          THE MISSION 
          Corrine Aquino & Andrew Coles        
           EXT. BISMARK, TEXAS - DAY (1934)

           We float HIGH ABOVE a large Texan farm town. The perfect 
           grid of its streets is bisected by a glittering river.

           In the very recent past, this place was a shining example of 
           pastoral America. Now, the farms that support the town are 
           dying - the fields around it are dust-choked and gray.

           We NOTICE a tiny FIGURE moving through a cornfield on the 
           outskirts -

           EXT. CORNFIELD - THAT MOMENT

           ALLISON WELLS (24), limping from a bullet wound in her thigh 
           as she pushes past the dry and disintegrating cornstalks.

           We will come to know Allison better, but for now it is 
           enough to say that she is the personification of a truly-
           American strain of wildness and passion - the Way of the Gun 
           meets the Way of the Lover. Her light brown dress is covered 
           in blood, only some of it hers.

           Our NARRATOR is an old man, the years stretching behind him 
           like ghosts:

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Allison Wells came to Bismark, 
                        Texas on August 20th, 1934, after a 
                        murder spree across five state 
                        lines.

           FLASHBACK: EXT. DIRT ROAD - DAY

           AN HOUR PRIOR - a PACKARD DELUXE tears down a farm road, 
           pursued by two TEXAS STATE POLICE CARS.

           FLASHBACK: INT. PACKARD DELUXE - THAT MOMENT

           Allison drives while PERRY MONTROY (25), the wayward son of 
           a wealthy family, leans out of the Packard's window and 
           empties his pistol in the direction of the cops.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        She entered Texas in a stolen 
                        Packard Deluxe with her lover, a 
                        young man by the name of Perry 
                        Montroy, heir apparent of Montroy

                        esteemed slaughterhouse dynasty.

           FLASHBACK: INT. CITIZEN'S FIRST - MORNING

           SOME HOURS PRIOR - A small-town bank.

           In SLOW MOTION, Perry shoots a BANK TELLER in the chest as 
           Allison stuffs money into a canvas bag. A shimmering haze of 
           red fills the air - a mist of blood.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Perry had killed the guard and two 
                        tellers during his and Allison's 
                        robbery of Citizen's First in 
                        Guthrie, Oklahoma that morning, 
                        their third heist in four days.

           MONTAGE

           -- CORONER'S PHOTOGRAPH of Perry Montroy's head on a morgue 
           slab. There is a small bullet hole above his open left eye. 
           His face is slack and rubbery in death.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Not long after crossing the state 
                        line, Perry was shot dead by the 
                        Texas police.

           -- IN THE PACKARD - Allison speeding, desperate. She glances 
           frantically at Perry, who has just been shot in the head. 
           Blood dribbles down his face.

                                 ALLISON
                        No, no, no, Baby! Look at me!

           *CHUNK CH-CHUNK* - bullets pepper the car, shattering the 
           driver's-side window. Allison screams in pain and looks down 
           to see blood pooling out of a hole in the side of her thigh.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        And Allison was shot in the leg.

                        She lost control of the Packard and 
                        crashed it in a ditch on the 
                        outskirts of town.

                        With the police approaching, she 
                        kissed Perry's corpse goodbye, 
                        stepped out of the car and 
                        vanished.

           -- Allison limps through the cornfield: desperate, bleeding.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Later that day, she would enter 
                        into my life and stay there 
                        forever, even though I only knew 
                        her for all of a week.

           PUSHING IN on a weathered SPIRAL NOTEBOOK from the 1990s 
           lying on a modern-day kitchen table.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        The day I write this is the 60th 
                        anniversary of Allison's death. 
                        Folks have been asking me questions 
                        about her for most of my life, and 
                        for most of them I don't have the 
                        answers. For the rest, I hope that 
                        this account settles the matter... 
                        With that in mind, I'd like to 
                        start at the beginning.

                        My name is Eugene Evans. I was born 
                        on February 2nd, 1919 in Amarillo, 
                        Texas -

                        When I was five, we moved to 
                        Bismark, a farm town in Childress 
                        County, on the east Panhandle.

                        My father, a journalist and 
                        alcoholic, had managed to get 
                        himself a job as the editor of the 
                        town gazette.

           FLASHBACK: INT. VARIOUS - FARMHOUSE - DAY (1924)

           Eugene, age five, wanders through the empty living room of 
           an old, but well-maintained farmhouse.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Even though he had no interest in 
                        agriculture, my father insisted 
                        that we move onto the property of a 
                        former corn farm on Bismark's 
                        outskirts.

           Eugene enters the dining room and looks out the window at 
           the unused and semi-dilapidated BARN about 150 yards back 
           from the house, across a weed-ridden field.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        He said he found something tranquil 
                        in the peace and quiet, and I can't 
                        say I found otherwise.

           Eugene enters the kitchen to discover his mother and father 
           leaning against the counter and kissing.

           Caught, John looks sheepish, but Olivia laughs and covers up 
           a smile. She is happy: they are a family at home at last.
           FLASHBACK: EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT (1925)

           WIDE of the farmhouse, lights shining. From within, we hear 
           a crash followed by Olivia's cry of pain, then the slam of a 
           screen door.

           John moves off quickly into the darkness and drops an empty 
           bottle of whiskey on the ground.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        When I was six, my father left us 
                        after drunkenly beating my mother 
                        senseless.

           Once John is out of sight, we hear sobs from the house.

           FLASHBACK: INT. KITCHEN - FARMHOUSE - DAY (1925)

           Eugene, age six, sits at the kitchen table, studying a 
           message on a postcard depicting a Mexican beach town.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        A few months later, he sent me a 
                        rambling postcard informing me that 
                        he was on the Gulf Coast of Mexico 
                        and that he hoped to find God 
                        there.

           FLASHBACK: INT. BARN - DAY (1926)

           Eugene, age seven, is sitting against one of the heavy 
           wooden beams holding up the barn's roof, carefully writing a 
           letter. A tattered dictionary serves as his writing surface.

           Sunlight slants in through gaps in the boards, illuminating 
           a maze of rusted old farm equipment. This barn is Eugene's 
           sanctuary - where he comes to find solitude.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        I would write him back many times 
                        over the next few years without 
                        receiving a reply, which my mother 
                        attributed to him being absorbed in 
                        his work on a book about the 
                        Mexican people.

           CLOSE ON fragments of what Eugene is writing - "How does the 
           ocean look like?" - "Does Mexico smell different?"

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        I stopped writing in 1930, around 
                        the time I turned eleven.
           FLASHBACK: EXT. EVANS FAMILY FARMHOUSE - DAY (1926)

           A PHOTOGRAPHER issues directions to a WEDDING PARTY. Olivia, 
           now 28, is beautiful in her simple Midwestern bride's dress. 
           The groom is GEORGE EVANS (35) - a tall drink of water. He 
           looks awkward in his suit, but happy.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Six months after my father left, 
                        Olivia remarried to a Childress 
                        county deputy by the name of George 
                        Evans, a thoughtful and generally 
                        decent man. We took George's last 
                        name and he moved with us into the 
                        house...

           Olivia leans down and kisses Eugene. Another photograph is 
           snapped.

                        Saving it, in the process, from the 
                        impending foreclosure brought on by 
                        my father's drinking habit.

           INT. BARN - DAY (PRESENT - 1934)

           EUGENE EVANS, age 15, is sitting against the barn's wall, 
           absorbed in a Black Mask pulp magazine - a periodical of 
           proto-noir stories written for teenage boys.

           This will be "our" Eugene for the majority of the film. He 
           is in the throes of adolescence - an arrow with no target, a 
           bomb without a fuse.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Eight months later, my half-sister 
                        Phoebe Evans was born.

           PHOEBE EVANS jumps out from behind a beam, "woo-woo-woo"ing 
           like an Indian war chief on a radio serial.

           Phoebe is nine-years-old and somewhere between a typical 
           Texan girl of the 1930s and a card-carrying tomboy. Her 
           dress is dirty from a day of playing outside.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        And I had the good fortune to grow 
                        up with her.

           Startled into laughter, Eugene throws the magazine at Phoebe 
           and chases her out of the barn.
           WE PUSH IN on the cover of Black Mask where it fell: a lurid 
           illustration of a buxom blonde menaced by shadowy men in 
           fedoras - "The Communist's Daughter".

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Other than seedy tales of 
                        criminals, dames and gunfights, -

           EXT. RIVERSIDE - DAY

           Eugene and BEN FLETCHER - a 15-year-old shrimp and Eugene's 
           best friend - jog down to the Wichita river in swim trunks 
           and shirts. BISMARK'S YOUTH frolic in the water.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        - my fifteen-year-old self had only 
                        one major preoccupation...

           EXT. WICHITA RIVER - LATER

           Eugene and Ben bob on the surface of the slow river. Eugene 
           has his eyes on LAURA BOYD, a seventeen-year-old knockout. 
           She is one in a group of gossiping TEENAGE GIRLS.

                                 EUGENE
                        I'm gonna ask her.

                                 BEN
                        Okay.

                                 EUGENE
                        I'm gonna do it.

                                 BEN
                        Well, do it then, Evans.

                                                       MOMENTS LATER:

           Eugene treads water in front of Laura, having just asked her 
           on a date. His expression is chagrined, however, due to the 
           fact that she's laughing at him.

                                 LAURA
                        Eugene Evans... Why, you're 
                        fifteen.

                                 EUGENE
                        And so what?

           Laura gazes at him with blue eyes full of pity.
                                 LAURA
                        I don't pluck fruit 'til it's ripe.

                        After the War, I’d visit Bismark to 
                        find that she'd married Jack Lomax, 
                        then become a widow when Jack was 
                        shot down over Hamburg in '43.

                        She was left with two children, her 
                        fading looks and a war gratuity.

                        By that time, I had a wife and kids 
                        of my own, but even now, on the 
                        other side of the century, -

           EXT. WICHITA RIVER - DAY

           BACK TO FREEZE FRAME of Laura at the river in 1934.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        - I still catch myself wishing I'd 
                        given Laura a ring and made her an 
                        honest woman for the second time.

           FREEZE FRAME ends - Laura smiles sadly at Eugene.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        What a beauty she was.

                                 LAURA
                        You're a doll for asking, though.

           She swims off to join her giggling friends. Eugene looks to 
           Ben, who shrugs nonchalantly - like a best friend should.
                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Anyway... The days flowed by.

           Eugene continues to look in Ben's direction - at something 
           behind him. Ben turns around to see the roiling head of a 
           DUST STORM in the distance.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        And then the dust came.

           EXT. CORNFIELD - DAY

           BILLOWING DUST rips through the cornstalks.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        It was the Industrial Revolution 
                        revolving all the way back to zero.

           EXT. MAIN STREET - BISMARK - DAY

           A dust storm rages... A MAN wearing goggles and holding a 
           rag to his face slowly crosses Main Street.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        The farms failed. And so did the 
                        town.

           INT. KITCHEN - FARMHOUSE - DAY

           The storm is over. Eugene and Phoebe enter the kitchen to 
           find every surface layered in dust, like the house has been 
           abandoned for decades.

           A floorboard creaks - behind them, Olivia is standing in the 
           doorway, crying. She is 37 now.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        We'd been dreaming a dream 
                        together. And we had all woken up.

           INT. DINER - DAY

           A diner next to a two-lane highway on the outskirts of 
           Bismark.

           We PAN from the diner's window (through which we see OKIE 
           CHILDREN playing around an overloaded jalopy) to Olivia, 
           working as a waitress behind the counter. The COOK flips 
           burgers in sizzling yellow grease.
                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        George's wages were cut in half and 
                        so my mother took a job as a 
                        waitress.

           A TRUCK DRIVER enters, beating the dust from his cap.

                            (
                                 OLIVIA
                             weary smile
                                       )
                        Pull up a seat. You come a long 
                        way?

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY

           A BLACK CAR timidly rolls up the dirt drive and parks at the 
           farmhouse. A well-dressed BANK MAN steps out, clutching 
           papers. He goes to the front door and knocks.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        That still didn't make the 
                        mortgage, and so the bank delivered 
                        a warning.

           George - 44 now - opens the door. He immediately understands 
           why the bank man is there and his expression grows dark.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Pay us or bust.

           INT. DINING ROOM - FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

           Eugene and his family sit around the dinner table. All are 
           silent, eyeing George, their patriarch, as he mulls over 
           something Eugene has just told him. Finally:

                                 GEORGE
                        I wanna hear you say - "Sir, I got 
                        that job you been asking me to get. 
                        Now you don't got to ask no more."

                                 EUGENE
                        Well, I can't.

                                 GEORGE
                        And why not?

                                 EUGENE
                        I went to Hal Ratliff and he said 
                        they're full up. What do you want 
                        me to do? He said he'll be in 
                        touch...
           George shakes his head and addresses the whole table:

                                 GEORGE
                        Somebody mind telling me why a man 
                        can't keep his goddamn promises 
                        anymore?
                            (
                             to Olivia
                                     )
                        A day ago, Hal said he had a job 
                        for the kid.

                                 OLIVIA
                        It's a tough time for promises.

                                 GEORGE
                            (
                             to Eugene
                                     )
                        If someone says they got nothing, 
                        you go to the fella next door, all 
                        right? And if he says split, you go 
                        to the guy after that...

           Eugene nods, chewing.

                                 GEORGE
                        You heard me?

                                 EUGENE
                        Yessir.

           As George says the following, Phoebe begins to pantomime him 
           for Eugene's amusement across the table -

                                 GEORGE
                        You ain't gonna spend the rest of 
                        the summer reading pulps in the 
                        barn... Soon enough there won't be 
                        a barn.

           And Eugene can't help laughing. George glares at him, then 
           follows his gaze to Phoebe and realizes what's happening. A 
           tense beat as the table waits for his reaction, but instead 
           of blowing up, George chuckles and digs into his dinner. 
           Eugene makes a face at his sister and she grins back at him.

           INT. FIRST BAPTIST CHURCH - DAY

           A BAPTIST PREACHER delivers his sermon to a packed house. 
           Eugene and his family are here in their Sunday best. Phoebe 
           fidgets and Eugene looks bored out of his mind.

                                 PREACHER
                        Neighbors, it is a sin to presume 
                        that tomorrow will be a better day.
                                 (MORE)
                            (
                             weighty pause
                                 PREACHER (CONT'D)
                                         )
                        That's right, it is a sin. For we 
                        are Lambs of His flock, and though 
                        he leads us along a path of 
                        obscurity, we may not question it, 
                        however mysterious - uh, however 
                        mysterious it may appear -

           The preacher falters as numerous POLICE SIRENS rise in the 
           distance. The CONGREGATION perks up and begins to chatter. 
           The sirens rush past outside and then diminish.

                                 GEORGE
                            (
                             to Olivia
                                     )
                        I'd better see about this.

           George stands and moves along the pew, then exits the church 
           along with a few others.

                                 PREACHER
                            (
                                            )
                             waving for order
                        Calm down, now. Calm down. 
                        Whatever's the matter, it's being 
                        dealt with by the authorities.

           EXT. FIRST BAPTIST CHURCH - DAY

           The service lets out. Eugene, eagerly removing his tie, 
           pushes through the crowd to reach Ben Fletcher.

                                 EUGENE
                        Jesus Christ, what a yawn.

                                 BEN
                        Sure was...

                                 EUGENE
                        Hell do you think them sirens was 
                        about?

           Ben shrugs. He seems preoccupied and distant. Eugene 
           examines him, which Ben senses and becomes annoyed by -

                                 BEN
                        What?

                                 EUGENE
                        What's eating you?

           Ben is about to respond when:

                                 OLIVIA (O.C.)
                        Eugene...!
           Olivia is waving to her son from a circle of WOMEN - old and 
           young, Midwestern faces etched with worry. Eugene goes over.

                                 OLIVIA
                        I want you at home today.

                                 EUGENE
                        Why?

                                 OLIVIA
                        It could be something happened. We 
                        don't know...

           Phoebe takes Eugene's tie and starts trying to tie it around 
           her neck as if she were wearing a man's collared shirt.

                                 EUGENE
                        Well, I ain't going home right now.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Excuse me?

                                 EUGENE
                        Me and Ben Fletcher are going to 
                        Main... Gonna look for jobs.

           Olivia regards her son with weary love - she knows that he's 
           lying about his plans.

                                 EUGENE
                        There ain't nothing to worry about, 
                        Mama. Something happens, Ben'll be 
                        there.

           She considers, frowning. Then -

                                 OLIVIA
                        Home by dark. And stick together.

                                 EUGENE
                        Yes, ma'am.

           Phoebe butts in eagerly -

                                 PHOEBE
                        Can I come?

                                 OLIVIA
                        No you can not.

           Eugene heads back to Ben. Olivia calls after him:

                                 OLIVIA
                        By dark...!
                                 EUGENE
                            (
                             to Ben
                                  )
                        You heard the lady. Let's go.

           Olivia turns back to the other women, shaking her head.

                                 FARMER'S WIFE
                        Boys will be boys.

           Eugene and Ben head off. Phoebe watches sadly after her 
           older brother.

                                 FARMER'S WIFE (O.C.)
                        I'm sure George has a handle on 
                        things.

           INT. MAIN STREET GROCER'S - DAY

           Eugene stands at a rack of PULPS, (Weird Tales, Crime, Black 
           Mask, Detective) keeping a surreptitious eye on the skinny 
           old GROCER, who is taking notes in a ledger.

           In a nearby aisle, Ben Fletcher is carefully inspecting two 
           cereal boxes - Spencer's All-Wheat and Raisin Bran.

           When the grocer turns to place some cans on the shelf behind 
           the counter, Eugene slides a copy of Detective into his 
           shirt and quickly exits the store. Ben follows.

           EXT. MAIN STREET - MOMENTS LATER

           The two of them amble down the sidewalk, kicking up puffs of 
           dust. Eugene is gazing at the cover of Detective, which 
           depicts a hard-boiled gumshoe on a rainy city street.

                                 EUGENE
                        You think there's really fellas 
                        like that?

           Ben glances at the cover but says nothing.

                                 EUGENE
                        You know, if he were real, I bet 
                        this fella'd have a different broad 
                        every night... I bet he knows 
                        exactly the right thing to say to a 
                        girl to make her crazy.

           Eugene realizes Ben isn't paying attention. He whacks him 
           lightly with the magazine.
                                 EUGENE
                        What's the matter, Fletcher? You've 
                        been a toad since church.

                                 BEN
                        It's nothing.

                                 EUGENE
                        Three times you're gonna make me 
                        ask...

           Ben weighs his words. Finally -

                                 BEN
                        We're going to California, they 
                        told me this morning... We're 
                        giving up the house.

           Eugene can't mask his surprise.

                                 EUGENE
                        For how long?

                                 BEN
                        Forever, I guess.

           FLASHBACK: EXT. USED AUTO LOT - DAY

           Ben and his FAMILY are at a sad used auto lot, dusty 
           pennants fluttering in the wind... Ben's FATHER is skinny 
           and bookish with heavy, round glasses, while Ben's MOTHER is 
           obese due to a health issue, hobbling around on a cane.

           Ben's OLDER BROTHER - a lady-slayer with pomaded hair - is 
           the mechanically-minded one of the family and so he's 
           looking over the guts of a HUDSON TRUCK while an impatient 
           SALESMAN taps his feet nearby.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Ben's father had lost his job as an 
                        accountant and, unable to find 
                        work, the Fletchers had spent the 
                        majority of their savings on a 
                        truck to leave Bismark with.

           EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY (PRESENT)

           Eugene has been struck by this news.

                                 BEN
                        Looks like you'll have to find 
                        someone else to boss around.
                                 EUGENE
                        Ain't no one I'd rather boss around 
                        than you, Fletch.

           Suddenly, Eugene grabs Ben, trying to get him in a headlock. 
           The two of them wrestle around playfully for a moment -

                                 BEN
                        Let go, you elephant! Leggo!

           - but they quickly lose steam, disengaging and continuing 
           their ramble down Main Street. Their faces betray the 
           sobering reality of Ben's move, already setting in.

           EXT. BISMARK TOWN SQUARE - MOMENTS LATER

           Further down Main, the two of them find SHERIFF ROSS - a 
           good-ole-boy sonofagun - addressing a gathered crowd of 
           Bismark CITIZENS at the town square.

           DEPUTIES move among them, displaying prints of Allison 
           Wells's MUGSHOT PHOTO.

                                 SHERIFF ROSS
                        We'd like to head off any notion - 
                        any inkling of panic.

                                 UPSET WOMAN
                        But she's a killer...!

           A murmur of assenting voices.

                                 SHERIFF ROSS
                        Now, now... Yes, she is. But she's 
                        also just one little lady with half 
                        of Texas law enforcement trying to 
                        find her. And find her we will.

           A deputy shows the mugshot to Eugene - in it, Allison stares 
           defiantly at the camera with an intense gaze and the hint of 
           a smile. Eugene is enthralled. He mutters to Ben -

                                 EUGENE
                        Christ, look at her...

                                                       MOMENTS LATER:

           The announcement finished, the crowd disperses from the 
           square. With Ben in tow, Eugene approaches the sheriff, 
           interrupting him as he confers with a deputy.
                                 EUGENE
                        Sheriff, we was wondering if there 
                        was any sort of reward for finding 
                        her...

                                 SHERIFF ROSS
                        Damn near every municipality west 
                        of K.C. has a stake in putting that 
                        bitch underground, son. So yes: 
                        there is a reward.

           And that's all the sheriff will give them - he turns his 
           attention back to the deputy.

                                 EUGENE
                        How much, sir?

           Annoyed, the sheriff turns back. He examines them -

                                 SHERIFF ROSS
                        Boys, I think you'd better leave 
                        the finding up to us.

                                 EUGENE
                        She's just one little lady - that's 
                        what you said.

                                 SHERIFF ROSS
                            (
                             chuckles, then:
                                           )
                        You're Deputy Evans' boy, ain't 
                        you?

                                 EUGENE
                        Yessir. He's my stepfather.

                                 SHERIFF ROSS
                        Well, I appreciate the interest, 
                        son, but we already got all the 
                        help we need from the Evans family, 
                        so just run on home.

           Eugene doesn't move.

                                 EUGENE
                        How much, Sheriff?

                                 BEN
                             under his breath
                                            )
                            (
                        Eugene...

           Flinty look from the sheriff now -

                                 SHERIFF ROSS
                        Ten-thousand dollars.
           Ben and Eugene exchange impressed glances.

                                 SHERIFF ROSS
                        But believe me when I tell you, 
                        she's a lot of woman to handle.
                            (
                             smiles meanly
                                         )
                        Best to leave her to the men.

           MONTAGE

           -- A HOBO JUNGLE under a river bridge. Ben and Eugene talk 
           to a TRAMP sitting at a firepit.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Ben and I looked all day.

           -- An alley behind various FORECLOSED BUSINESSES. Eugene 
           peers through a broken window while Ben keeps watch.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        We felt there was quite a bit we 
                        could do with five-thousand dollars 
                        apiece.

           -- From afar, the boys observe OFFICERS and DEPUTIES as they 
           fan out, looking for clues in a dead CORNFIELD.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Ben and his folks could stay in 
                        Bismark.

           -- A blood-red sunset over fallow, dry FARMLAND - Ben and 
           Eugene are silhouettes against it.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        And I could save my family's house.

           EXT. ROAD - DUSK

           The boys approach the driveway of the FLETCHER RESIDENCE - a 
           cottage close to the center of town. The Hudson truck from 
           the used car lot is parked out front.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Needless to say, we returned empty-
                        handed.

           Ben splits off and Eugene continues down the road.

                                 BEN
                        'Night, Evans.
                                 EUGENE
                        See ya.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

           Eugene ambles up the drive to his family's farmhouse. The 
           lights are warm and inviting.

           INT. KITCHEN - FARMHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           The screen door clatters as he enters. Olivia, preparing 
           dinner, (and still wearing her waitress's outfit from work 
           that afternoon) glances at him, then back to the food.

                                 OLIVIA
                        I said before dark.

           Eugene is about to answer when, from the other room:

                                 GEORGE (O.C.)
                        Is that him? Tell the kid I wanna 
                        talk to him.

           Eugene doesn't move. Olivia shoots him a look and he exits 
           the kitchen.

           INT. SITTING ROOM - FARMHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           He enters to find George in his easy chair, drinking whiskey 
           and smoking a cigarette. The man is still wearing his 
           deputies' uniform, tie undone. He indicates a chair.

                                 GEORGE
                        Rest your dogs.

           Eugene sits. George regards him neutrally, then:

                                 GEORGE
                        This family is in a mess and a half 
                        right now. You're aware of that.

                                 EUGENE
                        Yessir.

                                 GEORGE
                        Now, if a boy's mother says to do 
                        something, that boy does it. 
                        Always. That's basic respect. And 
                        in the situation that we're in now, 
                        the family and the town, that goes 
                        double.
           Phoebe is watching from the kitchen. Olivia shoos her away.

                                 GEORGE
                        We understand each other?

                                 EUGENE
                        Yeah... Yessir.

           George eyes him through the smoke. The moment elongates.

                                 EUGENE
                        Can I go, sir?

                                 GEORGE
                        What do you got in your shirt?

                                 EUGENE
                            (
                             a beat, then:
                                         )
                        Ain't nothing in my shirt.

                                 GEORGE
                        Do us both a favor and don't make 
                        like you think I'm stupid.

           Eugene hesitates, then slides out the stolen Detective. He 
           hands it over to George, who looks at it with sour distaste.

                                 GEORGE
                        With what money from what job did 
                        you pay for this garbage with?

           Eugene has no answer. George leans in -

                                 GEORGE
                        Your mother may let you off easy, 
                        but I won't... You contribute to 
                        this family or there will be hell 
                        to pay.

           ESTABLISHING. WIDE OF THE FARMHOUSE AND BARN - NIGHT

           A full moon shines.

           INT. EUGENE'S BEDROOM - FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

           Eugene sits against the door of his bedroom, sulking. He's 
           been grounded and is missing dinner -
           INT. DINING ROOM - FARMHOUSE - THAT MOMENT

           Downstairs, his family eats in silence. Phoebe glances 
           between her exhausted and worried parents.

           INT. EUGENE'S BEDROOM - FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

           Eugene is hunched over his desk, reading the weathered 
           Mexican postcard that John Baker sent him nine years ago. 
           His expression is yearning and lonesome.

           Suddenly, the door opens. It's George. With a jolt, Eugene 
           hides the postcard under his arm.

                                 GEORGE
                        Lights out.

           George hits the switch and the room goes dark. He shuts the 
           door and plods away down the hall.

                                                              LATER:

           With a *click*, a beam of light materializes in the 
           darkness - Eugene is holding a dented Rayovac flashlight.

           He switches it off, then appears in moonlit silhouette at 
           the window. He slides it open and steps out onto the roof.

           EXT. EVANS FAMILY PROPERTY - NIGHT

           Eugene treads through the field toward the barn. He gets to 
           the half-open barn doors and switches the Rayovac on.

           INT. BARN - MOMENTS LATER

           Eugene approaches a rusted old TILLER. We see that he's 
           turned the vehicle's running board into a bookshelf where he 
           keeps a decent-sized collection of pulp magazines.

           He stops short when he notices that a few of the pulps are 
           scattered on the barn's dirt floor and streaked with blood.

                                 ALLISON (O.C.)
                        Those must be yours.

           Eugene turns - Allison Wells is sitting against the deflated 
           wheel of a tractor. She's very pale and her dark hair is 
           matted to her forehead.
           She's pressing a page from Black Mask to the gunshot wound 
           on her left thigh in an attempt to stanch the bleeding. Her 
           black stockings are ripped and in disarray.

           Other torn-out and blood-soaked pages litter the ground 
           around her. With her free hand she shades her eyes from the 
           flashlight.

           Eugene starts to back away.

                                 ALLISON
                        Wait.

           Eugene stops.

                                 ALLISON
                        You hide them in here, right? From 
                        your mother and father?

                                 EUGENE
                        Yeah.

                                 ALLISON
                        What's your name, Handsome?

                                 EUGENE
                        Eugene.

                                 ALLISON
                        Eugene, I need your help.

           A beat, as he watches her, his mind reeling.

           INT. PANTRY - FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

           Eugene paws through a pantry cupboard, taking out medical 
           supplies.

           EXT. EVANS FAMILY PROPERTY - NIGHT

           He crosses the field, his arms full. When he reaches the 
           barn doors, he stops, unsure. He looks back to the 
           farmhouse, in silhouette against the night sky.

           After a moment, he makes up his mind and enters the barn.

           INT. BARN - NIGHT

           Eugene drops the medical supplies next to Allison - a bottle 
           of rubbing alcohol, gauze, tweezers, safety pins.
                                 ALLISON
                        Good. That's good.

           Eugene sets the Rayovac on the tiller's fender, casting a 
           stark light. He crouches in front of her.

                                 EUGENE
                        I know who you are.

                                 ALLISON
                        You know what they said about me, 
                        Eugene, but you don't know who I 
                        am.

           Eugene moves a little closer, as if he doesn't want to be 
           overheard. He appears both frightened and electrified:

                                 EUGENE
                        Are you really a killer?

                                 ALLISON
                        Do I look like one?

                                 EUGENE
                            (
                             a beat, then:
                                         )
                        No.

                                 ALLISON
                        Well, your eyes work at least. That 
                        bodes well.

                                 EUGENE
                        Why are they saying that, though?

                                 ALLISON
                        I'm running out of time here, 
                        Eugene. You help me, I'll tell you 
                        everything you want to know.

           Allison holds his gaze until Eugene nods, complying. Then, 
           she gingerly removes the paper from her leg, revealing a 
           small bullet hole surrounded by sticky, coagulated blood.

                             cringing
                                 EUGENE
                                    )
                            (
                        Jesus...

                                 ALLISON
                        It looks worse than it is. You have 
                        steady hands, Eugene?

                                 EUGENE
                        I think you need a doctor or 
                        something.
                                 ALLISON
                        You're my doctor, okay? You are.
                             off the rubbing alcohol
                            (
                                                   )
                        Clean your hands.

           Eugene unscrews the cap and carefully pours the alcohol into 
           his palm. Allison can sense his unease -

                                 ALLISON
                        Everything's gonna be fine.

           He nods minutely, rubbing his hands.

                            (
                                 ALLISON
                             the tweezers
                                        )
                        Now, clean this.

           Eugene pours the alcohol over the tweezers. He can't avoid 
           asking the question:

                                 EUGENE
                        You really didn't kill nobody?

                                 ALLISON
                        Look at me, Eugene. Look at me.
                            (
                             he looks at her
                                           )
                        I promise... I promise, everything 
                        will make sense. But right now, I 
                        need you to save my life.
                             off the alcohol
                            (
                                           )
                        Pour the rest of that stuff on my 
                        leg.

                                 EUGENE
                        You sure?

                            (
                                 ALLISON
                             shaking her head
                                            )
                        Just do it.

           He pours the rest of the alcohol on the wound. Allison bites 
           down on her hand, trying not to scream. 

           And then it's done - the bottle drips, empty. Allison is 
           panting, her face shining with sweat.

                                 ALLISON
                        Oh, God... Oh, God, that smarts...
                            (
                             beat
                                 )
                        You see the bullet?

           Eugene peers into the wound. A black shape glints dully, 
           barely discernible.
                                 EUGENE
                        I, uh - I think so.

                                 ALLISON
                        Take it out.

           He looks up at her. She nods. He positions the tweezers, his 
           trembling hands touching the unexplored territory of her 
           naked thigh. He takes a moment to collect himself, then -

           CLOSE ON the tweezers as they move toward the open wound.

           CLOSE ON Allison watching, panic mounting.

           CLOSE ON the tweezers, moving into the wound.

           INT. GEORGE AND OLIVIA'S BEDROOM - FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

           Olivia wakes with a start in the brass bed she shares with 
           George.

                                 OLIVIA
                        What was that?

           She listens. Hears nothing other than Panhandle crickets.

                            (
                                 OLIVIA
                             shaking him awake
                                             )
                        George - Honey.

                                 GEORGE
                        Wh - Hmph - What?

                                 OLIVIA
                        I - Maybe I heard something.

                                 GEORGE
                        What?

                                 OLIVIA
                        I don't know.

                                 GEORGE
                        'S another nightmare.

           George tugs her back down and wraps his arms around her.

                                 GEORGE
                        Go back to sleep.

           He starts dozing immediately. Olivia lies there, wide-awake.
           INT. BARN - NIGHT

           The bullet - a tiny slug of crushed metal dappled with 
           blood - sits on a page torn out of Black Mask.

           There's blood everywhere... Allison's legs, the floor, 
           Eugene's clothes. He's wrapping her thigh in gauze. Both of 
           them are exhausted and woozy from adrenaline.

                                 ALLISON
                        Make it tighter... It's all right.
                            (
                             Eugene adjusts the bandage
                                                      )
                        Yeah, like that.

           He finishes, safety-pinning the gauze... Allison brushes the 
           hair away from her face, streaking her cheek with blood.

                                 ALLISON
                        You did great, Handsome. You did 
                        good...
                            (
                             a deep, weary sigh, then:
                                                     )
                        You as thirsty as I am?

           EXT. BARN - NIGHT

           Eugene levers a water pump outside the barn. He washes the 
           blood off his hands, then begins filling a tin pail.

           INT. BARN - NIGHT

           Allison holds the pail to her face and gulps the water 
           desperately. Gasping, she sets the pail down.

                                 ALLISON
                        Good Lord... Good Lord, what a day.

           She goes distant for a moment, recalling something... But 
           she wills herself back into focus - she has an audience.

                                 ALLISON
                        How old are you, Handsome?

                                 EUGENE
                        Fifteen.

                                 ALLISON
                        Is that a fact? You look older.
                            (
                             smiles
                                  )
                        You got a girlfriend?

                                 EUGENE
                        No.
                                 ALLISON
                        Are you shy?

                                 EUGENE
                        Maybe... Not always.

                                 ALLISON
                        Girls like it when you aren't, but 
                        I'm sure you know that.
                            (
                             pats the ground
                                           )
                        Sit. I ought to explain things.

           Eugene remains standing. The reality (or surreality) of the 
           situation is starting to dawn on him.

                                 ALLISON
                        What did I just say about being 
                        shy?

                                 EUGENE
                        Miss, in all honesty, I ain't sure 
                        what's going on.

                                 ALLISON
                        Call me Allison... And sit down, 
                        I'm harmless.

                                 EUGENE
                        You sure about that?

                                 ALLISON
                            (
                             laughs, then:
                                         )
                        Eugene, right now, if you wanted 
                        you could break me in two.

           He sits. Nevertheless, he is guarded and uncomfortable.

                                 ALLISON
                        Do you think I did those things?

                                 EUGENE
                        I don't know...

                                 ALLISON
                        Well, I didn't.

                                 EUGENE
                        Then why are they saying something 
                        different?

                                 ALLISON
                        Because my father is a powerful 
                        man.
           MONTAGE

           -- A HANDSOME MIDDLE-AGED MAN, presumably Allison's father, 
           stands at a lectern in a large hall, addressing a meeting of 
           AMERICAN COMMUNISTS. He falters when FBI AGENTS burst in and 
           begin arresting people. He runs off the stage.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        It was a conspiracy. Her father was 
                        the chairman of the Chicago chapter 
                        of American Communists, and he was 
                        wanted by the FBI for political 
                        subversion.

           -- Allison's father hastily packs a suitcase in the bedroom 
           of a nice apartment.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Miraculously, he had evaded their 
                        agents and fled to Mexico.

           -- Allison sits at the counter of a BAR, getting chatted up 
           by a YOUNG MAN. FBI AGENTS burst in and start looking for 
           someone among the patrons. Allison slips away.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Subsequently, however, the Feds 
                        came after her... Their reasoning 
                        was that if they had the daughter, 
                        they could get the man.

           -- Allison drives the Packard Deluxe through Illinois 
           farmland. Behind her, the skyline of Chicago rises like a 
           vast temple to capitalism.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        But the daughter slipped through 
                        their fingers... So they framed her 
                        for multiple counts of bank robbery 
                        and first degree murder.

           -- Numerous POLICE CARS pursue Allison in the Packard as it 
           tears down a farm road. The scene is the same as depicted at 
           the beginning of the film, except Perry is absent.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Their hope being that someone - 
                        some watchdog citizen or eagle-eyed 
                        deputy on a lonely road would spot 
                        Allison and bring her in...
           FREEZE FRAME as the Packard Deluxe is peppered with bullets, 
           shattering the driver's side window -

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        And their plan had nearly worked.

           INT. BARN - NIGHT

           Eugene sits there, listening to Allison intently. We can't 
           hear what she's saying, but we can tell that she's holding 
           his undivided attention.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        That was her story as she relayed 
                        it to me... There was no mention of 
                        Perry Montroy.

           FLASHBACK: INT. BARN - AFTERNOON

           EARLIER THAT DAY - Allison, her leg bleeding profusely, 
           stumbles up to the half-open doors of the barn and peers in.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        It was all a lie, of course. Her 
                        tale was ludicrous.

                                                         LATER, DUSK:

           Allison is holding a ripped-out page of Black Mask to her 
           leg while reading the rest of the pulp in the fading light.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Allison was a murderer. She was a 
                        bank robber.

           WE PUSH IN on the cover of Black Mask, which we saw near the 
           beginning of the film: "The Communist's Daughter".

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        And she played me like a piano.

           INT. BARN - NIGHT (PRESENT)

           Allison has finished her tale. Eugene is dumbstruck by what 
           she's told him -

                                 EUGENE
                        That's the worst thing I ever 
                        heard...
                                 ALLISON
                        Now you can see why I need you.

           A deep breath from Eugene. He shakes his head.

                                 EUGENE
                        Yeah, well... But what can I do?

                                 ALLISON
                        I'll give you twenty-thousand 
                        dollars to get me to Mexico.

           This is like a punch to the face... Eugene stares at her.

                                 EUGENE
                        That's double your bounty...

                                 ALLISON
                            (
                             smiles, then:
                                         )
                        That's right... Those bastards 
                        won't get me. And you know why?

                                 EUGENE
                        Why?

                                 ALLISON
                        Because I've got you... And you 
                        already saved me once.

           Eugene shakes his head, deeply unsure.

                                 EUGENE
                        Mexico's a long way from here...

                                 ALLISON
                        All you need to do is get me a car. 
                        I'll drive myself when I'm feeling 
                        a little better.

                                 EUGENE
                        I don't know how to get a car.

                                 ALLISON
                        I'll need a few days to rest up... 
                        If you put your mind to it between 
                        now and then, I'm sure you'll 
                        figure something out.

           Eugene says nothing, his face clouded with doubt. Allison 
           can see she's losing him.
                                 ALLISON
                        Twenty-thousand dollars... You 
                        could help your family out quite a 
                        bit with money like that... I know 
                        you're all in trouble.

           He regards her with newfound wariness.

                                 EUGENE
                        How'd you figure that?

                                 ALLISON
                        The banks are running over everyone 
                        they can in a town like this... It 
                        follows that they're running over 
                        you too.

           Eugene nods - his thoughts shifting to his family's plight.

                                 ALLISON
                        The little girl I saw playing 
                        outside earlier... She's your 
                        sister, isn't she?

                                 EUGENE
                        Yeah, that's Phoebe.

                                 ALLISON
                        You gonna let Phoebe become 
                        homeless?

                                 EUGENE
                        'Course I ain't! But it ain't that 
                        simple.

                                 ALLISON
                        It is that simple... It is... If 
                        you help me, my father will send a 
                        courier with the money once I reach 
                        Mexico... 
                                 )
                            (
                             beat
                        What could be simpler than that?

           Allison's big, dark eyes are pleading as Eugene mulls this 
           over. Finally, he nods -

                                 EUGENE
                        All right... Okay.

           She grins and embraces him.

                                 ALLISON
                        Eugene... Eugene, my hero...
           She lets go and regards him affectionately, then her gaze 
           takes in his bloodstained clothes -

                                 ALLISON
                        Now, first order of business is 
                        getting rid of these.

           INT. KITCHEN - FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

           Eugene enters the kitchen, carefully shutting the screen 
           door behind him. He's wearing nothing but his underwear.

           He stands there listening for a moment, then moves further 
           into the house.

           INT. HALLWAY - FARMHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           He carefully opens the door to his room.

           A creak from down the hall - Olivia is peering out from her 
           and George's bedroom.

                                 OLIVIA
                        What are you doing up at this hour? 
                        And where are your bedclothes...?

                                 EUGENE
                        I had to use the john.

                                 OLIVIA
                        The one downstairs?

                                 EUGENE
                             a beat, then:
                                         )
                            (
                        Yeah.

                            (
                                 OLIVIA
                             suspicious, but:
                                            )
                        Get back to bed.

           INT. EUGENE'S BEDROOM - FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

           Eugene slips under the covers and stares up at the ceiling, 
           wide-awake. Finally, he mutters quietly to himself -

                                 EUGENE
                        Good Lord almighty...
           INT. KITCHEN - FARMHOUSE - SUNRISE

           George stands at the sink, staring absently out the window 
           while drinking his first coffee of the day. The sun rises 
           above the barn, prominently visible across the field.

           INT. EUGENE'S BEDROOM - FARMHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           George enters to find Eugene asleep. He shakes him awake.

                                 GEORGE
                        Hey, hey - snap to it. You're 
                        looking for work today and you're 
                        taking your sister.

                                 EUGENE
                            (
                             groggy
                                  )
                        Yessir.

                                                              LATER:

           Eugene watches from his bedroom window as George and Olivia 
           leave the house for their respective jobs.

           INT. GEORGE AND OLIVIA'S BEDROOM - FARMHOUSE - MORNING

           Eugene paws through his mother's closet and takes out a pale 
           blue dress patterned with birds. He holds it up to the light.

           INT. BARN - MORNING

           Allison sits leaning against the tractor. She looks better 
           than the night before, less spectral. She holds Olivia's 
           dress, admiring it as Eugene stands by.

                                 ALLISON
                        It's perfect...

                                 EUGENE
                        She won't notice it's gone. She 
                        don't wear it much.

                                 ALLISON
                        Oh, she'll notice.

                                 EUGENE
                        Well, maybe it blew off the line, 
                        then...

                                 ALLISON
                        Maybe it did.
           Allison lowers the dress into her lap, taking care to keep 
           it off the ground. She looks at Eugene for a long, silent 
           moment. Finally, he realizes:

                                 EUGENE
                        Oh, sorry.

           EXT. BARN - MOMENTS LATER

           CLOSE ON an EYE - peering through a gap in the barn's wall.

           THE EYE'S POV - inside, Allison is slowly removing her 
           ripped stockings, minding her bandaged leg.

           Once the stockings are off, she starts unbuttoning her 
           bloodstained dress.

           THE EYE - goes wide.

                                 PHOEBE (O.C.)
                        What are you looking at?

           REVEAL - the eye belongs to Eugene. He turns, caught.

           Phoebe is standing there, watching him curiously.

                                 EUGENE
                        Nothing.

                                 PHOEBE
                        Mother said you've been acting 
                        strange...

                                 EUGENE
                        What do you want?

                                 PHOEBE
                        Who gets a job by puttering around 
                        like a hobo? You was supposed to 
                        take me to town.

           Eugene starts heading back to the farmhouse. Phoebe follows.

                                 EUGENE
                        I'm busy right now.

                                 PHOEBE
                        You ain't.

                                 EUGENE
                        I am.
                                 PHOEBE
                        What were you looking at?

                                 EUGENE
                        I was just seeing it how it looked.

                                 PHOEBE
                        I ain't dumb. What's in there?

                                 EUGENE
                        Ain't nothing in there. Christ.

           Phoebe is silent. Eugene can feel her eyes on his back. 
           Finally, he turns and grabs her, throwing her over his 
           shoulder. She giggles, hitting him with her fists. He 
           continues heading to the farmhouse.

                                 EUGENE
                        If I tell you, you gotta promise 
                        you won't go in there to see.

           She stops hitting him.

                                 PHOEBE
                        Okay.

           Eugene keeps walking, not saying anything.

                                 PHOEBE
                        What's in there?

                                 EUGENE
                        You promise?

                                 PHOEBE
                        Yeah! Tell me.

           Eugene sets her down, looks very seriously into her eyes -

                                 EUGENE
                        Two dead mutts with their guts out 
                        in the dirt. And flies everywhere.

           Phoebe looks at first confused and then disgusted.

                                 PHOEBE
                        What killed 'em?

                                 EUGENE
                        Coyotes or something. How should I 
                        know?

                                 PHOEBE
                        That's sad.
                            (
                                 EUGENE
                             walking off
                                       )
                        That's life.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Eugene goes straight to his bicycle, leaning against the 
           back of the farmhouse.

                                 PHOEBE
                        Well, where you going now?

                                 EUGENE
                        I gotta talk to Ben Fletcher.

                                 PHOEBE
                        What about? Can I come?

                                 EUGENE
                            (
                             getting on his bike
                                               )
                        Nothing and no.

           He pedals away.

           EXT. TRAIN TRACKS - DAY

           Ben and Eugene walk along an elevated train grade. The 
           plains are vast around them and the day is beautiful - 
           painterly cumulus clouds recede into the distance.

                                 BEN
                        You can't have it. We're going to 
                        California in it.

                                 EUGENE
                        I ain't "having" it. I'll pay you 
                        for it afterwards... You can buy a 
                        new one to go in.

           Ben considers this. Meanwhile, in the distance, a train is 
           coming toward them down the tracks.

                                 BEN
                        What do you want it for?

                                 EUGENE
                        I can't say, and you can't tell 
                        nobody about this, neither. We'll 
                        have to figure how to deal with 
                        your parents.
                                 BEN
                        Why can't you say?

                                 EUGENE
                        'Cause I can't...! I ain't trying 
                        to cheat you, Fletcher. You just 
                        gotta trust me.

                                 BEN
                        What the hell kind of explanation 
                        is that?

                                 EUGENE
                        It's all I can say about it right 
                        now.

           Ben ruminates on this for a moment. The train gets closer.

                                 BEN
                        I thought we was friends...

                                 EUGENE
                        We are!

                                 BEN
                        Well, where's this money gonna come 
                        from after you do whatever it is 
                        you do with the truck?

                                 EUGENE
                        I can't say nothing, Fletch.

                                 BEN
                        Then I ain't selling you my 
                        family's truck. Friend or no.

                                 EUGENE
                        Suit yourself, I guess.

           The train is upon them and the boys clear the tracks - 
           Eugene to one side, Ben to the other.

           They regard one another through the flashing gaps between 
           the cars - their mutual disappointment plain to see.

           INT. SITTING ROOM - FARMHOUSE - DAY

           Phoebe sits in George's armchair, alone in the silent house. 
           She's staring out the window as if in a spell.

                            (
                                 PHOEBE
                             under her breath
                                            )
                        Two dead dogs...
           INT. BARN - MOMENTS LATER

           Phoebe's silhouette is visible through the gaps in the 
           boards as she passes along the outside of the barn.

           She reaches the doors and peers into the dim interior -

           Nothing out of place... No dead dogs... No guts.

           She cautiously ventures in - this space nominally belongs to 
           her older brother and it has an "off-limits" aura.

           Something catches her eye - pulp magazines lie on the ground 
           amid the maze of old farm equipment in the back of the barn.

           Phoebe approaches to get a better look... 

           Bloody pages and discarded medical supplies litter that part 
           of the barn's floor like the remainders of some strange 
           ritual. Phoebe's eyes go wide in fright.

           EXT. BARN - MOMENTS LATER

           She runs out of the barn and trips, falling to her knees in 
           the dirt. She gets up and brushes herself off.

           Now that she's outside, her nerve has returned - she regards 
           the barn suspiciously, as if the building itself is an 
           interloper on family land... Glaring, she kicks a clod of 
           dirt, then turns and starts walking back to the farmhouse.

           MONTAGE

           -- DEPUTIES stand at a ROADBLOCK on a two-lane road. They 
           wave down an OKIE FAMILY heading West in a packed jalopy.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        I would spend a great deal of time 
                        with Allison over the next few days 
                        of that strange week.

           -- A scrum of REPORTERS surrounds sheriff Ross on the steps 
           of the Childress County Courthouse as he apprises them of 
           the search for Allison Wells.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        She told me all about her life as a 
                        young girl in Chicago - her 
                        communist father... Her beautiful, 
                        lonely mother...
           -- Phoebe sits alone at the kitchen table resting her chin 
           on her hands, bored. She watches through the window at the 
           barn in the distance.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        And I told her about my own father. 
                        How badly I missed him even though 
                        I could barely remember the man...

           -- Eugene and Allison talk in the barn. Blankets and pillows 
           taken from the farmhouse form a "bed" where Allison lies, 
           recovering.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        She reassured me that I would one 
                        day see him again.

           CLOSE ON Allison as Eugene speaks. At first she is listening 
           closely, but soon becomes distant and sad - some ghost 
           surfacing and reminding her of its presence.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        And in a way, she was right.

           ESTABLISHING. BISMARK, TEXAS - MORNING

           HIGH ABOVE Bismark and the surrounding fields.

           EXT. CORNFIELD - MORNING

           Alone, in uniform - George pushes through the dead 
           cornstalks. He keeps his eyes on the ground, searching.

           The stalks thin out as he gets closer to the fallow adjacent 
           field. Suddenly, he stops -

           A piece of fabric jitters in the wind, caught on one of the 
           stalks.

           George leans down to inspect it - a shred from a ladies' 
           black stocking. He unhooks it, then looks around.

           A couple miles distant, a BARN can be seen - the barn on the 
           Evans family property.

           George stares at it, then down at the fabric in his hand.

           EXT. CRASHED PACKARD - DAY

           He emerges from the cornfield into the crime scene which has 
           been established around the crashed Packard.
           An FBI AGENT - a disdainful city man - sips a cup of coffee 
           as OFFICERS supervise the diesel tow-truck which has come to 
           remove the Packard from the ditch.

           George approaches the agent and shows him the thread.

                                 GEORGE
                        Found this about a mile distant. 
                        Western edge of the field.

           The agent takes the thread from George and examines it 
           dispassionately. He sips his coffee. He hands the thread 
           back.

                                 FBI AGENT
                        It's nothing.

           George regards the agent with confusion.

                                 GEORGE
                        This is hers.

                                 FBI AGENT
                        So what if it is? She isn't in 
                        Bismark, Evans.

                                 GEORGE
                        Well, if she ain't, she's certainly 
                        nearby, with an injury like the one 
                        she's got.

           Bored, the agent checks the time on his watch.

                                 FBI AGENT
                        Deputy, one of the truisms of 
                        criminal behavior is that a 
                        desperate person is capable of 
                        extraordinary things... That woman 
                        ran her heart out north to the 
                        river and either drowned there or 
                        crossed it.

                                 GEORGE
                        Sir, with all due respect, you 
                        ought to have a search team go over 
                        the town. Top-to-bottom.

                                 FBI AGENT
                        We've already performed a search.

                                 GEORGE
                        You just went from door-to-door, 
                        asking. I'm talking about -
                                 FBI AGENT
                        If you feel that the citizens of 
                        your county aren't trustworthy, 
                        Evans, you should let me know.

           George's temper is sparked -

                                 GEORGE
                        Don't be a shitheel. That ain't 
                        what I'm saying.

           The agent stares at George, a man unfit to challenge him. 
           Nevertheless, George continues, though with a softer tone -

                                 GEORGE
                        That weren't really a search -  
                        that's all I'm trying to say. You 
                        ought to get more personnel out 
                        here so we can mount something 
                        methodical in the town itself.

                                 FBI AGENT
                        I know you're tired, Deputy, and I 
                        know you wanted your picture in the 
                        papers, but I suggest you go home 
                        and get some sleep before you make 
                        yourself look even more like a son 
                        of a bitch.

           The agent pours the rest of his coffee out on the ground.

                                 FBI AGENT
                        As for me, I'm going back to 
                        Dallas.

           INT. BARN - DAY

           Allison is alone, sobbing quietly. She hears the sound of 
           someone entering the barn and attempts to hide.

                                 EUGENE (O.C.)
                        It's me.

           Eugene comes around the tiller and sees her.

                                 EUGENE
                        What's wrong?

                                 ALLISON
                            (
                             wiping her eyes
                                           )
                        It's nothing. It's all right.
                                 EUGENE
                        No, it ain't.

           She looks up at him.

                                 ALLISON
                        It's nothing.

                                 EUGENE
                        Tell me.

                                                       MOMENTS LATER:

           CLOSE ON Allison, wiping her eyes. Eugene is sitting next to 
           her. A weight seems to have been lifted from her shoulders.

                                 EUGENE
                        Why didn't you mention him before?

                                 ALLISON
                            (
                             shrugs, then:
                                         )
                        I don't know...
                             beat
                            (
                                 )
                        Perry was a good man... And they 
                        just-- They killed him... Like 
                        that.
                            (
                                         )
                             snaps fingers
                        It's hard to talk about.

                                 EUGENE
                        Did you love him?

           Allison nods. Seeing something in Eugene's face, she smiles, 
           though not meanly -

                                 ALLISON
                        Are you jealous?

                                 EUGENE
                            (
                             exaggerated aloofness
                                                 )
                        'Course not. He's dead.

           Allison's smile fades. Eugene immediately realizes that he's 
           said the wrong thing.

                                 EUGENE
                        I'm sorry.

                                 ALLISON
                        You know, you've got some growing 
                        up to do.
                                 EUGENE
                        That weren't right for me to say, 
                        Allison.

           More tears come. Allison wipes them away. Eugene tries to 
           move past his blunder - 

                                 EUGENE
                        Do you have anything of his to 
                        remember him by?

           Allison shakes her head.

                                 ALLISON
                        He had this watch...

           FLASHBACK: INT. PACKARD DELUXE - DAY

           POV FROM PASSENGER SEAT: Perry - smiling, handsome - drives 
           the Packard down some beautiful country road.

                                 ALLISON (V.O.)
                        I'd seen it in a store window and 
                        it made me think of him, the way it 
                        looked... He was so sharp, so 
                        perfect.

           CLOSE ON Perry's WRISTWATCH - Elgin brand. The glass face 
           reflects the passing oak trees - a dappled river of green.

                                 ALLISON (V.O.)
                        Like you could shine him up and put 
                        him in a museum. One-of-a-kind...

           The watch face moves minutely with the adjustment of Perry's 
           wrist and now we see Allison reflected in the glass, riding 
           in the passenger seat - happy and free.

                                 ALLISON (V.O.)
                        So I bought it for him... And he 
                        was wearing it when he died.

           INT. BARN - DAY (PRESENT)

           Back to Allison, sobbing now. At first, Eugene doesn't know 
           what to do.

                                 ALLISON
                        And I left it there. I left it...
                            (
                             beat
                                 )
                        He was gonna come with me to 
                        Mexico...
           Finally, Eugene puts his arm around her. Not a romantic 
           gesture, but one of consolation. Allison puts her hand in 
           his and they sit there - two lonely people stumbling into a 
           brief moment of solace.

           INT. FORD TRUCK - NIGHT

           The Evans family rides together on the bench seat of 
           George's '28 Ford as he drives it through town. Olivia 
           smiles at her husband and runs her hand through his hair.

                                 OLIVIA
                        You tired, Papa?

                                 GEORGE
                        Yep.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Well, the dance'll cheer you up.

           George nods and gives her a brief smile back.

                                 OLIVIA
                        By the way, anyone seen my blue 
                        dress? The one with the birds?

           Eugene shifts a little. Phoebe glances sidelong at him.

                                 EUGENE
                        No, ma'am.

                                 PHOEBE
                        I haven't seen it, Mama.

                                 OLIVIA
                        We're out some food from the pantry 
                        too.

           At this, George looks concerned.

                                 GEORGE
                        That a fact?

                                 OLIVIA
                        Yes, indeed... A number of things 
                        coulda happened to the dress, but 
                        the pantry I can't account for.

           George thinks, brows knitted. Olivia looks to her children.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Ain't one of you, is it? Eating 
                        more food than you're allowed?
                                 EUGENE
                        No, ma'am.

                                 PHOEBE
                        Not me, Mama.

           EXT. DANCE HALL LOT - NIGHT

           The Ford is parked side by side with farm trucks and 
           jalopies. The Evans family threads through the lot toward 
           the SQUARE DANCE HALL, where a hoedown is audibly underway.

           George lingers back with Eugene while Olivia and Phoebe walk 
           ahead. He waits until his wife and daughter are out of 
           earshot -

                                 GEORGE
                        Your sister said you ain't been 
                        going to town like you told me you 
                        would.

                                 EUGENE
                            (
                             a beat, then:
                                         )
                        I been working on something.

                                 GEORGE
                        And what's that?

           Eugene says nothing...

                                 GEORGE
                        I'll ask again -

                                 EUGENE
                        It's a magazine sweepstakes... I'm 
                        trying to win us some money.

           George shakes his head, bewildered.

                                 GEORGE
                        Jesus Christ, Kid... Jesus God damn 
                        Christ. I'm telling you, find some 
                        work and stop messing around like a 
                        goon... You've gone foolish, 
                        spending all that time by yourself.

                                 EUGENE
                        I ain't a goon... And I ain't 
                        foolish. Don't speak to me that 
                        way.
           George stops short and roughly turns Eugene around. He gets 
           in the teenager's face -

                                 GEORGE
                        I put food on the table you sit at, 
                        so I'll talk to you any way I 
                        want... And if you got a problem 
                        with that, I suggest you do 
                        something about it.

           Eugene says nothing, but his stare makes it clear that if he 
           could flatten George right now, he would.

           INT. DANCE HALL - NIGHT

           Eugene sits alone in the stands, brooding, as the square 
           dance progresses, noisy and cheerful.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

           The dance is over. George's truck pulls up to the farmhouse.

           INT. ENTRYWAY - FARMHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Eugene enters the house first and is halfway up the stairs 
           by the time the rest of his family reach the front door.

           INT. GEORGE AND OLIVIA'S BEDROOM - FARMHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           He enters his parent's bedroom and goes directly to the end 
           table on George's side of the bed.

           A set of KEYS rests next to George's spectacles and a copy 
           of the Bismark Ledger with Allison's mugshot on the front.

           Eugene pockets the keys and exits the bedroom.

           INT. STAIRWELL - FARMHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           He comes down the stairs, passing his mother on the way up.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Where you going?

                                 EUGENE
                        Ben Fletcher's.

                                  OLIVIA
                        It's past ten...
           Eugene ignores her and goes out the front door.

           Olivia looks to George, who is already in his easy chair, 
           lighting a cigarette. He shrugs in weary apathy.

           EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT

           Eugene rides his bicycle past the closed-for-the-night shops 
           and busy pool halls of Main Street.

           EXT. CHILDRESS COUNTY COURTHOUSE - NIGHT

           He dismounts in front of the darkened county Courthouse and 
           wheels the bike around back.

           INT. BASEMENT HALLWAY - CHILDRESS COUNTY COURTHOUSE - NIGHT

           A narrow concrete hallway ending at a closed metal door.

           On the other side, the sound of jangling keys. The door is 
           unlocked and swings open, revealing Eugene.

                                                       MOMENTS LATER:

           Eugene prowls down the hallway and stops in front of a door:

                              Childress Co. Sheriff 
                                  Investigations

           He tries the knob. Locked. He tries one of the keys.

           INT. EVIDENCE LOCKER - MOMENTS LATER

           Eugene enters, quietly shutting the door behind him. He 
           flicks on the light.

           WE PAN to reveal a wire cage protecting shelf after shelf of 
           metal evidence boxes.

                                                       MOMENTS LATER:

           Having unlocked the cage door, Eugene is digging through a 
           box hand-labeled with the words "Wells Murders".

           He removes an oily paper bag and looks inside:

           Perry Montroy's Elgin watch.

           Eugene removes it from the bag and inspects it closely. The 
           watch face is spotted with dried blood.
           The metal back has an inscription carved into it with the 
           tip of a knife, the cuts glinting in the light:

                                  Love Forever, 
                                        A

           Suddenly, the door opens and a SHERIFF'S DEPUTY enters. He 
           has the look of a desk jockey - uniform too neat, hair too 
           shiny.

           The deputy is startled upon seeing Eugene, who is hard to 
           discern in the shadows -

                                 DEPUTY
                        Woah, now...

           Eugene shoves the watch in his pocket as the deputy 
           approaches the cage.

                                 DEPUTY
                        You ain't supposed to be in here.

           Eugene takes a random sheaf of papers and photographs from 
           the box before pushing it back onto the shelf. He stands.

                                 EUGENE
                        These are for my old man. He wanted 
                        to look 'em over at home.

                                 DEPUTY
                        Who's your old man?

                                 EUGENE
                        Deputy Evans.
                            (
                             shows him...
                                        )
                        He gave me his keys.

           The deputy stands there, not sure what to make of this. 
           Finally:

                                 DEPUTY
                        You're Eugene Evans, ain't you?

                                 EUGENE
                        Yessir.

                            (
                                 DEPUTY
                             holds up his hand
                                             )
                        Last time I saw you, you was about 
                        yea-high... Time sure as hell does 
                        a trick on people.

                                 EUGENE
                        Yessir, I guess it does.
                                 DEPUTY
                        George knows better, but I 
                        understand he's got a bug up his 
                        ass about this little situation we 
                        got... Take him what he needs, but 
                        let him know that next time he's 
                        gotta come here hisself.

                                 EUGENE
                        I will, sir.

                                 DEPUTY
                        All right.

           Eugene passes the deputy and exits. The deputy closes the 
           cage door, shaking his head.

           INT. BARN - NIGHT

           Allison is hugging Eugene tightly. He has just given her the 
           watch and she's ecstatic.

                                 ALLISON
                        Handsome...

           She surprises him with a kiss on the cheek.

                                 ALLISON
                        You're wonderful... Oh, you didn't 
                        have to do this.

                                 EUGENE
                        Are you happy?

           She takes his head in her hands and kisses him on the lips. 
           They separate - Eugene blinks, a little dazed.

                                 ALLISON
                        I'm happy.

           EXT. EVANS FAMILY PROPERTY - NIGHT

           Eugene stands at an empty oil drum behind the farmhouse. He 
           throws in the sheaf of evidence papers and photographs.

           He lights a match and throws that in too. He watches the 
           documents burn.
           INT. BARN - NIGHT

           Allison lies on her blankets, running her finger over the 
           inscription on the back of the watch. Her expression is sad.

           EXT. EVANS FAMILY PROPERTY - NIGHT

           Eugene turns away from the oil drum and flinches when he 
           sees Phoebe flickering ghost-like at the edge of the 
           firelight, a blanket around her shoulder -

                                 EUGENE
                        Why ain't you in bed?

           Phoebe's feet are sticking out of the bottom of her pajama 
           gown. She regards him groggily -

                                 PHOEBE
                        Why ain't you?

                                                       MOMENTS LATER:

           Eugene carries her on his shoulder, aimlessly walking deeper 
           into the fields of their property.

                                 PHOEBE
                        What sort of ridiculousness are you 
                        up to, brother?

                                 EUGENE
                            (
                             a long pause, then:
                                               )
                        It's a complicated thing.

                                 PHOEBE
                        Sure looks that way...

           Eugene stops walking. They stare at the incredible sweep of 
           the MILKY WAY above, undiminished by ambient light. Finally:

                                 PHOEBE
                        You know, I been thinking - I ain't 
                        left the county once my whole life.

           Eugene tries to work out why she would say this. Finally -

                                 EUGENE
                        That's 'cause you're a nine-year-
                        old little girl. You don't have no 
                        reason to leave the county.

                                 PHOEBE
                        I guess...
           But we can tell by her face that Phoebe doesn't agree... She 
           keeps her eyes on the stars. Finally -

                                 PHOEBE
                        How far is California?

                                 EUGENE
                        Not sure exactly... I gather it's 
                        pretty far.

                                 PHOEBE
                        You think we'll go there like the 
                        Fletchers?

           Eugene's resolve is clear. He knows this as he says it -

                                 EUGENE
                        No. We're gonna stay here.

                                 PHOEBE
                            (
                             a beat, then carefully:
                                                   )
                        If we had to leave, maybe it 
                        wouldn't be so bad...

                                 EUGENE
                            (
                             thrown by this
                                          )
                        'Course it'd be bad. The hell kinda 
                        thinking is that?

                                 PHOEBE
                        'Cause even if we left, we'd still 
                        be together... You, me, Mama and 
                        George... It'd be all right.

                                 EUGENE
                        But this is where we live.

                                 PHOEBE
                        But that's what I'm sayin'... 
                        What's it matter where we live, 
                        long as we're together?

           Eugene doesn't respond. Phoebe is insistent -

                                 PHOEBE
                        Right?

           Still nothing... Phoebe pinches his cheek playfully -

                                 PHOEBE
                        Ah, don't be a grump.

           But Eugene jerks his head away, his expression troubled.
           INT. BATHROOM - FARMHOUSE - MORNING

           Morning sun slants in, hitting a weary George as he stands 
           at the mirror, knotting his deputy's tie.

           INT. GEORGE AND OLIVIA'S BEDROOM - FARMHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           He enters and crosses the room to the end table, taking care 
           to be quiet since Olivia is still asleep.

           He gets to the table and stands there, confused - his keys 
           are missing.

           INT. KITCHEN - FARMHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           George hustles in, looking around - and sees: his keys are 
           sitting on the kitchen table. He mutters to himself -

                                 GEORGE
                        Damn it, George...

           He grabs them and exits.

           INT. OFFICES - CHILDRESS COUNTY COURTHOUSE - DAY

           It's hot as hell in the offices of Childress County law 
           enforcement when George enters. A desk fan blows paper 
           streamers and DEPUTIES fan themselves with their Stetsons.

           Unsurprisingly, the desk jockey who caught Eugene the night 
           before is at his desk. He regards George -

                                 DEPUTY
                        Evans, Sheriff wants a word.

           George nods and heads to the sheriff's office in back. The 
           other deputies watch him go.

           INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE - CHILDRESS COUNTY COURTHOUSE - CONT.

           The sheriff is immersed in paperwork as George enters. He 
           indicates a chair. George sits.

                                 SHERIFF ROSS
                        You're out. I'll need your badge 
                        and gun.

           George was expecting a reprimand, but not this -
                                 GEORGE
                        I'm out? Why?

                                 SHERIFF ROSS
                        One: you called an FBI agent a 
                        shitheel -

                                 GEORGE
                        He was a shitheel. He mishandled 
                        the search...!

                                 SHERIFF ROSS
                        Maybe. But it don't make my life 
                        any easier for you say so... Now, 
                        if that were all you did, I could 
                        let it slide, but having your own 
                        stepson come and pick up evidence 
                        for you to go over at home is a 
                        bridge too far. A God damn bridge 
                        too far.

           Confusion starts to overtake George's anger...

                                 GEORGE
                        The hell are you talking about?

                                 SHERIFF ROSS
                        Last night. Your stepson. He came 
                        with your keys and took material 
                        evidence for the Wells case. Said 
                        you asked him to.

                                 GEORGE
                        I never asked him any such thing.

                            (
                                                   )
                                 SHERIFF ROSS
                             stares at George, then:
                        So you're saying he's a thief of 
                        county property?

                                 GEORGE
                        No, I ain't, but -

                                 SHERIFF ROSS
                        I think whatever difficulties you 
                        may be having at home - with your 
                        family, your house - they's seeping 
                        into your greater life... You need 
                        to take care of you and yours 
                        before anything else, and perhaps 
                        when times is a little less lean, 
                        we can have you back. Sorry to say, 
                        but that's the way it is.
           George sits there, boiling. Then:

                                 GEORGE
                        She's still in Bismark, Sheriff. 
                        She didn't go nowhere.

                                 SHERIFF ROSS
                        Not according to the God damn FBI.

           George has nothing to say to this. He looks ready to kill 
           somebody.

                                 SHERIFF ROSS
                        Badge, gun, and the evidence your 
                        stepson took: I want 'em all on my 
                        desk by this afternoon.

           INT. FORD TRUCK - DAY

           George drives home past dead farms. In the distance, a DUST 
           STORM looms.

           EXT. BARN - DAY

           Eugene walks through the field to the barn. The storm roils 
           apocalyptically in the distance.

                                 ALLISON (PRE-LAP)
                        Today's the day, Handsome...

           INT. BARN - CONTINUOUS

           Allison sits on the tiller's fender, massaging her leg. 
           Eugene stands by, arms crossed, shaking his head -

                                 EUGENE
                        You can barely walk.

                                 ALLISON
                        Barely's better than not at all.

           He clearly doesn't like the idea of her leaving, his voice 
           rises in pitch -

                                 EUGENE
                        The storm'll be here in an hour...

                                 ALLISON
                        And it'll be perfect cover.
                                 (MORE)
                                 ALLISON (CONT'D)
                            (
                             beat
                                 )
                        I'd stay forever if I could, but we 
                        both know I can't.

           Eugene sighs. Allison's expression turns cold as she watches 
           him pout - she doesn't have time right now to indulge him.

                                 ALLISON
                        So what about the car...? You 
                        haven't said much on the subject.

                                 EUGENE
                        I couldn't get one.

           Any remaining tenderness disappears -

                                 ALLISON
                        You couldn't? Why the hell not?

           Eugene regards her with surprise, like she's slapped him.

                                 ALLISON
                        You've had fucking days! I thought 
                        you were actually gonna do this. I 
                        thought you were competent.

                                 EUGENE
                        I - Jesus - I tried!

                                 ALLISON
                        Well, you didn't try hard enough.

                                 EUGENE
                        Yeah, I was stealing that God damn 
                        watch! Christ almighty... How'd you 
                        expect me to get a car without 
                        money?!

           Allison can tell she went too far... With a softer tone -

                                 ALLISON
                        All right, all right... I'm 
                        sorry... Relax...

                                 EUGENE
                        I ain't incompetent.

                                 ALLISON
                        I know... Let's think about 
                        things... We have an option or two.
                                 EUGENE
                        And I ain't gonna steal my 
                        stepfather's truck, if that's 
                        crossing your mind. I'll do 
                        anything except that.

                                 ALLISON
                        No... I have a different idea.

                                 EUGENE
                            (
                             still smarting
                                          )
                        Yeah? And what's that?

                                 ALLISON
                        You ever hotwired a car before?

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY

           Eugene jogs back to the farmhouse. He jumps on his bicycle 
           and starts pedaling toward the road.

           Meanwhile, George's truck is approaching down the drive. 
           When he spots Eugene, he swerves to block him, skidding to a 
           stop and almost colliding with his stepson.

                                 EUGENE
                        Look out!

           George furiously barrels out of the truck. He pulls Eugene 
           from his bicycle and starts dragging him to the farmhouse.

                                 EUGENE
                            (
                             trying to free himself
                                                  )
                        The hell?! Let - Let go!

           INT. KITCHEN - FARMHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           George slams open the kitchen door and pushes Eugene inside.

                                 GEORGE
                        You know what happened?

           Eugene just stares at him, terrified.

                                 GEORGE
                        Do you know what happened?

                                 EUGENE
                        No.
                                 GEORGE
                        I was laid off. Now, do you know 
                        why?

           They watch each other... George nods -

                                 GEORGE
                        Yeah, you know why...
                            (
                             beat
                                 )
                        I have so many questions for you, 
                        you slippery bastard.

           Phoebe appears at the kitchen door to see what the commotion 
           is. George points at her.

                                 GEORGE
                        Get upstairs!

           She doesn't move, looking to Eugene for a signal that he'll 
           be okay. He nods at her, and at that she disappears.

                                 GEORGE
                        The evidence you took: where is it?

           Eugene says nothing. George shakes him.

                                 GEORGE
                        Say something!

                                 EUGENE
                        It's gone.

                                 GEORGE
                        Gone where?!

                                 EUGENE
                        I lost it.

           George suddenly gets very calm, but his eyes are fire. 
           Eugene senses danger, but instead of getting meek, he 
           acquires a sort of self-righteous anger -

                                 EUGENE
                        Hell, she was innocent! That stuff 
                        was all lies and made up nonsense.

                                 GEORGE
                        Innocent?! Where in God's creation 
                        do you get the idea of calling that 
                        woman "innocent"?

                                 EUGENE
                        I know things.
           A beat. George scrutinizes Eugene.

                                 GEORGE
                        Apple don't fall far from the tree, 
                        does it? Full of delusions and 
                        fantasies like your old man... I 
                        may have raised you, but you sure 
                        as shit ain't my son.

                                 EUGENE
                        You only raised me 'cause you had 
                        to, George.

           BOOM - George slugs Eugene in the stomach, sending him to 
           the floor.

           George immediately regrets it, but what's done is done. 
           Eugene is curled up, moaning.

           INT. EUGENE'S BEDROOM - FARMHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           George pushes Eugene into his bedroom. The boy stumbles to 
           the bed and sits down, clutching his stomach.

                                 GEORGE
                        You're gonna break your mother's 
                        heart when you end up dead like 
                        your old man...

           Eugene peers up at his stepfather.

                                 EUGENE
                        He ain't dead... He's in Mexico.

                                 GEORGE
                            (
                             smiling meanly
                                          )
                        Sure. Mexico.

           George exits, slamming the door.

           INT. SITTING ROOM - FARMHOUSE - DAY

           George sits in his chair, smoking. The storm looms closer - 
           the light through the windows is murky and brown.

           In the kitchen, Olivia enters through the back door. She's 
           wearing her waitress's outfit. Upon seeing George:

                                 OLIVIA
                        Hey there, I'm glad you're home... 
                        We closed up 'cause the storm.
                                 (MORE)
                                 OLIVIA (CONT'D)
                            (
                             noticing his demeanor
                                                 )
                        What's the matter now?

           ESTABLISHING. WIDE OF THE FARMHOUSE AND BARN - DAY

           The storm - a huge, billowing wall of dust - is only a few 
           hundred yards from the Evans property.

           INT. BARN - DAY

           Allison huddles amid the blankets of her makeshift bed. 
           Curls of dust waft in through gaps in the beams.

           INT. STAIRWELL - FARMHOUSE - DAY

           Olivia creeps up the stairs. The wind howls.

           INT. EUGENE'S BEDROOM - FARMHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           She opens the door to find Eugene lying on his bed, his back 
           to her. She shuts the door and sits next to her son. The 
           house rattles.

                                 OLIVIA
                        George... He's sorry what happened.
                            (
                             no response
                                       )
                        But he told me what you did...
                            (
                             still nothing...
                                            )
                        We both of us want to know exactly 
                        why.

           Eugene rolls over. His eyes are dry. His gaze, intent.

                                 EUGENE
                        I been trying to help.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Help who?

                                 EUGENE
                        The family. Us.

           Olivia looks up at the ceiling, trying not to cry. She looks 
           back at her son.

                                 OLIVIA
                        How is what you did a help? George 
                        was dismissed. We're less than a 
                        month away from being homeless.
           Eugene puts a hand on her arm to comfort her, but she 
           brushes him off...

           ...as the storm finally reaches the house. The room grows 
           dim and there is a sound on the roof like a rain of pebbles. 
           In the murk, Eugene regards his mother.

                                 EUGENE
                        George said Papa was dead.

           A beat. Olivia musters her courage - she nods.

                                 OLIVIA
                        And he was right.

           Eugene stares at her.

                                 EUGENE
                        How do you know?

           She says nothing, having dreaded this moment for years.

                                 EUGENE
                        He's in Mexico, Mama.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Do you remember that postcard he 
                        wrote you, when you was six?

                                 EUGENE
                        'Course I do.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Well, he sent more. But I burned 
                        every one of them after the first.

           Eugene watches her - gauging for truth.

           FLASHBACK: INT. KITCHEN - FARMHOUSE - DAY (1929)

           Olivia, thirty-two here, flips through a stack of mail. 
           Something catches her eye and she picks it out: a postcard 
           from Mexico. Her expression becomes sad as she reads it.

           Through the window, Eugene, age ten, can be seen having a 
           mock gunfight in the field with Ben, age nine.

                                 OLIVIA (V.O.)
                        Every month, he would write and 
                        every month each card was worse 
                        than the last... They'd be full of 
                        talk about God and people and 
                        strange things he had seen.

                                 OLIVIA (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        But it was all jumbled up... It was 
                        crazy. He was drinking himself to 
                        death and his mind was falling 
                        apart.

           FLASHBACK: EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY

           Behind the farmhouse, Olivia takes a match to the postcard 
           and drops it in a tin pail. She watches it burn.

                                 OLIVIA (V.O.)
                        I couldn't let a little boy read 
                        what he wrote. You wouldn't have 
                        known what to make of it... So I 
                        told you he was busy writing a 
                        book.

           INT. EUGENE'S BEDROOM - FARMHOUSE - DAY (PRESENT)

           The storm beats outside the window. Olivia has been crying, 
           but holds herself up with dignity.

                                 OLIVIA
                        I only lied 'cause I love you... I 
                        can't claim to be a perfect mother.

                                 EUGENE
                        You're lying to me now, Mama.

                                 OLIVIA
                        No, Eugene, I am not.
                            (
                             beat
                                 )
                        After five years, the cards 
                        stopped... And I believe that was 
                        because he had died.

           A long pause from Eugene. Finally:

                                 EUGENE
                        That ain't for sure.

                                 OLIVIA
                        I know it's hard to hear, Love. It 
                        was hard to say.

           Eugene lies down and turns away from his mother.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Eugene...

                                 EUGENE
                        It ain't for sure.
           A beat. Olivia stands. She looks one last time at her son 
           and then exits, shutting the door behind her.

           INT. HALLWAY - FARMHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           She finds George sitting in a chair placed directly outside 
           Eugene's door. She shoots her husband a reproachful look.

                                 GEORGE
                        He ain't leaving that room.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Where could he go in a storm like 
                        this?

                                 GEORGE
                        He say anything meaningful about 
                        what he did?

                                 OLIVIA
                        No.
                            (
                             beat
                                 )
                        This isn't like him. This behavior.

                                 GEORGE
                        I wonder if maybe it was coming the 
                        whole time... Maybe we just didn't 
                        see it...

           Olivia says nothing, overwhelmed by it all and wanting to 
           defend her son, but being incapable. The moment elongates...

                                 OLIVIA
                        I'm gonna seal up what I can.

                                 GEORGE
                        What good will it do?

           Olivia ignores this and starts down the stairs, then pauses.

                                 OLIVIA
                        I need your help with it, George. 
                        He ain't going nowhere.

           A beat, then George stands and follows her downstairs.

           INT. BARN - AFTERNOON

           The storm rages outside. Allison clutches the blankets to 
           her. Inside the barn is a whirlwind of dust.
           INT. EUGENE'S BEDROOM - FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

           Eugene wakes to utter silence... He looks out the window: 
           the storm is gone and a crystal-clear night has taken its 
           place.

           He gets up and puts on his clothes. He opens the window and 
           steps out onto the roof.

           INT. PHOEBE'S BEDROOM - FARMHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           The austere bedroom of a girl uninterested in "girlish" 
           things. Eugene slides the window open and crawls in, pushing 
           accumulated dust off the sill.

           He shakes Phoebe awake. She jerks, scared, but calms when 
           she sees it's him.

                                 EUGENE
                        I'm leaving. I wanted to tell you 
                        goodbye.

                                 PHOEBE
                        You're leaving? To where?

                                 EUGENE
                        Mexico.

                                 PHOEBE
                        Mexico?!

                                 EUGENE
                        Shh!

           Eugene listens... The house is silent.

                                 EUGENE
                        Yeah.

           Phoebe stares at him bleakly, something dawning on her.

                                 PHOEBE
                        It's her.

                                 EUGENE
                        Who?

                                 PHOEBE
                        The fugitive. The Wells lady... 
                        That's who you're going with.

                                 EUGENE
                        What...? You've gone crazy.
                            (
                             nodding
                                 PHOEBE
                                   )
                        Now I know why you been acting so 
                        strange.

                                 EUGENE
                        You don't know anything about it.

           Eugene is becoming visibly nervous. He tries to stand but 
           Phoebe holds onto him.

                                 PHOEBE
                        Lemme come. I wanna meet her.

                                 EUGENE
                        There ain't no "her".

           Phoebe just stares at him. Finally:

                                 EUGENE
                        You can't come.

                                 PHOEBE
                        Why not?

                                 EUGENE
                        'Cause you can't.
                            (
                             beat
                                 )
                        They need you here.

                                 PHOEBE
                        How long you gonna be there for?

                                 EUGENE
                        I don't know, but listen, I'm gonna 
                        send you money.

                                 PHOEBE
                        What?

                                 EUGENE
                        Use it to help Mama and George. But 
                        don't say where you got it from. 
                        Tell 'em you found it or something.

           Phoebe seems bewildered by all of this... She lies down and 
           hides her face under a pillow.

                                 EUGENE
                        Phoebe.
                                 PHOEBE
                        You talked up and down about 
                        staying here... So why all of a 
                        sudden are you going to Mexico?

           Eugene thinks about this. Finally:

                                 EUGENE
                        I guess I'm kinda in love.

                                 PHOEBE
                        You don't know anything about 
                        "love".

                                 EUGENE
                        Well, you don't neither.

           Phoebe starts to cry.

                                 PHOEBE
                        I know that if you loved us you'd 
                        stay. If you loved me...

                                 EUGENE
                        I do love you.

                                 PHOEBE
                        Then stay.

           Eugene's silence says it all. Phoebe looks crestfallen.

                                 EUGENE
                        Don't cry, Phoebe.
                            (
                             nothing from her...
                                               )
                        Phoebe.

                                 PHOEBE
                        Go... Quit drawing it out

           Eugene regards her sadly, then stands and goes to the 
           window. With one last look, he climbs out and onto the roof.

                                                       MOMENTS LATER:

           Phoebe rolls over. She sits up and watches longingly out the 
           window as her brother moves off through the moonlit field.

           EXT. FLETCHER RESIDENCE - DAWN

           A vivid dawn fills the sky... Eugene approaches the Fletcher 
           residence. The Hudson truck is parked on the drive.
           INT. KITCHEN - FARMHOUSE - MORNING

           Olivia prepares breakfast with Phoebe's help, but her 
           daughter is distracted, almost dropping a bowl of pancake 
           batter. Olivia notices this but doesn't comment.

           George is visible in the sitting room, smoking a cigarette 
           while sweeping up dust from the floor.

                                 OLIVIA
                        We're almost ready. You wanna wake 
                        the boy?

           George hesitates - of course he doesn't. Nevertheless, he 
           leaves the broom and goes upstairs.

           INT. HALLWAY - FARMHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           George knocks on Eugene's door.

                                 GEORGE
                        There's breakfast.

           He waits. Knocks again.

                                 GEORGE
                        Let's hop to it.

           Nothing. George opens the door - Eugene is gone.

           INT. KITCHEN - FLETCHER RESIDENCE - MORNING

           Ben Fletcher eats breakfast with his family. His mother, 
           Josie, notices that William - Ben's older brother - is 
           hunched moodily over his food, pecking at it.

                                 JOSIE FLETCHER
                        Them eggs is eating you, Will.

                                 BEN
                        He's crying 'cause Ruth McKinley's 
                        gonna take up with someone else 
                        soon as we leave town, if she ain't 
                        done it already.

           William flicks a piece of egg at Ben -

                                 WILLIAM FLETCHER
                        Hell do you know about it?
                                 JOSIE FLETCHER
                        Profanity! And it's a shameful sin 
                        to waste that food.

           Ben's Father, Ed, doesn't look up from his newspaper:

                                 ED FLETCHER
                        That's enough, fellas.

                                 JOSIE FLETCHER
                        Now, when you boys is finished, you 
                        gonna help your father load the 
                        bureau onto the truck. We're 
                        sellin' it in town today.

           William flicks another piece of egg at Ben, which hits him 
           in the face and sticks there. Ben plays it up for laughs - 
           he remains still as if he's unaware he's been hit.

                                 BEN
                        Yes, ma'am.

           Ed sees this over the top of his newspaper and chuckles, as 
           does William. Josie is not amused -

                                 JOSIE
                        Ya'll make me wish I had daughters.

           EXT. FLETCHER RESIDENCE - MORNING

           Ben, Ed and William carry a fine wooden bureau out of the 
           front door and around the house.

           Suddenly, Ed notices something in the driveway and stops 
           short, forcing Ben and his brother to stop too. Before we 
           see what's drawing Ed's attention, we CUT TO -

           EXT. DEAD CORNFIELD - MORNING

           Eugene helps Allison through the cornstalks. She is uneasy 
           on her feet, but able to walk with relative ease. She 
           carries an old army knapsack.

                                 ALLISON
                        You aren't gonna tell me, are you?

                                 EUGENE
                        You'll see...

                                 ALLISON
                        What make is it, at least?
                                 EUGENE
                        You'll see in a minute.

                                                       MOMENTS LATER:

           They emerge from the cornfield onto a dirt farm road. The 
           Fletcher's Hudson truck is parked on the shoulder.

           Allison looks impressed. She smiles approvingly at Eugene.

           INT. KITCHEN - FARMHOUSE - MORNING

           Breakfast is finished and plates piled high with pancake and 
           sausage are waiting. However, Phoebe sits crying at the 
           kitchen table, Olivia hovering over her -

                                 OLIVIA
                        Why are you saying that?

                                 PHOEBE
                        It's true...!

           George bursts in through the back door, startling them.

                                 GEORGE
                        He ain't in the barn -

                                 OLIVIA
                        Papa, Phoebe here's been saying 
                        strange things about her brother 
                        and I want you to tell her they 
                        isn't true.

           George looks keenly at Phoebe -

                                 GEORGE
                        What's she been saying?

                                 OLIVIA

                             to Phoebe
                                     )
                        She says Eugene's been helping 
                        Allison Wells, the fugitive, and 
                        that - that he's eloped with her, 
                        or some such... But that just isn't 
                        possible. It's a little girl's 
                        fantasy.
                            (
                        Isn't it?

           Phoebe sniffles, remaining silent.

           The phone rings. Everyone looks at it. It rings again. 
           George answers -
                                 GEORGE (ON PHONE)
                        Hello.
                            (
                             listens
                                   )
                        This is he.
                            (
                             listens
                                   )
                        Is that a fact...? That's - Ah - 
                        That's quite the speculation, Ed.

           George listens to the person on the other line, then is 
           silent for a moment, looking through the window at the barn 
           in the distance. Finally -

                                 GEORGE (ON PHONE)
                        Truthfully, I don't know. I ain't 
                        seen him.
                            (
                             listens
                                   )
                        Now, Ed. You don't know for sure -
                             other end hangs up
                                              )
                            (
                        Shit!

           George sets the phone down and looks to Olivia, her panic 
           growing.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Oh, George, what now?

                                 GEORGE
                        That was Ed Fletcher. They think 
                        Eugene's stolen their truck.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Nonsense... Nonsense... Call them 
                        back.

           EXT. HUDSON TRUCK/TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - MORNING

           The Hudson flies south through the outskirts of Bismark.

           INT. HUDSON TRUCK - THAT MOMENT

           Eugene drives and Allison sits shotgun. She watches the 
           passing landscape with unease.

                                 ALLISON
                        You did good, Handsome...

           Eugene grins -

                                 EUGENE
                        I know it.
                                 ALLISON
                        But I hate goodbyes and this one's 
                        getting tougher by the mile.

                                 EUGENE
                        There ain't gonna be any goodbyes. 
                        You don't got to fret about it.

           Allison watches him, not sure what he means, but his 
           expression makes her understand -

                                 ALLISON
                        Oh, no. Uh-uh... I'm going to 
                        Mexico by myself.

                                 EUGENE
                        'Fraid not.

                                 ALLISON
                        Afraid so... Eugene... What about 
                        the money?

                                 EUGENE
                        Your old man can't pay me in 
                        person?

                                 ALLISON
                        I mean for your family...

           Eugene loses his smile. "Family" is a touchy subject for him 
           right now.

                                 EUGENE
                        I'll get it to them somehow.

                                 ALLISON
                        You can't just leave them.

           A sullen, guilty look from Eugene at this -

                                 EUGENE
                        They're better off without me... 
                        Besides, I got family in Mexico.

           Allison is at first unsure what he's talking about. Then she 
           remembers -

                                 ALLISON
                        Your father...

                                 EUGENE
                        That's right. I'm gonna track him 
                        down.
                                 ALLISON
                        I don't think you understand what 
                        that entails.

                                 EUGENE
                        Let's cut the bullshit. What's it 
                        matter to you if I come or not?

           Allison is silent, regarding him coldly. Finally:

                                 ALLISON
                        It matters 'cause you're in love 
                        with me.

           Forced laughter from Eugene...

                                 EUGENE
                        No I ain't.
                             Allison gives him a look
                                                    )
                            (
                        I ain't...

           She isn't swayed. Finally -

                                 EUGENE
                        Well what of it?! You know, this 
                        morning I woke up, I said to myself 
                        "there isn't no way in hell Allison 
                        is going to Mexico without me..." 
                        And there ain't. Whether you love 
                        me back or not is besides the 
                        point...
                            (
                             he smiles
                                     )
                        We're both of us just gonna have to 
                        live with it.

           And with this, the tension breaks. Allison smiles too, 
           shaking her head in mystification.

                                 ALLISON
                        What happened to you, Eugene, 
                        between yesterday and today?

                                 EUGENE
                        What didn't happen, is the better 
                        question.

                                 ALLISON
                            (
                             a beat, then:
                                         )
                        Nothing funny, you hear me? Once we 
                        get to Mexico, you'll go your way 
                        and I'll go mine.

                                 EUGENE
                        We'll see... You could come around.
           Allison shoots him a look, anger reigniting briefly only to 
           dissipate again...

                                 ALLISON
                        Just drive, all right...? And keep 
                        your smart mouth shut for a while.

           INT. KITCHEN - FARMHOUSE - DAY

           Olivia is crying, head in hands. Phoebe watches her mother 
           with dread while George dials a number on the telephone.

                                 OLIVIA
                        God... God, what did I do wrong?
                            (
                             beat
                                 )
                        George, how'd they come across one 
                        another?

                                 GEORGE
                        I don't know.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Well, what's gonna happen to him?

           George finishes dialing and listens to it ring.

                                 GEORGE
                        I'm calling Tade and I'm calling 
                        Lomax. We'll find them before 
                        someone else does.

           The other line picks up. George smiles, despite everything, 
           and turns away from his wife and daughter.

                                 GEORGE (ON PHONE)
                        Tade. Dust off that buckshooter. I 
                        got us a bounty.

           EXT. BACK ROAD - MORNING

           The stolen Hudson roars through the Texan plains.

           INT. HUDSON TRUCK - THAT MOMENT

           Allison is watching Eugene with curiosity: she thought she 
           had the full measure of this teenage boy and she wound up 
           being wrong.

           When he notices her gaze, she looks away and turns on the 
           radio, filling the truck with gospel music.
           She changes the station. "Whispering" by the Benny Goodman 
           Quartet starts playing - a pleasant jazz song.

                                 ALLISON
                        There we go...

           Allison absently taps the rhythm and hums fragments of the 
           melody.

                                 EUGENE
                        Who's this?

                                 ALLISON
                        Benny Goodman. You like it?

           Eugene shrugs.

                                 ALLISON
                        I met him once, you know.

                                 EUGENE
                        Huh.

                                 ALLISON
                        He picked me out of a crowd. Said I 
                        was pretty.

           This gets Eugene's attention.

                                 EUGENE
                        What crowd was that?

           FLASHBACK: EXT. RADIO CITY MUSIC HALL - EVENING

           Allison, 20 here, is among a crush of NEW YORKERS on the 
           sidewalk.

                                 ALLISON (V.O.)
                        Outside Radio City Music Hall... 
                        Four years ago.

           BENNY GOODMAN, attended by HANDLERS, steps out of a car and 
           waves. He begins heading into the Hall but arrests his pace 
           when he spots Allison.

           He wades into the crowd, which is shouting for him, and 
           takes Allison's outstretched hand. He says something to her 
           which we can't hear, but can see - "What's your name, 
           beautiful?"
           INT. HUDSON TRUCK - MORNING (PRESENT)

           The Hudson speeds along.

                                 ALLISON
                        People like him just have this... 
                        grace. They move through the world 
                        like it's theirs. You know what I 
                        mean?

                                 EUGENE
                        Sure... That's like you.

           Allison is flattered by this.

                                 ALLISON
                        Yeah?

           Eugene nods.

                                 ALLISON
                        Well, that's going to be you too.

           Eugene chuckles, shaking his head.

                                 EUGENE
                        Yeah, I have my doubts about that.

                                 ALLISON
                        No, you're going to have a special 
                        life.

           Eugene stares out the windshield, thinking about this.

           EXT. INTERSECTION - DAY

           An intersection of two farm roads, the outline of a small 
           town in the flat, hazy distance.

           Adjacent to the intersection is a hedge, and behind that 
           hedge - an idling POLICE CAR.

           INT. POLICE CAR - THAT MOMENT

           Inside it, a COP - 25-years-old with blonde hair and a 
           babyface - eats a ham sandwich while reading a "Doc Savage" 
           pulp magazine, his feet up on the dash. Just killing time...

           He is chewing and chuckling to himself when the Hudson roars 
           by. There is a moment of surprise, then Babyface drops the 
           sandwich and magazine onto the passenger seat.
           EXT. INTERSECTION - THAT MOMENT

           The siren comes on and the police car pulls onto the road.

           INT. HUDSON TRUCK - MOMENTS LATER

           Allison watches behind them at the gaining cop.

                                 ALLISON
                        Shit.

                                 EUGENE
                        What should I do?

                                 ALLISON
                        Put distance on him.

                                 EUGENE
                        In this?

           Allison looks chagrined - of course, the Hudson isn't nearly 
           fast enough.

                                 ALLISON
                        Do you have a gun?

           Eugene works to keep his cool -

                                 EUGENE
                        No, I don't have a gun.

           Allison glances back over her shoulder.

                                 ALLISON
                        Stop, then.

                                                       MOMENTS LATER:

           The Hudson has pulled over. Babyface saunters to the 
           driver's side window.

                                 BABYFACE COP
                        How ya'll doin'?

                                 EUGENE
                        Fine, sir.

           Babyface takes a long look at Allison. She smiles at him. He 
           smiles back. He looks at Eugene and his smile fades.

                                 EUGENE
                        What's the problem?
                                 BABYFACE COP
                        Problem is, you ignored a clearly-
                        placed stop sign, not to mention 
                        you was going forty-five plus while 
                        doing it. You leave your good sense 
                        at home, son?

           Laughter from Allison at this... Eugene's embarrassment 
           deepens.

                                 ALLISON
                        Officer, this is my nephew. I've 
                        been teaching him how to drive and 
                        I was chattering away like I tend 
                        to do and I guess I must have 
                        distracted him.

           Babyface leans in the window to address Allison better. 
           Eugene has to lean back to maintain his personal space.

                                 BABYFACE COP
                        Nephew? How old are you, miss?   
                        You don't look a day past twenty.

                                 ALLISON
                            (
                             with a lovely smile
                                               )
                        Guess again, Handsome.

           Eugene shoots her a look, his jealousy palpable.

           EXT. BACK ROAD - MOMENTS LATER

           Whistling, Babyface strolls back to the police car.

           INT. POLICE CAR - CONTINUOUS

           He gets in and waves out of his window in the Hudson's 
           direction. The truck drives off. Babyface shakes his head.

                                 BABYFACE COP
                        God damn... God damn.

           INT. GEORGE AND OLIVIA'S BEDROOM - FARMHOUSE - MORNING

           Shotgun in hand, George pockets rounds from a box of 
           ammunition in the closet. Olivia sits on the bed behind him.

                                 OLIVIA
                        Don't shoot my son, George.
                                 GEORGE
                        Olivia, we ain't gonna shoot nobody 
                        until the kid's free and clear. I 
                        told you that.

           George finishes and turns to his wife.

                                 GEORGE
                        I get a third of that bounty as it 
                        currently stands and we're set... 
                        We can stay.

           Olivia says nothing, regarding her husband with dread. He 
           moves in to say this quietly:

                                 GEORGE
                        And another thing: if word gets out 
                        about where that bitch was hiding, 
                        and I'm not the one to bring her 
                        in...? Makes me sick to even think 
                        about it.

           Olivia glares at him.

                                 OLIVIA
                        You think I care right now about 
                        any of that?

                        You bring my son back to me, or you 
                        don't bother coming back.

           George watches her, the weight of this clear to him.

           INT. LOBBY - MATADOR POLICE STATION - MORNING

           Babyface enters, still finishing the last of his sandwich. 
           He grins at the POLICE DISPATCHER - a cranky woman of 50.

                                 DISPATCHER
                        You're early.

                                 BABYFACE COP
                        I'm in love.

                                 DISPATCHER
                        With what? Your mirror?

           Babyface forces a guffaw of laughter. He goes behind the 
           desk to the notice board.

                                 BABYFACE COP
                        That's rich. You oughta go into 
                        showbiz. It would suit your looks.
           The dispatcher rolls her eyes and Babyface scans the board. 
           Wanted posters are tacked up next to typed announcements.

                                 BABYFACE COP
                            (
                             muttering
                                     )
                        Anything new in dishwater-ville?

           He notices, half-buried - a picture of Allison's face. He 
           squints and uncovers it, revealing her wanted poster.

           Surprised, he lets go of the remainder of his ham sandwich. 
           It splats onto the floor.

           INT. KITCHEN - FARMHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           George enters, trailed by Olivia. BILL TADE and CARL LOMAX, 
           unemployed middle-aged farmers, wait respectfully near the 
           back door. Both are holding rifles.

                                 BILL TADE
                        Mornin', Mrs. Evans.

           Olivia coolly ignores Bill and sits next to her daughter at 
           the kitchen table.

                                 BILL TADE
                        Eugene's gonna be a-okay.

           Still nothing from Olivia. She puts her arm around Phoebe 
           and draws her close.

           The phone rings. George answers it immediately.

                                 GEORGE (ON PHONE)
                        This is Evans.
                            (
                             listens
                                   )
                        Uh-huh.
                            (
                             listens
                                   )
                        All right. I appreciate it.

           George hangs up, addresses the room:

                                 GEORGE
                        They're near Matador, heading 
                        south.

           INT. HUDSON TRUCK - DAY

           Allison wakes with a start - sitting upright in her seat. 
           Eugene is staring intently out the windshield.
                                 ALLISON
                        Why are we slowing down?

                                 EUGENE
                        Look.

           Two miles down the highway - a ROADBLOCK: three police cars 
           creating a pinch point and numerous OFFICERS. Allison 
           glares - she doesn't like the way this looks at all...

           Just beyond the roadblock is a small town - one-story 
           buildings and a water tower.

           Between the Hudson and the roadblock - an intersection with 
           a dirt farm road, quickly getting closer.

                                 ALLISON
                        Here, here - take a right.

           EXT. FARM ROAD INTERSECTION - THAT MOMENT

           The Hudson slows and turns onto the road.

           After a moment of hard-to-discern activity at the roadblock, 
           one of the police cars breaks off and heads up the highway 
           after them - not in a hurry, but clearly suspicious.

           INT. HUDSON TRUCK - THAT MOMENT

           Allison watches the distant car get closer.

                                 ALLISON
                        Turn back, you bastards...
                             beat, then to Eugene:
                                                 )
                            (
                        Speed up.

           EXT. FARM ROAD - THAT MOMENT

           The Hudson accelerates, kicking up dust. A mile off now, the 
           police car turns on its siren and speeds up too.

                                                       MOMENTS LATER:

           The Hudson is further down the farm road, which crosses a 
           dry river on a rickety bridge.

           Just before that, a less-traveled dirt road spurs off and 
           runs along the riverbank amid clusters of elm trees.

           The Hudson makes a sharp turn onto this road, fishtailing -
           INT. HUDSON TRUCK - THAT MOMENT

           - and nearly spinning out. Eugene wrenches the wheel side-
           to-side and succeeds in straightening the truck. Allison 
           laughs gleefully, as if this were a ride at the state fair. 
           Eugene shoots her a wary glance.

           INT. HUDSON TRUCK - MOMENTS LATER

           The Hudson sits idling in the shade of some elms. Allison 
           and Eugene stare out the window behind them - they have a 
           clear view of the riverside road back to the bridge.

                                 EUGENE
                        Maybe they didn't see us turn...

                                 ALLISON
                        Of course they did.

           Lo and behold - the police car, sirens wailing, slows down 
           and stops at the intersection, as if considering. Then, it 
           makes a left turn and comes after them.

           EXT. HUDSON TRUCK - THAT MOMENT

           Eugene and Allison open their doors and jump out. Allison 
           makes a break down the riverbank, limping. Eugene hesitates, 
           watching the fast-approaching police car.

                                 ALLISON
                        What are you waiting for?!

           Eugene follows down the bank. Allison throws an arm around 
           his shoulder and they move off together along the dry 
           riverbed.

           EXT. DEAD WHEAT FIELD - LATE AFTERNOON

           Some hours later, the sun lower in the sky. Allison and 
           Eugene lie amid crumbling stalks of wheat, watching a 
           FARMHOUSE. They're both sweating in the late-day heat.

           A moment passes. Suddenly, Allison is laughing. Eugene 
           glares at her.

                                 ALLISON
                        Isn't this fun...? I'm having fun.

           He shakes his head moodily. Allison's gaze lingers on him 
           and then she nods at the farmhouse.
                                 ALLISON
                        You think it's empty, or what?

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Eugene stands at a window, peering into the farmhouse 
           through his cupped hands.

           Allison lingers by the new-looking Chevy truck parked on the 
           dirt driveway.

           She's looking back in the direction they came from - shouts 
           of police and the barks of search dogs can be heard echoing 
           from the distant grove of riverbank elms.

           Eugene steps away from the window.

                                 EUGENE
                        Stay here.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - FARMHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Eugene pads quietly into the living room, where an 
           octogenarian FARMER snores loudly in an easy chair.

           A half-full pitcher of water and an empty glass sit on the 
           side-table next to the farmer, along with a set of keys.

           Eugene hears a faint tapping - Allison is peering in the 
           window at him. She makes a "hurry-up" motion.

           INT. CHEVY TRUCK - EVENING

           The farmer's keys dangle from the ignition as the stolen 
           Chevy purrs down the highway. Eugene drives and Allison 
           rides shotgun, holding the pitcher of water.

           Allison drinks, then offers some water to Eugene.

           He takes it with his free hand and tips it over his open 
           mouth. Water goes everywhere and the truck swerves a little.  
           Allison laughs.

                                 EUGENE
                        Darn it.

                                 ALLISON
                        Here.

           She reaches out and helps him put the jug to his lips. He 
           drinks.
           EXT. TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - NIGHT

           The last glow of dusk leaving the sky... Two trucks push 
           along the highway. The one in the lead is George's Ford.

           INT. FORD TRUCK - THAT MOMENT

           George grips the steering wheel, utterly intent. An un-ashed 
           cigarette dangles from his lips.

           Carl Lomax sits next to him, staring pensively out the 
           window. They drive in tense silence.

           EXT. NIGHT'S REST MOTOR COURT - NIGHT

           A neon "Vacancy" blinks beneath the sign for the Night's 
           Rest Motor Court - a collection of small bungalows, each 
           with its own parking space.

           Eugene and Allison's stolen Chevy pulls off the road and 
           parks in front of the office.

           INT. CHEVY TRUCK - THAT MOMENT

           Eugene starts to get out, as does Allison -

                                 EUGENE
                        You ought to wait here.

                                 ALLISON
                        Uh-uh. I wanna stretch my legs.

           Eugene indicates the DESK CLERK (20s), visible in the 
           office.

                                 EUGENE
                        He'll see you.

                                 ALLISON
                        So? Let him see.

           INT. MOTOR COURT OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           The radio is playing an episode of the Lone Ranger. The 
           bored clerk - attractive, tall - sits up as they enter.

                                 DESK CLERK
                        Evenin'.
           Allison leans on the desk. She is still magnetic despite her 
           day on the run in the Texas summer.

                                 ALLISON
                        Evening yourself, Handsome.

           Eugene grinds his teeth. The clerk glances between him and 
           Allison, trying to discern their relationship.

                                 ALLISON
                        How you doing on this lonesome 
                        night?

                                 DESK CLERK
                        Well, I can't complain.

                                 ALLISON
                        The sign says you have vacancies.

                                 DESK CLERK
                        That's right.
                            (
                             the hint of a smile
                                               )
                        One room or two?

           Before Allison can answer -

                                 EUGENE
                        One.

           INT. BUNGALOW - NIGHT'S REST MOTOR COURT - NIGHT

           They enter the bland room. Allison continues into the 
           bathroom and shuts the door. She turns the shower on.

           Eugene follows to the closed bathroom door and stands there. 
           Almost knocks. Decides not to...

                                 ALLISON (THROUGH DOOR)
                        I can see your shadow.

           Caught, Eugene has to say something. But he doesn't.

                                 ALLISON (THROUGH DOOR)
                        What is it?

           Eugene wrestles with himself for a moment and then says it -

                                 EUGENE
                        You trying to get a rise out of me, 
                        talking to fellas like that?

                                 ALLISON (THROUGH DOOR)
                        What fellas?
                                 EUGENE
                            (
                             a beat, then:
                                         )
                        The cop this morning and - and the 
                        fella at the desk. You was calling 
                        them "Handsome".

           He cringes, embarrassed by what he's saying.

                                 ALLISON (THROUGH DOOR)
                        You know, you're all the same. You 
                        all think with your dicks.

           Even in Eugene's pulp magazines, no one's ever said anything 
           like that. He doesn't know how to respond.

           The bathroom door opens, emitting a cloud of steam. It 
           dissipates a little to reveal Allison, who is naked except 
           for a towel. Eugene averts his eyes.

                                 ALLISON
                        Did it occur to you that I was 
                        chatting them up for a reason?

                                 EUGENE
                        Take your shower... We can talk 
                        about this later.

                                 ALLISON
                        No, if it bothers you - if you 
                        care - do something about it... 
                        What's the use of being shy 
                        anymore?

           He stares at her with a formidable mixture of lust and 
           nerves. She looks back serenely, almost coldly...

                                                       MOMENTS LATER:

           Eugene and Allison are kissing in the shower, naked but 
           obscured by steam. We slowly PUSH IN on them.

                        But that isn't really how it went.
           INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT'S REST MOTOR COURT - NIGHT

           Allison sits on the lid of the toilet, crying. She is fully 
           clothed and the bathroom is devoid of steam... Some or all 
           of the previous scene was a fantasy.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        The reality was more desperate and 
                        sad, as reality tends to be.

           INT. BUNGALOW - NIGHT'S REST MOTOR COURT - THAT MOMENT

           Eugene listens at the bathroom door. He looks worried.

                                 EUGENE
                        Can I do something for you?

           No response...

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        I won't recount every detail of how 
                        we wound up in bed together 
                        because, quite honestly, I can 
                        hardly remember.

           The door opens and Allison is standing there with red eyes 
           and wet cheeks. She takes Eugene's hand.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        But I remember what happened after.

                                                              LATER:

           Eugene and Allison lie in bed in a post-coital haze. Allison 
           is smoking a cigarette, staring off. The radio is on, 
           quietly playing a Glenn Miller tune.

           Eugene taps her and gestures for the cigarette. She hands it 
           to him and watches his face as he takes an unpracticed drag.

           There is a vulnerability and need in her eyes that is new to 
           us. She tentatively caresses his cheek, then takes the 
           cigarette back.

           ESTABLISHING. NIGHT'S REST MOTOR COURT - MORNING

           The sun rises over the motor court.
           INT. BUNGALOW - NIGHT'S REST MOTOR COURT - MORNING

           Morning light silhouettes Allison at the window as she peers 
           out through the flimsy curtains.

                                                       MOMENTS LATER:

           She's in bed with Eugene, watching him sleep with genuine 
           affection. After a moment, he wakes and sees her. He smiles.

                                 ALLISON
                        Morning, Handsome.

                                 EUGENE
                        Morning.

                                 ALLISON
                        I've got a surprise for you.

                                 EUGENE
                        Oh yeah...?

           He paws at her, but Allison pulls away.

                                 ALLISON
                        Not like that. Close your eyes.

           Eugene smirks, but closes them. Allison takes something out 
           of her knapsack and presses it into his hand.

           He opens his eyes - she's given him the Elgin wristwatch. 
           The blood has been cleaned off and the watch is gleaming.

           She watches him expectantly, but he doesn't know what to 
           say. She senses his unease.

                                 ALLISON
                        You don't like it?

                                 EUGENE
                        No, I do... I do. It's swell.

           Eugene holds the watch to his wrist. He tries to muster a 
           big smile, but his heart isn't in it.

                                 EUGENE
                        It'll look real sharp.

                                 ALLISON
                        What's the matter with it?

                                 EUGENE
                        Nothing. No, it's nicer than 
                        anything I ever had.
           Allison simply stares at him. Finally, Eugene admits what's 
           on his mind:

                                 EUGENE
                        This was Perry's watch. You gave it 
                        to him.

                                 ALLISON
                            (
                             suddenly angry
                                          )
                        So what? You want a brand new one?

                                 EUGENE
                        No, that's not -

                                 ALLISON
                        You want me to hop in the car and 
                        go to Dillard's? I'll pick up a new 
                        watch for you at the watch counter.

                                 EUGENE
                        That's not what I meant.

                                 ALLISON
                        Then say what you mean!

                                 EUGENE
                        Doesn't it remind you of him?

           A beat. Allison gets off the bed and crosses the room. She 
           pauses at the bathroom door.

                                 ALLISON
                        Wherever Perry is, the last thing 
                        he needs is a watch.
                                 )
                            (
                             beat
                        Do you want it, or not?

                                 EUGENE
                        I want it.

           Allison enters the bathroom and shuts the door.

                                                              LATER:

           The sound of the running shower. Eugene is in bed, reading 
           the inscription carved on the back of the watch:

                                  Love Forever, 
                                        A

           He studies this, his expression unreadable.
           INT. CHEVY TRUCK - MORNING

           Eugene drives, wearing the wristwatch. Allison stares out 
           the window at the endless dormant fields.

                                 ALLISON
                        I'm sorry... I get all mixed up 
                        sometimes.

                                 EUGENE
                        I'm keen on it. I shouldn'tve said 
                        nothing.

           She turns to him, smiling.

                                 ALLISON
                        It makes you look like a million 
                        bucks.

           Eugene smiles back.

           EXT. GRAPEFRUIT STAND - DAY

           Allison and Eugene sit at a picnic table, peeling huge 
           grapefruits and eating them, their hands glistening.

           In the background - the VENDOR, a middle-aged woman in 
           glasses and a checkered dress, lounges on a chair in the 
           shade of the stand, fanning herself.

                                 ALLISON
                        People are strange...

                                 EUGENE
                        How's that?

                                 ALLISON
                        I'm so happy you came with me. I 
                        am... But yesterday morning, when 
                        you wouldn't get out of that 
                        truck...
                            (
                             beat
                                 )
                        I was wondering what the hell I was 
                        gonna do with you.

                                 EUGENE
                        I know it.

                                 ALLISON
                        You showed me a side of you I 
                        hadn't seen.
                            (
                             smiles at him
                                         )
                        I like that side.
                                 EUGENE
                        Music to my ears.

                                 ALLISON
                        I guess it's funny to me how you 
                        can so easily change your mind 
                        about a person.

                                 EUGENE
                        It is funny... But I ain't gonna 
                        change my mind about you.

           Allison returns Eugene's affectionate gaze with the same 
           open vulnerability that she had in bed the night prior -

                                 ALLISON
                        Do you think I'm a good person?

           The question catches him off guard.

                                 EUGENE
                        Sure I do... You asking just 'cause 
                        you was mad at me?

                                 ALLISON
                        I don't know...
                             beat
                            (
                                 )
                        I suppose I just feel like in some 
                        ways that you're a good person and 
                        I'm not.

                                 EUGENE
                        Why would you think that?

                                 ALLISON
                            (
                             shrugs, then:
                                         )
                        Because I'm from the city and I do 
                        things for myself... And you do 
                        things for other people.

                                 EUGENE
                        Not always... Not usually.

                                 ALLISON
                        I want to be more like Eugene 
                        Evans...

           Eugene grabs her and pulls her close, a gesture she 
           appreciates.

                                 EUGENE
                        You don't have to worry about who 
                        you are, or what I think of you... 
                        I'm over the moon for you.
                                 ALLISON
                        I am too.

           They kiss.

                                                              LATER:

           The trees behind the grapefruit vendor sway gently in the 
           wind, sunlight glimmering through their leaves.

           WIDE SHOT of Allison and Eugene walking back to the truck, 
           both happy. Smiling and talking, though we can't hear them -

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        It was the sort of perfect morning 
                        that echoes through the rest of 
                        your life - the details blurrier 
                        every year, but with a positive 
                        resonance that never fades. I half-
                        remember us going on to discuss a 
                        dream she'd had the night before -

           CLOSE ON the two of them - we hear Allison now:

                                 ALLISON
                        It was me and you and we were in 
                        swim clothes...
                             reverently
                            (
                                      )
                        And we were on a black-sand Mexican 
                        beach.

                                 EUGENE
                        How'd you know it was Mexico?

                                 ALLISON
                        I just did... It was a dream.
                            (
                             beat
                                 )
                        There was this darling little girl 
                        with us. But she wasn't our child.

           Eugene chuckles nervously -

                                 EUGENE
                        But she coulda been?

           Allison shrugs, looking off to the distance.

                                 EUGENE
                        If she wasn't ours, whose was she 
                        then?

                                 ALLISON
                        I don't know.
           DREAM: EXT. MEXICAN BEACH - DAY

           Eugene and Allison, in swim clothes, sit in the sand with a 
           FIVE-YEAR-OLD GIRL.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        I have a theory.

           CLOSE ON the five-year-old girl, who has the same complexion 
           and dark hair as Allison.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        I think the little girl in 
                        Allison's dream was her - side-by-
                        side with the adult.

           EXT. GRAPEFRUIT STAND - DAY

           Eugene and Allison get in the truck and drive off. The 
           grapefruit vendor watches them go.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        For the world who didn't know her, 
                        Allison went on to become a woman 
                        of legend, perfect and inscrutable.

           INT. CHEVY TRUCK - MOMENTS LATER

           Sailing down the road - Allison has her hand out the open 
           window and the wind coming into the truck blows her hair 
           around. Eugene glances at her admiringly.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        But to me she was a human being - 
                        with fears and desires and a 
                        longing for her past, and that's 
                        how I like to remember her.

                                                              LATER:

           The truck idles at a crossroads. Eugene has a road map 
           spread out on the dash. Allison watches as he traces a path 
           of rural roads leading to the Mexican border.

                                 EUGENE
                        If we're gonna bypass the rest of 
                        the main roads, we ought to go 
                        east.

           Allison shakes her head and indicates a small town that 
           Eugene avoided - Round Rock.
                                 ALLISON
                        South. We're making a stop in Round 
                        Rock.

                                 EUGENE
                        Why?

                                 ALLISON
                        To pick up some supplies from some 
                        friends of mine.

           Eugene thinks about this.

                                 EUGENE
                        Round Rock's in the middle of 
                        nowhere. How do you got friends 
                        there?

                                 ALLISON
                        They're part-time nomads... 
                        Sometimes they find themselves in 
                        the middle of nowhere.

           Allison takes the map from him and starts folding it up.

                                 ALLISON
                        So, let's me and you do what nomads 
                        do and move.

           Eugene considers, then shifts the truck into first.

           EXT. TWO-LANE HIGHWAY - DAY

           George's Ford and the other posse truck move along the two-
           lane highway, approaching the Night's Rest Motor Court.

           INT. FORD TRUCK - THAT MOMENT

           George is still behind the wheel. He looks bleary-eyed and 
           exhausted - they've been driving around this part of Texas 
           since last night. Carl dozes in the passenger seat.

           George watches the motor court pass by on the left and then 
           returns his gaze to the road. However, something about the 
           place has piqued his interest.

           He slows and makes a u-turn. Carl jerks awake and looks 
           around, grumbling -

                                 CARL LOMAX
                        Time is it?
           EXT. NIGHT'S REST MOTOR COURT - THAT MOMENT

           The two trucks pull onto the motor court blacktop and come 
           to a stop. George, Carl and Bill step out.

                                 BILL TADE
                        What are we doin' here, George?

           George scans the motor court suspiciously.

                                 GEORGE
                        I don't know.

           Abruptly, he heads into the office. Bill and Carl exchange a 
           look and then follow.

           EXT. TWO-STORY VICTORIAN - DAY

           The stolen Chevy stops across the road from a two-story 
           Victorian house on the outskirts of Round Rock. Rusted-out 
           vehicles and garbage litter the weed-choked front yard.

           On the property behind the house, a vast grapefruit orchard 
           extends, still thriving despite the drought.

           INT. CHEVY TRUCK - THAT MOMENT

           Eugene regards the house uneasily while Allison fixes her 
           hair in the rear-view mirror.

           A WOMAN in her early-30s, wearing a dress and flapper hat, 
           is watching from the window next to the front door. When she 
           sees Eugene looking at her, she disappears inside.

                                 EUGENE
                        You know these friends well?

                                 ALLISON
                        Are you worried about me?

                                 EUGENE
                        Should I be?

                                 ALLISON
                        They're harmless... Just some tired 
                        old hounds.

                                 EUGENE
                        They got money to give you?

                                 ALLISON
                        That's right...
                                 (MORE)
                                 ALLISON (CONT'D)
                            (
                             briefly puckers her lips
                                                    )
                        And some lipstick if I'm lucky.

           Satisfied that she looks acceptable, Allison opens her door 
           and steps out, as does Eugene.

                                 ALLISON
                        Stay in the truck. We don't have 
                        the time.

                                 EUGENE
                        Won't take any longer than you 
                        going in there by yourself. I wanna 
                        meet 'em.

                                 ALLISON
                        Well, who's gonna keep a lookout?

           She meets his suspicious gaze with equanimity. She smiles.

                                 ALLISON
                        I'll be five minutes... Lay on the 
                        horn if things get gloomy.

           She winks and closes her door. Eugene climbs back in the 
           truck and pensively watches her go up to the house.

                                                              LATER:

           Some time has passed. A warbling country tune plays quietly 
           on the radio. Eugene taps on the truck door impatiently.

           The woman in the flapper hat is peering out the window 
           again. Eugene squints, noticing her.

           EXT. TWO-STORY VICTORIAN - THAT MOMENT

           Eugene steps out of the truck. Seeing this, the woman again 
           disappears. He crosses the road to the house.

                                                       MOMENTS LATER:

           He's standing at the front door, having just knocked. It 
           opens to reveal CLAYTON HARVEY, a roughly handsome man with 
           slicked back hair. His fashionable clothes (suit vest over a 
           tailored white shirt) are dirty and sweat-stained.

                                 EUGENE
                        Sorry to bother you, sir. There's a 
                        lady I'm traveling with -
                                 CLAYTON
                        Yeah, she's occupied at the moment. 
                        Whyn't you come in and sit down?

           INT. KITCHEN - TWO-STORY VICTORIAN - MOMENTS LATER

           The home has the shabby quality of a flophouse. Eugene 
           stands at the kitchen window, looking out onto the backyard 
           where Allison is arguing with a MIDDLE-AGED MAN, dressed 
           similarly to Clayton in a suit vest and shirt.

                                 CLAYTON (O.C.)
                        See? Just settling old business. 
                        Nothing to write home about.

           Clayton is pouring himself a cup of coffee. ADELAIDE, the 
           woman in the hat, sits at the kitchen table, smoking and 
           watching Eugene with sphinx-like placidity.

                                 CLAYTON
                            (
                             to Eugene
                                     )
                        You want a cup?

           Eugene shakes his head and sits at the table. He is nervous.

                                 EUGENE
                        So where ya'll from?

           Clayton chuckles phlegmatically. His teeth are badly 
           cigarette-stained.

                                 CLAYTON
                        "Ya'll"... Listen to that. Well, I 
                        know where you're from, Texas.
                            (
                             beat
                                 )
                        Clayton Harvey, pleased to make 
                        your acquaintance.

           Clayton offers his hand. They shake.

                                 CLAYTON

                            (
                                                   )
                        I hail from Chicago and Adelaide's 
                        from K.C., but this is her house.
                             indicating the backyard
                        Teddy out there's from Chi-Town 
                        also. Me and him's been here about 
                        three weeks now, laying low.

           Eugene ponders this, not sure what exactly Clayton means by 
           "laying low". He half-turns and points to the backyard.

                                 EUGENE
                        What are they arguing about?
                                 CLAYTON
                        Don't worry about it, kid... Don't 
                        worry. You're making me nervous. 
                        Let 'em talk it out.
                            (
                             changing the subject
                                                )
                        How old are you? Twenty?

                                 EUGENE
                        Uh, fifteen.

                                 CLAYTON
                        Fifteen? Shit. I'd say you look old 
                        enough to fight a war.

           Clayton polishes his teeth with a finger.

                                 CLAYTON
                        Where you and the girl headed? The 
                        border?

                                 EUGENE
                            (
                             surprised
                                     )
                        She told you?

           Clayton gives him a look -

                                 CLAYTON
                        She didn't tell me a thing, but 
                        where else'd you be going other'n 
                        Canada? She snuffed seven God damn 
                        people and it's all over the 
                        papers...

           Eugene is silent, his confusion growing.

                                 CLAYTON
                        Too bad about Perry Montroy, 
                        though... I kinda liked the guy.
                            (
                             grins
                                 )
                        Are you and her, uh...?

                                 EUGENE
                        Sir, those are lies about her 
                        killing people. They ain't true.

                            (
                             to Adelaide

                        He thinks I'm stupid. He thinks I

                        Kid, we're on your side. Shit... 
                        You don't have to pretend around 
                        us. We know what she's done. Hell, 
                        I saw her kill her first man...

                                 CLAYTON (CONT'D)
                        Some bookie in a basement in 
                        Garfield Park. Bullet to the back 
                        of the head... Establishing her 
                        bona-fides.

           Clayton chuckles, but his smile fades when he realizes that 
           Eugene's fear and confusion are real.

           He looks to Adelaide, who finally speaks, her voice 
           incongruously wizened and tired -

                                 ADELAIDE
                        Clay, Eugene here's a civilian.

           EXT. BACKYARD - THAT MOMENT

           Allison and TEDDY GREENE, the middle-aged man, argue in the 
           backyard. Teddy is pacing:

                                 TEDDY
                        Let me just - I just gotta repeat 
                        this because it's so far-fetched... 
                        Allison Wells is gonna move to 
                        Mexico and go straight... No more 
                        heists, no more business. Just... 
                        Done.

                                 ALLISON
                        That's right.

                                 TEDDY
                        You don't have it in you, sugar. 
                        That ain't who you are.

                                 ALLISON
                        If that's what you think, then you 
                        don't know me at all, Teddy.

                                 TEDDY
                        Please, you're the only broad who 
                        broke my heart... I know you better 
                        than you think I do. This is 
                        another one of your passing 
                        fancies...

           Allison rubs her temples -

                                 ALLISON
                        Can you just tell me straight, 
                        without any more hee-hawing 
                        bullshit? Are you gonna help me or 
                        not?
                                 TEDDY
                        Give me a reason... One good reason 
                        why I should, and I will. But 
                        sentiment ain't a reason.

                                                       MOMENTS LATER:

           Allison is walking up the steps to the kitchen's back door. 
           Teddy watches her go with his arms crossed.

           INT. KITCHEN - TWO-STORY VICTORIAN - CONTINUOUS

           Allison enters to find Clayton hastily loading a revolver 
           from a loose pool of bullets on the table as he shouts in 
           the direction of the open front door, through which Eugene 
           can be seen running across the road. Adelaide is nowhere in 
           sight.

                                 CLAYTON
                        Kid! Kid, don't do nothing stupid!

                                 ALLISON
                        The hell is going on?!

           Clayton whirls around.

                                 CLAYTON
                        Coulda warned us he wasn't in on 
                        it!

                                 ALLISON
                        He came in here? You talked to him?

                                 CLAYTON
                        What do you think?

           Allison stands there in a deep panic, her mind racing. After 
           a beat, she approaches Clayton. He thinks she's coming to 
           stop him from loading the pistol, so he explains himself -

                                 CLAYTON
                        Has to be done, Wells... He'll rat 
                        us out if he gets the chance.

                                 ALLISON
                        Let me do it.

           Clayton stares at her in surprise... He sees something in 
           her face and hands her the revolver.

                                 CLAYTON
                        Kid's on a tear. Better be quick.
           EXT./INT. TWO-STORY VICTORIAN/CHEVY TRUCK - MOMENTS LATER

           Eugene is in the Chevy when Allison runs out of the house. 
           He fires up the engine and shifts into first.

           The truck starts moving as she reaches the driver's side 
           window. She points the gun at him.

                                 ALLISON
                        Let me in!

           He accelerates past her. She aims at the truck and fires, 
           shattering the rear window.

           Eugene ducks, covering his head and taking his foot off the 
           gas, stalling the engine. He slides to the passenger-side 
           door in order to get out on the opposite side from Allison.

           He scrambles to open it... Gets it open... Only to find her 
           standing there, revolver aimed at his chest.

           INT. CHEVY TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

           She pushes in, gun ahead of her. Eugene slides back behind 
           the wheel and Allison slams the passenger door shut.

                                 ALLISON
                        C'mon.

           Eugene doesn't move.

                                 ALLISON
                        Drive!

                                 EUGENE
                        Where?!

           In spite of everything, Allison smiles.

                                 ALLISON
                        Where do you think?

           EXT. TWO-STORY VICTORIAN - THAT MOMENT

           Clayton runs out of the house, followed by Teddy and 
           Adelaide, who is carrying a shotgun. They watch the Chevy 
           disappear down the road.

                                 ADELAIDE
                        Did she do it or not?
                                 CLAYTON
                        Don't matter now.

           Teddy turns and looks down the road behind them. In the 
           distance, two trucks are coming their way - George and his 
           posse. Teddy shakes his head -

                                 TEDDY
                        What a dog of a day...
                             to Clayton
                                      )
                            (
                        Let's go.

           INT. CHEVY TRUCK - THAT MOMENT

           The Chevy speeds through the Grapefruit orchard. Allison 
           opens the glovebox and puts the gun in. She leaves it open.

           Eugene's fury and sense of betrayal are mixed with a deep, 
           gut-level fear. He's crying a little. He wipes his eyes.

                            (
                             off the gun
                                 ALLISON
                                       )
                        This was just for show, Handsome... 
                        I wouldn't hurt you.

           He pulls away when she tries to touch his face. She eyes him 
           for a moment then turns her attention to her leg, hiking up 
           her dress -

           Blood soaks the bandage around her thigh - her gunshot wound 
           has reopened from her sprint. She winces and smooths her 
           dress back down. Finally, Eugene speaks:

                                 EUGENE
                        There ain't any money, is there?

           A long pause from Allison... Perhaps she hoped that this 
           would just blow over. She shakes her head, ashamed.

                                 EUGENE
                        And there sure as hell ain't no 
                        father in Mexico, neither.

                                 ALLISON
                        No, there isn't.

           They ride in silence, Eugene staring in fury out the 
           windshield.

                                 ALLISON
                        Handsome, please... Look at me.
                                 EUGENE
                        Don't call me that no more! That 
                        was your way of stringing me 
                        along...

                                 ALLISON
                        I know...

                                 EUGENE
                        It didn't mean nothing to you.

                                 ALLISON
                        It does now. I swear to God.

                            (
                                 EUGENE
                             shaking his head
                                            )
                        You're a piece of work, you know 
                        that...? You're crazy.

                                 ALLISON
                            (
                             a beat, then:
                                         )
                        That isn't true.

                                 EUGENE
                        It's the only true thing about you.

           Her tears come easily. She looks out the window and tries to 
           hide them, to no avail.

           Eugene has no pity for her... He eyes the revolver in the 
           glovebox. Noticing this, she puts it in her lap and keeps 
           her hand on it. She looks at him with sad eyes -

           FREEZE FRAME on Allison.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        The human tendency to ruminate on 
                        the path not taken is a tantalizing 
                        fantasy, but it makes for a painful 
                        way of going through life. 
                        Nevertheless, I have always been a 
                        man of my vices and I often find 
                        myself thinking back to that day in 
                        the orchard and wondering what 
                        shape my existence would have taken 
                        had I simply stayed in the truck.

           FREEZE FRAME ends.

           SUDDENLY, the truck is skidding to a stop on the dirt road - 
           Eugene has slammed the brakes. Allison is pitched forward 
           and the gun goes flying to the truck's floor.
           Eugene opens his door and jumps out, running full tilt into 
           the orchard.

                                 ALLISON
                        Eugene!

           Allison scrambles for the gun and gets out of the truck.

           EXT. GRAPEFRUIT ORCHARD - CONTINUOUS

           Eugene quickly disappears among the grapefruit trees.

                                 ALLISON
                        Eugene Evans!

           FREEZE FRAME on Allison, in a panic.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        I can't imagine a life more 
                        different.

           FREEZE FRAME ends.

           Allison runs after him. She passes the first line of trees 
           and looks around - he's nowhere in sight, though he can be 
           heard running through the dry grass.

           She keeps going - the orchard has a disorienting geometry, 
           the trees line up and then divide and then line up again.

           She steps on a grapefruit and stumbles, almost falling... 
           Panting, she leans against a tree to catch her breath.

           A moment passes. She looks up at the clear blue sky...

           And then Eugene darts into view. She raises the gun.

                                 ALLISON
                        Stop! I've got a bead on you!

           He stops short and turns. Their eyes meet.

                                 ALLISON
                        You take one more step, I swear to 
                        God, I'll shoot you dead.

                                 EUGENE
                            (
                             a beat, then:
                                         )
                        Just let me go home.

           She points at the watch on his wrist -
                                 ALLISON
                        Do you know what that says on the 
                        back?

                                 EUGENE
                        Yeah.

                                 ALLISON
                        It says "forever".

                                 EUGENE
                        I know... You wrote that for Perry.

                                 ALLISON
                        But then I gave it to you.
                            (
                                 )
                             beat
                        Come to Mexico.

           Eugene shakes his head... Allison moves a few feet closer. 
           He backs up.

                                 ALLISON
                        Please...

                                 EUGENE
                        Allison... I - I know what you 
                        did...

                                 ALLISON
                            (
                             through tears
                                         )
                        But that was the past... And the 
                        past doesn't repeat itself.
                            (
                             beat
                                 )
                        You make me a better person - you 
                        make me good - and if you could 
                        just understand that...

           His expression makes it clear: he's leaving and there's 
           nothing she can do about it except shoot him.

                            (
                             pleading
                                 ALLISON
                                    )
                        What about your father? You're 
                        gonna give up on him, too?

           A long beat from Eugene. He realizes this as it comes out of 
           his mouth:

                                 EUGENE
                        He's dead... He's gone.

           Her face sinks. The fire goes out of her eyes and is 
           replaced by a cold reckoning.
                                 ALLISON
                        How do you know?

                                 EUGENE
                        I just do.
                            (
                                      )
                             backing up
                        Don't shoot me.

           Eugene turns and runs for it. Allison aims the gun with both 
           hands and pulls the trigger.

           EXT. ORCHARD ROAD - DAY

           The posse has finally caught up - their two trucks are 
           parked behind the stolen Chevy.

           Bill and Carl search the Chevy while George scans the 
           orchard for some sign of Allison and Eugene.

           Abruptly, the *crack* of a gunshot echoes from the trees. 
           Startled, the men look in that direction. A flock of birds 
           fly up from the orchard, cawing.

           INT. GRAPEFRUIT ORCHARD - THAT MOMENT

           Eugene lies face down in the grass, unmoving. Allison looks 
           on, trembling, gun still aimed.

                                 ALLISON
                        Get up!
                            (
                             nothing...
                                      )
                        It went wide! Don't pretend.

           Still no movement. Allison notices blood pooling on the 
           ground beneath Eugene's body. She drops the gun and runs to 
           him.

           She kneels next to Eugene and turns him over. He regards her 
           blankly, gasping. He was hit in the right arm - a wound that 
           isn't immediately fatal.

           Her terror turns to joy. She takes his face in her hands -

                                 ALLISON
                        Baby, you're all right. It's 
                        over... It's okay...
                                 )
                            (
                             beat
                        You're gonna be just fine.

           Suddenly - men shouting, coming closer.
           Allison looks up. It's George, Bill and Carl, approaching 
           through the orchard, guns at the ready... Her deliverance.

           She looks back down at Eugene, he's blinking, coming to.

                                 EUGENE
                        It hurts.

           Allison's expression becomes sad - she is lucid now and back 
           in the human realm, and what she has to do is clear.

                                 ALLISON
                        That's a good sign...

           She leans down and kisses him.

           The posse crashes closer. With one last look at Eugene, 
           Allison stands, and runs.

                                 BILL TADE
                        There she is!

                                 GEORGE
                             upon noticing Eugene
                                                )
                            (
                        Oh my God.

           Bill picks up Allison's revolver from where she dropped it 
           and waves it at Eugene.

                                 BILL TADE
                        Son, is this it? Is this all she 
                        had?

           Eugene just blinks, too dazed or in too much pain to answer. 
           George crouches next to him and snaps his fingers.

                                 GEORGE
                        Look at me, look at my eyes. Focus.

           Eugene looks at George and when he does so, the weight of 
           everything that's happened hits him fully -

                             near tears
                                 EUGENE
                                      )
                            (
                        I'm sorry.

                                 GEORGE
                        I know...

                                 BILL TADE
                        George, me and Carl are going 
                        ahead. What about you?
                                 GEORGE
                        Just hold on a minute.

                                 BILL TADE
                        No, sir. She's a slick kitty.

                                 GEORGE
                        She's on foot! Where's she gonna 
                        go?

                                 BILL TADE
                        Well, that's been said before, 
                        Evans...
                            (
                             kneels next to George
                                                 )
                        Listen, me and Carl talked about 
                        this - we can't share the bounty 
                        with you if you ain't there.

                                 GEORGE
                        Come again?

                                 BILL TADE
                        She's likely armed, and you ain't 
                        put yourself through no risk to get 
                        this far... If you ain't gonna 
                        help, by rights it ain't your 
                        bounty.

           George glares in disbelief. Eugene looks between them 
           anxiously.

                                 GEORGE
                        You son of a bitch... You think I'm 
                        just gonna let him bleed out?

                                 BILL TADE
                        He ain't gonna bleed out very quick 
                        from a wound like that. Least 
                        that's the way I see it... Up to 
                        you, Evans.

           Bill stands. A moment passes. George shakes his head.

                                 GEORGE
                        Fuck you, Tade... Both of you.

                                 BILL TADE
                        Suit yourself.

           And with that, Bill and Carl set off. George stares after 
           them, then helps Eugene up.

                                 GEORGE
                        C'mon.
           INT. FORD TRUCK - DAY

           Eugene, pale and spectral, bounces in the passenger seat as 
           George tears down a rural road. Blood soaks the right side 
           of Eugene's shirt.

                                 GEORGE
                        You with me...? Hey!

                                 EUGENE
                        I'm here...

           EXT. SMALL-TOWN HOSPITAL - DAY

           The truck screeches to a halt in front of a one-story, 
           clapboard hospital.

           INT. LOBBY - SMALL-TOWN HOSPITAL - MOMENTS LATER

           George pushes in, carrying Eugene. WE NOTICE, but George 
           does not - Eugene is still wearing the Elgin wristwatch.

                                 GEORGE
                        Help! We need help!

           INT. HALLWAY - SMALL-TOWN HOSPITAL - MOMENTS LATER

           A near-unconscious Eugene is being wheeled away on a gurney 
           by a female NURSE and ORDERLY. (Both of them pushing sixty 
           and semi-unprepared for this emergency.)

           George stands at the hallway doors, receding away from them.

                            (
                             to Eugene
                                 NURSE
                                     )
                        Who is that man?

                                 EUGENE
                        My father.

           INT. WARD - SMALL-TOWN HOSPITAL - DAY

           Perhaps a day later. Eugene is dozing in bed, arm bandaged.

           Two SHERIFF'S DEPUTIES, here to both guard Eugene and 
           prevent him from leaving, sit at a table near the entrance 
           to the ward, reading newspapers.

           George sits at his stepson's bedside, holding the Elgin 
           wristwatch and reading the inscription on back.
           He regards Eugene with curiosity - and perhaps some 
           admiration - then sets the watch on the bedside table.

           EXT. BACK OF SMALL-TOWN HOSPITAL - DAY

           Some days later. Deputies escort Eugene out of a back door, 
           his arm in a sling. George follows, concerned but powerless.

           They walk Eugene to a waiting police car and handcuff him, 
           the cuffs clicking on the wristwatch. They help him get in 
           the backseat and then shut the door.

           Eugene and George exchange a nod through the window and then 
           the car starts moving - lights spinning, but siren off.

           EXT. SMALL-TOWN HOSPITAL - MOMENTS LATER

           The police car pulls around the hospital to get to the road.

           On the hospital's dead lawn, a number of REPORTERS and 
           PHOTOGRAPHERS have assembled, evidently waiting for Eugene.

                                 PHOTOGRAPHER
                        Here he comes!

           The photographers rush over and start snapping photos. 
           Eugene turns away, hiding his face until the car reaches the 
           street and speeds off.

           INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE - CHILDRESS COUNTY COURTHOUSE - DAY

           Eugene, not wearing the wristwatch, sits across from Sheriff 
           Ross at his desk. The sheriff is practically twiddling his 
           thumbs. They've been at this for a while. Finally:

                                 SHERIFF ROSS
                        What was it, son...? Her figure?

           Eugene just stares back at him.

                                 SHERIFF ROSS
                        Was it the way she looked at 
                        you...?
                            (
                             leans in, grinning
                                              )
                        Was it her pussy?

           Eugene says nothing. The sheriff leans back and regains some 
           composure.
                                 SHERIFF ROSS
                        You better think of something 
                        plausible, 'cause so far I don't 
                        trust a God damn word you've been 
                        saying.

                                 EUGENE
                        When can I see my family?

           The sheriff glares.

                                 SHERIFF ROSS
                        You have gotten yourself into an 
                        enormous pile of shit. I'm worried 
                        you don't realize that.

           Abruptly, the door opens and the young, city-boy DISTRICT 
           ATTORNEY enters. He sports a nice suit and a high-status 
           disposition. He sets a thick file folder on the table.

                             getting up
                                 SHERIFF ROSS
                                      )
                            (
                        Mr. D.A.

           They shake hands. The D.A. sits in the sheriff's chair.

                                 DISTRICT ATTORNEY
                            (
                             to the Sheriff
                                          )
                        You can leave us.

                                 SHERIFF ROSS
                        He may be a boy, sir, but he's been 
                        in some pretty rough company.

                                 DISTRICT ATTORNEY
                        Thank you, Ross. I'll holler if I 
                        need you.

           A beat - and then the cowed sheriff leaves his own office. 
           The D.A. takes some papers from the folder and calmly looks 
           them over. Finally, he addresses Eugene:

                                 DISTRICT ATTORNEY
                        I'm just gonna get straight to it, 
                        as I imagine you're worn out... 
                        Son, why did you let this woman 
                        lead you astray?

                                 EUGENE
                        I already gave them my statement, 
                        sir.
                                 DISTRICT ATTORNEY
                        Oh, I've read it. A few times... 
                        It's got everything except why. And 
                        that's what I sincerely would like 
                        to be informed of.

           Eugene shakes his head, deep in thought. Then:

                                 EUGENE
                        I don't know exactly...

                                 DISTRICT ATTORNEY
                        You don't know exactly, or you 
                        don't know at all?

                                 EUGENE
                        I don't know at all.

           The D.A. watches him, deep skepticism evident.

                                 EUGENE
                        It don't make much sense to me 
                        either, sir.

           The D.A. considers this. A moment passes... Finally, he 
           reaches into the folder and produces the Elgin watch. He 
           reads the inscription, allowing himself a slight smile.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        It's been many decades since I've 
                        cracked open the Good Book, but in 
                        '44 I read something in one of 
                        those little army Bibles that's 
                        stuck with me through all the years 
                        since...

           Finally, the D.A. sets the watch on the table. He takes his 
           file folder and, with a nod, leaves the office.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        I can't remember the passage 
                        exactly, but it goes something like 
                        this: "what are our lives? They are 
                        but vapors that appeareth for a 
                        little time and then vanisheth."

           Eugene sits, alone with the watch. The seconds tick by.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        I don't quite know why that 
                        occurred to me just now, but I'm 
                        sure someone could find a reason.

           He takes the watch and puts it in his pocket.
           INT. CHILDRESS COUNTY COURTHOUSE - DAY

           Eugene embraces his mother in the marble courthouse lobby. 
           She is sobbing, overjoyed to see her son alive.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        They let me go with a charge of 
                        mischief and lying to an officer of 
                        the law. It helped that both of the 
                        vehicles I stole were returned to 
                        their owners soon after, if 
                        somewhat the worse for wear.

           The hug ends. Eugene notices Phoebe watching sullenly 
           nearby. Her expression is hurt and disappointed, but when 
           Eugene smiles at her, she can't help but smile back.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        As punishment for my crimes, I was 
                        fined five-hundred dollars.

           EXT. CHILDRESS COUNTY COURTHOUSE - DAY

           Eugene and his family push through the crowd of REPORTERS 
           and PHOTOGRAPHERS on the courthouse steps. An unintelligible 
           jumble of questions are being shouted at him.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        The court of public opinion was 
                        less lenient.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        "Boy-love of the Killer Dame" was 
                        my favorite headline of the many 
                        that were printed. Most others were 
                        not so lyrical.

                        Additionally, Allison's past was 
                        exposed in careless detail.

                        Born "Gretchen Powell", she was the 
                        daughter of an Indiana oil man, the 
                        millionaire Tobin Powell.

                        Her childhood had been a difficult 
                        and unhappy one.

           CLOSE ON Allison's mother - she has sad, haunted eyes.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Her mother died in an asylum when 
                        Allison was ten.

           FLASHBACK: INT. MORGUE - CHILDRESS COUNTY COURTHOUSE - DAY

           Just after Eugene's interrogation - Eugene, his arm 
           bandaged, is ushered past cadaver drawers by the CORONER, 
           Sheriff Ross and a number of deputies.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        And her father, a very particular 
                        and demanding man, had committed 
                        suicide in 1927 with a bullet to 
                        the temple.

                                                       MOMENTS LATER:

           All have assembled around a BODY under a sheet. The coroner 
           lifts the sheet and we see Allison lying on the morgue slab, 
           her face peaceful in death.

           All look to Eugene for a positive ID. He nods, barely 
           holding it together.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        As for Allison herself, -

           FLASHBACK: EXT. GRAPEFRUIT ORCHARD - DAY

           Allison is running, terrified. Her leg has bled all over her 
           light blue, bird-patterned dress.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        - she was cut adrift from our 
                        material world on Monday, August 
                        27th, 1934. Seven days after we 
                        met.
           Behind Allison, Bill Tade stops running and aims his rifle. 
           He pulls the trigger. *CRACK*

           Without a sound, Allison falls - her long hair flying... She 
           lands on her back.

           The exit wound is in the center of her chest and blood flows 
           out freely. She blinks, looking up at the empty blue sky.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Sometimes, when I'm feeling 
                        lonesome, I like to imagine that 
                        she made it to Mexico and nine 
                        months later gave birth to a little 
                        girl in a fishing town on the Gulf.

           Bill and Carl approach, guns raised protectively.

           But Allison is powerless. Both men lower their weapons and 
           regard her with a sort of reverence, aware that they're 
           witness to something beautiful and terrible - the death of a 
           rare bird.

           Allison closes her eyes.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        And I like to imagine that girl, 
                        sixty by now, would be a smart and 
                        lovely human being, and that she 
                        would embody the best aspects of 
                        Allison and myself.

           EXT. EVANS FAMILY PROPERTY - SUNSET (PRESENT)

           Eugene looks over his family's property for the last time - 
           the barn, the farmhouse, the land... The sun sets gloriously 
           over all of it.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Despite what was said about Allison  
                        after she was gone, I do believe 
                        and will maintain that there was 
                        good in her.

           Phoebe walks up and hugs him. They watch the sunset 
           together.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        It may sound like irony to some, 
                        but I can say unequivocally that my 
                        experiences with the so-called 
                        "Killer Dame" made me a better 
                        person, in a number of ways...
           INT. BARN - THAT MOMENT

           Inside the barn during the sunset - pink, orange and purple 
           glow through the gaps in the slats as we PUSH IN on one of 
           the wooden beams holding up the roof.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Not the least of which was coming 
                        to understand the preciousness of 
                        life and the importance of using it 
                        well, before it disappears as 
                        easily as it breezed in.

           We get closer and closer to the beam until we can see 
           something carved into it with the tip of a knife:

                                        AW

           FLASHBACK: EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY

           Earlier that same day - Eugene and his family pack their 
           things onto George's truck.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        As for my family and I, we gave up 
                        the house and moved to Dallas.

           INT. DALLAS GROCERS - DAY (PRESENT)

           A year later - 1935. Wearing an apron, Eugene sweeps the 
           floor of a well-stocked grocery store.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        I took a job and spent the next two 
                        years paying off Childress county, 
                        not to mention my parents for the 
                        recovery of the Fletcher's truck.

           FLASHBACK: EXT. FLETCHER RESIDENCE - DAY

           A few weeks after Eugene's adventure - the Fletchers are 
           finally packing up their Hudson in order to leave Texas.

           They regard Eugene suspiciously as he speaks to Ben in the 
           driveway. Eugene's arm is still in a sling.

                                 EUGENE
                            (
                             to Ben
                                  )
                        California... How do you feel, 
                        Fletcher?
                                 BEN
                        You know, when you took the truck, 
                        I was halfway hoping we'd get to 
                        stay, you wanna hear the truth of 
                        it.

                                 EUGENE
                        Well, I guess maybe I shoulda 
                        wrecked it.

                                 BEN
                            (
                             chuckles, then:
                                           )
                        Yeah, I guess.

           A silence descends... Despite their bonhomie in this moment, 
           their friendship is a shadow of what it was at the beginning 
           of the summer. So they shake, Eugene using his left hand.

                                 EUGENE
                        Been nice knowing you, Fletcher.

                                 BEN
                        'Course it has... Stay in touch.

                                 EUGENE
                        Same to you. Write me a postcard or 
                        something.

                                 BEN
                        Sure. You bet.

                                 EUGENE
                        Like I said, I'm sorry. Wish I 
                        could take back what I did.

                                 BEN
                        Forget it. Everything turned out 
                        peachy in the end, right?

           Eugene smiles, though it is tinged with heartache.

                                 EUGENE
                        Yeah, I guess so.

                                                       MOMENTS LATER:

           Eugene is meandering down the road. He turns and waves, but 
           Ben isn't looking as he heads back to his family. Eugene 
           turns around and continues.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        I never spoke to Ben Fletcher 
                        again.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        I heard through the grapevine that 
                        he joined the navy for the War, 
                        made it through the Pacific theater 
                        and took a job as a taxi dispatcher 
                        in San Francisco. He died in 1981.

           EXT. TEXAS CEMETERY - DAY (PRESENT - 1945)

           A BAPTIST PRIEST reads a eulogy in front of a closed CASKET, 
           upon which is sitting a framed photograph of George as a 
           young deputy. The hills of Texas stretch into the distance.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        George Evans died of a heart attack 
                        at the age of 54, a week before 
                        V.E. Day.

           Eugene, 26 now, sits in the front row, wearing his U.S. Army 
           dress uniform. Pinned on it are Purple Heart, Parachutist 
           Badge and 101st Airborne decorations.

           Sitting next to Eugene are his WIFE (20s) and two young 
           SONS, both toddlers. They are looking up at their father, 
           nearly a stranger to them.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        They delayed his funeral until I 
                        returned, for which I was grateful.

           Phoebe, 19 now, and Olivia, 48, are also in the front row. 
           Olivia is bereft, but Phoebe has only toughened as she's 
           grown older, and she holds her mother up with dignity.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        After the events of the summer of 
                        '34, George and I had finally 
                        reached an equilibrium... I 
                        considered him my father and he 
                        considered me his son.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           Olivia, 72 now, lies in a hospital bed. Eugene, 50, and 
           Phoebe, 43, sit at her bedside. 

           Eugene holds his mother's hand as they talk - inaudibly to 
           us, though their expressions communicate the fact that the 
           subject of discussion is something heavy and difficult.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        It took much longer for my mother 
                        and I to reach that same balance.
           Their conversation fades in. Olivia is addressing her son -

                                 OLIVIA
                        It's okay... I want you to know: 
                        it's okay what you did...
                            (
                             beat
                                 )
                        I've forgiven you.

           Eugene nods, accepting it and fighting for composure. His 
           mother smiles sadly at him.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Olivia passed away in 1969, having 
                        lived long enough to see men land 
                        on the moon and her grandsons turn 
                        into dope-smoking hippies.

           EXT. PENNSYLVANIA AVENUE - WASHINGTON D.C. - DAY

           Eugene, 50, in his U.S. Army dress uniform, marches with 
           thousands of ANTI-WAR DEMONSTRATORS down Washington D.C.'s 
           Pennsylvania Ave, toward the WHITE HOUSE.

           He is linked arm-in-arm with his SONS - hippies in their 20s 
           who bear a distinct resemblance to their father. The three 
           of them CHANT as they march down the avenue.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        In a surprise to everyone in my 
                        family, but most-especially to my 
                        sons, who I had thought knew me 
                        better, I marched with them against 
                        the War in Vietnam.

           INSERT - A photo of Eugene (65 here), his wife, sons, two 
           DAUGHTER-IN-LAWS, and GRANDCHILDREN, taken in the mid-'80s 
           at a barbecue in a Texas park. Eugene is smiling proudly.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Eventually, of course, they grew 
                        up... They cut their hair, got jobs 
                        and raised children of their own. 
                        Now, they're far more sedate and 
                        conservative than I ever was, which 
                        I find quite amusing.

           CLOSE ON Phoebe, at the barbecue as well, beautiful in her 
           late-50s. Her arm is around a MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN.
                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Phoebe stayed Phoebe. Afflicted 
                        with wanderlust, she traveled 
                        widely in the late '40s and the 
                        '50s, eventually settling back in 
                        Texas to teach grade school. She 
                        never married, and that's all I'll 
                        say about that.

                        Anyway, time performed its parlor 
                        trick and made the years disappear.

           EXT. MEXICAN AIRPORT TERMINAL - DAY

           EUGENE EVANS, mid-70s now, white-haired and rangy, exits the 
           terminal with a backpack and small suitcase. He's wearing a 
           101st Airborne baseball cap. He hails a taxi.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        And in 1995, I finally made it to 
                        Mexico.

           EXT. BEACHSIDE CEMETERY - SUNSET

           Eugene stands at a gravestone in a Mexican cemetery with a 
           beautiful view of the Gulf. The sun sets behind him.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        This is a place of ghosts... 
                        Benevolent ones, but ghosts all the 
                        same...

           The weathered gravestone says:

                                    John Baker
                                    1889-1929
                                     Q.E.P.D.

           Eugene kneels with some difficulty and touches the inscribed 
           words - as if by doing so they could tell him something.

           EXT. BEACH - DUSK

           He walks along the beach.
                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        I'm looking forward to coming home.

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Eugene sits at the desk and writes in a SPIRAL NOTEBOOK - 
           the same one we saw near the beginning of the film, though 
           at this point it is new.

           Through the window, we can hear waves crashing on a nearby 
           beach and the murmur of voices from beachside cantinas.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        One last thing: I'd like to 
                        dedicate this account to Phoebe. 
                        While I initially did not believe 
                        my sister's claim that it would 
                        make me lighter to write it, I have 
                        to admit that perhaps it has...

           Eugene sets down his pen and scrutinizes what he's written. 
           He closes the notebook and looks out the window.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Perhaps it has.

           MEANWHILE, the Elgin watch is still on Eugene's wrist. 
           Tick - Tick - Ticking away...

                                                        WE'LL MEET AGAIN,
                                                        DON'T KNOW WHERE,
                                                         DON'T KNOW WHEN,
                                             BUT I KNOW WE'LL MEET AGAIN,
                                                         SOME SUNNY DAY.
