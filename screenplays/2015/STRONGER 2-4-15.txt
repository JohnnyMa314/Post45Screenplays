                                 Based on the book 
                            By Jeff Bauman and Jeff Winter
           INT. COSTCO - DELI SECTION - NASHUA NEW HAMPSHIRE - DAY

           JEFF BAUMAN is an affable, aimless 27 year old guy with hair 
           bristling outta his hairnet, shirt half untucked, sly 
           sideways grin permanently affixed to his face.  He’s in the 
           middle of preparing a row of naked, raw chickens to be 
           “chucked” into the roaster on spits... 

           He’s talking to MAYA, his supervisor, Costco lifer in her 
           early forties. 

                                 MAYA
                        Ya wanna drag race me?  In ya 1998 
                        Honda Accord?

                                 JEFF
                        She’s faster’n she looks.

                                 MAYA
                        Ya second gear don’t even work!

                                 JEFF
                        Who needs second gear?  I put 89 
                        octane fuel in that baby.  It ain’t 
                        premium, I mean a boy’s gotta eat, 
                        but I got that Tokyo Drift shit 
                        going big time.

                                 MAYA
                        I’m not racing my Dodge fucking 
                        Caravan!  It shakes I go over 
                        fifty.

                                 JEFF
                        If you got an X5 like I told ya to, 
                        you wouldn’ta had that problem.

                                 MAYA
                        Maybe I win Megabucks I’ll buy us 
                        both one.  Fix ya hair.  Kevy’s 
                        walking over.

           Jeff jams his hair into the net as KEVIN “HEAVY KEVY” HORST 
           walks up... he’s late forties looks ten years younger... 
           super put together, Type A manager of the whole store. 

                                 JEFF
                        Heavy Kevy!

                                 KEVIN
                        Low on roasters again, Jeff. 
                                 JEFF
                        Don’t blame me, sir.  Blame the 
                        Sox. If I’m not at the Brickhouse 
                        with a beer in my hand and two in 
                        my guts by the fifth inning, 
                        there’s just no way they’re gonna 
                        win.  Call it superstition but it’s 
                        scientifically proven. Tell him 
                        Maya.

                                 MAYA
                        I tole him, he wants to ever get 
                        promoted outta tossin’ chickens, 
                        he’s gotta apply himself.

                                 JEFF
                        To which I say that I am down with 
                        chickens.  I’m not, like, sexually 
                        attracted to them.  But the lack of 
                        responsibility chickens afford give 
                        me the ability to leave eighteen 
                        minutes early on game day.  Right?

           He looks at the clock.

                                 KEVIN
                        Fine.  Go.

                                 JEFF
                        You rock, Heavy Kevy!

           EXT. COSTCO PARKING LOT - MINUTES LATER

           Jeff sprints into his beat-ass 1998 Honda Accord and on the 
           third try... engine SPARKS TO LIFE.  He grinds the manual 
           transmission as he tears out... changing out of his Costco 
           uniform and into civvies as skips second gear and dials his 
           phone.  

                                 PHONE (ON SPEAKER)
                             (in a loud bar)
                        Where the fuck are ya?

                                 JEFF
                        I’m on my way!  You guys fucked up 
                        yet?  

           EXT. BRICKHOUSE SPORTS BAR - CHELMSFORD MASS - DAY

           A large dirt parking lot nestled in the middle of Chelmsford 
           center... 
           mostly pickups and SUVs among some Corvettes and Camaros 
           (middle aged Townies who “made it” by local standards) and a 
           shitload of Harleys. 

           Constant flow of locals in and out... two women stand in the 
           smoking area out front, dragging on their Marlboro 47s.  

           Patty JOYCE is Jeff’s mother, tough, gravelly-voiced, eyes 
           that bore into you... her fierce tongue guards a tender, 
           wounded heart.  Beside her is her sparring partner-- AUNT 
           JEN, pretty, and equally fierce, fifteen years younger.  

                                 AUNT JEN
                        I told Dale, I says put down the 
                        fucking remote and be a father for 
                        half an hour.  Ya son needs a 
                        goddamned role model so’s he don’t 
                        end up fucked up like you. 

                                 PATTY
                        Why you gotta push his buttons like 
                        that?

                                 AUNT JEN
                        I don’t know.  It’s fun. His face, 
                        though?  I swear, one of these days 
                        he’s gonna snap and take swing at 
                        me. 

                                 PATTY
                        He touches one hair on your head, 
                        I’ll cut his throat while he 
                        sleeps.  Nobody messes with my 
                        fucking family.  I’m serious.  

                                 AUNT JEN
                        Oh, I know you are.  

                                 PATTY
                        Look who’s here!

           Jeff walks up, gets sloppy drunken kisses on his cheeks.

                                 JEFF
                        He ma.  Hey Aunt Jen.

                                 PATTY
                        I thought you was working?

                                 JEFF
                        They lemme out early.

                                 PATTY
                        ‘Cause ya such a good worker.
                                 AUNT JEN
                        G’head in.  The idiots have a 
                        table.

           The women flick their cigarettes and all three walk into the 
           place.  

           INT. BRICKHOUSE SPORTS BAR - SAME

           Place is fucking hoppin’.  Red Sox game packs in sunburnt 
           locals who’ve been drinking since noon.  Guys with tank tops 
           and beards, Townie gals with too many tattoos, their kids 
           coloring at tables surrounded by empty beer bottles.

           Walls covered in sports memorabilia, photos and posters cram 
           around the Lottery and Keno machines, detailing the past 100 
           years of local sports... Bob Cousy to Cam Neely to Larry 
           Bird... LEGENDS and HEROES in every New Englander’s heart.

           Jeff helps his mother up on her stool at the bar where their 
           two white wines have napkins on the top, reserving their 
           seats.  Patty is drunker than she looks, slips off the stool 
           and Jeff grabs her. 

                                 JEFF
                        You wanna maybe sit on a lower 
                        chair?  That fall’s a doozy.

                                 PATTY
                        Go fuck yerself, sweetie.

           Jeff moves into the jam of people toward a table in the 
           back... there, engrossed in the game, three empty pitchers 
           and one half filled with Blue Moon in between them, sits:

           UNCLE BOB, financial rock of the family, late fifties... big 
           drinker and master wise ass... 

           BIG D, mid twenties, Jeff’s cousin, big shouldered dude, went 
           to college on baseball scholarship that fizzled when he got 
           injured... 

           SULLY, mid twenties, sweet good natured Townie with a nice 
           smile and skin speckled with paint...

                                 BIG D
                        What the fuck you talking about?  
                        Saltalamacchia is, like, wicked 
                        older’n me.
                                 SULLY
                        You just think that because he 
                        accomplished so much more’n less 
                        years.

                                 BIG D
                        Fuck you, I’m Googling it.

                                 SULLY
                        And what the fuck is “wicked 
                        older?”  He’s maybe two years 
                        older, tops.

           Holds up phone, fingers flecked with tar.

                                 BIG D
                        He’s 27.

                                 SULLY
                        So ya got one fucking year to stop 
                        paving roads, heal ya shoulder and 
                        go pro.

                                 UNCLE BOB
                        I got ten grand says that ain’t 
                        happening.

                                 SULLY
                        I got eighty three bucks and fifty 
                        five cents on that too.

                                 BIG D
                        Fuck you guys.

                                 UNCLE BOB
                        Who give a shit how old ya are?  
                        I’m older than every one of those 
                        pricks.  And I got bigger balls’n 
                        any of ‘em.

                                 BIG D
                        Bigger or, like, they hang lower?

                                 SULLY
                        Your age, a little sag is expected.

                                 UNCLE BOB
                        All I know is each morning I put 
                        one testicle in the left sock, one 
                        testicle in the right.  Balances me 
                        out.

           They’re laughing their asses off when Jeff walks up.
                                 UNCLE BOB (CONT’D)
                        Here he is, my favorite 
                        underachiever.  You smell like 
                        fucking chicken carcasses.  Sully, 
                        pour him a Blue Moon...

                                 SULLY
                        Here ya go.

           Jeff guzzles half before he sits down.  

                                 JEFF
                        What’d I miss?

           Just then, SOX SCORE and the place goes FUCKING BALLISTIC!  
           Everyone cheering, hugging, spilling beer... chaos!  Somebody 
           hands Jeff a shot of whisky, he downs it... 

           Across the bar, the doors open and ERIN HURLEY steps in 
           quietly... mid twenties, fresh-faced, pretty gal next door 
           look... wearing Brigham Young Boston Marathon sweatshirt, 
           carrying a 2013 DONATIONS BUCKET.  Beside her is GAIL HURLEY, 
           her no-bullshit sister... a little older, prettiest 
           physician’s assistant you’ll find... 

           Erin bellies up to the bar, not uncomfortable in the chaos, 
           but def not her plan to party today.  She’s waiting for the 
           bartender... looking around...

           Jeff spots her and he just freezes there.  Like there’s 
           nothing on the planet right now but this girl.  Big D 
           notices...

                                 UNCLE BOB
                        That the college girl who dumped 
                        you for being a loser?

                                 JEFF
                        Yeah.

                                 UNCLE BOB
                        Too bad.  She’s cute.

                                 JEFF
                        Sully, since you’re the only one a 
                        this table who has seen a pair a 
                        tits in the last year without 
                        paying a cover charge... how do I 
                        get her back?

                                 SULLY
                        She’s not my usual quarry, ya know?  
                        I like ‘em a little dumber.
                                 JEFF
                        That girl is my destiny.

                                 BIG D
                        That’s so gay.

                                 SULLY
                        My advice?  Pretend you’re someone 
                        else.

                                 JEFF
                        I’m fucking serious here.

                                 SULLY
                        So am I.  She didn’t break up with 
                        you because she likes who you are, 
                        bro.  Think about it.

                                 JEFF
                        So, like, act like somebody I’m 
                        not?

                                 SULLY
                        We’ve been over this.  She don’t 
                        like you.

                                 JEFF
                        Okay.

           Jeff gets up from the table.  

                                 UNCLE BOB
                        Wait.  Drink this.

           Uncle Bob hands him a beer... as Jeff guzzles, he tucks in 
           Jeff’s shirt, fixes his hair a bit, straightens his collar.

                                 UNCLE BOB (CONT’D)
                        Nobody wants to fuck a guy with 
                        chicken in his hair!

           He pushes him in the right direction.  Jeff walks across the 
           bar... Patty and Aunt Jen follow his gaze and see Erin and 
           Gail.  

                                 PATTY
                        That’s the gal who broke Jeffrey’s 
                        fucking heart right there.

                                 AUNT JEN
                        The skinny bitch?

                                 PATTY
                        My baby cried for a week.
                                 AUNT JEN
                        I got my Spyderco in my purse.  
                        Want me to stab her in the face?

                                 PATTY
                        Not yet.  Jeffrey!  Come here!

           Jeff walks up to her, eyes on Erin.

                                 PATTY (CONT’D)
                        Sweetie, let it go.  Ya too good 
                        for her.  

                                 AUNT JEN
                        She don’t want a guy who works at 
                        Costco?  Fuck her!

                                 JEFF
                        It’s not like that.

           Aunt Jen hands him a shot of Jager.

                                 AUNT JEN
                        Liquid courage.

           He downs it, moves past a group of people and stands in front 
           of her.  Gail is the first to notice, gives her sister a 
           slight tap.

                                 JEFF
                        Hey, E.

                                 ERIN
                        Jeff. I’m sorry.  

                                 JEFF
                        Fa what?

                                 ERIN
                        Wasn’t fair of me to come by 
                        unannounced... 

                                 JEFF
                        I’m glad you stopped by.  I been 
                        meaning to talk to ya about 
                        something.

                                 ERIN
                        Yeah? 

                                 JEFF
                        About how I’m, like, a wicked 
                        different person since we broke up 
                        last month.
                                 GAIL
                        Really?  Because you’re drunk at 
                        five o’clock on a Sunday?

                                 JEFF
                        Sox are playing!  

                                 GAIL
                        Did you move out of your mother’s 
                        apartment?

                                 ERIN
                        Gail, knock it off.

                                 JEFF
                        Ya know, I haven’t gotten around to 
                        that, Gail.  But it’s on my list. 
                             (to Erin)
                        I’m thinking a applying to the 
                        DeVry Institute because, you know, 
                        the people in those commercials 
                        seem really special and I’d like to 
                        hang out with them.  

           Erin cracks a smile.

                                 GAIL
                        Don’t laugh at him.  That’s his 
                        hook.

                                 JEFF
                        What “hook?”

                                 GAIL
                        How you pull her in.  She laughs 
                        and it distracts her from all the 
                        other shit.

                                 JEFF
                        Can we all just sit down for a 
                        second and chat about how different 
                        I am from the old Jeff?  

                                 ERIN
                        I never wanted you to be different.  
                        I just got tired of you saying 
                        you’d do something and then not do 
                        it.   

                                 JEFF
                        Can ya elaborate?
                                 GAIL
                        How about the time Erin picked you 
                        up to go to a tour of UMass Lowell 
                        and you were sitting here, watching 
                        fucking baseball and drinking 
                        yourself to oblivion.

                                 JEFF
                        What do you got against the Red 
                        Sox!  

                                 GAIL
                        That scenario happened not once, 
                        not twice, but three times, Jeff.  

                                 ERIN
                        I gotta go.  I’m sorry. 

           Gail pulls her out of there... Jeff just watches... heart 
           breaking.  He turns to look over his shoulder and notices ALL 
           HIS FAMILY AND FRIENDS WATCHING.  

                                 JEFF
                        All part a the plan!

           EXT. BRICKHOUSE SPORTS BAR - PARKING LOT

           Erin and Gail walk toward the parking lot... Jeff starts 
           running, then it hits him... he leans over the railing and 
           PUKES out the Jager.

                                 JEFF
                        Fucking Jager...

           He wipes his chin with his sleeve, catches up with them 
           getting in the car.

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        You’re running the marathon, right?

                                 GAIL
                        So what?

                                 JEFF
                        I’m gonna be there at the finish 
                        line, Erin.  I mean it.  Old Jeff 
                        mighta said he was gonna go and 
                        then not show up, but this is the 
                        New, Different... improved Jeff.  
                        So look for me, okay!

           They get in the car, shut the doors.
                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        Gonna make a big ass sign!  
                        Glitter, markers!  3-D block 
                        letters!  No 2-D for Erin Hurley.  
                        No fucking way!  

           The car starts pulling out... he chases it...

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        But ya gotta do me a favor!  If I’m 
                        getting up early on my day off, ya 
                        gotta win the race, okay!  The 
                        whole thing.  Win it!

           Erin in the passenger seat, she can’t help but light up with 
           laughter... until she sees Gail and her face goes straight.

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        WIN IT FOR ME!

           He watches the car head off, rubs his sore elbow where he 
           landed.

           EXT. BOSTON MARATHON - FINISH LINE - DAY - APRIL 15, 2013

           A HAND holds a BIC PEN and applies the final touches to a 
           posterboard that reads “RUN ERIN RUN!” In 3D block letters.  

           Jeff stands on the Boyleston Street sidewalk near the finish 
           line... 10,000 spectators are clogging the sidewalk... 
           families cheering... runners pushing it past the finish 
           line... 

           Jeff scans the runners... sees someone... holds up the 
           sign... it’s not her... he lowers it.

           He looks around, takes the day in... hard not to swell with 
           pride on this fine Boston day... 

           A little BLONDE 8 YEAR OLD BOY with a RED SOX HAT stands 
           nearby, he drops his tiny American Flag.  Jeff picks it up 
           for him, hands it to him and when he stands back up, a BIG 
           GUY in mirrored aviators, light beard, black hoodie and 
           Jansport backpack BUMPS into him.

           Jeff turns and the guy stands there for a moment... locking 
           his gaze... It’s a weird moment... the guy is totally out of 
           place with the cheering crowd... Jeff, not being a sociopath, 
           turns away... weirded out... 

           He tries to shake it off, can’t... looks back... the Big Guy 
           is gone but his BACKPACK is on the ground about ten feet 
           away.   
           Jeff focuses on that backpack... should he say something? He 
           looks around for the guy... but the crowd SURGES in cheering 
           as a RUNNER in his fifties, tapping into inhuman reserves to 
           finish, pushes himself solely on the crowd’s energy...

           Jeff takes his eyes off the bag... sees the runner...  he 
           starts CHEERING for this heroic display... when suddenly...

           POP.

           The explosion isn’t as loud as you’d think.  But the 
           CONCUSSIVE POP is like a TIDAL WAVE blasting the crowd --men, 
           women, children-- are BLASTED BACK and into the air as a 
           cloud of fire BURPS into the sky.  

           Jeff finds himself TEN FEET IN THE AIR.  He FREEZES there for 
           a moment before PLUMMETING DOWN.  

           He SLAMS onto his back... EARS RINGING... eyebrows and hair 
           SMOKING... meaty “things” are slapping against the ground all 
           around him like some kind of horrific rain shower... smoke 
           clogs the eyes and the nose... coughing... we realize these 
           “things” are body parts... hands... legs... feet... God knows 
           what...

           Jeff turns his head and sees the lifeless eyes of the YOUNG 
           WOMAN lying beside him... staring at him... her body just 
           GONE beneath her pelvis... there is the small boy he handed 
           the flag to, bent at a strange angle... he has to look 
           away...

           Then the SCREAMING begins... all around him...

           He cranes his head down and sees that his legs are PUDDLES of 
           GORE beneath the knees... impossibly red femoral blood pulses 
           out of him... 

           ANOTHER BOMB POPS DOWN THE STREET... those with intact limbs 
           RUN FOR THEIR LIVES as chaos takes over...

           Jeff sees his cell phone and reaches for it... just out of 
           reach...

           ALAN PAINTER, a surgeon in his late forties-- the first of 
           many heroes in this story-- pushes through the screaming and 
           kneels in front of Jeff...

                                 PAINTER
                        BELTS!  I NEED BELTS!

           Strangers stop in their tracks, pull out their belts and hand 
           it to him... he TIGHTENS them over Jeff’s pulsing knees... he 
           uses Jeff’s blood to write a “C” on his head... 
           and then Painter is on his feet to the next victim, shouting 
           out to whomever will listen:

                                 PAINTER (CONT’D)
                        YOUR BELTS!  GIVE ME YOUR BELTS!

           Jeff looks down at his destroyed legs... the belts slow the 
           blood but puddle of red is still blooming out and right now 
           maybe we’re thinking... just how much blood does the human 
           body have?

           He puts his head down... almost peaceful as he looks up at 
           the blue sky with SMOKE spiraling overhead... his ears are 
           RINGING... his breath slowing... he closes his eyes... 
           listens to his heart beat...

           Suddenly, his eyes dart open and he panics.

                                 JEFF
                        HELP ME!  SOMEBODY HELP ME PLEASE!  
                        I’M DYING!

           But his voice is barely a whisper amidst the smoke and 
           screaming and chaos... 

           And then... a large man in a COWBOY HAT steps over the 
           scattered barriers... a Costa Rican man in his 50’s named 
           CARLOS ARRENDONDO... leans over Jeff and HEAVES him over his 
           shoulder... takes a few steps and EASES him into one of the 
           several wheelchairs sitting there for runners who collapse...

           Carlos PUSHES the chair through the madness... we see Jeff’s 
           legs clearly... charred stump of a right thigh, tibia of the 
           left leg raw like a skeleton, strips of flesh hanging down... 

           Carlos tightens the belts on the stumps as he runs towards 
           the ambulance idling at the finish line... 

           They reach a clearing in the smoke and an AP photographer 
           named CHARLES KRUPA, standing in the street with blood 
           speckled clothes and face, sees Carlos and Jeff and takes a 
           knee and SNAPS off a picture.

           The moment FREEZES and we see the ICONIC PHOTO... Jeff, ashen 
           face, legs a horrific mess, Carlos with his cowboy hat, 
           heroic and determined... frozen in the chaos...

           But, though the image freezes, we still hear the SCREAMING...

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. AMBULANCE - MOVING

           Paramedics frantically apply ratchet tourniquets on his 
           bloody stumps, barking orders to each other as the diesel 
           engine ROARS out of Copley Square.

           Jeff, eyes half open, life sapping out of him, reaches out 
           weakly to speak:

                                 JEFF
                        I saw who did this... I saw who-

           But they cover his face with an oxygen mask.  His vitals 
           FLATLINE...

                                 PARAMEDIC
                        We’re losing him!

           They go to work trying to resuscitate him as they TEAR down 
           the street.

           EXT. BOYLESTON STREET - BLOCKS FROM FINISH - SAME

           Erin Hurley is running with pain in her leg... pushing 
           onward... all around her cheers of support... passes the MILE 
           22 marker... 

           Then she notices something peculiar... the runners in front 
           of her are SLOWING THEIR PACE... bumping into each other, 
           some falling to their knees... 

           Erin slows and begins to panic as runners PILE UP behind 
           her... it’s getting tight...

           She hears SCREAMING UP AHEAD... and then something INSANE 
           happens... runners begin to run TOWARD HER...

                                 RUNNER
                        OUT OF THE WAY!  THEY’RE BOMBING 
                        US!

           A panicked runner KNOCKS her over... sneakered feet are about 
           to TRAMPLE HER when a strong hand grabs her and pulls her to 
           her feet... she doesn’t even see who... pushes her to the 
           curb out of the way... just one of the many, faceless HEROES 
           that day...

           A terrified woman with a crying baby in a Bjorn is hiding 
           behind a wall... Erin grabs her by the arm.

                                 ERIN
                        What’s happening?
                                 WOMAN
                        Terrorists are blowing up the 
                        finish line!  Gotta get the fuck 
                        outta here!

           The woman flees.  Erin hobbles on top of a postal box to see 
           above the mass of panicking people... she sees a faint plume 
           of smoke on the horizon...

           INT. COSTCO CONFERENCE ROOM - SAME

           Kevin Horst leans back in his chair as a few other 
           supervisors lean in on the conference call.

                                 KEVIN
                        We’re actually pretty surprised at 
                        how well the mixer is selling, Jim.  
                        I mean, you should see the demo.  
                        You’d think it was Cirque De Soleil 
                        with the crowd she gets...

           Maya barges in, tears streaming down her face.

                                 KEVIN (CONT’D)
                        What happened?  

           She THRUSTS her smartphone in front of his face and he sees 
           Jeff’s UNCROPPED AP PHOTO. 

           INT. KEVIN’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Maya sits there, sobbing as they watch the news on his 
           computer, Kevin pulls out Jeff’s emergency contact sheet... 
           finds the names scrawled in Jeff’s messy handwriting...

                                 MAYA
                        Don’t call his dad.  They’re not 
                        that close...

                                 KEVIN
                        Patty Joyce is his mother?

                                 MAYA
                        Yeah.  Call her at the work number.  
                        Oh god, oh Jesus...

           Dials... pacing...

                                 KEVIN
                        Hi, could I speak to Patty Joyce 
                        please?  I’m afraid this is an 
                        emergency.  Thank you.

                        They’re getting her.
                             (into phone)
                        Hi, Patty Joyce?  This is Kevin 
                        Horst, Jeff’s manager at Costco.  

           INT. RESTAURANT - MOMENTS LATER

           We see Patty dressed in her work uniform, her eyes glaze as 
           she hears what Kevin’s telling her... she is nodding... 
           nodding... she FAINTS onto the carpeted floor... coworkers 
           run to her...

           EXT. NEW ENGLAND HIGHWAY - SAME

           Big D is shoveling steaming hot black ASPHALT MIX out of the 
           back of a road truck, spreading it over over the top of a 
           fresh road when his phone DINGS.  Then DINGS.  Then DINGS.

                                 BIG D
                        What the fuck?

           He pulls out his iPhone... the text reads HE’S HURT BAD and 
           he clicks the attachment and the photo loads and Big D 
           staggers...

                                 BIG D (CONT’D)
                        Oh fuck... oh no...

           Big D takes a few steps and the phone drops and, light-
           headed, he collapses to his knees...

                                 BIG D (CONT’D)
                        UNCLE BOB! 

           Uncle Bob climbs out of a truck... runs to him...

           EXT. COMMERCIAL BUILDING - LOWELL, MA - SAME

           Sully in paint-spattered coveralls, applying KILLZ to an 
           exterior wall... his phone BUZZES and he opens it... sees the 
           pic.  Puts it back in his pocket. Takes him a few brushes of 
           paint until he processes what he has seen.  Then he calmly 
           takes his coveralls off, turns to his foreman.

                                 SULLY
                        I need to use your truck, Frank.
           EXT. AUNT JEN’S HOUSE - CHELMSFORD, MA - SAME

           Aunt Jen on her cell phone, rushes out on the porch throwing 
           her jacket on... she lights a cigarette with SHAKING HANDS 
           and gets into her Ford F150.  ROARS outta there.

           INT. BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER WAITING ROOM - DAY

           A VORTEX OF ANXIETY as dozens of TERRIFIED FAMILIES cram in 
           there, each clustered in their own private hell... cell 
           phones RINGING, chatter, crying, whimpering, consoling... 

           FBI AGENTS with dark blue jackets with big yellow letters 
           stalk in and out... a CHAPLAIN paces with her hands behind 
           her back, she is weeping and smiling at the same time... 

           Doctors and Nurses, their scrubs SPATTERED IN BLOOD, sprint 
           in and out like exhausted pit crew workers... a nurse 
           absently leaves a BLOODY HANDPRINT on the wall as she 
           passes...

           Jeff’s family takes a corner... Big D, Sully, Patty, Aunt 
           Jen, Uncle Bob plus some new faces... AUNT KAREN, late 
           fifties, Big D’s mother who lost her voice from cancer and 
           has a permanent hole in her throat... Jen’s husband DALE, 
           disheveled and still dressed like he’s in the 90’s... 

           Uncle Bob is red-faced and pacing, trying to keep it 
           contained... Sully sits there in a daze, bouncing his leg... 
           Big D punches the wall, crying... everyone else gathered 
           around Patty who is in a state of shock...

           Karen leans over, covers her throat with her hand to muster 
           the air needed to whisper...

                                 AUNT KAREN
                        They woulda tole you if he was 
                        dead, Patty.  

                                 PATTY
                        How the fuck do you know that!

                             (offended)
                        I spent my fair share a time in a 
                        goddamn hospital!

                                 PATTY
                        This ain’t about you!

                                 AUNT KAREN
                        I’m not saying it is!  Jesus!
                                 UNCLE BOB
                        Calm down you two!  They could be 
                        calling our name we won’t hear it!

           A man steps into the waiting room... waves of coiled anxiety 
           just fucking emanate from this guy... moustache, mechanic’s 
           shirt, strong dirty hands... this is BIG JEFF. 

                                 BIG JEFF
                        Where’s my son, goddammit!  
                        Somebody tell me what fucking 
                        happened!

           He scares the people around him... Patti sees him, her crying 
           turns to something sharper...

                                 PATTI
                        Keep that prick away from me.

           Too late... Big Jeff sees her.  Bounds over.

                                 BIG JEFF
                        What happened to Jeff?

                                 UNCLE BOB
                        Calm down, Big Jeff.  

                                 BIG JEFF
                        Don’t tell me what to do!  What’s 
                        going on with my fucking son!

                        We don’t know yet!  You see the 
                        picture?

                                 BIG JEFF
                        I did!  Goddammit!  I did!

                                 UNCLE BOB
                        Then you know much as we do!  

                                 BIG JEFF
                        Don’t tell me what to fucking do, 
                        Bob!

                        You two shut the FUCK UP!
                             (has heard the nurse 
                              announce Jeff’s name)
                        We’re with Jeff Bauman!  Right 
                        here!  We’re his family!
           INT. HOLDING ROOM - SAME

           The nurse ushers Jeff’s group into the room... waiting there, 
           exhausted and spattered with blood, is the well-groomed and 
           demure Vascular Surgeon DR JEFFREY KALISH, wiping the sweat 
           off his glasses... 

                                 PATTY
                        Is he alive!  Is my son alive?

                                 DR KALISH
                        He is alive.  But your son has 
                        suffered a catastrophic injury.  
                        There’s swelling of the organs and 
                        we won’t know the extent of the--

                                 BIG JEFF
                        What about his legs?  We saw the 
                        picture!

                                 DR KALISH
                        He underwent a double above-the-
                        knee amputation.

                                 UNCLE BOB
                        Both legs?

                                 BIG JEFF
                        You shoulda called me before you 
                        did that!  

                                 DR KALISH
                        We saved his life by amputating.  

                                 BIG JEFF
                        You better got proof for that or 
                        I’m suing your ass!

                                 AUNT JEN
                        Will you fucking stop already!

                                 DR KALISH
                        If you insist on suing us while we 
                        treat your son, go to the first 
                        floor and speak to office 
                        administration and they will direct 
                        you to the hospital’s attorney. 
                        Meanwhile, you’ll have to excuse 
                        me, I have thirty two patients to 
                        tend to.  Many with ball bearings 
                        and nails still inside their 
                        wounds.  

           He walks out.  Big Jeff watches him, he’s falling apart.
                                 BIG JEFF
                        I mean, what else he gonna say, 
                        right?

                                 PATTY
                        You pull it together or I’ll 
                        fucking KILL YA!  

           She lunges at him, everyone holds her back.  

           IN THE LOBBY.

           Amidst the wailing, sobbing families... Erin limps in, still 
           in Marathon gear... she moves through them... passes the 
           nurse station, which is so chaotic they don’t even notice her 
           walk by... dreamlike past the rooms of the injured... she 
           looks into them as she passes...

           ...a nine year old with a bloody gauze on her face... a man 
           in his sixties on a breathing machine, his footless leg held 
           up... room after room of bloody, maimed, crying people and 
           their families...

           ... finds the ICU section and peaks through a glass window 
           and what she sees takes the strength out of her legs...

           ...there on the bed... unconscious... breathing tubes and 
           machine beeping... burns all over his body, hair singed off 
           face and half of his scalp... lacerations and wounds criss 
           crossed all over... but worse of all the blanket ENDS BELOW 
           HIS KNEES.

           A MOAN escapes her lips as she processes the horror... she 
           senses people behind her and sees Jeff’s group... all stunned 
           into silence...

                                 ERIN
                        Is he gonna live?

                        We don’t know yet.

           Just then... Jeff’s vitals start BEEPING and nurses BOLT 
           INSIDE...

                                 NURSE
                        He’s flatlining!

           They RUSH him out of the room and down the hall... 

                                 BIG JEFF
                        Where they taking him!

           A beefy SECURITY GUARD stops him.
                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        Ya can’t go down there, sir. I’m 
                        sorry.

                                 BIG JEFF
                        That’s my son!  Goddammit!  Did you 
                        see what they did to my son!

           INT. FAMILY WAITING ROOM - NIGHT

           The television bolted on the wall plays endless news coverage 
           as Jeff’s group, their nerves chewed down to the quick, watch 
           with glazed eyes.

                                 BOSTON NEWSCASTER
                        ...debris recovered at the scene 
                        leads experts to believe that the 
                        explosive was most likely a 
                        pressure cooker bomb.  Still now 
                        word yet on which organization, if 
                        any, claims responsibility.  But 
                        the hunt for those responsible has 
                        begun in full force...

           Aunt Jen and Aunt Karen walk up to Patty and Big Jeff, who 
           are having an impromptu meeting in the corner.  Everyone 
           (except Big Jeff, who hasn’t shed a tear) is raw and ragged 
           from crying.

                        What’s the word?

                                 AUNT KAREN 
                        He’s still in surgery.

                                 BIG JEFF 
                        What the fuck’s this gonna cost?  

                                 PATTY
                        I dunno.  But I can pull together 
                        some cash.

                                 BIG JEFF
                        How much?

                                 PATTY
                        Lemme check.

           She reaches for her purse.

                                 BIG JEFF
                        You kidding me?  They’re gonna kick 
                        him out.
                                 AUNT KAREN
                        They won’t kick him out.  That’s 
                        illegal.

                                 BIG JEFF
                        You don’t think they’re gonna 
                        prioritize and give bettah 
                        treatment to rich people?  Don’t be 
                        so naive.

                                 AUNT JEN
                        You wanna talk naive?  How about 
                        you waltzing in here and trying to 
                        act the father!

                                 BIG JEFF
                        So he’s not my son ‘cause I don’t 
                        see him often enough in your book?

                                 PATTY
                        He’s only your son when it’s 
                        convenient.

                                 BIG JEFF
                        This is convenient?  This FUCKING 
                        HORROR SHOW?

                                 AUNT KAREN
                             (yelling as loud as she 
                              can)
                        Enough!  Let’s focus here!  For 
                        Jeff.

                                 BIG JEFF
                        I’ll sell my house I gotta.

                                 PATTY
                        That duplex maybe cover a fucking 
                        tonsilectomy.

                                 BIG JEFF
                        Goddammit, ya just dig and dig!

                                 PATTY
                        Every-fucking-thing’s always gotta 
                        be about you!

           Aunt Karen, frustrated that nobody will quiet enough so she 
           can hear, takes a tray of hospital food and CHUCKS IT AGAINST 
           THE WALL.  

                                 AUNT KAREN
                        Stop arguing!
           They notice a tall man standing nearby, sharp pants a crisp 
           collared shirt and a very sincere smile... KEVIN HORST. 

                                 KEVIN
                        I’m so sorry to interrupt your 
                        meeting.  

                                 BIG JEFF
                        Who the hell are you?

                                 KEVIN
                        Kevin Horst.  Jeff’s manager at 
                        Costco.  I spoke with Patty on the 
                        phone. 

                                 PATTY
                        I’m Patty.

                                 KEVIN
                        And you must be Jeff Senior?

                                 BIG JEFF
                        Yeah.

                                 PATTY
                        Call him Big Jeff though.  He don’t 
                        like Jeff Senior.

                                 BIG JEFF
                        Makes me look for my old man, ya 
                        know?

                                 AUNT KAREN
                        I’m Aunt Karen, this is Aunt Jen...

                                 KEVIN
                        The aunts.  Yes, I’ve heard a lot 
                        about you two.  All of you, in 
                        fact.  

                                 BIG JEFF
                        What are you doing here?

                                 KEVIN
                        I’m here on behalf of Costco.  
                        We’re all devastated about what 
                        happened and want to help.

                                 AUNT JEN
                        How you gonna help?
                                 KEVIN
                        With whatever you may need. I’ve 
                        taken the liberty of printing up 
                        Jeff’s policy and highlighting the 
                        pertinent areas...

           He hands them a neatly organized folder.

                                 PATTY
                        Jeffrey’s insured?

                                 KEVIN
                        Everyone at Costco is given the 
                        option, of course.  He was on the 
                        fence but his supervisor convinced 
                        him.

                                 AUNT KAREN
                        Thank God.

                                 BIG JEFF
                        What about when Costco drops him 
                        ‘cause he can’t work no more?  

                                 PATTY
                        Give it a rest!

                                 BIG JEFF
                        That Cobra shit is a fucking scam.

                                 AUNT KAREN
                        Will you both shut up!

                                 BIG JEFF
                        This is how the fucking world 
                        works!  I been kicked in the teeth 
                        enough to know!

                                 KEVIN
                        We won’t drop him, Mr. Bauman.

                                 BIG JEFF
                        So you’re gonna rehire him with no 
                        legs?  Because that’s what 
                        happened.  They took his legs.  
                        Both of ‘em.  We don’t know what 
                        he’s gonna fucking do.

                                 KEVIN
                        I’m so sorry to hear that.  But no, 
                        we won’t rehire him--

                                 BIG JEFF
                        I knew it!
                                 KEVIN
                        Mr. Bauman!  Please let me finish.  
                        We won’t rehire him because he will 
                        never have stopped working for us.

           Big Jeff mumbles for a second, then leans over and begins 
           sobbing... finally, lets it all out... this tough mechanic 
           wailing like an infant... nobody will touch him... so Kevin 
           reaches out and gently pats Big Jeff on the back.  

           INT. ICU - NIGHT

           Jeff lies in his hospital bed, a breathing tube in his mouth, 
           eyes peacefully closed as the machines do their work.  Sully 
           sits in chair beside Jeff, fighting to stay awake. JEFF’S 
           EYES OPEN.

                                 SULLY
                        HOLY SHIT!
                             (looks around)
                        Somebody come here!

           Jeff looks around, disoriented...

                                 SULLY (CONT’D)
                        Don’t move, I’ll get somebody 
                        important--

           Jeff reaches out and grips Sully’s hand... searches his face 
           with his eyes... 

                                 SULLY (CONT’D)
                        Okay, so listen... there was this 
                        explosion and your legs... they’re 
                        fucking gone, man... I don’t know 
                        what happened to them, like if they 
                        put them in a jar or... shit, do 
                        you even understand me? 

           Jeff gives him the middle finger.

                                 SULLY (CONT’D)
                        Oh, thank God.

           Jeff mimes “paper and pen.”

                                 SULLY (CONT’D)
                        You wanna write something?  

           Sully scrambles, knocking shit over, and finds a pen and 
           paper.  Jeff takes it... slowly writes.  Hands it to him.
                                 SULLY (CONT’D)
                             (reading)
                        “Lieutenant Dan.”  The dude from 
                        Forrest Gump with no legs?  Are you 
                        being funny?

           Jeff motions for the pen again.  Writes.  Sully reads.

                                 SULLY (CONT’D)
                        Where’s Erin?  She was here 
                        earlier, bro.  But I don’t know.  

           He writes again.

                                 SULLY (CONT’D)
                        Yeah, she was crying.

           Jeff smiles around the tube.  Then he gets serious, writes 
           some more.

           INT. HALLWAY - SAME

           Sully walks out with that paper in shaky hands... most 
           important message he’s ever carried in his fucking life... 
           who to bring it to?  

           Uncle Bob walks over, rubbing his eyes awake.

                                 UNCLE BOB
                        What the fuck you doing walking 
                        around here, you idiot.  This 
                        hallway is for important personell--

                                 SULLY
                        Jeff woke up and... wrote this...

           He hands Uncle Bob the paper... he reads it...

                                 UNCLE BOB
                        Holy shit!  Get tha fuck outta my 
                        way!

           Uncle Bob SPRINTS as fast as his old ass takes him down the 
           hallway... dodging nurses and doctors... 

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        SIR!  SLOW DOWN!

           Uncle Bob FLIES past him... 
           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - MAKESHIFT FBI HQ - SAME

           A group of haggard-looking agents sit around a table... 
           photos and video screens all around them among the spent 
           coffee cups and take out food... among them, an Alpha Woman 
           in her late forties, AGENT RENEE MORRELL.  

           The door SLAMS open and Uncle Bob bursts in.

                                 UNCLE BOB
                        I GOT SOMETHING FOR YA!

           The agents near the door TACKLE him to the floor. Morrell 
           pulls her weapon in a flash.

                                 UNCLE BOB (CONT’D)
                        DON’T SHOOT!  I’M A LOCAL BUSINESS 
                        OWNER!

                                 AGENT MORRELL
                        What the hell are you doing!

           Sully pops up behind him.

                                 SULLY
                        Don’t shoot Uncle Bob!  

                                 UNCLE BOB
                        Read the note!  Jeff Bauman wrote a 
                        note!

                                 AGENT MORRELL
                        Jeff Bauman?  One of the victims?

           Morrell snatches the note out of Uncle Bob’s hand.  Reads it: 

           “I SAW THE BOMBER.  LOOKED RIGHT AT ME.”

           INT. JEFF’S ICU ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Jeff looks up at Agent Morrell and half a dozen other FBI 
           agents and State Troopers hovering over him. Sully and Uncle 
           Bob hover back.

                                 AGENT MORRELL
                        Mr. Bauman.  Do you understand me 
                        clearly?

                                 SULLY
                        Ya gotta speak louder, he’s not 
                        brain damaged but his hearing is 
                        fucked.
                                 AGENT MORRELL
                        Do you understand me clearly?!

           Jeff nods.  Groggy as hell.

                                 AGENT MORRELL (CONT’D)
                        Did you see the person responsible 
                        for the attack?

           Jeff nods. The agents rush into the hall.

           HALLWAY - SAME

           Morrell takes charge.

                                 AGENT MORRELL
                        Get me the photo sheet.  And 
                        someone get the sketch artist!  

           She pulls a nearby nurse closer by the arm.

                                 AGENT MORRELL (CONT’D)
                        Ma’am, I need you to take that 
                        breathing tube out immediately.

           Dr. Kalish rounds the corner... 

                                 DR KALISH
                        What’s going on here?

                                 AGENT MORRELL
                        I need that tube out so Mr. Bauman 
                        can talk.

                                 DR KALISH
                        Absolutely not.

                                 AGENT MORRELL
                        This is the single biggest manhunt 
                        in United States history and this 
                        young man’s information is the only 
                        lead we have!  

                                 DR KALISH
                        My patient may have internal 
                        contusions, he could die if we 
                        don’t explore immediately!

                                 AGENT MORRELL
                        I need five fucking minutes, 
                        doctor!
                                 DR KALISH
                        Which you will have after the 
                        procedure!

                                 AGENT MORRELL
                        They could bomb again!

                                 DR KALISH
                        That’s YOUR job, this is mine!

           The nurses are already wheeling Jeff away for surgery.  
           Morrell seethes, pulls herself together.

           INT. JEFF’S ICU ROOM - POST SURGERY - MORNING

           Jeff’s battered face sleeping quietly on a pillow.  He does 
           not have a breathing tube... he opens his eyes.

           JEFF’S POV:

           Ten FBI Agents, Morrell at the helm, hovering over him... a 
           sketch artist sitting beside him.  

                                 AGENT MORRELL
                        Mr. Bauman, I’m Agent Renee Morrell 
                        from the Federal Bureau of 
                        Investigation.  You told me last 
                        night that you saw the bomber.  Do 
                        you still remember that?

           Jeff nods.

                                 AGENT MORRELL (CONT’D)
                        Can you speak?

                                 JEFF
                             (voice raw and weak)
                        Yeah.

                                 AGENT MORRELL
                        I want you to tell us everything 
                        you remember and then describe to 
                        our sketch artist just what you 
                        saw.

           Jeff moves and cries out.  The nurse props him up.

                                 NURSE
                        He’s in a lot of pain.
                                 AGENT MORRELL
                        We have ten thousand hours of 
                        security videotape to comb through 
                        and we have no idea what look for. 
                        I don’t think I need to explain how 
                        important this is, do I? 

           Jeff is fighting an incredible amount of pain.  He’s groggy, 
           barely conscious.

                                 JEFF
                        Where’s Erin?

                                 AGENT MORRELL
                        Who’s Erin?

                                 JEFF
                        I need Erin... 

                                 AGENT MORRELL
                        Somebody find out who this Erin 
                        person is!

           INT. GAIL’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Gail and Erin sit on the couch watching the news coverage.  
           Erin is a wreck, been crying nonstop.  Their parents, clean 
           cut and professional BILL and LORI HURLEY sit beside her, 
           consoling.    

                                 LORI
                        Honey, you need to stop blaming 
                        yourself.  It’s not going to help 
                        you and it’s certainly not going to 
                        help Jeff.

                                 BILL
                        It’s not your fault.  It’s those 
                        goddamn bombers.  The cowards.  I 
                        hope someone strings them up.

                                 LORI
                        Bill!

                                 GAIL
                        Erin, if you go back to that 
                        hospital, it’s just going to 
                        confuse everything.    

           A KNOCK at the door.

                                 BILL
                        I’ll get it.
                                 LORI
                        His family is there.  He has 
                        support.

                                 ERIN
                        Have you met his family? 

                                 GAIL
                        I just don’t want you to let guilt 
                        force you into making a bad 
                        decision.

                                 BILL
                        Erin!  It’s for you!

           Erin walks over to see THREE BURLY FBI AGENTS in mirrored 
           sunglasses standing in front.  Behind them, a BLACK SUV and 
           two MA STATE POLICE CRUISERS, lights FLASHING.

                                 FBI AGENT
                        Erin Hurley?

           INT. WAITING ROOM - SAME

           The is still full of grieving, stressed out, weeping 
           families... now running on fumes... Jeff’s group clusters in 
           a corner... 

           The BURLY FBI agents stride through with Erin in between 
           them.

                                 UNCLE BOB
                        I thought she dumped him?  

                                 PATTY
                        She did.

           Patty follows but is blocked by security.

           INT. JEFF’s ICU ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Agent Morell is pacing impatiently as the agents bring Erin 
           into the room.  Jeff is lying there... eyes half closed when 
           she walks in... he props himself up, gains some clarity...

                                 JEFF
                        Hey, E.  I told ya I’d show up.  

                                 ERIN
                        You did.
                                 JEFF
                        Ya didn’t believe me did ya?  Be 
                        honest.

                                 ERIN
                        No, I didn’t.  

                                 JEFF
                        Wish ya could have seen the poster 
                        I made for ya.  3D letters and 
                        everything.  Musta burned up 
                        though.  

                                 AGENT MORRELL
                        We’re very pressed for time.  

                                 JEFF
                        Just a minute please, ma’am.  This 
                        is the girl of my dreams here.  
                        Come closer.

           She quietly walks up... takes Jeff’s hand... sits at the side 
           of his bed.  

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        Erin?

                                 ERIN
                        Yeah?

                                 JEFF
                        You’re hurting my feet.

           She looks down and sees that she’s sitting where Jeff’s legs 
           should be.  She doesn’t know if she should laugh or cry-- 
           does both.

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        Made her laugh.  That’s all I 
                        needed.  Okay, FBI lady.  Let’s do 
                        this shit.

                                 AGENT MORRELL
                        Tell us what you saw, Jeff.

           The door BASHES open and Patty barges in.

                                 PATTY
                        You wake up and ya don’t even call 
                        for ya fucking mother!

                                 JEFF
                        I’m sorry, ma.
                                 AGENT MORRELL
                        Ma’am, we need this room filled 
                        with only essential personnel.

                                 PATTY
                        I had a govahment job once, I know 
                        half these people just standing 
                        here to pull fucking OT.

                                 JEFF
                        Can my ma stay too?

                                 AGENT MORRELL
                        Jesus Christ.  Fine.  Anybody else? 

           Patty pushes Erin aside as she hugs Jeff, who yelps in pain.

                                 JEFF
                        Nope. This is it.

           EXT. HALLWAY - MINUTES LATER

           The agents STREAM OUT into the hallway, half of them on their 
           cell phones talking excitedly.  We SEE the SKETCH as the 
           artist and Morrell step out... it looks a lot like the Bomber 
           we saw bump into Jeff.

                                 AGENT MORRELL
                        Get that sketch to every agent in 
                        the Greater Boston area.  Let’s 
                        nail this fucker to the wall!

           Jeff’s group watches, especially Big Jeff who swells with 
           pride.

           EXT. BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER - NIGHT

           Kevin is carrying two large take-out bags... he walks past a 
           mob of Newsvans and flashing red and blue lights...

           INT. BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER - LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

           Throngs of people gather around the television screens... 
           closer to the elevators, a mob of reporters and photographers 
           are being held back by security guards... 

           Kevin nods at the security guards, they smile and let him 
           pass.
           INT. WAITING ROOM - DAY

           Kevin enters with an armload of paper bags.  Patty greets 
           him.

                                 PATTY
                        Mister Horst.  You came back.

                                 KEVIN
                        I brought lunch for everybody.  

                                 AUNT JEN
                        What do we owe ya?

                                 KEVIN
                        I asked the delis around here to 
                        pitch in... everybody in Boston 
                        wants to pitch in.  

                                 PATTY
                        Ya know, Jeffrey would love to see 
                        ya.  Why don’t ya come in?

           Kevin sees Jeff’s room up ahead and notices that it is 
           bursting with visitors.

                                 KEVIN
                        He looks like he has plenty of 
                        visitors right now, I’m sure...

                                 AUNT JEN
                        He’s fine!  He loves it!

           INT. JEFF’S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Jeff sits up in his bed, propped up by pillows... smiling but 
           pale and weak-looking.  The room is packed and rowdy... Big 
           D, Sully sit in chairs at his bedside, Aunt Jen, Aunt Karen, 
           Dale, 8 year old Cole, Big Jeff, his wife Csilla... plus a 
           nurse working around everyone... Erin and Gail sit in a 
           corner.

                                 JEFF
                        Heavy Kevy!  Come in and meet 
                        everybody.  This is Big D, Sully,

                        their son Cole, my old man Big 
                        Jeffie, his wife Csilla, this guy I 
                        don’t know...

                                 THAT GUY
                        I’m just here to check your fluids.
                                 JEFF
                        What’s ya name?

                                 THAT GUY
                        Harold.

                                 JEFF
                        That’s Harold the Fluid Guy.  This 
                        is my nurse Camille, this is Erin 
                        Hurley and her sister Gail.  Who am 
                        I missing?  Right, these are my new 
                        stumps “Larry” and “Mo.”  Guys, 
                        this is Heavy Kevy, my boss. 

                                 KEVIN
                        Nice to meet everyone.  How you 
                        feeling, Jeff?

                                 JEFF
                        I’ll be chucking chickens again

                        Tell them to come by.

                                 KEVIN
                        Anyone specifically?

                                 JEFF
                        All of them.     

           Uncle Bob barges in.

                                 UNCLE BOB
                        Turn on the TV!

                        The one who forgot to zip his fly 
                        is my Uncle Bob.

                                 KEVIN
                        Nice to meet you, Uncle Bob.

           Uncle Bob zips his fly.

                                 UNCLE BOB
                        Who’s the jolly gay guy?

                        stressed out with news reports.

                                 UNCLE BOB
                        They’re talking about him on the

                        Who they talking about?

                        think?  Ya son.  They’re saying he 
                        fingered the terrorists!

           Uncle Bob clicks on the TV.  Nonstop coverage of the 
           manhunt... sure enough, Jeff’s face pops up... smiling with 
           Erin.

           The screen shows the ICONIC PHOTO.  Jeff looks away, only

           Kevin is ordering when he turns and sees Erin, crouched in a 
           corner, sobbing.  He walks up to her, puts his hand on her 
           shoulder.

                                 KEVIN
                        You’re Erin, right?

                                 ERIN
                        You remembered my name?

                                 KEVIN
                        I’m good with names.  Would you 
                        have a coffee with me?

           EXT. BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER - NIGHT

           Erin and Kevin sit on a bench, nursing Dunkin Donuts coffee 
           cups.  They are watching the cluster of reporters massing 
           against a barricade of armed cops across the street.

                                 KEVIN
                        I’m sure what you’re feeling is 
                        super complicated.    
                             (she nods)
                        He’s such a sweet guy. And he’s 
                        cute.  But he’s not really driven, 
                        to say the least.
                             (she nods)
                        And you don’t want to end up like 
                        one of those women in the 
                        neighborhood, swallowing down her 
                        dreams so you can play surrogate 
                        mother to an overgrown Manchild who 
                        drinks beer and watches the Red Sox 
                        in his underwear while you take 
                        care of his kids. 
                             (she looks at him... how 
                              does he know this?)
                        Most important thing in life is to 
                        live in truth.  I learned that the 
                        long, hard way. But I think you can 
                        do what’s best for you and what’s 
                        best for Jeff.  Just make sure you 
                        do them in that order, okay?  

                                 ERIN

                        Kevin Horst.  I’m Jeff’s boss at 
                        Costco.  
           He hands her his monogrammed hankerchief to wipe away her 
           tears.

                                 ERIN
                        It’s so soft.

                                 KEVIN
                        I have them imported from Italy.  
                        Keep it.

           INT. JEFF’S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

           Kalish checks Jeff’s sutures and he is sweating in pain.  
           Erin stands beside him, holding his hand.

                                 DR KALISH
                        You need to pull back on the 
                        socializing and try and sleep, 
                        Jeff.    

                                 JEFF
                        Sure thing, doc.

           The Doctor grabs his chart and walks out.

                                 ERIN
                        I’m so sorry this happened to you.

                                 JEFF
                        It wasn’t your fault, ya know.  
                        Unless ya spending time with me 
                        just because ya feel guilty.  In 
                        that case... yes, it’s all you’re 
                        fault and ya should be ashamed of 
                        yourself.
                             (she gives him a smile)
                        Or maybe this is an elaborate, ya 
                        know, ruse to win ya back?
                             (she laughs)
                        Look, I know this don’t change 
                        anything.  But it means a lot, you 
                        being here.

                                 ERIN
                        What can I do to help?

                                 JEFF
                        Wanna watch some cartoons?  

           He moves over and she sits beside him... he turns on the TV 
           and flicks through the endless NEWS COVERAGE to find 
           ADVENTURE TIME on Cartoon Network.

           The crowd swears at the television... reminiscent of a Red

                        Road Kill.

                                 NEWCASTER
                        Boston has initiated a city-wide 
                        curfew.  The city is on lockdown 
                        while this manhunt continues...
           INT. JEFF’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Jeff in his bed, Erin laying beside him.

                                 JEFF
                        I don’t want to be famous for this.  

                                 ERIN
                        You don’t have to be.

                                 JEFF
                        Ya think I got a choice?

                                 ERIN
                        You always have a choice.

           He reaches out and takes her hand.

                                 JEFF
                        I don’t know what it is.  But when 
                        you’re with me, I feel like 
                        everything’s gonna be okay.  
                        Whatever that is ya got, ya should 
                        bottle that shit up.  Make a 
                        fortune.

           He closes his eyes.  She watches as he falls asleep for the 
           first time since the bombing.

           EXT. BOSTON STREETS - DAY

           A series of shots showing the Ghost Town that Boston has 
           become... Sumner Tunnel... Fenway... Faneuil Hall... Boston 
           Common... all DEVOID OF PEOPLE.

           From dozens of windows we see BOSTON STRONG flags hanging.

           INT. WAITING ROOM - NIGHT 

           The families and friends, bearing the weight of no sleep and 
           raw nerves, are passed out on the floor, across chairs, 
           drinking coffee as the news drones in the background. 

           HALLWAY:

           Uncle Bob pours some scotch from a flask into the Dunkin 
           Donuts cups of Sully and Big D.

                                 UNCLE BOB
                        Entire fucking city of Boston can’t 
                        find this one little cuntbag?
                                 BIG D
                        Maybe he’s, like, a green beret or 
                        something.

                                 SULLY
                        Ya retahded.

                                 BIG D
                        You don’t know what kinda training 
                        these guys got in Afghanistan or 
                        whatever.

                                 SULLY
                        They said they’re Russian.

                                 BIG D
                        Isn’t that near Afghanistan?

           Commotion around the television.  ON SCREEN: a boat in 
           somebody’s backyard with spotlights all over it.

                                 BIG JEFF
                             (yelling into hallway)
                        They found him alive! They found 
                        him in a fucking boat! 

           Big D, Sully and Uncle Bob sprint in the room to find 
           everyone celebrating.  

           INT. JEFF’S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT

           Jeff wakes up to hear CHEERING break out from down the 
           hall... and it echoes OUTSIDE... on the STREETS!

           Erin gets up and looks out the window... people are POURING 
           OUT into the streets... cheering... you’ve never seen tension 
           released like this... strangers hugging... weeping... 

                                 ERIN
                        Something happened.

           Patty SWINGS the door open... pushes through and EMBRACES 
           JEFF.

                                 PATTY
                        They caught the other one.  It’s 
                        over, baby.  They got the monsters.  
                        It’s finally over.
           EXT. BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER - ALLEYWAY - DAY

           A mob of newsreporters and photographers yell out as a line 
           of Staties keep them back around the corner.  Jeff waits on 
           the curb, sitting in his wheelchair, Erin, Kevin and Gail 
           beside him... his family gathers around (most of them now 
           sporting BOSTON STRONG shirts)... arguing.  

                                 BIG JEFF
                        He should be moving in with me!

                                 PATTY
                        All the way up in Cow Hampshire?  
                        His friends are in Chelmsford!

                                 UNCLE BOB
                        All due respect, I got the most 
                        fucking room outta all a ya.  And 
                        I’m only one here with a credit 
                        score above 520.

                                 PATTY
                        I raised him by myself since he was 
                        two, he’s coming home with me.  

                                 AUNT JEN
                        I’m just saying, I got a pool!

                                 UNCLE BOB
                        Fucking above ground!  

                                 JEFF
                        Hey!  Everybody shut the hell up.  
                        I made my choice. I’m staying with 
                        ma.  Okay?

                                 AUNT KAREN
                        That’s right.  Jeffrey made his 
                        choice.  Gotta respect that.

                                 JEFF
                        Erin, come here a sec.

           Jeff wheels away a few feet so he can talk privately to Erin. 

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        I just wanna say thanks for, you 
                        know, helping me get through these 
                        last weeks.  I know it wasn’t 
                        wasn’t easy and I couldn’t’a made 
                        it without ya.

                                 ERIN
                        I’m glad I could help.
                                 JEFF
                        See ya around?  

                                 ERIN
                        Yeah.

           Patty grabs his wheelchair and starts pushing him.

                                 PATTY
                        I got him from here.  Let’s go, 
                        Jeffrey.

           Erin watches as Patty rolls him away.  

           INT. UNCLE BOB’S DIESEL VOLKSWAGEN PASSAT - DAY

           Hauling ass north up the 495... Jeff in the backseat.  Uncle 
           Bob is driving, Patty beside him. Wheelchair strapped to the 
           trunk.  He sees a sign for 110/Chelmsford and they ease into 
           the right lane...

           ...as they approach an overpass, Jeff sees a massive banner 
           that reads “WELCOME HOME, BAUMAN STRONG!” And a group of 
           people cheering.

                                 JEFF
                        What’s that all about?

                                 UNCLE BOB
                        You’re a national fucking hero, 
                        kid.

                                 JEFF
                        For what?

                                 PATTY
                        Whaddya mean for what?  Don’t be 
                        silly.

           Jeff looks at the next underpass... a group of people 
           cheering over a sign that reads BOSTON STRONG.  And for a 
           second, it looks like one of them is wearing a hoodie and 
           mirrored sunglasses... just like TAMERLAN.  

           Jeff shakes off the feeling, unrolls the window for some 
           air...

           EXT. CHELMSFORD STREET - DAY

           The VW heads down the street... a BLACK SEDAN is tailing them 
           awful close.
           INT. CAR - SAME

           Uncle Bob spots them in his rearview.

                                 UNCLE BOB
                        Goddamn reporters.  

           Uncle Bob pops open his cell phone, dials it.

                                 UNCLE BOB (CONT’D)
                             (into phone)
                        Lou?  It’s Bob.  Do me a favor, 
                        will ya? 

           EXT. CHELMSFORD STREET - MOMENTS LATER

           Red and Blue lights FLASH behind that sedan... a CHELMSFORD 
           SQUAD CAR pulls it over.  Uncle Bob pulls over too... he 
           REVERSES so they are eye to eye with the drivers... two tired-
           looking reporters and a photog look back at him.

                                 UNCLE BOB
                        Welcome to Chelmsford, dickbags!

           EXT. PATTY’S APARTMENT COMPLEX - DAY

           A simple three level apartment building built about fifty 
           feet from a major road.  As the VW pulls up, we see the whole 
           crew waiting there... Aunt Jen, Dale, Aunt Karen, Sully, Big 
           D, Aunt Karen, Big Jeff, Csilla.  Patty has put up a WELCOME 
           HOME JEFFREY sign on the front.

           They untie the wheelchair, help him in it.  

                                 AUNT JEN 
                        Careful.

                                 BIG JEFF
                        Ya gotta pull that latch first!

                                 AUNT JEN
                        Push it, not pull it!

           Jeff gets into the chair.  Sully tries to push.

                                 JEFF
                        I can do it!  

           He rolls towards the apartment... it’s on the first floor, 
           there’s a little walkway leading to a tiny patio and then an 
           open door... he rolls to the door... and his wheelchair 
           CLANKS AGAINST THE DOORJAMB.
                                 BIG JEFF
                        Goddammit, Patty!  This is what I 
                        was worried about!

                                 PATTY
                        How was I supposed to know!

                                 BIG JEFF
                        Measure the goddamm chair!  Look at 
                        him!

                                 PATTY
                        I’ll hire somebody to fix it!

                                 BIG JEFF
                        Meantime he sleeps outside?

                                 PATTY
                        We’ll carry him in.

                                 JEFF
                        Nobody’s carrying me in.

           Big Jeff bounds over to his truck, pulls a CROWBAR out of the 
           bed, then eases it into the doorjamb and WRENCHES IT OFF with 
           a SPLINTERING YANK.

                                 BIG JEFF
                        There.

           Jeff rolls in.  They all push inside after him.  Patty is 
           crying, Uncle Bob puts a hand on her shoulder.

                                 UNCLE BOB
                        I’ll get some boys to fix that, 
                        okay?

           Jeff pauses in the middle of the room... there are stacks of 
           letters covering every flat surface... photos and drawings 
           covering every vertical surface... it’s like the small 
           apartment is a shrine dedicated to FAN MAIL FOR JEFF from all 
           over the world.

                                 JEFF
                        What’s all this?

                                 PATTY
                        They come from everwhere, hon.  All 
                        over the world.  I got a letter 
                        from a place called Micronesia.  I 
                        thought it was made up, but it’s a 
                        real place.  Kinda near Australia.  
                                 AUNT JEN 
                        Whole world is watching ya, 
                        Jeffrey.

           Jeff rolls through the small apartment... more and more 
           letters and artwork...

                                 JEFF
                        You read all these?

                                 PATTY
                        Every one.  And I’m gonna write 
                        back to each one too.  Just takes a 
                        while ‘cause I start crying each 
                        time.

                                 AUNT KAREN
                        Everybody’s so proud of you.

                                 JEFF
                        For what?

                                 BIG JEFF
                        Being Boston Strong.

                                 PATTY
                        Let’s have a drink and celebrate 
                        Jeffrey’s return home!

           Patty pulls out a box of Cavitz White wine and a six pack of 
           Budweiser.  She hands Jeff a Bud.

                                 UNCLE BOB
                        Should he be drinking?

           Everyone looks to Jeff.  

                                 JEFF
                        They took my legs, not my balls.

                                 PATTY
                        There ya go!  Anybody here deserves 
                        a fucking drink it’s Jeffrey!  

           INT. JEFF’S ROOM - MORNING

           Jeff is spread across his bed, jumbled up in blankets and 
           sheets.  Has slept maybe five minutes.  There’s a BANGING 
           KNOCK on his bedroom door.

                                 PATTY (O.S.)
                        Jeffrey!  Wake up!  We’re gonna be 
                        late!
                                 JEFF
                        I’m up!

           He swings his legs over the edge of his bed and “takes a 
           step” only to SLAM right on his fucking face because he 
           forgot he had no legs.

                                 AUNT JEN (O.S.)
                        What the hell was that?

                                 PATTY (O.S.)
                        JEFFREY ARE YOU OKAY!

           Jeff rolls onto his back, blood pouring out of his nose... 

                                 JEFF
                        I’m fine.  Just gimme a second.

           Jeff writhes silently in pain.

           EXT. JEFF’S ROOM - SAME

           Patty presses her ear against the door, cigarette dangling 
           out her mouth.  Aunt Jen beside her, tray of Dunkin Donuts 
           coffee in her hand.

                                 PATTY
                        What the hell’s he doing in there?

                                 AUNT JEN
                        Jesus, Patty.  Whaddya think boys 
                        do in their room when they lock the 
                        door?

                                 PATTY
                        Ya think he’s doing that?  That’s 
                        good, right?  Means he’s healing?
                             (to door)
                        Jeffrey, you take ya time! We’ll be 
                        waiting outside!  Take all the time 
                        ya want!

           INT. SPAULDING REHAB FACILITY  - DAY

           Whole gang (Uncle Bob, Aunt Jen, Patty, Sully, Big D, Aunt 
           Karen, Big Jeff) watch as MICHELE, his Physical Therapist 
           (late forties, sinewy and NO BULLSHIT kinda lady) wraps up 
           Jeff’s stumps.  

                                 JEFF
                        Don’t any of you guys work any 
                        more?
                                 PATTY
                        We all took time off ta help ya, 
                        Jeffrey.  Now answer her question, 
                        for God’s sake.

                                 JEFF
                        “What are my goals?”  Whaddya mean?

                                 MICHELE
                        Other survivors from the bombing 
                        I’m working with, for example, 
                        they’ve said “Michele, I don’t 
                        wanna just walk... I wanna run and 
                        climb mountains.”  

                                 JEFF
                        Did they climb mountains before?

                                 MICHELE
                        Maybe.  But they look at this as an 
                        opportunity to find deeper meaning 
                        in their lives.

                                 JEFF
                        Are you fucking kidding me?

                                 BIG JEFF
                        Hey!  Mind ya goddamn manners!

                                 PATTY
                        He’s expressing himself!

                                 MICHELE
                        It’s okay.  I’ve heard worse.

                                 BIG JEFF 
                             (to Michele)
                        This ain’t how I raised him.

                                 PATTY
                        You raised him?  That a fucking 
                        joke?

                                 BIG JEFF
                        Okay, then it’s your fault then.
                             (to Michele)
                        Any wonder I hadda split?  She’s 
                        very difficult.

                                 PATTY
                        Fuck you!
                                 JEFF
                        Enough!  Ya wanna know my goals?  I 
                        just want my old life back.  That’s 
                        it.

                                 MICHELE
                        Okay.  What did you used to do?

                                 JEFF
                        Work at Costco, watch the Sox, 
                        drink beer.  Hang with my friends.  
                        That’s all I want.

                                                                CUT TO:

                        You can do it!

           His whole crew looks on silently... rooting him on the way a 
           family cheers for a little leaguer...

                                 PATTY
                        You can do it, Jeffrey!

           Jeff GROANS in pain and exertion... tears coming outta his 
           eyes...

                                 BIG JEFF
                        Don’t quit!  Ya always quit!

                                 PATTY
                        Will you stop being negative for 
                        once in ya goddamn life!

                                 BIG JEFF
                        I’m allowed to motivate how I 
                        fucking want!

                                 PATTY
                        He doesn’t respond to that 
                        bullshit!    

                                 BIG JEFF
                        I don’t need you to tell me how to 
                        be a father!

                                 PATTY
                        Why don’t ya go to Barnes and 
                        Nobles and buy a fucking parenting 
                        book or something!
                                 JEFF
                        CUT IT OUT!

                                 MICHELE
                        Jeff, just focus.  A little more... 
                        you almost got it!

           ...and we see the LARGE PAIR OF UNDERWEAR he’s pulling over 
           his shorts... a “Basic Life” exercise... he GETS THEM ON... 
           then collapses onto his back, spent, gasping for breath...

                                 MICHELE (CONT’D)
                        Good job.

           Everyone claps.  AT HIM PUTTING ON UNDERWEAR.  

                                 UNCLE BOB
                        Ya did it!  

                                 JEFF
                        I PUT ON FUCKING UNDERWEAR!  STOP 
                        CLAPPING!

           INT. SPAULDING REHAB FACILITY - GROUP THERAPY - DAY

           Jeff sits in a chair in a semi-circle.  Around him are half a 
           dozen amputees... victims of the bombing... legs missing... 
           double amputees... ages ranging from 20’s to 40’s.  The 
           THERAPIST sits in front of them.  She isn’t saying anything, 
           just smiling warmly... 

           ...as EVERYONE WEEPS... letting out the sorrow and the pain 
           and the fear... 

                                 THERAPIST
                        Jeff?  Do you have anything to 
                        share?

           Jeff looks around at everyone... he’s the only one not 
           crying.

                                 JEFF
                        Huh?  

                                 THERAPIST
                        I asked if you had anything to 
                        share with the group.

                                 JEFF
                        Nah. I’m good.  Somebody else can 
                        go.
           Through the window in the door, Jeff sees PATTY, BIG JEFF and 
           the whole crew looking in on him.  Patty and Big Jeff start 
           arguing.  

           INT. UNITED PROSTHETICS - DORCHESTER - DAY

           Jeff and his mother sit in the small, unassuming workshop 
           among a museum of artificial legs.  PAUL MARTINO, grandson of 
           the founder of the company, presents Jeff with a sleek 
           futuristic-looking artificial leg... looks like it was yanked 
           off a Sci Fi robot.

                                 MARTINO
                        These are your new legs.  The 
                        Genium.  

                                 PATTY
                        They’re so nice, aren’t they 
                        Jeffrey?

                                 JEFF
                        How much?

                                 MARTINO
                        Even with insurance... couple 
                        hundred thousand, give or take.

                                 JEFF
                        These legs cost more than Pop’s 
                        house.

                                 PATTY
                        I’ll get another job, honey.  We’ll 
                        make it work.

                                 MARTINO
                        I don’t think you understand.  You 
                        don’t have to pay anything.  
                        Ottoback donated them.  And the 
                        customization will be covered by 
                        donations.

                                 PATTY
                        Donations from who?

                                 MARTINO
                        We got calls from all over the 
                        world.  And they all said the same 
                        thing.  Give that kid the best.  
                        Geniums are the best.  

           Patty is crying.
                                 PATTY
                        Jeffrey... ya so lucky...

           INT. PATTY’S TOYOTA COROLLA - MOVING

           Patty smokes as they motor down the highway.  Jeff staring 
           out the window.

                                 PATTY
                        They’re having that One Fund 
                        concert to raise money for the 
                        victims.  If your Geniums are 
                        ready, I was thinking maybe you 
                        walk out on stage.  Let everybody 
                        see ya.

                                 JEFF
                        When is that?

                                 PATTY
                        Next week.

                                 JEFF
                        I’m not sure I’ll be walking next 
                        week, ma.

                                 PATTY
                        Not with that attitude.

                                 JEFF
                        Ma?

                                 PATTY
                        Yeah?

                                 JEFF
                        Look at my legs.

                                 PATTY
                        Why?

                                 JEFF
                        They’re fucking gone, ma.  Can you 
                        look at ‘em?

           Patty doesn’t look.  Patty smokes.  

                                 PATTY
                        You don’t know what it’s like to 
                        have your baby blown up by 
                        monsters.  It’s like somebody 
                        reached inside a ya and just 
                        plucked out an internal organ.

                                 PATTY (CONT'D)
                        An important one.  Like a lung or 
                        something.  And ya just don’t know 
                        how ya can even breath anymore but 
                        somehow ya do.  But the whole world 
                        is different.  

           She stubs her butt out, reaches for another one but her 
           hand’s shaking too much.  

                                 JEFF
                        Ma...

           She pulls over on the highway shoulder, covers her face and 
           sobs.  Jeff takes the lighter, lights a smoke and hands it to 
           her.

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        What do you say we just skip rehab, 
                        meet up with everybody and get some 
                        beers?

           Same bar as before.  Only now there are BOSTON STRONG banners 
           all over the place.  

           The whole gang-- Uncle Bob, Aunt Karen, Aunt Jen, Sully, Big 
           D, Patty and Jeff in his wheelchair-- all gather around 
           drinking beer and watching the RED SOX play KANSAS CITY.  
           Jeff has two empty Sam Adams in front of him... working on 
           his third... 

           Red Sox player Jonny Gomes is up at bat... the camera gets a 
           close up of the “B. Strong” patch on his arm.  As much as the 
           Brickhouse patrons are always glued to the Sox games... this 
           is deeper... almost spiritual... everyone is SILENTLY 
           ABSORBED, like they’re at church... they NEED them to win 
           now...

                                 UNCLE BOB
                        Come on, Jonny.  Get us a fucking 
                        hit.  We need a win here.

           Gomes lets a BALL pass.  

                                 BIG JEFF
                        Good eye.  Good eye.
                                 SPORTS ANNOUNCER (ON TV)
                        If you look close, you see that 
                        Jonny Gomes is using a bat with the 
                        words “Boston Strong” etched into.  
                        Along with the names of the four 
                        people who died in the bombing...

                                 AUNT JEN
                        That’s fucking beautiful.

                                 PATTY
                        Ya hear that, Jeff?  His bat says--

                                 JEFF
                        Ya, I heard.

           PITCH... Gomes CONNECTS... the bar goes NUTS... then he 
           grounds OUT!  The reaction is deeper, more painful than 
           usual.  It’s like their hearts are being broken.

                                 SULLY
                        No!

                                 UNCLE BOB
                             (quietly, to Big Jeff)
                        It was a nice gesture, but maybe he 
                        shouldn’t a used that bat, ya know 
                        what I’m sayin’?

           Big D leans over so only Sully and Jeff can hear him.  

                                 BIG D
                        When you go to therapy, people ever 
                        talk about dreams and shit?

                                 JEFF
                        I guess.  Why?

                                 BIG D
                        ‘Cause I had this dream last 
                        night... I’m pitching a playoff 
                        game and the catcher gives me the 
                        sign for a fastball and I throw it 
                        and I realize that, instead of 
                        throwing the baseball... I’m, uh... 
                        I’m throwing my penis.

                                 JEFF
                        Ya penis?

                                 BIG D
                        And the batter hits it and my penis 
                        grounds to shortstop...

                        who taps second and then underhands 
                        it to first for a double play.  But 
                        First drops it and it gets all 
                        dirty and I’m afraid someone’s 
                        gonna step on it with their cleats. 
                        So I start screaming “don’t hurt my 
                        dick!” and I’m running toward it 
                        and here’s where it gets weird... 
                             (moves in even closer)
                        I wake up with a killer fucking 
                        hard-on.  

                                 JEFF
                        Ya want me to bring that up in 
                        group therapy?

                                 BIG D
                        If ya feel comfortable.  

           The Sox go to a commercial.  

                                 AUNT JEN
                        Patty!  You tell him about the 
                        Bruins?

                                 JEFF
                        What about the Bruins?

                                 AUNT JEN
                        They called me.  They want ya to go 
                        out on the ice at half time and 
                        wave the Boston Strong flag.

                                 PATTY
                        I told Jen to tell ‘em you’d do it.  

                                 JEFF
                        Ya told them I’d do it without 
                        asking me?

                                 PATTY
                        Ya love the Bruins.  

                                 JEFF
                        That’s not the point, ma.  You 
                        gotta ask me shit.  

                                 PATTY
                        It’s the fucking playoffs.

                        All ya gotta do is roll out on the 
                        ice, Jeff.  Wave a little for tha 
                        cameras.  Easy, peasy.

                                 PATTY
                        Heal the city.  Boston Strong and 
                        all.

           Jeff rubs his legs... they’re starting to heard real bad.

                                 PATTY (CONT’D)
                        Ya don’t wanna do it, ya doesn’t 
                        wanna do it. But I’m gonna look so 
                        goddamn stupid calling them back.

                                 AUNT JEN
                        It’s too bad.  They was gonna give 
                        us box seats. 

                                 BIG D
                        “Us?”

                                 AUNT JEN
                        They said he could bring a whole 
                        fucking gang.  I’m just saying.  
                        It’s an open bar, too.

                                 SULLY
                        Jeff!  Come on!

                                 BIG D 
                        Ya gotta do this.

                                 UNCLE BOB
                        It’s the playoffs, Jeff.  City a 
                        Boston needs ya to step up.

                                 JEFF
                        Fine!  I’ll do it just so you all 
                        shut the fuck up about it.

                                 BIG JEFF
                        Ya shoulda asked him first, Patty.  
                        Now he feels guilty.  Why do ya do 
                        this?  

                                 PATTY
                        Don’t you fucking start with me!  

                                 JEFF
                        Ma, calm down.  Pop, I’m doing it 
                        because I wanna do it, okay?
                                 PATTY
                        We gotta take advantage while 
                        there’s still interest.   Get you 
                        in the public spotlight before they 
                        forget about ya. Because they 
                        will...   

                                 UNCLE BOB
                             (stops waitress)
                        I’ll take the check, hon.

                                 WAITRESS
                        No need, Bob.  Couple from Vermont 
                        paid.  People been coming in from 
                        all over because they know Jeff 
                        comes here.

           An elderly WEALTHY BOSTON COUPLE at the bar stands up and 
           raise their wine glasses.  They are both crying.

                                 OLDER WOMAN
                        God bless you, Jeff Bauman!

                                 OLDER MAN
                        You’re an American Hero!

           The entire restaurant starts applauding.  The couple walks 
           closer.  

                                 JEFF
                        I don’t wanna do this right now.

                                 PATTY
                        THey paid for lunch, ya owe em!

           Patty walks over to them.

                                 PATTY (CONT’D)
                        I’m Patty, Jeff’s mom.

                                 OLDER WOMAN
                        We’ve been following Jeff’s story.

                                 OLDER MAN
                        We were two blocks away on Boylston 
                        when the bomb went off.  That could 
                        have been us standing there.  

                                 OLDER WOMAN
                        Can we take a picture with him?

                                 PATTY
                        Course you can!
           Patty wheels him over and Jeff fights the panic as everyone 
           in the bar crowds around him for photos.

           INT. JEFF’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Jeff lays out on his bed... sweating in pain... sore as fuck 
           as he rubs his legs while dialing his cell.

                                 JEFF
                        What are ya doing?

           INTERCUT WITH ERIN, curled up in her bed.

                                 ERIN
                        Sleeping.  What are you doing?

                                 JEFF
                        Dancing.  Hold on, lemme walk outta 
                        the club. So... I gotta go to the 
                        Bruins tmrw night... wondering if 
                        you wanna come with me.

                                 ERIN
                        The Bruins? 

                                 JEFF
                        Yeah, they want me to go out on the 
                        ice and wave the flag and shit.  

                                 ERIN
                        Kinda early to be out in public, 
                        no?

                                 JEFF
                        No big deal. You wanna come?  Gonna 
                        be super casual.

           Erin chews it over for a second...

                                 ERIN
                        Uh... sure.  

           For the first time in a while we see Jeff’s big old smile 
           again.

                                 JEFF
                        Awesome.

           EXT. ERIN’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Erin waits outside on the curb.  A STRETCH BLACK LIMOUSINE 
           pull ups, bass PUMPING.  
           The door opens on the lead car and BEER CANS clatter out.  
           Jeff’s sitting there, the gang packed all around him.

                                 JEFF
                        Can you believe?  Bruins paid for 
                        it.  Come on in!

           INT. TD GARDEN - LUXURY BOX - BOSTON BRUINS GAME - NIGHT

           The gang is there-- Sully, Big D, Uncle Bob, Karen, Patty, 
           Big Jeff, Csilla... living it up... endless beer and hot 
           dogs... Erin watches Jeff, who is looking out at the crowd 
           and seems to be withdrawing into himself... 

                                 ERIN
                        You okay?

                                 JEFF
                        Huh?  Ya.  I’m fine.

           Sully turns to him, his face smeared with Nachos.

                                 SULLY
                        ‘Nother round on me!  Ha!  It’s an 
                        open fucking bar, bro!

           Sully is so drunk he CRASHES out of his seat.  

                                 BIG D 
                        Wake up!

                                 ERIN
                        Is he okay?  

                                 BIG D
                        He got a moderation problem.  Wake 
                        up!

           Big D pours beer on him. The Bruins PR rep steps over Sully 
           and finds Jeff.

                                 PR REP
                        We’re ready, Mr. Bauman.

           INT. ARENA TUNNEL - NIGHT

           Tunnel that leads out to the ice... we hear the RUMBLING of 
           30,000 fans cheering... Jeff in his wheelchair, breath 
           clouding up in the cool air.  Big Jeff and Patty stand beside 
           him... Erin behind holding the handles of the chair.  
                                 PATTY
                        Ya could have shaved for the 
                        cameras.

                                 JEFF
                        I ain’t shaving my playoff beard 
                        for nobody, ma.

           The PR rep hands Jeff a six-foot BOSTON STRONG flag.  

                                 PR REP
                        I’ll be standing over there and 
                        I’ll signal you when it’s time to 
                        come out.

           The rep walks off.  

                                 JEFF
                        I, uh... I don’t think I can do 
                        this.

                                 PATTY
                        Sure ya can, Jeff.

                                 BIG JEFF
                        You’re a Bauman.

                                 PATTY
                        And you’re Boston Strong.

                                 JEFF
                        I still don’t know what the fuck 
                        that even means.

                                 PATTY
                        Means ya gonna show the whole city 
                        that those monsters didn’t beat ya.  
                        That ya stronger.

           The PA shakes the whole arena.

                                 ANNOUNCER
                        By now you all know his 
                        inspirational story...

           The Rep signals Erin.

                                 ERIN
                        Here we go.

                                 ANNOUNCER
                        ...his perserverence in the face of 
                        great adversity represents all that 
                        is...
                                 JEFF
                        Wait... stop!

                                 ANNOUNCER
                        BOSTON STRONG!

           The crowd ERUPTS.  Erin stops in the tunnel, leans down.  

                                 ERIN
                        What’s wrong, Jeff?

                                 JEFF
                        They’re gonna see that I don’t got 
                        legs.   

                                 ANNOUNCER
                        Ladies and gentlemen... the one and 
                        only... Jeff Bauman.

                                 ERIN
                        Look at me, Jeff.  You can do this, 
                        okay?  I’m right here with you.

                                 JEFF
                        Okay.  Fuck it.

           She pushes him out onto the ice... the ROAR of 30,000 
           attendees ON THEIR FEET CHEERING.  SPOTLIGHTS flashing... 
           cameras POPPING OFF.

           Jeff looks around at all the people... his eyes darting 
           around... 

                                 ERIN
                        Wave the flag.  There you go.

           He moves the flag and the crowd GOES NUTS.  But his hands are 
           getting slick, his heart pounding in his chest.  And then he 
           sees him... standing up in the crowd... TAMERLAN WEARING THAT 
           JENSEN BACKPACK.

                                 JEFF
                        Do you see him?

                                 ERIN
                        Who?

           Jeff tries to shake it off... but he looks somewhere else... 
           SEES TAMERLAN there... everywhere his eyes focus... there his 
           is... HUNDREDS OF TAMERLANS.  They each put down a Jensen 
           backpack... stare at him with those mirrored sunglasses.
           Jeff starts shaking... the flag SLIPS from his hands and 
           CLANKS on the ice.  Erin picks it up and puts it back in his 
           hands.

                                 ERIN (CONT’D)
                        I’m getting you out of here.

           INT. ARENA TUNNEL - MOMENTS LATER

           The crowd ROARS in the background as Erin pushes Jeff past 
           Patty and Big Jeff.

                                 PATTY
                        That was amazing!

           She blows right by them.

                                 ERIN
                        Meet you back at the apartment!

           INT. LIMOUSINE - NIGHT

           Jeff sitting there, shaking and sweating...

                                 JEFF
                        Every time I close my eyes... I 
                        smell it.

                                 ERIN
                        What do you smell?

                                 JEFF
                        People burning.

           She takes him in her arms.

                                 ERIN
                        I’m here.  I’m here.

                                 JEFF
                        I can’t do this without you, Erin.    

           INT. JEFF’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Jeff climbs out of his wheelchair and into his bed.  He’s 
           still pale and shaking.

                                 ERIN
                        You’re clothes are drenched.  I’m 
                        going to change you.
                                 JEFF
                        I’m fine.

                                 ERIN
                        You’re not fine, Jeff.  You had 
                        some kind of PTSD panic attack.  

                                 JEFF
                        I don’t want you to see me like 
                        this.  

                                 ERIN
                        I can handle it.

                                 JEFF
                        I don’t want you to “handle it.”  I 
                        want you to look at me and think 
                        “that’s the guy!  I’m dying to be 
                        with that guy!”  Please just go...  

                                 ERIN
                        Do you really want me to go?

                                 JEFF
                        You broke up with me, remember?  

                                 ERIN
                        I don’t want to leave.  

                                 JEFF
                        Why?

           She takes a damp towel and carefully cleans the sweat off of 
           his face.  

                                 ERIN
                        Because I’m starting to see what 
                        you’re really made of.  

                                 JEFF
                        What am I made of?

                                 ERIN
                        Did you see those people tonight?  
                        They want a hero.  Somebody to heal 
                        them.  I think you can be that.  
                        But first you need to heal 
                        yourself.  

                                 JEFF
                        How?

                                 ERIN
                        I’m going to help you.
                                 JEFF
                        Ya sure this isn’t, like, the 
                        Florence Nightingale Syndrome?

                                 ERIN
                        I believe in you, Jeff.    

           She unbuttons his shirt and cleans his chest, careful around 
           the ragged stitches on his belly.  Kisses him again.  She 
           cleans his thighs, moves down... he stops her.

                                 JEFF
                        I don’t want you to see them.  

                                 ERIN
                        Trust me.

           She pulls the blanket down and gently cleans his scarred 
           stumps.  She looks into his eyes as she does this. It’s more 
           intimacy than either has ever had.

                                 ERIN (CONT’D)
                        They’re not so bad.

           Jeff leans up and kisses her... they get passionate.  He 
           starts unbuttoning her shirt.

                                 ERIN (CONT’D)
                        Are you sure you can--?

                                 JEFF
                        Wedding tackle still works.  I 
                        tested it in the shower.

                                 ERIN
                        I don’t want to hurt you.

                                 JEFF
                        I’ll text Kalish a picture of my 
                        penis.  Doc, okay if I use this?

                                 ERIN
                        We can wait...

                                 JEFF
                        I don’t wanna wait no more.

           He helps her shed her clothes.  She delicately straddles him.

                                 ERIN
                        Tell me if it starts to hurt.

                                 JEFF
                        I will.
           She moves her hips, slowly makes love to him.  

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        This mean we’re back together?

                                 ERIN
                        Shhhhh

           They both start weeping and smiling at the same time. 

           EXT. AUNT JEN’S HOUSE - DAY

           A barbeque in full swing... everybody’s there... Big D, 
           Sully, Aunt Jen, Aunt Karen, Dale, Cole, Big Jeff and Csilla, 
           Patty, Jeff, Maya... Gail... Even Kevin with his husband, a 
           very dapper and handsome MIKE.

           Aunt Jen and Dale have dragged a big-ass PLASMA screen out so 
           everyone can watch the Red Sox play the Angels... 11th inning 
           and the Sox blow a 2 run lead... as Hawpe rounds the bases 
           from a homerun by Hamilton...  

                                 UNCLE BOB
                        Can you believe this shit?

           Everyone is cussing, flinging their hats at the screen.  Jeff 
           finishes his Corona, immediately gets handed another one.

                                 BIG D
                        We needed a win.

                                 UNCLE BOB
                        City of Boston needs this.  

           Aunt Jen walks over and CLICKS the TV off.

                                 AUNT JEN
                        Hey!  Everyboy listen the hell up!  
                             (to Erin)
                        G’head, hon.  You got the floor.

                                 PATTY
                        I have some very exciting news to--

                                 JEFF
                        She was talking about Erin, ma.

                                 PATTY
                        Oh.  Okay.  Well, she can go first.

           Erin walks over, takes the beer out of Jeff’s hand, and 
           stands in front of the group of people.
                                 ERIN
                        First off, I want to thank Aunt Jen 
                        for hosting.  You didn’t need to go 
                        to all the trouble, but...

                                 AUNT JEN
                             (proud)
                        Hey.  Anybody knows me, they know I 
                        don’t do nothing half assed. 

                                 UNCLE BOB
                        Except college!  Dropped out 
                        Freshman year!

                                 AUNT JEN
                        Go fuck yerself, Bob!  

                                 ERIN
                        So as you may have heard, Jeff and 
                        I are back together. But more 
                        importantly, we’ve been talking 
                        and... things are going to change a 
                        little bit.  After I move in with 
                        Jeff and Patty and--

                                 PATTY
                        Wait, what?

                                 ERIN
                        You didn’t tell her?

                                 JEFF
                        I thought that was what today is 
                        for.  Ya know, announcements and 
                        shit. What?

                                 PATTY
                        It’s a very small apartment for 
                        three people, Jeffrey.

                                 JEFF
                        Technically it’s only two and a 
                        half people.

                                 PATTY
                        That ain’t funny.

                                 JEFF
                        Just temporary until Erin and I 
                        find our own place.

                                 PATTY
                        Ya own place?
                                 JEFF
                        Take it easy, ma.

           Patty takes a sip of her wine to steady herself.  

                                 PATTY
                        Is that the change? You mentioned 
                        change.  Is that it?  Or is there 
                        more?

                                 JEFF
                        Nah, there’s more.  I’m not gonna 
                        do any media or public appearances.  
                        Not until I get better.

                                 AUNT JEN
                        What about book deals and fucking 
                        movies and whatnot?

                                 BIG JEFF
                        Other survivors doing that kinda 
                        shit.

                                 JEFF
                        I told ya.  I gotta fucking heal 
                        first. 

                                 AUNT JEN
                        But ya gotta strike while the 
                        anvil’s hot!  

                                 MAYA
                        Jen’s right, other survivors all 
                        over the tv.

                                 AUNT JEN
                        We’re trying to set you up so ya 
                        don’t gotta worry ya whole life!  
                        It ain’t gonna be easy, Jeff!

                                 JEFF
                        I made up my mind.  I’m going dark 
                        for a bit.

                                 PATTY
                        GODDAMMIT!  OPRAH’S COMING!

           Everyone stops, turns to Patty.  

                                 PATTY (CONT’D)
                        That was my surprise.  I talked to 
                        her on the actual phone last night.  
                        She’s flying down to interview Jeff 
                        tomorrow.
                                 UNCLE BOB
                        Oprah’s fat ass is coming to 
                        Chelmsford?

                                 AUNT JEN
                        She hasn’t been fat since the early 
                        nineties!

                                 JEFF
                        Well, ya gonna have to call her and 
                        cancel, ma.

                                 PATTY
                        You can’t just cancel Oprah!

                                 JEFF
                        Why not?

                                 PATTY
                        She’s the most famous person in the 
                        world!

                                 JEFF
                        I don’t watch her.

                                 PATTY
                        Oprah saved my life!  In those dark 
                        days, I woulda hung myself in the 
                        bathroom without Oprah.

                                 JEFF
                        I made up my mind, ma.

                                 PATTY
                        This your idea or hers?

                                 JEFF
                        Why’s it matter?

           Patty finishes her wine, throws the glass into the woods.

                                 UNCLE BOB
                        If Oprah’s ya lifeline, ya got 
                        deeper issues, Patty.  I’m just 
                        saying.

                                 PATTY
                        GO FUCK YOURSELF, BOB!

           INT. BOSTON MEDICAL CENTER - ELEVATOR - DAY

           Patty in dark sunglasses stands behind Jeff’s wheelchair as 
           they take the elevator up. 
                                 JEFF
                        You still mad at me?

                                 PATTY
                        I’m not mad.  I’m disappointed.  
                        This girl broke your heart and now 
                        she makes all your decisions?

                                 JEFF
                        I love her, ma.

                                 PATTY
                        I love you too.

           The doors open and they are greeted by Erin holding a laptop 
           with Kevin Horst beside her.

                                 ERIN
                        Hey guys.  

                                 JEFF
                        Heavy Kevy!

                                 KEVIN
                        Good to see you, Jeff.

                                 ERIN
                        Kevin and I met with Jeff’s 
                        therapists at Spaulding this 
                        morning and the, just now, his 
                        doctors here at BMC.  We created a 
                        spreadsheet for the next couple 
                        weeks.   

                                 KEVIN
                        He’s been missing appointments. 

                                 ERIN
                        We can’t have him miss any more.  
                        Here’s your copy.

           She hands an excel sheet to Patty.

                                 KEVIN
                        Figured the three of us could tag 
                        team bringing him to his doctor 
                        appointments and rehab.

                                 PATTY
                        I could do all of them, it’s no 
                        problem.  
                                 ERIN
                        It’s totally fine, Patty.  Kevin 
                        and I took time off from work so we 
                        can help.

                                 JEFF
                        This is good, ma.  Just what I 
                        need.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY

           Jeff lies in bed, drenched in sweat, his stumps are raw and 
           open to the air.  Dr. Kalish leans over them with a plier-
           like tool in his hands.  

                                 DR KALISH
                        You want another minute to breathe?

           Jeff squeezes Erin’s hand.

                                 JEFF
                        Stop, please... no more...

                                 ERIN
                        We need to do this so they can fit 
                        your legs, Jeff.  

                                 JEFF
                        You’re not looking at my stumps, 
                        right?

                                 ERIN
                        I’m looking at you.

                                 JEFF
                        Do it.

           Kalish moves his PLIERS to remove the sharp METAL SUTURES 
           holding the large pieces of skin over Jeff’s raw, mottled 
           stumps.  Jeff SCREAMS...tears streaming down his face... 
           INHUMAN PAIN... 

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        Erin... please...

                                 ERIN
                        I’m here.

                                 DR KALISH
                        One more...

                                 JEFF
                        I can’t...
                                 ERIN
                        Jeff, you can do this.

           She takes both his hands, stares into his eyes.  She’s there 
           for him every moment of this...

                                 JEFF
                        Okay, do it.

           Kalish goes to work... more SCREAMS.  Jeff looks out the 
           window... sees an AMERICAN FLAG on a building across the 
           street... at HALF MAST.  He closes his eyes.  The pliers find 
           the metal and pull.

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        AHHHHHHHHHH!

           INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - SAME

           Patti, crying her eyes out, FLINCHES as she hears SCREAMING 
           from Jeff’s room.  Kevin holds her close.

           INT. JEFF’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Jeff lays out on his bed as Erin rubs his legs and wipes the 
           sweat off his forehead.  

                                 JEFF
                        Why did this happen to me?  I’m not 
                        rich.  I’m not famous.  I didn’t 
                        even vote.  It don’t make sense.

                                 ERIN
                        They just want to make people hurt.

                                 JEFF
                        Why?  Is it their religion and 
                        shit?

                                 ERIN
                        I don’t know.

                                 PATTY (O.C.)
                        Listen ta this one, Jeffrey!  
                        Listen to this.  From Denver, 
                        Colorado, “I’m sure you’ve heard 
                        this over and over again, but you 
                        are truly a hero.  I just want to 
                        thank you for being an inspiration 
                        to this entire nation...”  
                                 ERIN
                        Is she okay?

           OPPOSITE SIDE OF THE DOOR:

           Patty leans against it, letter in one hand, glass of wine in 
           the other.  She’s wasted.

                                 PATTY
                        “I’ve never seen a stronger, more 
                        resilient person in my life.”  
                             (lowers letter)
                        She’s talking about you. My son.  
                        The fucking hero.  We’re all 
                        rooting for ya.
                             (she sips)
                        Those fucking monsters. I’m glad 
                        that one got run over.
                             (sips)
                        We should go to Denver, baby. When 
                        you get better.  Just me and you.
                             (sips)
                        Ya gotta pee?  Lemme know if ya 
                        need help.  Don’t be embarrassed.  
                        I seen it before.  Ya penis.  When 
                        ya was...
                             (sips)
                        My baby boy.  They took everything 
                        from ya.    

           She spills her wine, sobs uncontrollably.

           JEFF’S ROOM

                                 ERIN
                        Has it always been like that?

                                 JEFF
                        Long as I remember.  Why?

                                 ERIN
                        I just... I feel bad.

                                 JEFF
                        Don’t feel bad.  This is what I 
                        come from.   

                                 ERIN
                        But you can be more than this, ya 
                        know that right?  

           She presses against Jeff.  But his eyes go someplace else...
           INT. SPAULDING REHAB FACILITY - DAY

           Jeff has his Genium legs on his stumps... he’s balancing on 
           parallel bars... shaking and covered in sweat... Kevin, Patty 
           and Erin watch nearby.

                                 JEFF
                        I can’t make ‘em move.

           Michele slides a piece of white paper under one of the feet.

                                 MICHELE
                        Focus on putting all your weight on 
                        the paper and kicking it backward.  
                        If you can move the paper, you can 
                        walk.

           Jeff STRAINS with all his might to move that leg... tendons 
           in his neck popping... his teeth gritting...

                                 PATTY
                        Don’t hurt yourself, baby!

                                 ERIN
                        Come on!  Push yourself!

                                 KEVIN
                        I think it’s moving... is it 
                        moving?

                                 JEFF
                        It’s not fucking moving!

           He collapses into Michele’s arms.  She eases him down.  

                                 MICHELE
                        That’s a good start, Jeff.

           As Michele takes the Genium legs off, Jeff stares out the 
           window.  

                                 ERIN
                        You’ll get it.  You just have to 
                        work harder.

                                 JEFF
                        This is me at ten, E.  When ya 
                        gonna figure that out?
           INT. BRICKHOUSE SPORTS BAR - NIGHT

           Sully and Big D sit at the table with Jeff, Erin and Gail 
           while the Red Sox highlights play in the background.  
           Everybody’s making the effort to bridge these two worlds.  

                                 ERIN
                        So what are you guys up to these 
                        days?

                                 BIG D
                        Besides Big Pimpin?  Paving for 
                        Uncle Bob.  

                                 SULLY
                        My stepdad got me a demo job over 
                        in Lowell.

                                 JEFF
                        He lives like two blocks from the 
                        job site. 

                                 BIG D
                        Which is good because he got his 
                        license yanked last week.

                                 GAIL
                        For what?

                                 BIG D
                        Blowing a .08.

                                 SULLY
                        Better’n who you blew last week.

                                 BIG D
                        Ya know why he’s so cranky?  He 
                        fucking walked here!

           The three boys bust out laughing.  The girls smile politely  
           Just then, the waitress brings a tray of fancy-looking shots.  

                                 WAITRESS
                        Ladies at the bar bought this 
                        round, folks.  Called Three Legged 
                        Monkeys.

                                 SULLY
                        That some kinda Hipster shot?

                                 BIG D
                        Ya never had a Three Legged Monkey?  
                        What’s wrong with you?
           Jeff looks over and sees two middle-aged women smiling at 
           him, misty eyed and emotional.  He gives them a wave.

                                 WAITRESS
                        They’d like to take a picture with 
                        you if that’s cool.

                                 JEFF
                        Not right now.

                                 SULLY
                        We still get to keep these though, 
                        right?

           They each take a shot and smell them.  

                                 ERIN
                        What’s in this?

                                 BIG D
                        Jim Beam, Wild Turkey and Jack.  
                        It’s quite delicious.

           Erin sniffs it... fights the urge to vomit.  Gail notices.

                                 JEFF
                        Ya don’t gotta drink it.

                                 ERIN
                        I’m driving.

                                 SULLY
                        I’ll have yours.

                                 GAIL
                        Hands off.  Hurley girls are tough 
                        as shit.

           Gail downs her shot, then Erin’s.  

                                 BIG D
                        SWEET JESUS!

           EXT. BRICKHOUSE - PARKING LOT

           Big D and Sully stand on the porch out on the porch while 
           Gail and Erin walk to their car. 

                                 ERIN
                        You sure you don’t wanna head home 
                        with me?
                                 JEFF
                        Nah, I’m gonna hang with my boys 
                        for a little bit.

                                 ERIN
                        You have rehab in the morning.

                                 JEFF
                        I’ll have D drop me off in like an 
                        hour.

           They girls get in their car and pull out.  The boys wave at 
           them. 

                                 SULLY
                        You guys want some pills?

           Sully digs into his pocket.

                                 BIG D
                        What are they?

                                 SULLY
                        Found them behind my sister’s 
                        dresser.  We’re either gonna get 
                        high as fuck or regulate our 
                        periods.

           The boys swallow the pills.

           INT. ERIN’S GALAPAGOS GREEN 2003 HONDA CIVIC - MOVING 

           Gail reaches over and plays with Erin’s hair.

                                 GAIL
                        Does he know yet? 

                                 ERIN
                        Know what?

                                 GAIL
                        Come on, Erin.  You can’t get 
                        something like that by your big 
                        sister.  

                                 ERIN
                        No.  I haven’t told him.

                                 GAIL
                        This is exactly what you didn’t 
                        want to happen.  You worked too 
                        hard.
                                 ERIN
                        You don’t know him like I do.  He’s 
                        going to be great.  You’ll see.  
                        He’s really changed.

           EXT. BRICKHOUSE PORCH - HANDICAP RAMP - NIGHT

           Jeff at the top of the ramp in his wheelchair.  Big D and 
           Sully wait at the bottom, beers in hand, barely standing.  

                                 JEFF
                        Ready?

                                 SULLY
                        Go!

           Jeff uses his hands to PROPEL himself down and he ROARS down 
           the ramp... controlling his speed... until he hits the bottom 
           and FLIES OUT OF HIS WHEELCHAIR and CRASHES into the grass.

           It looks painful but Jeff is laughing his ass off.  Sully and 
           Big D walk over, barely able to breathe they’re laughing so 
           hard.

                                 BIG D
                        I give that a solid 7!

                                 SULLY
                        7!  That was a fucking 6.

                                 JEFF
                        Bullshit!  You see the lift I got?

                                 BIG D
                        You shat all over the landing, bro.

                                 JEFF
                        Push me back up... I’m going again.

           They push him back up.  Just then, a group four of Out-of-
           Towners (not from Chelmsford, that is), mid fifties, two 
           older couples with Boston Strong hoodies and Red Sox shirts 
           walk out and recognize Jeff.

                                 OUT-OF-TOWNER
                        Oh my God, it’s him. It’s Jeff 
                        Bauman.  

                                 OUT-OF-TOWNER #2
                        From the picture?

           The group pauses for a moment, then walk over to him.  
                                 OUT-OF-TOWNER 2
                        Young man.  I’d like to shake your 
                        hand.

                                 JEFF
                        Who do you think I am?

                                 OUT-OF-TOWNER 2
                        Aren’t you Jeff Bauman?

           Sully senses something’s off.

                                 BIG D
                        He’s way too ugly to be Jeff 
                        Bauman.  Jeff Bauman got those 
                        chestnut eyes.

                                 SULLY
                        This ain’t Jeff Bauman.  This is 
                        Skip. He’s a local drunken fixture 
                        here in Chelmsford. Lost his legs 
                        water skiing offa Hampton Beach.

                                 OUT-OF-TOWNER 2
                        Water skiing?

                                 BIG D
                        Shark bit them off.  

                                 SULLY
                        But the boat kept pulling him.  
                        That’s why we call him “Skip.”  

           The confused Out-of-towners walk off.  

                                 JEFF
                        We gonna do this or what?

           Sully and Big D get to the end of the ramp.

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        Ready?

           He pushes HARDER than last time... he’s picking up speed... 
           ROARING down... no slowing at all... wheelchair hits the 
           bottom and Jeff is LAUNCHED... in the air.. arms 
           outstretched... stupid grin on his face, tongue sticking 
           out... seems to FREEZE weightless like that for a moment 
           before SMASHING HARD into Sully and Big D and they all spread 
           out onto the grass... 

           Sully and Big D writhe in pain, their noses and lips bleeding 
           from impact...
                                 BIG D
                        Dude!  That hurt!

                                 SULLY
                        Not cool!

           Jeff crawls back to his chair.

                                 JEFF
                        Again.

           EXT. PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           Sully and Big D, who can barely stand at this point, their 
           faces are blotchy and bloody from Jeff tackling them, shove 
           the wheelchair into the trunk of Big D’s V6 Impala.  

                                 BIG D
                        That Skip joke... very 
                        disappointing... I expect more from 
                        ya, Sully.

                                 SULLY
                        I’ll try harder next time.

           Big D pulls out his keys, sits behind the wheel.

                                 BIG D
                        Guys.  I shouldn’t be operating 
                        machinery.  

           Sully pushes him into the back where he passes out.

                                 SULLY
                        Go sleep back there.  Gimme the 
                        keys.  

                                 JEFF
                        Ya license was yanked.

                                 SULLY
                        So?

                                 JEFF
                        So they’ll throw ya in jail.  

                                 SULLY
                        Gotta get ya home before ya wife 
                        kills ya.

                                 JEFF
                        She’s not my wife.  Gimme the 
                        fucking keys.  
           He pulls himself over to the driver’s seat.

                                 SULLY
                        Do you still have a license?

                                 JEFF
                        They don’t take it away when you 
                        lose your fucking legs, dumbass.

                                 SULLY
                        Oh, a course.

           Jeff starts the car and sits there.  Sully in the passenger 
           seat, waiting.

                                 SULLY (CONT’D)
                        Wait a second.  How you gonna reach 
                        the pedals.

                                 JEFF
                        Get down there and press it for me.

                                 SULLY
                        Is that safe though?

                                 JEFF
                        No.

                                 SULLY
                        Okay.  

           Sully flops to the floor and JAMS the gas pedal with his palm 
           and the Impala ROARS across the gravel lot.  Jeff gains 
           control, yanks the wheel.

                                 JEFF
                        BRAKE!  BRAKE!

           Sully hits the brake and they narrowly miss a parked car.  

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        Okay, easy now.

           They accelerate and Jeff steers them out of the parking lot.

                                 BIG D
                        Who the fuck’s driving?

                                 SULLY
                        Go back ta sleep, ya alcoholic.

           Big D passes out again.
           EXT. CHELMSFORD BACK ROAD - NIGHT

           The Impala is flying down a street.  

                                 SULLY
                        What’s going on? 

                                 JEFF
                        Let’s go faster.

           Sully hits the gas harder.  Speedometer goes from 65... 70...

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        Faster.

           Sully pushes harder.  80... 85... 90...  That Impala has some 
           balls... keeps giving them power...

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        Faster.

                                 SULLY
                        It’s floored!

           95...100... something’s off with Jeff.  His eyes are a little 
           checked out... he doesn’t seem to know what’s going on... 
           like he doesn’t care if they crash and die...

           BLUE LIGHTS BEHIND HIM.

                                 JEFF
                        Shit!  COPS!

           Sully SLAMS THE BRAKES with both hands.

           EXT. ROAD - SAME

           The Impala PAINTS THE ASPHALT WITH HOT RUBBER as it SPINS in 
           a full 180 and STOPS in the middle of road.  Smoke RISES from 
           the street.

           The Squad Car has to VEER off almost into the woods to avoid 
           hitting them.

           After a moment, the COP, clean cut in his thirties, bounds up 
           to the door with his flashlight and hand on the butt of his 
           Glock.

                                 COP
                        LEMME SEE YOUR FUCKING HANDS!  NOW!

           Jeff throws his hands in the air as the cop approaches.  Mag 
           light SHINES into the car and sees three things: 
           1. Big D still asleep in the back seat.

           2. Sully pops up from below Jeff looking like he was giving 
           him head.

           3. Jeff has no legs.  

                                 JEFF
                        Is there a problem, officer?

           The cop shines his light in Jeff’s face.

                                 COP
                        Are you Jeff Bauman?

           EXT. PATTY’S APARTMENT COMPLEX - NIGHT

           The Squad Car pulls up with Jeff’s wheelchair in the trunk.  
           Instantly, Patty is out there in her bathrobe... Erin a few 
           steps behind.

                                 PATTY
                        JEFFREY!  WHAT HAPPENED!

           The Cop gets out of the car.

                                 COP
                        Everything is fine, ma’am.  Just 
                        some car trouble.

                                 JEFF
                        I was just letting off some steam.

                                 ERIN
                        You have rehab in five hours!

                                 JEFF
                        I’ll be fine...

                                 ERIN
                        You promised to take this 
                        seriously!

                                 PATTY
                        Boys will be boys, what are ya 
                        gonna do?  Tell him not ta have any 
                        friends?

                                 ERIN
                        He just lost his legs!
                                 PATTY
                        And maybe you don’t gotta remind 
                        him every ten fucking minutes!

           Erin storms inside.

                                 JEFF
                        Erin! I’m sorry! 

           Jeff wheels after Erin.  

           INT. PATTY’S CAR - MOVING

           Jeff in the front seat while Patty drives, she’s smoking and 
           he looks hungover as hell.  Erin in the back, seething.

                                 PATTY
                        Ya woke right up this morning, hon.  
                        Even after all those beers.  Proud 
                        a ya.

           She pats his knee-- then quickly withdraws her hand.

           INT. SPAULDING REHAB FACILITY - DAY

           Jeff in his wheelchair, rolls up to see Kevin, Aunt Jen, Big 
           Jeff, Uncle Bob and Aunt Karen all standing there surrounded 
           by REPORTERS and CAMERAS from all the local stations.

                                 ERIN
                        Jeff doesn’t want to do interviews.

                                 AUNT JEN
                        These ain’t interviews.  They’re 
                        just gonna take some pictures of 
                        him on his new legs.  Show the 
                        whole world how strong he is.

                                 PATTY
                        What’s the big deal?  Lotta people 
                        need to see hope right now.  Know I 
                        do.

                                 ERIN
                        Jeff has to worry about himself.

                                 PATTY
                        Agreed. But don’t mean he can’t hit 
                        two birds with one fucking stone 
                        here.

           JEFF WITH HIS GENIUMS ON...
           Michele stands behind him as he reaches for the parallel 
           bars.  He “stands” and balances there for a second.  He 
           raises his arms and CAMERAS SNAP.  

                                 REPORTER
                        How about a couple steps?

                                 ERIN
                        You don’t have to if you don’t want 
                        to.

                                 JEFF
                        It’s fine.

           Michele puts a piece of paper under his “foot.”  He strains 
           to move it... CAMERAS SNAPPING... he leans.

                                 MICHELE
                        Don’t lean.

           He STRAINS.  PHOTOS SNAPPING.  He overcompensates and CRASHES 
           on his ass hard.

                                 MICHELE (CONT’D)
                        Okay, please get the cameras out of 
                        here.

           Jeff tries to shrug it off but he hit pretty hard.

           EXT. BOYLSTON STREET - DAY

           A makeshift MEMORIAL has been created on the bombing site... 
           a maze cordoned off by barriers... thousands of FLOWERS and 
           SNEAKERS and STUFFED ANIMALS, hand-made memorials, names of 
           the KILLED and INJURED... 

           Kevin and Erin push Jeff on a wheelchair through the maze.

                                 JEFF
                        Why you gotta bring me here?

                                 KEVIN
                        To show you that this isn’t a small 
                        deal, Jeff.  You have to accept 
                        responsibility in your recovery.

                                 JEFF
                        I am.
                                 KEVIN
                        You have to work harder for this 
                        than you’ve ever worked for 
                        anything in your life.  Erin and I 
                        aren’t sure you understand this.

           They reach the end of the maze... right in front of the Old 
           South Church where a big yellow sign surrounded by ribbons 
           reads “LOVE IS LOUDER.”

                                 ERIN
                        I’ll fight for you, Jeff.  Always.  
                        But I won’t stand by and watch you 
                        give up.  

           They leave him there to look at the sign.

           INT. PATTY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Erin and Patty in the middle of a yelling match.  Jeff on the 
           couch, playing video games.

                                 PATTY
                        He’ll be on National Television!  
                        Helping the fucking Red Sox!

                                 ERIN
                        Jeff throwing out a pitch is going 
                        to help them win?

                                 PATTY
                        Fact that you ask that shows how 
                        little you know about baseball! He 
                        owes Boston!

                                 ERIN
                        You can’t owe a whole city!  

                                 PATTY
                        He’s doing great, can’t you just 
                        admit that?

                                 ERIN
                        He’s in a lot more pain than you 
                        admit.

                                 PATTY
                        Just because he don’t whine all the 
                        time like you folks from 
                        Amesbury...
                                 ERIN
                        I gave up everything to be here. My 
                        job, my apartment, seeing my 
                        family. 

                                 PATTY
                        But unlike the rest of us, you can 
                        just walk out here any minute and 
                        start over.  Once the spotlight 
                        gets cold, I’m sure you’ll do just 
                        that.

                                 ERIN
                        I may be from Amesbury but if you 
                        make another accusation like that 
                        I’ll punch you in the face, Patti!

                                 PATTY
                        Jeff, did you hear what she said ta 
                        me?

           They look in the living room... Jeff’s gone...

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT

           Jeff is rolling under streetlights in his wheelchair... every 
           three spins he reaches between his stumps and takes a drag on 
           a bottle of Jack Daniels...

           Finally, a car pulls over beside him.

                                 BIG D
                        Hey sexy.  Want a ride?

           INT. HONG KONG RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           An infamous restaurant/lounge that locals go to when they 
           want the stiffest, cheapest drink in town... the place has a 
           dance floor and a bar and hasn’t been updated since the 70’s.  

           Aunt Jen and Dale are dancing together to the EAGLES on the 
           jukebox... both wasted... at the bar, Jeff in his chair 
           beside Big D and Sully as Uncle Bob guzzle their beers. Sully 
           lights up a cigarette.  

                                 CHINESE BARTENDER
                        You can’t smoke in here.

           Sully, eyes like slits he’s so cocked...

                                 SULLY
                        Fuck you.
                                 BIG D 
                        He meant to say we’re with Jeff 
                        Bauman.  

           The bartender sees Jeff and walks away.

                                 SULLY
                        He’s Chinese.

                                 JEFF
                        I’m getting next round.

           He wheels over to the bar.  

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        Four Mai Tais!

           He reaches for his wallet and a big, calloused hand stops 
           him.

                                 TOWNIE
                        You’re that dude from the 
                        wheelchair, right? 

           Jeff looks up and sees three BURLY TOWNIES in Carharts, 
           workboots and tattered Red Sox hats, just off a construction 
           job.

                                 TOWNIE (CONT’D)
                        The one in the picture with the guy 
                        in the fucking cowboy hat? 

                                 JEFF
                        Yeah.

                                 TOWNIE 
                        Dude, we were doing a job like ten 
                        blocks away when that bomb went 
                        off.  Fucking nuts, right?

                                 JEFF
                        I know.  I was there.

           The Townies laugh.

                                 TOWNIE
                        Round of Jack!  Put your wallet 
                        away, on us.  Hey, can we take a 
                        picture?

                                 JEFF
                        Sure.

           The guys lean in for a pic.
                                 TOWNIE
                        My wife’s not gonna believe I met 
                        the wheelchair guy.

                                 JEFF
                        You guys have a great night.

                                 TOWNIE
                        What about your shot of Jack?

                                 JEFF
                        Sure.

           They each hold up their shot and knock it back.

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        Thanks.

                                 TOWNIE
                        Another!

           He starts to roll away but the Townie stops the wheelchair 
           with his steel-toed boot.

                                 TOWNIE (CONT’D)
                        They say the bombing never really 
                        happened.

                                 JEFF
                        Who says that?

                                 TOWNIE
                        All over the internet.  Mainstream 
                        media ignores it but there’s these 
                        websites that aren’t afraid to talk 
                        about it, man. Showed pics of the 
                        bombing that don’t add up.

           He hands Jeff another shot of Jack.

                                 TOWNIE (CONT’D)
                        They say you’re this Gulf War vet 
                        the government hired... like an 
                        actor... total black ops shit that 
                        Obama faked so we can go to war 
                        with Syria or some shit.  

                                 JEFF
                        I ain’t an actor.

                                 TOWNIE
                        Okay.  Then let me see your stumps.  
           Jeff takes his shotglass and CHUCKS it at the guy’s face.  
           The guy jumps back, whisky in his eyes.

                                 TOWNIE (CONT’D)
                        You chipped my fucking tooth!

           He winds his arm up to swing at Jeff, who sits in his 
           wheelchair with his fists up.

                                 JEFF
                        Come on!  HIT ME!  

           Before he can do anything, Uncle Bob swings a chair that 
           CRACKS the Townie upside the head.  Townie goes down... Uncle 
           Bob, Sully and Big D start SWINGING at the other.

           But they’re big and they deal just as much damage as they 
           take... it’s messy and clumsy but people are getting hurt 
           quick...

           Jeff tries to swing but pathetically misses again and 
           again...

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        Somebody HIT ME! 

           The big Townie gets to his feet again and cocks back his arm 
           and HITS JEFF out of his chair... Jeff hits his forehead on a 
           TABLE with a CRACK.  Flops to the ground.  Dudes stomping all 
           around him.

                                 AUNT JEN
                        JEFFIE!

           Aunt Jen lifts up Dale’s shirt and pulls a GLOCK 17 OUT OF 
           HIS WAISTBAND and FIRES into the ceiling.

                                 AUNT JEN (CONT’D)
                        NEXT COCKSUCKER WHO TOUCHES MY 
                        NEPHEW GETS BLASTED IN THE FUCKING 
                        NUTSACK!

           The Townies, their faces cut up and bleeding, see the gun and 
           hold up their hands.

                                 AUNT JEN (CONT’D)
                        GET THE FUCK OUTTA HERE!

           They stumble out of there.  This gives Sully and Big D, faces 
           busted up, the chance to get to their feet. 

           Uncle Bob snatches the gun from her hands.
                                 UNCLE BOB
                        Whattsa matter with you?  We’re not 
                        in fucking Lowell!

           EXT. HONG KONG RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           A few cop cars, lights flashing, taking statements.  But it’s 
           clear by the way Uncle Bob is laughing with them and 
           reenacting the Aunt Jen’s big moment that nothing is going to 
           happen.   

                                 UNCLE BOB
                             (pointing his finger like 
                              a gun)
                        Next motherfucker touches Jeff gets 
                        his balls blown off!

           The cops are laughing their asses off.

           Erin’s car pulls away with Jeff in the passenger seat... 
           Sully, Big D, Uncle Bob, Aunt Jen and Dale all wave as he 
           pulls out... hell, even the cops wave...

           INT. ERIN’S GALAPAGOS GREEN 2003 HONDA CIVIC - MOVING 

           As she drives through the streets of Chelmsford, Jeff sits in 
           the front seat quietly, a packet of ice against his bruised 
           head.  

                                 ERIN
                        This doesn’t work for me!  You 
                        aren’t healthy enough to metabolize 
                        alcohol and... dammit... I can’t 
                        keep doing this!  Your mother 
                        screaming at me... I haven’t seen 
                        my family in weeks!  And you’re 
                        going to miss rehab again and--

                                 JEFF
                        Fuck it.

                                 ERIN
                        Fuck what?

                                 JEFF
                        Rehab.  Life.  All of it.  Just 
                        fuck it all.

                                 ERIN
                        Why are you talking like that?
                                 JEFF
                        Because it’s all bullshit. 

                                 ERIN
                        What is?

                                 JEFF
                        You know how easy it was for them 
                        to just blow me the fuck up?  
                        Nobody wants to talk about that.  
                        But that’s how life is now.  One 
                        second you’re standing there and 
                        then BOOM ya never stand again! 

           He PUNCHES the dashboard, cracks it. 

                                 ERIN
                        Stop it.  You’re scaring me.

                                 JEFF
                        You should be scared.  

                                 ERIN
                        Please...

                                 JEFF
                        I could have them killed.  The 
                        bomber.  Tamerlan.  I could have 
                        his wife and kid killed and nobody 
                        would even know.  Just like that.  
                        BLAM!  It’d be so easy.  Because 
                        after like two weeks, nobody would 
                        even care.  

           Erin pulls the car over in the parking lot of their apartment 
           building.

                                 ERIN
                        Stop!

                                 JEFF
                        I could kill them!  I could kill 
                        you, I could kill myself and nobody 
                        would ever fucking CARE!

                                 ERIN
                        I don’t want to hear this anymore!

                                 JEFF
                        YOU NEED TO HEAR!

                                 ERIN
                        STOP!
                                 JEFF
                        Why are you crying?  I’m the one 
                        they fucking blew up.

                                 ERIN
                        I’M PREGNANT!

                                 JEFF
                        What?

                                 ERIN
                        Two months.  

                                 JEFF
                        But we only...

                                 ERIN
                        One time, I know... but it 
                        happened.

                                 JEFF
                        I can’t have a baby. 

                                 ERIN
                        I won’t give up one more thing for 
                        you.  I gave up my job, my family, 
                        my whole life... but not this... 
                        this is bigger than you, bigger 
                        than the bombing...

                                 JEFF
                        I can’t...

                                 ERIN
                        With you or without you, I...

                                 JEFF
                        I can’t!

           He HITS the dashboard AGAIN AND AGAIN.  Just PUNCHES THE SHIT 
           OUT OF IT.  

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        I can’t!  I can’t!

           Plastic SHATTERS and knobs and dials go flying...Jeff’s 
           knuckles SPLAYED open...

                                 JEFF (CONT'D)
                        I CAN’T!

           Erin is frozen... blood SPATTERS her in the face.  
                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        I can’t!  

           She opens the door and LUNGES out.

           EXT. PARKING LOT - SAME

           Erin bounds towards the apartment... the door to the car 
           opens and Jeff FLOPS out on his belly... 

                                 JEFF
                        Don’t walk away from me!

           He crawls like an alligator across the parking lot... his 
           bloody hands pulling him... 

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        Erin!

           Dogs start barking.  Lights POP on from apartments overhead.

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        Minda ya own fucking business!

           Erin unlocks the door to the apartment, slams it behind her.

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        Wait!

           He crawls... over gravel and stones and empty cans and 
           cigarette butts... he PUKES, but keeps crawling towards that 
           door... he’s covered in mud and blood and puke when he 
           reaches it... pushes the door open with a bloody handprint...

           INT. PATTY’S APARTMENT - SAME

           He crawls inside.

                                 JEFF
                        Erin!

           He looks at the couch... Patty is passed out drunk with an 
           empty glass in one hand, a burnt-out cigarette in the 
           other... LETTERS STREWN ABOUT HER LAP.

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        Don’t walk away from me!

           He crawls to his bedroom door... it’s locked.  He SLAMS his 
           fists.
                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        OPEN THE FUCKING DOOR!

           He reaches for the doorknob... 

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        OPEN IT!

           He rises and “stands” on his stumps... all his weight on the 
           bones of his thighbones... agonizing pain... he SLAMS ON THE 
           DOOR.

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        OPEN THE FUCKING DOOR!

           He grabs the doorknob and PULLS... then FALLS onto his 
           back... spent... sobbing... 

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        I can’t do this anymore... I 
                        can’t...

           He closes his eyes, passes out.  After a moment the door 
           opens.  Erin stands there, pulls him into the room.

           INT. JEFF’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Jeff lying there, bandaged and cleaned up.  Erin sits on the 
           bed next to him, her suitcase by her feet. She leans down and 
           kisses him.  

           INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME

           Erin steps over Patty, walks out the front door.  As the foor 
           CLACKS shut, Patty opens her eyes.

                                 PATTY
                        What?  Who was that?

           She pulls herself to her feet.  Walks over to Jeff’s room, 
           tries the door.  It’s locked.  She pound on the door.

                                 PATTY (CONT’D)
                        Open up!  I gotta talk to you!

           She lights a new cigarette.

                                 PATTY (CONT’D)
                        She’s wrong, Jeffrey!  The Red Sox 
                        are the heart of Boston and when 
                        they ask ya for something, ya give 
                        it to them.

                        it, whole city’s gonna abandon ya 
                        and move on and then what?  Ya have 
                        nothing.  And take it from me, 
                        baby.  Being passed over fucking 
                        sucks!

           He in his bed... eyes open... head spinning... his world 
           falling apart.

           EXT. PATTY’S APARTMENT COMPLEX - DAY

           Patty, now sober, smoking a cigarette and pacing with worry 
           outside her front door. Big Jeff bounds out of the apartment.

                                 BIG JEFF
                        How long he been in there?

                                 PATTY
                        Three days.  He won’t eat, won’t 
                        let anybody in.  What are we gonna 
                        do?

                                 BIG JEFF
                        Bust the door down.

                                 PATTY
                        You can’t bash through this problem 
                        like you bash through everything 
                        else in ya life!

                                 BIG JEFF
                        Stop blaming me, would ya?  Gonna 
                        get us nowhere.

                                 PATTY
                        Okay... you’re right... 

                                 BIG JEFF
                        I am?

           They take a beat, considering how momentous that just was.

                                 BIG JEFF (CONT’D)
                        Now that that miracle just fucking 
                        happened, what are we gonna do?  
           INT. PATTY’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Patti, Big Jeff, Uncle Bob, Aunt Karen, Aunt Jen, Sully and 
           Big D all gathered around outside the door as Kevin knocks.

                                 KEVIN
                        Jeff?  It’s me, Kevin.  Jeff, can 
                        you please open the door?

           No response.  

                                 KEVIN (CONT’D)
                        I’m going to say some things that 
                        might not sound very nice.  And you 
                        know how hard that is for me.  None 
                        of us can possibly know what you 
                        are going through.  But we all care 
                        about you and we’re all fighting 
                        for you and the last thing we want 
                        to see is you give up.  You owe us 
                        to not give up, Jeff.  So can you 
                        please, as payback for all those 
                        times I let you leave early to 
                        watch the Sox, please just open the 
                        door and let me in?

           The door unlocks.  Kevin steps in.

           INT. JEFF’S BEDROOM - SAME

           Kevin sees Jeff crawl back into bed.  He looks terrible... 
           unshaven, a mess...

                                 KEVIN
                        Thank you for letting me in.

                                 JEFF
                        What do you want me to say?

                                 KEVIN
                        I want you to tell me what you’re 
                        feeling.

                                 JEFF
                        Why?

                                 KEVIN
                        Because you’re not alone.  

                                 JEFF
                        Yes I am.
                                 KEVIN
                        There’s a whole room of people out 
                        there...

                                 JEFF
                        Nobody understands.

                                 KEVIN
                        Then tell me.  Please Jeff.  Tell 
                        me or I’ll fire you from Costco.  
                        That’s not true.  I’d never do 
                        that.  Please though... talk to 
                        me...

                                 JEFF
                        It was all my fault.

                                 KEVIN
                        What was?

                                 JEFF
                        The bomb.  All the victims, losing 
                        their legs, their arms... their 
                        lives... I saw the guy... I saw him 
                        and I should have done something 
                        but I didn’t.  You know why I 
                        didn’t?  Because who the fuck is 
                        Jeff Bauman?

                                 KEVIN
                        You’re a hero.

                                 JEFF
                        For standing on a corner and 
                        getting blown up?  All my life, I 
                        never done a thing that means shit.  
                        They call me a Hero?  You kidding 
                        me?  That a joke?  

           Kevin sits beside him on the bed.  He puts his arm around 
           him.

                                 KEVIN
                        Most of are just regular people, 
                        Jeff.  We’re not equipped to deal 
                        with this kind of thing.  That’s 
                        why they target us.  But you’re a 
                        hero because you could have been 
                        any one of us.  You took that blast 
                        so we wouldn’t have to.  

                                 JEFF
                        I was a fucking loser, Kevy.  Now 
                        I’m a loser with no legs.   
           Jeff is crying.

                                 KEVIN
                        I want to take you to lunch to meet 
                        someone.

                                 JEFF
                        Who?

           INT. CHELMSFORD SEAFOOD RESTAURANT - DAY

           Jeff, now cleaned up a little, sits silently at a table in 
           the backroom... waiting... Kevin opens the door and leads HIM 
           in... the MAN IN THE COWBOY HAT.  CARLOS ARRENDONDO... he is 
           a vibrant presence, crisp shirt and sparkly eyes, speaks with 
           accent. 

                                 KEVIN
                        This is Carlos.

                                 CARLOS
                        We met once before.

                                 JEFF
                        Yah.  I remember.

                                 CARLOS
                        Your friend here asked to meet.  I 
                        said anything for Jeff Bauman.  
                        He’s a hero.

                                 JEFF
                        I seem to recall you saving my 
                        bloody ass, not the other way 
                        around.

                                 CARLOS
                        It is good for you to make jokes.  
                        Shows you have fight in you.  

           Carlos sits across from him.  He takes off his cowboy hat, 
           puts it in the center of the table.

                                 CARLOS (CONT’D)
                        I understand you are having trouble 
                        seeing the meaning in the 
                        situation, yes?

                                 JEFF
                        You could say that.
                                 CARLOS
                        I would like to tell you a story, 
                        Jeff.  My story.  Is the easiest 
                        way to show you what I feel.  Is 
                        this okay?    

                                 JEFF
                        I guess so.

                                 CARLOS
                        I come to this country long time 
                        ago, not the legal way, you 
                        understand?  My two boys, Alex and 
                        Brian, were born here in Boston. 
                        They were American citizens, which 
                        made me so happy, you can imagine.  
                        Alex joined the Marine Corps as 
                        soon as he graduate high school.  
                        To pay for his college, you know.  
                        And to fight for this country which 
                        his father loved so much he snuck 
                        in. On my 44th birthday, Jeff, I 
                        was staying close to the phone so 
                        Alex could call me from Iraq.  
                        Nothing a man loves more than a 
                        call from his child on this day.  
                        Instead, a van pulled up in front 
                        of my house and when I saw three 
                        Marines, I knew this was not good 
                        news.  He had been killed in 
                        action. May I have some more water?

           The WAITRESS, who has been hypnotized by the story as much as 
           Jeff and Kevin, pours him water from her pitcher.

                                 CARLOS (CONT’D)
                        I don't remember finding the 
                        gasoline can and the blow torch and 
                        locking myself into their van… I 
                        don't remember lighting myself on 
                        fire.  But I do remember the van 
                        exploding in a ball of flame and I 
                        am sailing through the air. If not 
                        for those Marines, who had seen 
                        horrible accidents like this in 
                        war... they saved me.  I burned up 
                        a third of my body.  Had to go to 
                        my boy's funeral on a stretcher so 
                        I could apologize to him.

                                 JEFF
                        Why would you have to apologize?
                                 CARLOS
                        For not being able to save him.  I 
                        went through months of physical 
                        therapy.  People wanted me to go to 
                        jail for blowing up that van, which 
                        was government property you know.  
                        When I got well enough to walk, I 
                        put American flags on my pickup 
                        truck and drove around the country 
                        with my son's photograph and his 
                        uniform folded on passenger seat.  
                        I spoke out against the war 
                        wherever they would hear me.  They 
                        beat me up.  Spit on me.  Called me 
                        racially insensitive names.  But 
                        this was the only way I could serve 
                        my son's memory.  I talked to 
                        anyone who would listen. And there 
                        were many who did listen…But in my 
                        quest, I did not notice that my 
                        youngest boy Brian was having 
                        troubles.  He idolized his brother 
                        and the loss pushed him to drugs 
                        and depression.  On December 19, 
                        2011, seven years after his brother 
                        fell in Najaf, my Brian took his 
                        own life.  Just a few days before 
                        the last troops came home from that 
                        war.  At his funeral, I apologized 
                        once again… because I could not 
                        save him either.  But I did not 
                        quit.  Because my sons, they had 
                        given me a reason not to quit.  
                        Everything I do, I do in their 
                        names.  This is my purpose now.  To 
                        honor those who were killed in 
                        action, or fell by their own hand 
                        after struggling with PTSD. This is 
                        why I was there at the finish line 
                        for the Marathon that day, handing 
                        out American flags.  When the first 
                        bomb went off, I looked up and saw 
                        a ball of fire.  And while everyone 
                        ran away, I crossed myself and said 
                        GOD PROTECT ME and I ran towards 
                        the flames. I jumped over the 
                        barricade, into the smoke… and then 
                        I saw you, Jeff.  The man with no 
                        legs.  God sent me to you, Jeff. 

                                 JEFF
                        How does that make me a hero?

                        You set me free.  

                                 JEFF
                        I don’t understand.

                                 CARLOS
                        I was not able to be there for my 
                        sons.  But I was there for you, 
                        Jeff. I didn't save you.  You saved 
                        me. 

           Carlos reaches out across the table and takes Jeff’s hand.  

                                 CARLOS (CONT’D)
                        There is a purpose in everything.  
                        You just have to look for it.

           Kevin tries to hide his sobbing.  The Waitress, who is 
           sobbing herself, hands him a napkin. 

           INT. DUNKIN DONUTS - DAY

           Aunt Jen hands out coffees while everyone-- Patty, Big Jeff, 
           Csilla, Dale, Big D, Sully, Uncle Bob and Aunt Karen gather 
           around.

                                 PATTY
                        We’re all here, Jeffrey.  Tell us 
                        ya big news.

                                 JEFF
                        Okay.  It’s time I told you all the 
                        truth about something.  I’m not 
                        doing good.

                                 SULLY
                        Ya sick or something?

                                 AUNT JEN
                        Ohmigod!  Is it cancer?

                                 JEFF
                        What?  

                                 AUNT KAREN
                        Is it a tumor?

                                 JEFF
                        No!
                                 BIG JEFF
                        What the hell is it then?  Ya got 
                        us all terrified here.

                                 JEFF
                        Seriously, you all don’t have a 
                        clue what I might not be doing good 
                        about?  

                                 BIG D
                             (tentative)
                        The legs?

                                 AUNT JEN 
                        Gotta be the legs.

                                 SULLY
                        I’m going with legs too.  Can we 
                        share an answer, Jeff?  

                                 JEFF
                        This ain’t a fucking quiz!  Look... 
                        I’ve been hiding a lot from you 
                        all... the pain.  The nightmares.  
                        The, ya know, suicidal thoughts.  
                        Been hiding it.

                                 PATTY
                        Ya been lying to me all this time!

                                 JEFF
                        It’s not exactly lying.  

                                 SULLY
                        I’ve been crying in the shower for 
                        two months, afraid to show any 
                        emotion around ya!

                                 AUNT KAREN
                        Jeff, that wasn’t very nice to do 
                        to him.

                                 BIG JEFF
                        Why couldn’t ya show us your 
                        goddamn emotions, Jeff?

                                 JEFF
                        Ya wanna know why?  Really wanna 
                        know?  Because all of you people 
                        are fucking disasters, that’s why!

                                 PATTY
                        We’re not that bad.
                                 JEFF
                        You want me to elaborate?
                             (to Uncle Bob)
                        Uncle Bob can’t go ten minutes 
                        without busting balls so he won’t 
                        gotta feel real emotion.
                             (to Sully)
                        Sully’s only person here drunker 
                        and lazier’n me.
                             (to Big D)
                        D uses his college degree to pave 
                        roads and complain about sports.  
                             (Aunt Jen)
                        Aunt Jen thinks we’re on real 
                        housewives of fucking Chelmsford.
                             (to Dale)
                        He never speaks.
                             (to Aunt Karen)
                        Aunt Karen... actually you are a 
                        sweet person.
                             (to Big Jeff)
                        Pop, you got the emotional 
                        sensitivity of a fucking caveman.
                             (to Patty)
                        And ma... Jesus Christ, I don’t 
                        even know where to start.

           Patty starts crying.

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        Okay, I’ll start there.  You know 
                        why I don’t show any emotions?  
                        ‘Cause you used ‘em all up!

           Everyone is stunned.

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        I actually feel a lot better now.  
                        Look, you’re all fucked up but I 
                        wouldn’t trade ya guys for 
                        anything.  I love you guys.  But 
                        I’m not gonna hide anymore.  You 
                        know what I’m gonna do?

           Jeff pauses so someone can answer him.

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        How come nobody is asking me what 
                        I’m gonna do?

                                 UNCLE BOB
                        Ya got us all so freaked out here, 
                        Jeff.  We don’t know what to say.
                                 JEFF
                        I’m gonna get better.  That’s what 
                        I’m gonna do.  Because this shit 
                        happened to me for a reason.

                                 PATTY
                        What’s the reason?

                                 JEFF
                        I’m still figuring that out.  And I 
                        got a lot of hard work ahead of me 
                        with the rehab and all that shit.  
                        But I’m ready for that.  And I’m 
                        ready for something else.  Ma, ya 
                        still got the Red Sox phone number?  

                                 PATTY
                        Yeah.  Why?

                                 JEFF
                        I’m gonna throw out that first 
                        pitch like they asked. 

           Sully, Big D, Big Jeff and Uncle Bob wince and share a glance 
           with each other.

                                 UNCLE BOB
                        Ya sure about that?

                                 BIG D 
                        Ya second time in a public place.  
                        National TV.

                                 SULLY
                        All them eyes on ya.

                                 BIG JEFF
                        Lotta pressure.

                                 JEFF
                        You guys don’t think I can do it?

                                 BIG JEFF
                        It’s just... been a rough season, 
                        Jeffie.  

                                 UNCLE BOB
                        Boston needs a win right now.  

                                 BIG D
                        Part of our fucking healing, ya 
                        know?
                                 SULLY
                        Sox losing when we’re all feeling 
                        like this... that could be the 
                        worst thing to happen to Boston in 
                        years.

                                 UNCLE BOB
                        Second worse.

                                 SULLY
                        Right, second worse.

                                 BIG D
                        I’m gonna tell it to ya straight, 
                        bro.  Ya throw it in the stands 
                        right now, that could jinx the rest 
                        of the season.  

                                 SULLY
                        National hero or not, city never 
                        forgive ya.

           All eyes on Jeff. 

                                 JEFF
                        Fuck it.  I’m gonna do it and you 
                        assholes gonna help me.

           EXT. DUNKIN DONUTS PARKING LOT - DAY

           Jeff in his wheelchair, shirt sleeves rolled up, HUCKS a 
           baseball... WAY OVER BIG D’s HEAD... out into traffic... hits 
           the windshield of a passing car that HONKS!  

                                 UNCLE BOB
                        Fuck ‘em, they got Vermont plates!

           Everyone laughs... and we see that they’re all there drinking 
           beers outta coolers... a big crowd of Chelmsford folks have 
           gathered... somebody dragged a BBQ out... it’s a makeshift 
           block party.

                                 BIG D
                        Try side-arm.

                                 JEFF
                        I don’t throw that way.

                                 BIG D
                        Ya don’t got legs so ya got no 
                        leverage.
                                 SULLY
                        Listen ta him.  He played college 
                        ball.

                                 BIG D
                        Fuck you, Sully!

                                 SULLY
                        That where we are, D?  I can’t even 
                        compliment ya without ya taking 
                        fucking offense?

           Jeff winds up and throws SIDEARM and the ball... flies over 
           Big D’s head... closer though...

                                 PATTY
                        That one was closer, baby!

                                 JEFF
                        Thanks, ma!  Again.

           As the sun sets behind him... Jeff throws again... and 
           again... ringed in orange glow... we see him working harder 
           than he ever has in his life.

           EXT. FENWAY PARK - MAY 28, 2013 - SOX VS PHILLIES - DAY

           Establishing shot.  Packed fucking day at Fenway.  Not an 
           open space.

           INT. FENWAY PARK - SAME

           The place is bristling with energy and emotion... everyone is 
           on their feet, cheering... not an empty seat... not a local 
           man, woman or child without a BOSTON STRONG or Red Sox, 
           Patriots, Bruins, Celtics shirt or hat...

           THE TUNNEL 

           Jeff stands in the tunnel wearing a custom BOSTON STRONG Red 
           Sox jersey... Big D, Sully, Uncle Bob, Patty, Aunt Jen, Big 
           Jeff, Kevin stand beside him.

                                 JEFF
                        I wish Erin was here to see this.

                                 PATTY
                        I bet she’s watching it.

                                 JEFF
                        Ya think?
                                 PATTY
                        Put up with me, that girl musta 
                        really loved ya.

                                 KEVIN
                        Jeff.  You want, we can go home.  
                        Nobody will think less of you.

                                 AUNT JEN
                        You might break the heart of a 
                        million Bostonians.  But ya more 
                        important.

                                 JEFF
                        You bustin my balls, Aunt Jen?

                                 AUNT JEN
                        Whaddyou think?

           Big Jeff leans down.

                                 BIG JEFF
                        Jeff... look, I... I wanna say that 
                        I’m, ya know...

                                 JEFF
                        Pop, let’s not cheez up the moment.  

                                 BIG JEFF
                        Good.  

           Big Jeff pats Jeff’s shoulder.

                                 RED SOX REP
                        Go time, Jeff!

           They each lean down and give him a hug.  Jeff starts ROLLING 
           towards the field... when suddenly he realizes that someone 
           is pushing him... he turns to see CARLOS behind him.

                                 JEFF
                        The hero and his hero.

                                 CARLOS
                        See where life is taking you, Jeff?  
                        Do you see this?

           The roll out on to the field and the crowd RISES TO ITS 
           FEET... The roar is DEAFENING... a THUNDER OF EMOTION... TENS 
           OF THOUSANDS of fans SCREAMING for Jeff, for Boston, for the 
           Sox... pinning all their emotions on to this skinny guy in 
           the wheelchair...
           They reach the pitcher’s mound and PEDRO FUCKING MARTINEZ 
           walks up to them, reaches out his hand.

                                 PEDRO
                        Hello, Jeff.  I’m Pedro Martinez.

                                 JEFF
                        Yah.  I mighta heard of ya.  Any 
                        tips?

           Pedro hands him the ball.

                                 PEDRO
                        Throw a strike.

           He winks and steps back, waving at the fans.  Jeff looks 
           around... His world is spinning... he looks out at the 
           crowd... and there he is-- for a brief second-- Tamerlan and 
           his backpack... 

           Jeff closes his eyes, breathes... 

                                 JEFF
                        Fuck it.

           He opens his eyes and Tamerlan is GONE.

           Jeff positions himself on the mound... Sox catcher Jarrod 
           Saltalamacchia crouches down and gives Jeff the sign for 
           fastball.

           Jeff grips the ball... leans to the side... he winds up and 
           throws SIDE ARM... and the ball BUZZES...

           ...paints the corner of the plate and SLAPS into 
           Saltalamacchia’s glove.

                                 PA SYSTEM
                        STRIKE!

           The crowd goes BEYOND APESHIT. 

           Jeff leans back... his face relieved...the crowd GOES 
           BALLISTIC... he opens his arms... lets the cheers WASH AND 
           CLEANSE him...

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. FENWAY TUNNEL - SAME

           As the crowd continues to cheer, Big D and Sully run through 
           the tunnel pushing Jeff.  

                                 SULLY
                        They gave us all these vouchers, 
                        bro.

                                 BIG D
                        Let’s get some fucking beer!

           They take a hard turn and reach a line of barriers... Big D 
           swings past them... out into the open...

           Jeff looks at the crowds of people all around... closing 
           in... he’s starting to panic a bit.

                                 SULLY
                        Uh... D, let’s maybe turn around.

           There’s a big crowd of maybe fifty fans who recognize him, 
           start taking pics and coming after him.  Big D swings the 
           chair around, heads back in...

           Another throng of people come from that side... closing in...

           Jeff’s breath picks up... his eyes darting around... sweat on 
           his lip...

                                 SULLY (CONT’D)
                        What do we do?

                                 BIG D
                        Pick him up?

                                 SULLY
                        The whole chair?

           They try to pick up the chair, almost drop him.  A BOOMING 
           voice nearby stops them.

                                 VOICE
                        HEY!  YOU!  LOOK AT ME!
           They turn to see a big BLUE COLLAR DUDE with hard labor 
           muscles bulging at his old Red Sox shirt, work boots, tin 
           cloth pants... three other BIG DUDES at his side.

                                 BLUE COLLAR DUDE
                        You’re Jeff Bauman, right?

           The guy walks closer... has a half filled beer sloshing 
           around his cup... his buddies at his heels... their faces red 
           from booze.  

           The crowd takes a few steps back... this is Boston and they 
           recognize guys looking for a fight...

                                 JEFF
                        Yeah, that’s me.

                                 BLUE COLLAR DUDE
                        I wanna tell ya something.

                                 BIG D
                        We’re kinda in a rush, bro.

                                 BLUE COLLAR DUDE
                        I ain’t talking to you, “bro.”

           The moment gets tense.  Big D is no small guy... but no way 
           he can swing it with three of these men.  

                                 JEFF
                        It’s okay.    
                             (to dude)
                        What can I do for ya?

                                 BLUE COLLAR DUDE
                        My kid brother... he... uh... five 
                        years ago, Over There... a, uh... 
                        IED...

                                 JEFF
                        Sorry to hear that, man.

                                 BLUE COLLAR DUDE
                        I saw your picture that morning, ya 
                        know.  After the bomb.  Thought of 
                        Thomas laying there in the dirt 
                        and... and just got so fucking 
                        angry...

                                 BLUE COLLAR DUDE’S FRIEND
                        Hey man, why don’t we get going...
                                 BLUE COLLAR DUDE
                        I can fucking handle my feelings, 
                        Patrick!  

           His friend backs away.

                                 BLUE COLLAR DUDE (CONT’D)
                        Seeing you out there, throwing that 
                        pitch...  ya showed the world they 
                        can’t break us, no matter what they 
                        do.  And that gave me hope and for 
                        a second... I kinda felt like 
                        Thomas was sitting beside me.  So I 
                        wanted to say thank you for that, 
                        man.   

                                 JEFF
                        What’s your name?

                                 BLUE COLLAR DUDE
                        Larry.  I install sheet rock around 
                        the greater Medford area.

                                 JEFF
                        What you just said means more than 
                        you can ever know.  Can I shake 
                        your hand?

                                 BLUE COLLAR DUDE
                        You wanna shake my hand?

           Jeff reaches out and shakes his hand.  Jeff looks into his 
           eyes... has a moment... then he pulls the guy in and they 
           embrace.  

                                 JEFF
                             (whispers to him)
                        It’s gonna be all right, Larry.  
                        All of it.  I promise.  We’re all 
                        gonna get stronger. 

           The big dude starts SOBBING... deep, painful sobs... after a 
           moment,  Larry pulls back, wipes the snot and tears from his 
           eyes.

                                 BLUE COLLAR DUDE
                        Go Sox.

           He walks away, his buddies put their thick arms around him 
           and they all huddle close.

           Big D and Sully look at Jeff with disbelief... they can’t 
           believe this is their Jeff.
           A Single Mom with her six year old daughter walk up and stand 
           in front of Jeff.

                                 MOM
                        Mr. Bauman?  My daughter wrote a 
                        report on you for her third grade 
                        class.  Can she meet you?

                                 JEFF
                        She sure can.  What’s your name, 
                        honey?

                                 GIRL
                        Sophie.  Do your legs hurt?

                                 JEFF
                        Sometimes.  You get a good grade on 
                        that report?

                                 GIRL
                        A minus.

                                 JEFF
                        What was the minus for?

                                 GIRL
                        Teacher said it was so I’d have 
                        something to fight for.

                                 JEFF
                        Smart teacher.

           Jeff smiles at her... and we pull back and see that, behind 
           this woman, there is a line of about 75 people waiting to 
           meet Jeff.  And he’s gonna talk to each one of them.

           The car sits in a strip mall parking lot.  Patty behind the 
           wheel.  Jeff beside her.  She lights a cigarette.

                                 PATTY
                        I shoulda been there when that bomb 
                        went off, Jeffrey.  I shoulda saved 
                        you from all of this.

                                 JEFF
                        There’s nothing ya could have done.
                                 PATTY
                        Every night I pray for God to bring 
                        me back to that moment so I can 
                        jump on that backpack and take the 
                        explosion for ya. Absorb it inside 
                        me. Ya life’s been so hard.  I did 
                        my best but... I know I drink too 
                        much.  Got a temper.  Hard to be 
                        around.  I did my best thought... 
                        but I shoulda done better.

                                 JEFF
                        Ya taught me how to survive, ma.  

                                 PATTY
                        Ya father and me... we was so happy 
                        when you was a baby.  We’d just sit 
                        there and stare at ya, not 
                        fighting, for hours.  Them little 
                        hands, little mouth... little feet.  
                        I was at peace ‘cause I knew I 
                        could protect ya.  But this world 
                        we live in.  Are any of us every 
                        gonna be that safe again?  

           He kisses her on the cheek.

                                 JEFF
                        I love ya, ma.

                                 PATTY
                        She’s here.

           EXT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

           Through the glass, we see Erin walking through the coffee 
           shop, looking around for someone who’s not there.  We notice 
           that her belly is popping out a bit... maybe five/six months 
           pregnant now.

           The place is sparse, only a coupla people on laptops.  She 
           puts her purse down, sits at the window... and freezes...

           We see the reflection of Jeff before we see him... he’s 
           walking across the lot on those Genium legs... one step, two 
           steps... he pauses and leans on his cane to catch his 
           breath... three steps... four...

           He reaches the door and wobbles as he enters... 
           INT. COFFEE SHOP - SAME

           Jeff moves inside and pauses to get his breath and balance 
           again... five steps... six steps...

           He sits on the chair across from her.  He’s panting from 
           exertion.  She’s staring at him.  He’s staring at her.

           He reaches his hand out across the table... after a moment, 
           she puts her hand on his.

                                 JEFF
                        Thank God.  Plan B was me dancing.

           Erin smiles... he could always make her smile... she leans 
           forward.

           INT. PATTY’S TOYOTA COROLLA - SAME

           Patty has a cigarette in one hand, her phone on speaker in 
           the other, tears streaming down her face.
