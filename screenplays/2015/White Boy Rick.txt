                       Based on the life of Richard Wershe Jr.
           FADE IN:

           INT. A PRIVATE JET - 1986 - NIGHT

           The luxury vessel cruises the celestial darkness of the 
           midnight sky as the camera glides through pools of moody 
           lighting and the figures illuminated beneath. 

           A strongly built black man reclines in an attitude of perfect 
           contentment, puffing on a Cohiba as the head of a naked woman 
           rhythmically rises and falls in his lap, massaging his penis 
           expertly with the arts of her trade. 

           He exhales a jet of perfumed smoke and the camera glides past 
           him to another black man straddled by two voluptuous black 
           women feeding him their full-bodied ebony breasts. 

           He takes a sip of cognac and the camera glides deeper into 
           the plane through the slow-moving atmosphere of decadence and 
           carnal pleasures where two other black men are sitting at a 
           mahogany table in front of a Ribao currency counter. 

           The machine rifles through a stack of hundred dollar bills. 
           One of the men removes the bills from the receiving tray and 
           wraps the bundle tight with a mustard currency strap and sets 
           it in a duffel bag.  

           The camera glides further into the interior toward a solitary 
           figure enthroned on a leather chair. 

           As the image takes focus two conspicuous features immediately 
           reveal themselves: He is the only white person on the plane, 
           and even more surprising, he is very young, disturbingly 
           young, a mere teenager, draped in a snowy mink coat, a thick 
           donkey rope gold chain around his neck, a velvet Kangol 
           bucket hat slung low across his brow. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        I made more money this year than 
                        Ronald Reagan. Think about that, a 
                        sixteen year-old kid making more 
                        money than the President of the 
                        United States. 

           As the camera continues toward Ricky’s adolescent features, 
           there’s an unnerving dissonance between the images we’ve 
           already seen and the words spoken from this kid’s mind. But 
           this is no wet-dream teenage fantasy. He is speaking the 
           truth.  

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        But do you think the government 
                        wants to stop me?

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Shit, they put me on this throne. 
                        I’m a Federal employee, tax dollars 
                        hard at work. 

           The camera pushes tighter and lands on the watery reflection 
           of his eyes.

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        I am the War on Drugs.

           The camera draws slowly away from his eyes and Ricky Wershe 
           is now standing atop a Little League mound preparing to 
           deliver his final pitch.

                                 TITLE: THREE YEARS EARLIER

           He looks in for the sign, nods, and then throws the pearl 
           through the warm sunshine and past the swinging bat where it 
           smacks into the catcher’s glove in a dusty burst. Strike 
           three. The game is over. 

           EXT. DETROIT, THE EAST SIDE - LATER

           Ricky walks home after the game, the sidewalk buckling from 
           neglect, the weeds waist-high and rampant, growing through 
           the cracks.    

           The street is virtually abandoned and the peculiar absence of 
           sound isolates his cleated footsteps, evoking the loneliness 
           of one traveling a bleak northern forest, not the diseased 
           heart of a major city.

           We follow young Ricky for some time when the distant rumble 
           of a U-Haul truck interrupts the silence. The truck honks 
           twice and then pulls to a stop beside Ricky.  

           Three people are sandwiched in the front seat. They are the 
           Majorksi’s: Dad drives, mom sits in the middle, and son Dave 
           hangs out the window. Everyone says hi to Ricky. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        Thought you guys were leaving 
                        tomorrow?

                                 DAVE
                        Dad starts his new job Monday.

                                 MR. MAJORSKI
                        Sorry about that, Ricky. I know I 
                        said I’d take you boys to pizza 
                        tonight, but I want to get unpacked 
                        and settled before the first day. 
                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        That’s alright. 

                                 MR. MAJORSKI
                        Our new place is just a few minutes 
                        north of Eight Mile. Come on out 
                        whenever you like.

                                 DAVE
                        Later Ricky.

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        Later.

           Dave and his family wave goodbye and the U-Haul pulls away.  

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        Dave was my best friend, and once 
                        they moved out, I was the only 
                        white kid left in the neighborhood. 

           Ricky watches the U-Haul recede into the distance and then 
           continues on his way home through a living museum of urban 
           decay -- and behind the carcass of each burned-out building, 
           dilapidated home, shuttered business and weed-infested lot, 
           is the broken dream, the forlorn hope, the future of 
           industrial America: dying, dead, extinct. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        Detroit wasn’t always this fucked 
                        up. At one time, it was the richest 
                        city in the United States, 
                        birthplace of the auto industry, 
                        the assembly line, the 
                        refrigerator, credit financing, the 
                        industrial mecca and promise of 
                        tomorrow.  

           As we follow Ricky down the street, we become spectators to 
           the Detroit of yesteryear, a brief history from its modern 
           birth in the early 20th Century through the post-war boom 
           years and up until the apocalyptic present. 

           The block is now transformed -- freshly painted facades, 
           bustling streets, new homes, and we travel across the 
           burgeoning skyline and plunge into the Packard Automotive 
           Plant -- 

           The buzz and hum of industry. The swarming assembly line. A 
           red fender is slapped onto a chassis. Men attack it with 
           pneumatic rivet guns and bolt the fender in place.
           That same car now drives down a residential street. A man 
           from that assembly line is behind the wheel, his wife beside 
           him in the front seat, his two wholesome kids in back, a 
           portrait that would make Norman Rockwell proud.

           The man steers into the driveway of their new home. Life sure 
           is swell.   

           Inside the house the children watch TV. The dad reads the 
           newspaper. The dutiful mother cooks dinner in a state-of-the-
           art kitchen -- all the trappings of middle-class success. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        But the promise of tomorrow wasn’t 
                        offered to everyone equally, and 
                        there were racial tensions 
                        simmering below the surface. At the 
                        auto plants, if the blacks did get 
                        hired, they were thrown the shit 
                        jobs for shit wages. 

           A Chrysler plant. A huge industrial bathroom. Five black 
           janitors mop, scrub, and plunge toilets. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        They were either handed a broom and 
                        a mop, or sent to work in Hell.

           The molten heat of the foundry. The hulking cauldron bubbles 
           with liquid ore. Sweltering, miserable, dangerous. 

           Outside the same plant. The shift has ended. A bus stop 
           adjacent to the vast parking lot. White men drive out in new 
           cars while black man huddle in line for the bus. 

           The bus lets out somewhere on the East Side. The black men 
           climb out and funnel toward a high-rise housing project. 
           Norman Rockwell never painted this side of town.

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        But people will only eat shit for 
                        so long. It had to touch off at 
                        some point. And in 1967, it did.

           The night sky is ablaze. Detroit is literally on fire as a 
           massive conflagration engulfs the city. Buildings collapse in 
           the flames. 

           Rioting and looting in the streets. The National Guard is 
           called in. It looks like a war zone.
                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        By the time the riots ended, 43 
                        people had been killed and more 
                        than 2,000 buildings were burned to 
                        the ground. Most of them were never 
                        rebuilt.  

           The Rockwellian white family climbs into their car. A 
           mattress is tied down on the roof. A chair pokes out of the 
           bungeed trunk. A cargo trailer hooked to the rear bumper.  

           They back out of the driveway, revealing a FOR SALE sign 
           staked on the front lawn. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        When the smoke settled, everyone 
                        with means, both white and black, 
                        started leaving the city for the 
                        suburbs -- and the jobs left with 
                        them.

           Interstate 75. Traffic crawls northward, the roofs of cars 
           loaded with belongings, the White Flight has begun. 

           We watch the city depopulate and decay. A time-lapse of 
           sorts. Factories shuttered, the chain link fence locked, 
           never to reopen. Neighborhoods abandoned. Neon signs flicker 
           and then go out forever.  

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        And with the city’s collapse came 
                        the drugs... 

           A heroin needle is thrust into a vein. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        ...And the violence came with them. 

           A rapid succession of gun shots echo through the urban 
           landscape -- the crime scene photographs of young dead black 
           men sprawled on the streets, twisted in every attitude of 
           murder. Families mourning.  

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        By the early ‘80s, Motor City USA 
                        had become the Murder Capital of 
                        the World. 

           Scenes of poverty and despair, the streets littered with 
           trash, husks of stripped cars rot on the pavement.

           And now we’re back to young Ricky Wershe, walking home in his 
           baseball uniform.
           He moves across an abandoned lot, through the hulking remains 
           of a burned-out concrete building that looks like it’s been 
           struck by a five-hundred pound bomb, across a residential 
           street and up the front steps of his modest brick home.

           He produces a key hanging from a string around his neck and 
           unlocks the front door.

           INT. THE WERSHE’S HOUSE - DAY

           Ricky steps into the living room where his older sister, 
           DAWN, 16, smokes a joint on the couch, watching television.

                                 DAWN
                        Hey, Ricky.

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        Hey, Dawn.

                                 DAWN
                        You want a hit?

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        Sure.

           Ricky sits down on the couch beside his sister. She passes 
           him the joint. He takes a hit and hands it back to her. 

                                 DAWN
                        Did you win? 

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        Yeah. 

           She takes off his baseball cap and musses up his hair. 

                                 DAWN
                        Sorry I didn’t come watch you. 
                             (she hits the joint)
                        I just got really tired all of a 
                        sudden. 

           Ricky shrugs. Dawn passes the joint back to him and we leave 
           them staring at the television.

           INT. THE WERSHE’S HOUSE - LATER

           Dawn and Ricky are passed out on the couch when the front 
           door swings open in a hurry, not an angry hurry, but an 
           energetic one, revealing their father, RICK SR., a small-time 
           hustler always searching for the next deal. Like a shark, he 
           never stops moving.  
           He sniffs the air.

                                 RICK SR. 
                        Dawn, you been smoking weed again?

                                 DAWN
                        No way.

                                 RICK SR.
                        Bullshit.

           Rick Sr. holds an UZI in one hand and an AK-47 in the other. 
           He has an AR-15 assault rifle slung across his back. He cuts 
           an unusual figure, to say the least. A one-man Rambo without 
           the muscles. 

                                 RICK SR. (CONT’D)
                        I give you two a lot of freedom. I 
                        try and treat you like adults. All 
                        I ask for is a little respect in 
                        return. 

                                 DAWN
                        Dad, I wasn’t smoking weed. I 
                        burned some toast, that’s all.

                                 RICK SR.
                        Don’t give me that shit, Dawn. 
                        Look, you can do what you want on 
                        your own, but under my roof, you 
                        gotta follow my rules.
                             (still holding assault 
                              rifles)
                        Drugs ruin lives. 

           He says this final line without a trace of irony. He is a man 
           tragically ill-equipped for fatherhood. 

                                 RICK SR. (CONT’D)
                        Hey, Ricky. Go on out to the car 
                        and grab the rest of the guns 
                        before somebody steals them. 
                             (leaving room)
                        I got some great deals today down 
                        at The Armory. Some great deals. 
                        We’re gonna make a killing this 
                        week.

           INT. THE WERSHE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Ricky and Dawn sit in front of TV dinners at a small formica 
           table in the kitchen. 
           But they are not eating at the moment, their attention 
           focused on their father, who is standing with his back to 
           them, the phone receiver to his ear. The female voice on the 
           other end of the line is screaming at him. 

           Rick Sr. slowly hangs up. He grips the receiver in its cradle 
           for a long moment before turning around and shuffling over to 
           the table with an air of defeat.  

           He slumps into his chair and stares blankly at his TV dinner. 
           He exhales, and after a tense and prolonged silence, says 
           flatly:  

                                 RICK SR.
                        Your mother is a whore. 

           The words settle, and then provoke.

                                 DAWN
                        What? 

                                 RICK SR.
                        Your mother is a whore. W - H - O - 
                        R - E.

                                 DAWN
                        You’re a fucking whore, Dad. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        Don’t say that about, Dad. 

                                 DAWN
                        Fuck him. All he cares about is 
                        making a quick buck. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        Fuck you. You’re a whore, Dawn.

           Rick Sr. slaps the back of Ricky’s head. 

                                 RICK SR.
                        Don’t call your sister that.

                                 DAWN
                        Then don’t call Mom one.

           Rick Sr. shoots a fierce look at Dawn. He just defended her 
           and now she’s attacking him again. 

                                 RICK SR.
                        Tell me then, sweet Dawn, what do 
                        you call a woman who walks out on 
                        her family for another man -- a 
                        princess? A fucking princess? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 RICK SR. (CONT'D)
                        Is that what you think your mother 
                        is -- a goddamn Disney fucking 
                        princess?

           This unleashes Dawn’s tears. She shoots out of her chair.

                                 DAWN
                        She didn’t walk out on us. You 
                        walked out on her a long time ago.  

           Now Ricky stands. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        Fuck you, Dawn. No he didn’t.

           Rick Sr. slaps the back of Ricky’s head again. 

                                 RICK SR.
                        Ricky, don’t fucking swear at your 
                        sister. 

                                 DAWN
                        And you wonder why I use drugs. You 
                        wonder why.

                                 RICK SR.
                        I’m trying. I’m really trying. I’m 
                        doing the best I can.

                                 DAWN
                        Well you need to try harder -- 
                        ‘cause you suck.

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        Dad doesn’t suck -- you suck. He 
                        puts food on the table.

                                 DAWN
                        They’re fucking TV dinners.

           Rick Sr. starts pounding his fists on the flimsy table. It’s 
           all very juvenile and terribly depressing and dysfunctional -- 
           charging headlong toward the hysterical. 

                                 RICK SR.
                        I suck? I suck? Suck this --

           He erupts from his chair and flips the table into the air as 
           we -- FREEZE FRAME -- pieces of mongrel fried chicken and 
           Salisbury Steak and peas and corn and cherry cobbler and 
           aluminum TV dinner trays are suspended in a shiny colorful 
           buffet, hovering in a lunatic world without gravity.
                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        I guess we were a typical Detroit 
                        family at the time. Like the city 
                        around us, we were falling apart.

           EXT. THE EAST SIDE - NIGHT

           A neighborhood blighted from poverty and the impossible 
           Detroit winter. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        Nobody had anything. No hope, no 
                        jobs, no money -- except for the 
                        drug kingpins. 

           A candy-painted Cadillac with Truespoke wheels and Vogue 
           Tyres rolls to the front of a jumping nightclub where valets 
           swarm the vehicle and open doors. 

           A kingpin in a full-length mink coat steps out. He swaggers 
           around the shimmering hood and picks up his two female 
           passengers who are lavishly bedecked in furs and jewels. They 
           each take an arm and the trio floats up the red carpet. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        In Detroit, the kingpins were as 
                        famous as movie stars in Hollywood. 
                        To my generation, they were heroes, 
                        modern day Robin Hoods in the 
                        brokest city in America.  

           Camera follows the trio through the front door and into a 
           swirling galaxy of kingpins and their harems, each trying to 
           outdo the other with flamboyant displays of wealth and 
           status. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        Guys like Maserati Rick, Demetrius 
                        Holloway, the Best Friends Gang, 
                        Young Boys Incorporated, the 
                        Chambers Brothers, Pony Down. These 
                        were the young black men that ruled 
                        the streets.  

           EXT. THE EAST SIDE - DAY

           Ricky pedals his BMX bike down the block.
                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        And in my neighborhood, twin 
                        brothers, Leo “Big Man” Curry, and 
                        Johnny “Little Man” Curry, ran 
                        things. They were two of the 
                        biggest kingpins on the East Side.  

           Ricky steers into a gas station. He dismounts at the air 
           compressor to fill his tires.

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        They owned the Marathon Garage up 
                        on the corner of Warren and Lemay, 
                        a couple blocks from my house. 

           Ricky bends down to his bike tire and unscrews the cap and 
           pretends to fill it up. He’s transfixed as he stares across 
           the asphalt where the CURRY BROTHERS and a couple of foot 
           soldiers and several busty women chat each other up. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        Everybody looked up to the Curry 
                        Brothers. They had pimped out cars 
                        and Japanese super-bikes, gold 
                        chains and diamond rings, brand 
                        name clothes, and most of all, they 
                        were always surrounded by beautiful 
                        women. I used to ride my bike up to 
                        the garage just to look at them. My 
                        tire wasn’t even flat.  

           JOHNNY CURRY sits in his ride with one leg on the asphalt as 
           his hands caress the thighs of a young woman in a skin-tight 
           leopard print dress. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        They had everything that anyone 
                        could ever want.  

           Ricky observes the sideshow, longing to be one of them, 
           longing for the fame, recognition, and the sexual favors of 
           women. But his presence goes unnoticed -- just a poor loner 
           white kid in a black city.

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        And I wanted to be one of them. But 
                        I was white, and they were all 
                        black. And in Detroit, race had 
                        always trumped desire. Your skin 
                        color chose your place for you, 
                        both good and bad, whether you 
                        liked it or not.
           Ricky finally screws back on the tire cap, hops on his bike 
           and drifts down the street the way he came, glancing over his 
           shoulder every now and then at a life and attention he only 
           wishes he could have.  

           INT. LIGHT GUARD ARMORY, DETROIT - DAY

           A sprawling gun show. Hundreds of fold-out tables display 
           assault rifles, pistols, shotguns, hunting rifles, knives, 
           swords, weapons of all kinds and war paraphernalia.  

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        My father hustled a bunch of 
                        different jobs. And guns was one of 
                        them. On the weekends, when I 
                        wasn’t playing baseball, he would 
                        take me to the shows with him.

           Amid the bustle, we find Ricky, his dextrous fingers 
           dismantling an AK-47 with rapid precision. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        By the time I was thirteen, I knew 
                        more about guns than Dirty Harry.  

           He removes the dust cover, slides out the carrier spring, and 
           scrutinizes the piston bolt.

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        This ain’t Russian.

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        This is an Egyptian AK. It ain’t 
                        Russian.

                                 GUN VENDOR
                        Egyptian? How old are you?

                        Old enough to smell bullshit. 

                                 GUN VENDOR
                        That rifle there was smuggled out 
                        of the Soviet Union by a high-level 
                        CIA spy. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        Smuggled out of your ass, maybe. 
                        You should be ashamed of yourself.

                        Trying to take advantage of a child 
                        and all. I should report you.  

           The gun vendor stutters with a mixture of anger and fear. He 
           throws a nervous glance or two around the convention hall.

                                 GUN VENDOR
                        Well, uh, I’m sure we can work out 
                        a deal.
                             (a false smile)
                        Right?

           And then suddenly, as if rehearsed, Rick Sr. bolts into the 
           picture, feigning a look of outraged distress.

                                 RICK SR.
                        What’s going on, son? 
                             (to vendor)
                        Are you trying to sell my child a 
                        firearm? 

                                 GUN VENDOR
                        Why, no, of course not. 

                                 RICK SR.
                        Does he look eighteen to you?

                                 GUN VENDOR
                        We were just talking guns, that’s 
                        all. Right kid?

                                 RICK SR.
                        Let me see this.

           Rick Sr. snatches the body of the dismantled AK-47 from the 
           table and examines it with contempt.  

                                 RICK SR. (CONT’D)
                        How much you want for this Egyptian 
                        piece of shit?

                                 GUN VENDOR
                        Uh... two hundred?

           Insulted by the price, Rick Sr. looks around and finds a 
           SECURITY GUARD stationed by the door, and waves him over.

                                 RICK SR.
                        Security! 

            The vendor shits his pants.
                                 GUN VENDOR
                        A hundred dollars. I’ll give it to 
                        you for a hundred dollars.

                                 RICK SR.
                        For two... Two AK’s for a hundred 
                        dollars.

                        Fine - fine. Whatever price you 
                        want. Just take the guns and go. 
                        Please.

           A knowing grin crosses Ricky’s face.

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        And that’s how we hustled. Father 
                        and son, we were a pretty good 
                        team. 

           EXT. LIGHT GUARD ARMORY - LATER

           Ricky pushes a shopping cart bristling with guns and 
           ammunition through the parking lot. Rick Sr. strides 
           alongside, spirited, beaming with success.

           They arrive at their car. Rick Sr. pops the trunk and they 
           start unloading the arsenal.

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        My dad sold most of the guns out of 
                        the sporting goods store he managed 
                        downtown.

           CUT TO -- Rick Sr. stands behind a glass counter, wearing a 
           collared shirt and name tag. He slides an assault rifle from 
           the gun rack, turns around and hands the weapon to a 
           customer.

           CUT TO -- Late at night. Rick Sr. walks through the cavernous 
           sporting goods store. The shelves are completely barren now. 
           It’s sad, eerie, you can’t help but feel for the man.  

           He steps through the glass front door and onto the sidewalk 
           and the lights go out behind him in a crashing succession, 
           starting from the back and creeping forward, until all is 
           dark inside. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        But when the store went out of 
                        business, we started selling guns 
                        out of our house.
           INT. THE WERSHE’S HOUSE, GARAGE - DAY

           Ricky stands behind a fold-out table with an array of 
           handguns spread on top. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        You drive a cab, right?

                                 CAB DRIVER
                        Yep.

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        That’s a pretty dangerous job, huh?

                                 CAB DRIVER
                        Sure is. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        You ever been robbed?

                                 CAB DRIVER
                        Too many times.

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        You ever been shot?

                                 CAB DRIVER
                        Twice.

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        It would’ve been different if you 
                        had a gun.

                                 CAB DRIVER
                        That’s why I’m here. 

           Ricky surveys the various firearms, and with practiced 
           salesmanship, takes a black snub-nosed revolver from the 
           table, whips open the cylinder, spins it, and slams it shut.

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        The 38 Special. Now that’s a 
                        cabbie’s gun.

           Ricky hands the revolver to the laconic cab driver. The cab 
           driver raises the weapon and aims it at the back wall. A thin 
           smile breaks his inexpressive features.  

                                 CAB DRIVER
                        I’ll give you a hundred and fifty 
                        for it. 

           Ricky winces, but it’s all part of his show. He holds up his 
           finger -- give me a moment. 
                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        Let me talk to the boss.

           Ricky steps over to the side door, unlocks it, steps into the 
           kitchen and shuts the door behind him. 

           THE KITCHEN

           His dad is on the phone, negotiating a deal of some sorts. 

           Ricky opens the fridge, pours a glass of milk, grabs an Oreo 
           cookie from its package, dips the cookie in the milk, and 
           takes a bite. 

           He casually walks into the living room, lifts the remote 
           control off the couch, turns on the TV, clicks through a few 
           channels, and finally, heads back through the kitchen and 
           into the garage without ever saying a word to his dad.

           THE GARAGE

                                 RICKY WERSHE (CONT’D)
                        I can’t do it for that price.

                                 CAB DRIVER
                        One seventy-five.

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        I’ll see what I can do.

           Ricky repeats the charade. He opens the side door, shuts it 
           behind, and is now back in the kitchen. 

           THE KITCHEN

           His dad acknowledges him, raises his thumb and jiggles it up 
           and down -- how’s it going out there? -- Ricky gives him a 
           thumbs up.

           Ricky grabs another Oreo. His dad motions for one. Ricky 
           hands him the one he’s holding, reaches back in the package 
           for another, sips his glass of milk. 

           He moves into the living room again, checks a couple more 
           channels with the remote control, and finally back out to the 
           garage and his customer. 

           THE GARAGE

                                 RICKY WERSHE (CONT’D)
                        Two twenty-five. 

                                 CAB DRIVER
                        Two hundred.
                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        This is a family owned business 
                        here. We gotta make some profit. Do 
                        you give rides for free? 

           After a moment of deliberation, the cab driver reaches into 
           his pocket, removes a wad of small bills and deals the money 
           onto the table. 

           MOMENTS LATER -- Ricky pulls up the garage door and the 
           cabbie walks down the driveway and into his yellow cab.

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        The way I figured, when you’re 
                        living in a war zone, you’re a fool 
                        if you don’t carry a gun. 

           EXT. LIQUOR STORE, THE EAST SIDE - DAY

           Ricky exits the liquor store with a Coke. He opens it and 
           takes a sip, straightens a .25 automatic pistol in his 
           waistband, hops on his bike and pedals down the sidewalk. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        Throughout my childhood, there were 
                        hundreds of murders a year in my 
                        neighborhood alone. Hundreds.  

           Ricky steers off the sidewalk and onto the street to avoid a 
           dead black man who is prostrate in a pool of blood. Other 
           people step around the body. It’s literally no big deal to 
           anyone.

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        The Grim Reaper didn’t give a fuck 
                        whether it was Christmas, 
                        Thanksgiving, or your birthday, if 
                        you were a baby in a crib or an old 
                        ass grandmother in a wheelchair or 
                        a star athlete on his way to 
                        college. Day in and day out, the 
                        bodies were collected.     

           EXT. THE EAST SIDE - NIGHT

           In the back of a supermarket parking lot, Rick Sr. counts out 
           money he has just received from a young black man, who is 
           standing beside him. Ricky hovers nearby.  

                                 RICK SR.
                        And two hundred and twenty five... 
                        Ricky, hand the man his stereo.
           Ricky reaches into the trunk of their car and lifts out a 
           large white box. It’s a brand new Alpine car stereo. 

                                 RICK SR. (CONT’D)
                        It’s a pleasure doing business with 
                        you, Jamal.

           Jamal leaves with his stereo. Ricky and his dad climb into 
           their car. 

                                 RICK SR. (CONT’D)
                        This is gonna be our year, Ricky. I 
                        can feel it. 1984 is gonna be a big 
                        year for America.
                             (musing)
                        We got the Olympics coming up in 
                        Los Angeles. A Presidential 
                        election. Lots of good stuff. 
                        Competition is good. It’s good for 
                        everyone. Good for the soul. You 
                        can do a lot with competition. 
                             (then something profound)
                        You can win. 

           He hands Ricky his cut from the proceeds. Not much, maybe 
           twenty bucks.

                                 RICK SR. (CONT’D)
                        Whoever said money can’t buy you 
                        happiness was never broke. Some 
                        rich fuck made that up to keep poor 
                        people from dreaming. Fuck him. 

           Ricky produces a knot of bills from his pocket, takes off the 
           rubber band and adds his new earnings to his bank roll.

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        Yeah, fuck him.

           Ricky tucks the knot back in his pocket.

                                 RICK SR.
                        I got a line on a couple dozen of 
                        those video player things, you 
                        know, the ones that you can watch 
                        the movies on?

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        VCR’s?

                                 RICK SR.
                        Yeah, VCR’s. You think we could 
                        move them? 
                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        Easy. They’re becoming really 
                        popular.

           Rick Sr. nods, smiles at the prospect, turns over the engine 
           and they drive out of the parking lot. 

                                 RICK SR.
                        This is gonna be our year, kiddo. 

           INT. THE WERSHE’S HOUSE - MORNING

           Ricky brushes his teeth in the bathroom. His father yells 
           from the other room.

                                 RICK SR.
                        Let’s go, Ricky. Get your ass in 
                        gear. 

           There’s a rap on the front door. Rick Sr. looks through the 
           peephole. 

                                 RICK SR. (CONT’D)
                             (under his breath)
                        What the fuck do they want?

           He opens the door and greets his visitors with a toothy 
           smile.

                                 RICK SR. (CONT’D)
                        Hey, fellas. What’s going on?

           TWO FBI AGENTS stand on the front porch. One is Agent Bell, 
           the other Agent Turner. 

                                 AGENT BELL
                        Hey, Rick. Good to see you this 
                        morning. 

           Rick Sr. and Agent Bell shake hands.

                                 AGENT BELL (CONT’D)
                        This is one of my colleagues, Agent 
                        Turner. Mind if we come in?

                                 RICK SR.
                        Well, it’s sort of bad timing. I’m 
                        about to take Ricky to school.

                                 AGENT TURNER
                        It’ll only take a few minutes. 
           Rick Sr. fidgets, glances over his shoulder into his house, 
           then cranes his neck out the front door and looks up and down 
           the street. He ushers them inside.

                                 RICK SR.
                        Can you guys park around the block 
                        next time instead of right in front 
                        of my fucking house?

                                 AGENT TURNER
                        Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure thing.  

           Rick Sr. leads the agents into the living room and over to 
           the couch.

                                 AGENT BELL
                             (to Turner)
                        Rick used to manage the sporting 
                        goods store across the street from 
                        headquarters. The one that’s all 
                        boarded up now.

                                 AGENT TURNER
                        Next to Roscoe’s?

                                 AGENT BELL
                        That’s the one... I miss seeing 
                        you, Rick. 

                                 RICK SR.
                        I miss working there. Fucking 
                        economy.

                                 AGENT BELL
                        I gotta drive all the way across 
                        town now just to buy a fucking 
                        nightcrawler. Pain in the ass.

           The agents sit down and set a stack of manila folders on the 
           coffee table. Rick Sr. sits across from them.

                                 RICK SR.
                        What can I do for you, gentlemen?

                                 AGENT TURNER
                        You got any coffee?

                                 RICK SR.
                        I’d have to make some.

                                 AGENT TURNER
                        We got the time.
                                 RICK SR.
                        Guys, I gotta take my son to 
                        school. I just told you that.

                                 AGENT TURNER
                        He’s late everyday. What’s one 
                        more?

           Rick Sr. glares at Agent Turner -- who the fuck are you? -- 
           and then stands and moves toward the kitchen, when Agent 
           Bell, playing the good cop, puts a hand on Rick’s shoulder 
           and eases him back into his chair.

                                 AGENT BELL
                        Forget about the coffee, Rick. 
                        We’ll get some when we leave.  

           Agent Bell opens a manila folder and spreads a series of 
           photographs on the table, ranging from mug shots to long lens 
           surveillance types. All young black men.

                                 AGENT BELL (CONT’D)
                        You know any of these guys?

           Rick Sr. takes a stack of photos from the table and flips 
           through them.

                                 RICK SR.
                        Some of them look familiar, but I 
                        couldn’t tell you their name’s or 
                        anything like that. 

                                 AGENT TURNER
                        You sure?

                                 RICK SR.
                        Yeah, I’m sure. 

                                 AGENT TURNER
                        They all live on the East Side, but 
                        you don’t know any of them? Hell, a 
                        couple of them are strutting around 
                        right now with guns you sold them 
                        rubbing against their big black 
                        cocks.

                                 RICK SR.
                        Now wait a fucking minute. 

                                 AGENT TURNER
                        No -- you wait a fucking minute. 
                                 RICK SR.
                        Owning a firearm is a 
                        constitutional right of every 
                        American citizen. It’s called the 
                        Second Amendment. You might want to 
                        look it up.

                                 AGENT TURNER
                        Is that so?

                                 RICK SR.
                        Sure is. 

                                 AGENT TURNER
                        You know how many times I’ve heard 
                        that line of bullshit?

                                 RICK SR.
                        I have a retail license to sell 
                        firearms.

                                 AGENT TURNER
                        To convicted felons? Out of your 
                        garage? Please show me that fucking 
                        permit. What about your son? Is he 
                        allowed to sell guns? He’s a minor, 
                        isn’t he? What Amendment is that 
                        fuck-face?

           Agent Bell sets his hand on Agent Turner’s chest who is 
           leaning forward like an angry dog on a chain.

                                 AGENT BELL
                        Whoa. Take it easy. Rick is on our 
                        side. He’s one of the good guys. 
                        He’d tell us if he knew anything. 
                        Wouldn’t you Rick?

                                 RICK SR.
                        You’re goddamn right I would. 

           Rick Sr. tosses the stack of photos back onto the table.

                                 RICK SR. (CONT’D)
                        I don’t know why you brought this 
                        asshole with you.

                                 AGENT TURNER
                        To clean out yours.

                                 RICK SR.
                        You’d like that wouldn’t you?
                                 AGENT BELL
                        Hey -- knock it off goddamnit.
                             (on an exhale)
                        On better days, Agent Turner is 
                        actually one of our more congenial 
                        types. He’s new to Detroit, so cut 
                        him some slack. 

                                 RICK SR.
                             (flustered)
                        I’m fucking cool.  

           Rick Sr. lights a cigarette. 

                                 AGENT BELL
                        The FBI can’t fight the good fight 
                        without help from the community, 
                        without help from people like you. 
                        Honest citizens. Family men.   

           Agent Bell produces a white letter-sized envelope from his 
           coat pocket and sets it on the table. The shape of the 
           envelope suggests there’s cash inside. He pats it gently.

                                 AGENT BELL (CONT’D)
                        The FBI respects people’s time. It 
                        respects what they hear, what they 
                        see. Intelligence is worth 
                        something. 
                             (pauses, then says)
                        If you don’t mind me asking, how 
                        much do you make a month? 

                                 RICK SR.
                        Not as much as I’d like. 

                                 AGENT BELL
                        We can help you with that.

           Ricky is standing in the hallway. He’s been watching the 
           entire time, fascinated with the exchange, a deep, 
           penetrating curiosity written across his face.

                                 AGENT BELL (CONT’D)
                        Crack cocaine is ruining Detroit. 
                        Hell, it’s ruining America. We’re 
                        on the front lines. You’re on the 
                        front lines. We’re all fighting 
                        this war together. Our children’s 
                        lives are at stake. 
                                 RICK SR.
                        Look, I would help you if I could, 
                        really. I don’t want dope in this 
                        neighborhood any more than you do.   

           Agent Bell takes the envelope of cash off the table and puts 
           it back in his coat pocket. But of course, this is a 
           calculated move, and he shrewdly anticipates that --   

           Rick Sr. doesn’t want to lose the deal -- whatever that deal 
           is at the moment. There was money on the table and now it’s 
           gone -- and we can see his mind racing -- how do I get it 
           back?  

           He takes a long pull on his cigarette, exhales a stream of 
           smoke, and scratches the back of his neck. He looks at his 
           son in the hallway, reluctant to bring him into the 
           conversation, but his mercenary impulses override any moral 
           qualms he might have.

                                 RICK SR. (CONT’D)
                        Maybe my son knows something. He’s 
                        always out and about.
                             (motions)
                        Hey, Ricky. Come here. I want you 
                        to meet a couple friends of mine.

           The FBI agents swivel their heads as Ricky walks over. 

                                 RICK SR. (CONT’D)
                        This is my son, Ricky. This is 
                        Agent Bell. And what was your name 
                        again?

                                 AGENT TURNER
                        Agent Turner. 

           They shake Ricky’s hand.

                                 RICK SR.
                             (to photos on table)
                        Do you know any of these guys? They 
                        live in the neighborhood.

           Ricky sifts through the stack of photos. His father and the 
           FBI agents are studying his every move, his eyes, his 
           breathing, searching for a physical tell. Ricky can feel 
           their burning stares. He’s practically sweating.

                                 RICK SR. (CONT’D)
                        You know any of them, Ricky? 

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        I don’t think so. 
                                 RICK SR.
                        None of them?

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        Nope.

           Agent Bell starts gathering the photos from the table and 
           putting them back into the manila folders.

                                 AGENT BELL
                        We appreciate your time this 
                        morning, Mr. Wershe. Like I said, 
                        it would only take a few minutes.

           But Rick Sr. has cause for suspicion. The nuances of his 
           son’s movements, the inflection of his voice, the unnatural 
           pauses, inform him that his son has not been forthright. 
           Moreover, he wants the goddamn money.  

                                 RICK SR.
                        Could you gentlemen hold on for a 
                        moment? If you don’t mind, I’d like 
                        to talk to my son in the other 
                        room. 

                                 AGENT BELL
                        We got all day.

                                 RICK SR.
                        Ricky, come here.

           Rick Sr. leads Ricky into the kitchen.

                                 RICK SR. (CONT’D)
                             (whispering)
                        You sure you don’t know any of 
                        those guys in the photos?

           Ricky stares down at the floor and does not answer. Rick Sr. 
           slaps the back of Ricky’s head. 

                                 RICK SR. (CONT’D)
                        Now listen to me. Those assholes 
                        out there can make my life really 
                        fucking difficult, yours too. You 
                        understand? 

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        I don’t want to be a snitch, Dad. 

                                 RICK SR.
                        You’re not snitching. You’re only 
                        giving them information. Drug 
                        dealers are scum. They ruin lives.
                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        But Dad -- 

                                 RICK SR.
                        Just tell them who those niggers 
                        are in the goddamned photos -- and 
                        they’ll pay us for it and be on 
                        their way. Can you help your dad 
                        out? Can you do that for me?  

           Ricky continues staring down at the linoleum.

                                 RICK SR. (CONT’D)
                        Can you do it for our family?

           After a long pause, Ricky reluctantly nods yes. 

           Father and son walk out of the kitchen together and sit back 
           down at the coffee table across from the agents. 

           Ricky lifts the stack of photos from the table. He studies 
           the first one.

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        This guy’s dead.  

           The revelation visibly embarrasses the Feds. Agent Turner 
           clears his throat as Agent Bell readjusts his butt cheeks on 
           the sofa.  

                                 RICKY WERSHE (CONT’D)
                        He got blasted last week. 
                             (hands photo to agents)
                        I guess you can take him out of 
                        your file.

           Agent Turner nods and scribbles on a note pad. Ricky studies 
           another photo.

                                 RICKY WERSHE (CONT’D)
                        This guy has been locked up for 
                        almost a year now. 

                                 AGENT TURNER
                        Where?

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        Wayne County. Guess you can take 
                        him out of your file too.

           Further embarrassment from the agents, more nodding, throat 
           clearing, studious note taking. 

           Rick Sr. can smell the money. He pats his son on the back.
                                 RICK SR.
                        All right, Ricky. Keep it up.
                             (to agents)
                        He may not do well in school, but 
                        he’s got street smarts -- and 
                        that’ll get you a lot further in 
                        life. He’s a fucking genius as far 
                        as I’m concerned. 

           But nobody is really paying much attention to Dad’s 
           commentary.

           Ricky studies another photo. He turns it around and displays 
           it to the agents. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        This is “Big Stink.”

                                 AGENT TURNER
                        What’s his real name?

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        Don’t know.

                                 AGENT TURNER
                        Do you know why they call him “Big 
                        Stink”?

           Ricky shakes his head as his father takes a stab at humor.

                                 RICK SR.
                        Maybe he shits his pants?

           But Rick Sr. is the only one who chuckles. He’s got that 
           giddy surge of a gambler on a hot streak. 

           Ricky flips through the rest of the stack and then hands the 
           photos back to the agents.

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        I know most of their faces, but not 
                        their names or who they run with.

           Ricky thinks he’s finished. But the agents aren’t done with 
           him just yet. They open another manila folder with a single 
           photo inside. It’s a long lens surveillance shot of two men 
           in mink coats conversing outside an East Side night club.

                                 AGENT TURNER
                        What about these two guys? You know 
                        them?

           Ricky looks at the photo. As we push in on the men’s faces we 
           recognize them as the Curry Brothers. 
                                 AGENT TURNER (CONT’D)
                        Of course you do. And we’re gonna 
                        take these fuckers down. 

           MOMENTS LATER 

           Rick Sr. escorts Agents Bell and Turner to the front door. 

                                 AGENT BELL
                        Your son was very helpful today. 

           Rick Sr. is smiling like a pig in shit as he pats the agents 
           on the back. The envelope with cash is now in his right hand. 

                                 RICK SR.
                        You know where you can find us.  
                        I’ll have the coffee waiting for 
                        you next time. Just be sure to park 
                        around the block.

           The agents step outside and Rick Sr. shuts the door behind 
           them. He turns around and waves the envelope at Ricky, who is 
           still sitting in the living room.  

                                 RICK SR. (CONT’D)
                             (like the O’Jays song)
                        Money - money - money - MUUUHH-
                        NAAAY! MUH-NAAAY!

           But Ricky does not share his father’s enthusiasm.  

                                 RICK SR. (CONT’D)
                        Look at that, easiest money we ever 
                        made. 

           Rick Sr. tears open the envelope and starts counting the 
           money onto the coffee table, crisp hundred dollar bills, ten 
           of them. 

                                 RICK SR. (CONT’D)
                        Jesus Christ. I thought the 
                        government was broke.  

           He fans the money like playing cards across the table.

                                 RICK SR. (CONT’D)
                        I think a ninety/ten split is more 
                        than generous. Does that sound fair 
                        to you, Ricky? I mean, after all, 
                        you live under my roof -- and those 
                        guys are my contacts. 

           But Ricky only nods absently. He looks ashamed. 
                                 RICK SR. (CONT’D)
                        Good. It’s a deal then. 
                             (changing course)
                        You can’t tell a soul about this, 
                        Ricky. Nobody. Not even Dawn. We 
                        could get killed if somebody found 
                        out about this. Understand?

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        Yeah.

                                 RICK SR.
                        Who knows, we might even be able to 
                        make a nice little side business 
                        out of this. 

           Rick Sr. hands Ricky a hundred dollar bill and then folds the 
           other nine bills and stuffs them in his pant pocket.

                                 RICK SR. (CONT’D)
                        You hungry? Let’s go celebrate.

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        What about school?

                                 RICK SR.
                        Screw it. You can go tomorrow.   

                                 RICK WERSHE (V.O.)
                        I had become an FBI informant, and 
                        I didn’t even know it. I was just 
                        fourteen years-old.

           EXT. THE EAST SIDE - DAY

           It’s late afternoon and junior high school is letting out for 
           the day as Ricky walks down the sidewalk and turns onto a 
           neighborhood street. 

           A sedan with tinted windows creeps down the block behind him 
           as if preparing for a drive-by. When the sedan pulls 
           alongside -- 

                                 AGENT TURNER (O.S.)
                        Hey, White Boy. 

           Ricky whips to his left and finds Agent Turner chuckling from 
           the passenger seat. Agent Bell drives.  

           Ricky scans the neighborhood, the packs of students walking 
           home, some cruising in cars, a few residents sitting on 
           tumbledown porches, drinking beer and bullshitting. 
                                 AGENT TURNER (CONT’D)
                        Let’s go for a ride. 

           Ricky is frozen. He doesn’t know what to do. 

                                 AGENT TURNER (CONT’D)
                        The longer you stand there, the 
                        more suspicious you look. 

           Ricky opens the back door and ducks inside -- where he’s 
           startled by a rawboned BLACK MAN in the backseat. Sunglasses 
           conceal the man’s eyes and a hoodie enshrouds his corn-rowed 
           scalp. Agent Turner swivels around from the front seat as the 
           car eases down the street. 

                                 AGENT TURNER (CONT’D)
                        Ricky, that’s Officer Jackson of 
                        the Detroit Police Department. We 
                        all work together. He looks rough, 
                        but he’s really a teddy bear.

           Officer Jackson nods to Ricky, cold and stony, hardly a teddy 
           bear. He’s been undercover for so long that he is a cop in 
           title only, as much a product of the street as the criminals 
           he takes down -- more gangster than the gangsters. 

                                 AGENT TURNER (CONT’D)
                        You feel like making some money, 
                        Ricky?

                                 AGENT BELL
                        Of course he does.

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        Does my dad know about this?

                                 AGENT TURNER
                        What do we look like -- kidnappers?

                                 AGENT BELL
                        We’re the good guys, Ricky. And so 
                        are you.

           INT. THE FBI SEDAN, GRATIOT AVE - LATER  

           The sun smolders behind the industrial haze and the 
           silhouetted smoke stacks of dying factories as the sedan 
           cruises down the avenue. Everyone is chewing on burgers, 
           fries, sipping sodas. 
                                 AGENT TURNER
                        I’m gonna put this whole situation 
                        in simple terms for you, Ricky. You 
                        know who the First Lady is?

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        The President’s wife? 

                                 AGENT TURNER
                        That’s right. Nancy Davis Reagan. 
                        You get an A in civics for the day. 
                        Well, it turns out that the First 
                        Lady is very fucking angry these 
                        days. She’s so fucking angry that 
                        she’s declared war. A War on Drugs. 
                        You know what that really means? 
                        That means that if she doesn’t get 
                        what she wants, if she doesn’t win 
                        this fucking goddamn war, the 
                        President doesn’t get any pussy. 
                        She locks his dick out of her 
                        vagina. And that’s bad for the 
                        country. Hell, it’s bad for the 
                        whole fucking world. Because when 
                        the President of the United States 
                        of America ain’t getting laid, he 
                        gets really fucking frustrated, and 
                        the next thing you know the nukes 
                        start flying and we’re buried in 
                        World War III with the fucking 
                        Russians. 

                                 OFFICER JACKSON
                        We gotta win this war, kid. Or else 
                        we’re all fucked.  

                                 AGENT TURNER
                        Have you ever bought crack cocaine, 
                        Ricky?

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        No.

                                 AGENT TURNER
                        Do you know what it looks like?

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        Of course. 

                                 OFFICER JACKSON
                        You ain’t just saying that to be 
                        cool, right brutha?
                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        I’ve never smoked it. But I seen 
                        it.

                                 AGENT TURNER
                        Good. We’re gonna play a little 
                        game. And the more you play, the 
                        more we pay. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        What’s the game?

                                 OFFICER JACKSON
                        The Crack Cocaine Game. 

                                 AGENT TURNER
                        We’re gonna stop by a few houses on 
                        the East Side, and you’re gonna go 
                        inside and buy some crack.

           Ricky stops chewing his burger. Officer Jackson can smell the 
           fear. 

                                 OFFICER JACKSON
                        You ain’t no punk, Ricky? Are you?

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                             (not convincing)
                        No.

                                 OFFICER JACKSON
                        They said you was born and raised 
                        on the East Side. Shit, I think we 
                        got the wrong muthafuckin’ White 
                        Boy back here. We got us a Grosse 
                        Pointe Country Club Cracker is what 
                        we got. 
                             (affecting a white voice)
                        Are you a good putter, Ricky? How’s 
                        your tee shot, Richard?  

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        I ain’t no punk. 

           Jackson grins, nudges Ricky on the shoulder. 

                                 OFFICER JACKSON
                        I’m just fucking with you.  

           The sedan turns off Gratiot and down a dark street. Even from 
           inside the car the neighborhood is scary.

           Agent Bell kills the headlights and rolls to a stop behind a 
           car on blocks. 
                                 AGENT TURNER
                             (pointing)
                        You see that house down there? The 
                        abandoned one with the lights off? 

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        The one the crack head just walked 
                        out of?

                                 AGENT TURNER
                        That’s the one.

           Agent Turner hands Ricky a twenty dollar bill. 

                                 AGENT TURNER (CONT’D)
                        We need you to go around to the 
                        back door and tell them you want 
                        two dime rocks. This is what’s 
                        called a “controlled buy”, and 
                        these buys help us build a case 
                        against drug dealers. Understand?

           Ricky nods.

                                 AGENT TURNER (CONT’D)
                        You ready?  

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        What’s my take?

                                 AGENT TURNER
                        For what?

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        For playing the game. 

                                 OFFICER JACKSON
                        Listen to this muthafucka -- what’s 
                        my take? You tell ‘em boy. Shit, 
                        East Side all the way.

                                 AGENT TURNER
                        Did we take care of you last time?
                             (off Ricky’s look)
                        OK then. Now go get us some crack.

           Ricky reaches into his waistband and removes his .25 auto. He 
           pulls back the slide halfway, checks the chamber, making sure 
           it’s loaded -- which triggers panic and alarm inside the car.

                                 AGENT TURNER (CONT’D)
                        Whoa - whoa - whoa - what the fuck 
                        are you doing, kid? You can’t do 
                        that.
                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        What do you mean? 

                                 AGENT TURNER
                        We can’t allow you to carry a 
                        firearm.

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        You got one.

                                 AGENT TURNER
                        We’re the fucking FBI.

           Officer Jackson loves the drama. What do the Feds expect -- 
           this is the fucking street.

                                 OFFICER JACKSON
                        You can’t send no warrior into the 
                        jungle without no spear. 

           Agent Bell, the senior most officer, turns around from the 
           driver’s seat. He is calm, measured, composed.

                                 AGENT BELL
                        Ricky. I can appreciate your desire 
                        to protect yourself. But the gun 
                        stays in the car. Don’t worry, we 
                        got your back. That’s why we’re 
                        here.  

           Agent Bell holds out his palm. 

                                 AGENT BELL (CONT’D)
                        We’ll give it back to you at the 
                        end of the night. When we’re done 
                        playing.

           Ricky hands Agent Bell his .25 auto. 

                                 OFFICER JACKSON
                        Straight fuckin’ gangsta. I love 
                        this nigga already.

           Ricky exits the sedan and moves down the dark street toward 
           the crack house. 

           He steps into the weed-infested front yard and follows a 
           trampled footpath down the side of the house. He pushes 
           through overgrown bushes and hanging vines. 

           A figure approaches on the narrow footpath, a shadow really, 
           and shimmies past Ricky without even noticing him. The crack 
           head has only one thing on his mind -- smoking the rock he 
           just bought.
           Ricky turns the corner to the rear of the house where light 
           spills from underneath a wrought iron door. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        I ain’t gonna lie, but I was scared 
                        shitless.  

           He approaches tentatively, his heart pounding. He knocks on 
           the door. A slit opens at eye level and there’s a sawed-off 
           shotgun barrel pointed at him.

                                 DOORMAN
                        What the fuck you want?

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        Two dime rocks.

                                 DOORMAN
                        Step into the light muthafuckuh.

           Ricky steps into the shaft of light spilling from the door 
           slit. His fresh features are at odds with the situation. 

                                 DOORMAN (CONT’D)
                        You ain’t no smoker.

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        It’s for my mom. 

           The doorman chuckles.     

                                 DOORMAN
                        She fine? Let her know I’ll give 
                        her a nickel rock next time if she 
                        sucks my dick.   

           The doorman howls.

                                 DOORMAN (CONT’D)
                        Gimme the money white boy.

           Ricky pushes the twenty dollar bill through the slit. The 
           doorman takes the money and shoves a crack vial with a red 
           cap out the other side. 

           INT. THE FBI SEDAN - MOMENTS LATER

           Ricky hops back into the sedan. 

                                 AGENT TURNER
                        Did you get it?
           Ricky opens his palm and reveals the crack vial with two dime 
           rocks inside.

                                 AGENT BELL
                        Thatta kid.

           Officer Jackson takes the vial and removes the tiny red cap 
           with his teeth. He dumps a rock into his hand and packs it 
           into a thin glass pipe. 

           To Ricky’s astonishment, Jackson sparks a torch lighter and 
           takes a hit, the blue flame hissing and crackling as it 
           devours the rock. Jackson closes his eyes and exhales the 
           smoke as the euphoria slams into his brain.   

                                 OFFICER JACKSON
                        It’s the real deal, gentlemen. The 
                        real muuuuthaaaafuuuuuckin deal.

           Jackson offers the pipe to Ricky. 

                                 OFFICER JACKSON (CONT’D)
                        Go on. Hit it, boy. 

           Ricky stares at the smoldering pipe with a mixture of terror 
           and bewilderment.   

                                 OFFICER JACKSON (CONT’D)
                        Go on. We won’t tell nobody.

           An ugly silence chokes the interior, the yellow crack smoke 
           feathering the stagnant air, Ricky’s head whirling -- until 
           Jackson snatches away the pipe and bellows.  

                                 OFFICER JACKSON (CONT’D)
                        Shit, I’m just playing with you. We 
                        can’t smoke this -- this is 
                        evidence. 

           He shoves the vial with the remaining crack rock into a large 
           Ziploc bag.

                                 AGENT TURNER
                             (to Ricky)
                        Ready to do another one?

                                                                CUT TO:

           A SERIES OF SHOTS

           As Ricky buys crack from various houses throughout the night, 
           strutting through the murky shadows, feeling more 
           comfortable, gaining a confidence and rhythm to his deeds.   
           -- His knuckles rap on a door. He hands over the money and 
           receives a crack vial.

           -- He climbs into the sedan. The agents congratulate him. 
           Officer Jackson give him a high-five, takes the vial, and 
           smokes a rock. 

                                 AGENT BELL
                        You tired yet, Ricky?

                                 AGENT TURNER
                             (ironically)
                        Don’t forget it’s a school night.

           The dashboard clock reads: 11:38PM.

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        I’m straight. 

                                 OFFICER JACKSON
                        Kid’s a gamer. Let’s keep rolling.

           And the crack game rolls on as the sedan cruises the burned-
           out and beleaguered streets.

           INT. THE FBI SEDAN - LATER

           The sedan idles in front of Ricky’s house. The dashboard 
           clock now reads: 3:03AM. 

           Agent Bell hands Ricky back his .25 auto which rests atop a 
           small cash payment for his night’s work. 

                                 AGENT BELL 
                        You did a really great job tonight, 
                        Ricky. You played the game well.  

           Agent Turner gives Ricky a business card. 

                                 AGENT TURNER
                        From now on, we’re gonna be your 
                        handlers. If you need anything, or 
                        if you see or hear anything that 
                        you think we should know about, you 
                        give us or Officer Jackson here a 
                        call. 
                             (to Jackson)
                        You got a card on you?

           Jackson laughs.

                                 OFFICER JACKSON
                        A fuckin card? Yeah, right here. 
           He flips off Agent Turner. 

           Ricky opens the door and steps out. Jackson gets out as well, 
           pulls the hoodie over his head, and struts down the street, 
           hops a chain link fence, and disappears into the night.  

           INT. THE WERSHE’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           The taillights from the sedan fade into the distance as Ricky 
           enters.    

           He moves quietly through the dark living room and into the 
           kitchen where his father is sitting at the formica table, 
           smoking a cigarette and nursing a whiskey.   

                                 RICK SR.
                        How much you make? 

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        Not much.

                                 RICK SR.
                        Hand it over. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        I earned it. 

                                 RICK SR.
                        Those are my contacts. You agreed 
                        to the deal, fair and square. This 
                        is our business, not your business. 
                        It’s a partnership.    

           To be sure, there are many disturbing aspects to the 
           conversation, but perhaps the most disturbing is Mr. Wershe’s 
           complete failure to concentrate on anything other than the 
           basic compensation he believes is due him.

                                 RICK SR. (CONT’D)
                        Nobody likes a welcher, Ricky. 
                        Nobody does business with them. I 
                        gave us this opportunity. I created 
                        it, not you. 

           Ricky reaches into his pocket and produces a thin stack of 
           cash and hands it to his father. 

                                 RICK SR. (CONT’D)
                        Thank you. Next time you need to 
                        call me and ask for permission to 
                        work with them. I’m gonna give 
                        those assholes an earful tomorrow. 
           Rick Sr. counts out one-hundred and fifty dollars in small 
           bills. He gives Ricky a ten and a five.

                                 RICK SR. (CONT’D)
                        Cheap fuckers... They should be 
                        paying us a lot more than this.

           Ricky moves down the hallway toward his room while his dad 
           remains in the kitchen.  

                                 RICK SR. (CONT’D)
                        You seen, Dawn?

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        Not since the weekend.

                                 RICK SR.
                        I don’t trust her new boyfriend. I 
                        don’t trust him at all. Why can’t 
                        she date any white guys?

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        There aren’t any.

           Ricky closes his door and locks it. He pulls up his pant cuff 
           and removes THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS hidden inside his sock. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        If there’s one thing my dad taught 
                        me, it was to always be one step 
                        ahead. 

           He reaches under his bed, slides out a SHOE BOX, and stuffs 
           the money inside.

           EXT. THE MARATHON GARAGE - DAY

           Ricky steers his BMX bike into the lot and parks at the air 
           dispenser. But like before, he’s not here to fill his tires -- 
           he’s here to observe, to admire, to fantasize.  

           Music bumps from the garage where a small crew has gathered 
           around several tricked-out rides.

           As Ricky pretends to fill his tires, stealing glances at the 
           gathering, a member of the crew breaks from the crowd and 
           struts over to him. He is BOO CURRY -- Johnny and Leo’s 
           younger brother.

                                 BOO
                        You need to find the dude that sold 
                        you them faulty tires and beat his 
                        ass. 
           Ricky is caught without a reply, and nods in deference to the 
           towering figure. 

                                 BOO (CONT’D)
                        You fill those things up so much we 
                        need to start charging you. 

           Boo chuckles. But the banter is only a friendly preamble for 
           his real intentions. 

                                 BOO (CONT’D)
                        You live over on Hampshire, don’t 
                        you?

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        Yeah.

                                 BOO
                        Your dad drives a black Ranchero?

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        Yeah.

                                 BOO
                        I heard he could hook a player up 
                        with a Mac-10. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        The Mac-11’s better. 

                                 BOO
                        Is that right?

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        It’s smaller and lighter. 1090 
                        rpm’s versus 1380 rpm’s.

           The jargon registers a blank stare from Boo. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE (CONT’D)
                        That’s rounds-per-minute. The Mac-
                        11 is a much faster gun. That’s 
                        what I’d get if I were you.  

           Boo glances over his shoulder at Johnny and Leo, who are 
           watching the exchange from the open doorway to the garage. 
           It’s clear that they sent Boo over here to do their bidding. 
           Boo nods to his older brothers, the kingpins, indicating that 
           the conversation is bearing fruit. 

                                 BOO
                        How do I get a hold of your dad?
                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        You don’t have to. I can hook you 
                        up with whatever you need.  

                                 BOO
                        No shit?

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        I’d be a fool if I lied to the 
                        Curry Brothers. 

           Boo chuckles. 

                                 BOO
                        All right then. Gimme two Mac-11’s. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        When? 

                                 BOO
                        How about Saturday? 

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        How about Friday?

           Boo chuckles again. He can’t believe the hustle in this kid.

                                 BOO
                        Friday it is. What’s your name?

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        Ricky. 

                                 BOO
                        I’m Boo.

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        I know. 

           EXT. THE EAST SIDE - DAY

           The sun is setting as Ricky pedals his bike through the 
           neighborhood with a duffel bag slung across his handlebars.

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        And so when Friday rolled around, I 
                        delivered as promised. 

           Ricky steers into the lot and over to the garage where Boo is 
           waiting for him. Ricky rides inside and Boo pulls down the 
           roll-up door. 
           INT. MARATHON GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER

           Ricky opens the duffel bag, revealing -- 

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        Two Mac-11’s. 

           Boo reaches inside, takes one of the weapons, feels the 
           weight, nods, pleased, impressed.  

           TIME CUT

           When Boo rolls up the garage door, the night glitters with a 
           fleet of washed and waxed luxury vehicles idling in the lot, 
           lined up as if for a parade, each one chromed and candied in 
           its own ghetto fabulous way.     

           Ricky straddles his bike, awestruck, the surface of his eyes 
           gleaming with the reflection. 

                                 BOO
                        What you doing tonight?

           Ricky shrugs. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        Nothing. 

                                 BOO
                        You wanna roll with us? 

           But Ricky is speechless. He’s not quite sure if the 
           invitation is genuine or if Boo is just fucking with him.

                                 BOO (CONT’D)
                        Leave your bike in the garage. 
                        It’ll be here when you get back. 

           Ricky sets his bike against the wall and follows Boo over to 
           the lead vehicle -- a shimmering Berlina Coupe. If money was 
           no object, and you were playing a pimp for the night, this 
           would be your official ride.  

           Johnny leans across the front seat. 

                                 JOHNNY CURRY
                        Yo Boo. He can ride with me.

           Ricky hesitates before climbing inside. 

                                 JOHNNY CURRY (CONT’D)
                        Ready to roll?
           Ricky marvels at the plush leather interior and the gaudy 
           accessories. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        Yeah... Fuck yeah.

           The fleet pulls onto the boulevard, ten, maybe fifteen cars 
           deep, cruising along at an easy roll, taking their time, 
           wanting to be seen.

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        Riding around in Johnny Curry’s 
                        front seat gave me instant respect. 
                        I don’t know why the Curry Brothers 
                        took such a strong liking to me. 
                        Perhaps I was the exotic white kid, 
                        almost like an alien or circus 
                        midget or some sort of novelty. 
                        Whatever it was, they immediately 
                        brought me into their crew.

           The convoy pulls into the parking lot of Royal Skateland and 
           files inside. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        On the weekends, or any night for 
                        that matter, the Curry Brothers and 
                        their crew would take over Royal 
                        Skateland.

           INT. ROYAL SKATELAND - CONTINUOUS

           The joint flashes with strobe lights as a DJ holds sway 
           behind a couple of turntables. A giant disco ball hangs over 
           the center of the rink as dozens of skaters roll around the 
           floor. 

           The atmosphere has a dreamlike, almost mesmerizing effect on 
           Ricky, the whirling colors, the thumping music, turning his 
           head to admire the overflowing rush of beautiful black women 
           that are seemingly everywhere. 

           A section of tables has been cordoned off with red velour 
           ropes and brass stanchions. A bouncer unlatches the rope and 
           the Curry crew situates themselves at the reserved tables. 
           Ricky sits down with Johnny, Leo, and Boo.  

                                 JOHNNY CURRY
                        You like cognac? 

           Ricky nods, sure, why not. Johnny signals a waitress to bring 
           the table a round of drinks.  
           A LITTLE LATER in the night.

           Ricky sips cognac, nodding to the beat of the music, when his 
           attention becomes transfixed in the way that only an 
           enchanting woman can bring about --

           TIME SEEMS TO STAND STILL -- as CATHY VOLSAN sashays her 
           sensual hips and finely sculpted backside, skating in 
           reverse. It’s as though a spotlight follows her around the 
           rink. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        Cathy Volsan was Johnny’s 
                        girlfriend. She also happened to be 
                        Mayor Coleman Young’s favorite 
                        niece, which made her the crown 
                        princess of Detroit. But even 
                        though she was royalty, she loved 
                        bad boys, most specifically, drug 
                        dealers.

           She skates past Johnny’s table and blows him a seductive 
           kiss, winks, and caresses her luscious thighs in an expert 
           tease.  

                                 RICKY WERSHE  (V.O.)
                        She had a special police detail 
                        assigned to her, twenty-four hours 
                        a day and seven days a week, which 
                        not only assured her safety, but 
                        that of the Curry Brothers.  

           At the rink side, Johnny leans over the railing and whispers 
           to TWO YOUNG LADIES. He points in the direction of two plain 
           clothes POLICE OFFICERS, Cathy’s detail, who are watching the 
           action at one of the ingresses to the rink. 

           On Johnny’s orders, the ladies skate over to the cops, flirt 
           with them for a moment, and then escort them over to the 
           men’s bathroom where one of Johnny’s crew stands guard 
           outside. 

           INSIDE THE BATHROOM -- MOMENTS LATER 

           One of the young ladies is now bent over the porcelain sink 
           as a cop thrusts into her from behind while the other young 
           lady rides on top of the other cop inside a stall. Both 
           ladies are still wearing their pink skates and moaning loudly 
           for effect. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        The Curry Brothers knew how to 
                        treat people, especially the cops. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Watching over the Mayor’s niece was 
                        the best detail a Detroit cop could 
                        ever dream up...

           EXT. MANOOGIAN MANSION - DAY

           Camera tracks down the horseshoe driveway of the Mayor’s 
           stately residence and past the tricked-out rides of the Curry 
           crew and up the marble front steps and through the towering 
           front door and out to the grassy backyard where Johnny and 
           Cathy are reciting their vows with the shimmering river 
           behind them. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        ...And when Johnny and Cathy tied 
                        the knot, Mayor Young happily 
                        opened the gates of Manoogian 
                        Mansion to send off his favorite 
                        niece. 

           Beneath the floral wedding bower, MAYOR YOUNG kisses Cathy on 
           the cheek and then hugs Johnny Curry. 

                                 MAYOR YOUNG
                        Welcome to the family, Johnny.

           Now the Mayor’s cronies, the power elite, move in to 
           congratulate Johnny and Cathy on their nuptials.

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        Nobody played the game better than 
                        Johnny “Little Man” Curry and Leo 
                        “Big Man” Curry. They understood 
                        politics on every level. They 
                        understood the power of it. If the 
                        Curry Brothers hadn’t been born 
                        black, and in Detroit, I swear to 
                        god they would have ruled the 
                        world.

           Ricky and the crew throw rice onto the newlyweds. It all 
           seems like an impossible dream, only it’s all too real in the 
           backwards ass city they call Detroit. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        I can’t remember the exact date 
                        when I stopped going to school. It 
                        wasn’t something I really planned 
                        or anything. It just sort of 
                        happened...
           INT. THE FBI SEDAN - NIGHT

           They have just wrapped up another night of work as the sedan 
           pulls to a stop down the street from Ricky’s house. It’s very 
           late and the neighborhood is dead quiet. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        ...I was either hanging with the 
                        Curry Brothers or running around 
                        with the FBI all night. 

           It’s the same configuration as before: Agent Bell drives and 
           Agent Turner sits in the front passenger seat. Officer 
           Jackson sits alongside Ricky in the backseat. 

           Agent Turner hands Ricky a knot of cash, his payment for the 
           night. Then Agent Turner nods to Officer Jackson, who hands 
           Ricky a small paper bag. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        What’s this?

                                 OFFICER JACKSON
                        A bonus.

           Ricky peers inside the bag --  

                                 AGENT TURNER
                        It’s half a kilo of cocaine.

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        What do you want me to do with it?

                                 AGENT TURNER
                        Sell it. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        To who?

                                 OFFICER JACKSON
                        Ricky, you could sell rice to the 
                        muthafuckin’ Chinese.

                                 AGENT TURNER
                        It’s important that you get your 
                        hands dirty. Word will spread 
                        around the neighborhood. It’ll make 
                        you that much more authentic. Less 
                        suspicious. 

                                 AGENT BELL
                        An informant needs to erase all 
                        doubt about his credentials. All 
                        doubt that he’s not a criminal.
                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        I don’t really want to sell coke.

                                 AGENT TURNER
                        It’s all part of an act. You’re 
                        thinking too deeply about it, kid. 
                        The key to your job is being a 
                        great actor. This is your stage, 
                        and you need to own your part.

                                 AGENT BELL
                        War isn’t pretty, Ricky. And 
                        sometimes you have to make moral 
                        compromises in order to win.

           The hesitation, the reluctance, the misgivings are written 
           across Ricky’s features. 

                                 OFFICER JACKSON
                        You scared? Shit, we just gave you 
                        an extra seven thousand dollars. 
                        You should be thanking us. If you 
                        don’t want it, I’ll fuckin’ sell 
                        it. 

                                 AGENT BELL
                        Ricky, trust us. Don’t think so 
                        much. We know what we’re doing. 
                        You’re a great kid, and you’re 
                        doing a great job.
                             (then)
                        Do you trust us?

           Ricky nods. But it’s not very convincing. 

                                 AGENT BELL (CONT’D)
                        Good. Now get some rest. 

           Ricky exits the sedan and walks down the street toward his 
           house. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        I may have done some illegal stuff 
                        on my own, but I never sold drugs 
                        until the cops gave them to me. 

           EXT. THE MARATHON GARAGE - DAY

           Ricky struts onto the lot. He’s wearing a brand new red 
           Adidas track suit and Top Ten sneakers. He greets Boo with a 
           handshake.        
           Boo steps back to admire Ricky’s new threads. In fact, Boo 
           and Ricky, apart from one being black and the other white, 
           are dressed like identical twins. 

                                 BOO
                        You biting my style, Ricky? 

           Boo chuckles. He leads Ricky around the side of the garage to 
           several new super bikes.  

                                 BOO (CONT’D)
                        Look at that shit. Kawasaki Ninjas. 
                        Fastest street bike in the world. 
                        That’s what Ninja means in 
                        Japanese: Fast Muthafucka. Can you 
                        ride?

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        I’ve been dirt riding before. 

                                 BOO
                        Same shit, bro. Only on the street. 
                        Let’s go pick up some hoes. 

           Boo and Ricky, with reckless bravado, each straddle a Ninja 
           and turn onto the street and race down the block. 

           EXT. THE MARATHON GARAGE - LATER THAT NIGHT

           After racing around the city all day, Ricky and Boo ride back 
           into the lot and pull the Ninjas into the garage. A group of 
           young men play eight ball at a pool table in the corner.  

           Johnny Curry, the consummate business man, sits in the back 
           office at a desk. He stands and waves Ricky over.

                                 JOHNNY CURRY
                        Shut the door.

           Ricky shuts the door. 

                                 JOHNNY CURRY (CONT’D)
                        You doing some hustling on the 
                        side?

           Ricky turns pale. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        What do you mean?

                                 JOHNNY CURRY
                        You know, hustling a little of the 
                        white?
           Ricky bows his head, scared, can’t look Johnny in the eyes. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        I should’ve asked you first. I know 
                        this is your neighborhood and all. 

                                 JOHNNY CURRY
                        It ain’t like that little man. It’s 
                        all good. Just get it from me from 
                        now on. I’ll set you up. 
                             (on Ricky’s nod)
                        Who’d you get it from? One of my 
                        guys?

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        No, it was uh, it was my dad’s 
                        friend. 

                                 JOHNNY CURRY
                        White dude?

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        Yeah. From the suburbs.

           Satisfied, Johnny moves over to a closet and removes a triple-
           beam scale from inside. He places the scale on the desk along 
           with a set of calibrating weights.  

           He sets a weight on the scale and slides the measure until 
           the pointer balances out.

                                 JOHNNY CURRY
                        What does that say?

           Ricky squints and reads the measure on the scale.

                                 RICKY WERSHE

                                 JOHNNY CURRY
                        250 grams.

           Johnny sets another calibrating weight on the scale and 
           slides the measure until the pointer rides flush.

                                 JOHNNY CURRY (CONT’D)
                        What does that say?

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        500. 500 grams.

           Johnny sets another weight on the scale. Ricky reads the 
           measurement. 
                                 RICKY WERSHE (CONT’D)
                        650 grams. 

                                 JOHNNY CURRY
                        That’s a life sentence in the State 
                        of Michigan. You get caught holding 
                        650 grams of cocaine or more and 
                        you’re leaving prison in a coffin. 
                        Remember that. Always have your 
                        shit wrapped tight. Know your game. 
                        Never have your drugs and your 
                        money in the same place. And never 
                        bring any drugs here. Understand?

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        Yes, Johnny. 

                                 JOHNNY CURRY
                        You got a lot of heart. Stay smart 
                        and you might last a while. 

           INT. INTERNATIONAL HOUSE OF PANCAKES - DAY

           A suburb of Detroit. Nothing but white people here. Ricky 
           sits across from FBI Agent’s Bell and Turner. 

                                 AGENT BELL
                        Who calls the shots, Johnny or Leo?

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        It seems like they both do. It’s 
                        all really organized, and they 
                        don’t tolerate any bullshit from 
                        their workers. They know all the 
                        laws and they never keep the drugs 
                        and the money together.  
                             (lowering his voice)
                        They got the Detroit police in 
                        their pockets. You’re never gonna 
                        take them down. 

                                 AGENT TURNER
                        You let us worry about that, Ricky. 
                        We know who we can trust and who we 
                        can’t. 

           Ricky looks around the restaurant, on edge, nervous. He 
           watches the patrons coming through the front door, a white 
           family with two young kids. 

                                 AGENT BELL
                        Keep going, Ricky. You’re safe 
                        here. 
                                 AGENT TURNER
                        There ain’t a spook for five miles. 
                        As soon as they cross Eight Mile, 
                        the cops pull them over.

                                 AGENT BELL
                        Go on.

           After another nervous search of the crowded breakfast joint, 
           Ricky continues.

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        The crack business never sleeps. 
                        Around the clock, guys are cooking 
                        it up and slanging rocks for the 
                        Curry Brothers.

           As Ricky debriefs the agents, we see the images and scenes 
           related to his testimony -- 

           EXT. AN EAST SIDE NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT

           A car stops in front of a crack house.

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        At a specific time each day, two 
                        couriers drive around from house to 
                        house picking up all the money from 
                        the crack sales.

           TWO MEN exit the house and approach the car. One of the men 
           carries a large grocery bag, the other has his hand inside 
           his coat on his gun, scanning the neighborhood for potential 
           danger, police or would-be jackers. 

           The grocery bag is handed to the passenger and the car pulls 
           away. It’s all very well-orchestrated. Just like a Brinks 
           pick up. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        The cash is then brought back to 
                        the garage and tallied up.

           INT. THE MARATHON GARAGE - NIGHT

           A bank of video games line the back wall. Ricky plays Donkey 
           Kong while Boo gobbles up power pellets and ghosts in Pac-
           Man.   

           Johnny Curry enters, holding two swollen industrial-sized 
           garbage bags, and calls out to -- 
                                 JOHNNY CURRY
                        Hey, Ricky. 

           Ricky turns around from Donkey Kong. 

                                 JOHNNY CURRY (CONT’D)
                        Can you count?

           But the question is rhetorical.

                                 JOHNNY CURRY (CONT’D)
                        I already know Boo can’t.

           INT. THE BACK ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Ricky follows Johnny into the back room. Johnny turns the 
           swollen garbage bags upside down and empties a mountain of 
           wrinkled cash onto the table, which spills onto the floor. 

                                 JOHNNY CURRY
                        What does that look like to you?

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        A lot of fuckin’ money. 

                                 JOHNNY CURRY
                        It’s a fuckin’ problem, is what it 
                        is. Until it gets organized. 

           FREEZE FRAME ON RICKY’S HUGE EYES STARING AT THE MONEY:

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        I thought it was the greatest 
                        problem I ever seen. I wanted that 
                        problem. But you gotta understand: 
                        the Curry Brothers were grossing 
                        over a hundred thousand a day. One 
                        hundred thousand. And almost all of 
                        it was in small bills, which is 
                        fine for buying snacks at the 
                        liquor store, but not for buying 
                        large amounts of cocaine.

           RESUME NORMAL SPEED:

                                 JOHNNY CURRY
                        The white muthafuckas -- no offense 
                        -- that bring the cocaine into the 
                        city by the planeload don’t take 
                        small bills for payments. They want 
                        hundreds. That’s it. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JOHNNY CURRY (CONT'D)
                        Which creates a major fuckin’ 
                        hassle in my life, the hassle of 
                        which, I’m now turning over to you. 
                        I need you to separate the fives 
                        from the tens from the twenties and 
                        stack them into neat piles. You can 
                        keep the singles.

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        What about the fifties and 
                        hundreds?

                                 JOHNNY CURRY
                        There shouldn’t be any. They 
                        should’ve already been sorted out. 
                        Grab yourself a soda. You’re gonna 
                        be here all night.

           INT. THE INTERNATIONAL HOUSE OF PANCAKES - CONTINUOUS

           Ricky sits across from the FBI agents.

                                 AGENT TURNER
                        Who are the white motherfuckers 
                        he’s talking about? Who brings the 
                        cocaine into the city?

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        I don’t know. 

                                 AGENT TURNER
                        It’s imperative that you find out. 
                        We want the head of the snake. 

                                 AGENT BELL
                        Keep going. This is all really good 
                        information. 

                                                           CUT BACK TO:

           INT. THE MARATHON GARAGE - CONTINUOUS 

           Ricky reaches into the heap of cash and pulls out a handful. 
           He begins sorting the fives from the tens from the twenties, 
           arranging them according to each bill’s denomination.    

           It’s tedious and time-consuming labor, but Ricky seems to be 
           thrilling in the task. 
                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        I had never seen so much money in 
                        my life, and it was a rush just to 
                        be in the same room with it. By the 
                        end of the night, my fingertips 
                        were raw.

           Over the course of hours, the mountain of cash is reduced to 
           neat stacks covering the entire table, like paper bricks.

           Johnny enters with a Ribao currency counter and a large bag 
           of rubber bands and sets them on the table. 

                                 JOHNNY CURRY
                        You ever used one of these things?

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        No. 

                                 JOHNNY CURRY
                        The key is to only grab about this 
                        much at a time. 

           He lifts a stack of fives from a pile, about two inches 
           worth.

                                 JOHNNY CURRY (CONT’D)
                        Otherwise you’ll jam the machine. 

           He feeds the bills into the receiving tray and the machine 
           rifles the money through.   

                                 JOHNNY CURRY (CONT’D)
                        Once the digital display says one 
                        hundred, grab a rubber band and 
                        bundle that shit up. I want 
                        everything: the fives, the tens, 
                        and the twenties banded in stacks 
                        of a hundred. Got it?

           Ricky nods. Johnny motions to the discrete stacks of one 
           dollar bills set off to the side. 

                                 JOHNNY CURRY (CONT’D)
                        How many singles were there?

                                 RICKY WERSHE

           Johnny nods, smiles. There’s a warmth to his expression as 
           that of a mentor to a protege.  

           Johnny takes a twenty dollar bill from one of the piles and 
           hands it to Ricky.  
                                 JOHNNY CURRY
                        Now you’re over a thousand. Not bad 
                        for a night’s work.

           EXT. THE MARATHON GARAGE - DAY

           A blue Mercedes Benz with tinted windows pulls into the lot 
           and stops beside Johnny and Ricky. Ricky holds two duffel 
           bags. 

           The driver’s side window rolls down, revealing the always 
           sexy Cathy Volsan behind the steering wheel, wearing gold-
           plated Vuarnet sunglasses and lurid red lipstick.   

           Johnny kisses her.

                                 JOHNNY CURRY
                             (to Ricky)
                        You think you can handle her?

           Ricky nods and climbs inside the car with the two duffel 
           bags. 

           INT. CATHY’S MERCEDES BENZ - SAME

           Ricky shuts the door.

                                 CATHY VOLSAN
                        Hey, sweetheart.

           She unexpectedly pecks Ricky on the cheek, leaving a puckered 
           tattoo of lipstick on his skin. 

                                 CATHY VOLSAN (CONT’D)
                        Let’s go banking. 

           As the Mercedes pulls away, Cathy slides her hand onto 
           Ricky’s thigh and walks her long red fingernails down his 
           jeans as if moving along a piano. She’s flirting with his 
           nervousness, which is evident. 

                                 CATHY VOLSAN (CONT’D)
                        Oh. I’m sorry. My hand wandered. 
                        I’m so used to Johnny sitting 
                        there. 

           A SERIES OF SHOTS -- 

           As Ricky and Cathy visit local banks, exchanging hundreds of 
           thousands of dollars in small bills for crisp hundreds. 
           -- An obsequious BANK MANAGER greets Cathy and escorts her 
           over to his desk, where Ricky, acting as valet, follows 
           behind with a duffel bag. Cathy gestures imperiously to 
           Ricky, who reaches into the duffel and stacks the manager’s 
           desk with rubber-banded fives and tens. 

           The small bills are run through a money counting machine and 
           exchanged for ten-thousand dollar stacks of hundreds.  

           Cathy hands the money to Ricky, who places the hundreds 
           inside the duffel. The bank manager hugs Cathy goodbye, and 
           the queen departs with her valet in tow. 

           The process is repeated throughout the day, across the city 
           from one bank to another, Cathy’s security detail of 
           undercover Detroit cops ensuring safe passage.

           INT. THE INTERNATIONAL HOUSE OF PANCAKES - CONTINUOUS

           Agent Turner scribbles notes, stays his pencil momentarily to 
           ask Ricky a question. 

                                 AGENT TURNER
                        What banks did you visit?

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        A bunch. 

                                 AGENT TURNER
                        First National, Citibank, CINB?

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        I don’t know. Probably. 

                                 AGENT BELL
                        We need specifics, Ricky. How much 
                        money do you think you exchanged?

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        Probably like two or three million. 
                        I wasn’t keeping track. We had to 
                        go back to the garage twice to drop 
                        off the hundreds and refill the 
                        duffel bags with the smaller bills.

                                 AGENT BELL
                        And they do this how many times a 
                        week?

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        At least a couple. 
                                 AGENT TURNER
                        You gotta do a better job with the 
                        details. You gotta be thorough if 
                        you want to be part of this team. 
                        We’re serious. You need to be 
                        serious too.

           EXT. A BANK PARKING LOT - DAY

           Ricky and Cathy step out of the glass doors and walk over to 
           her Benz. She unlocks the trunk and Ricky sets the duffel bag 
           inside. 

                                 CATHY VOLSAN
                        I need to make one more stop. 

           INT. DEPARTMENT STORE, CHANGING ROOM - LATER

           The changing room curtain slides open and Cathy is standing 
           in a hot pink thong and bra. She spins around slowly and 
           admires her backside and perky breasts in the mirror and then 
           turns to Ricky, who is standing just outside the room, rigid 
           with discomfort. 

                                 CATHY VOLSAN
                        How does it fit?

           Ricky is terrifyingly aroused at the dangerous and forbidden 
           fruit dangling before him, the way the hot pink thong and bra 
           accentuates her curves, the contrast of the provocative 
           colors against her radiant chocolate skin. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        How does it fit? What the fuck was 
                        I supposed to say? She was 
                        gorgeous, she was a Playboy 
                        centerfold, she was an image that 
                        men jerk off to for the rest of 
                        their lives. 

           He struggles to answer her.   

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        Good, I think.

                                 CATHY VOLSAN
                        You think?  
                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        No, I mean, it looks really nice on 
                        you, Cathy. Real fly.  

           Cathy giggles at his nervousness.

                                 CATHY VOLSAN
                        Feel how smooth that is.

           She takes his hand and runs his fingertips along the string 
           of her panties that hugs her waistline. 

                                 CATHY VOLSAN (CONT’D)
                        You think Johnny will like these?

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        Of course. 

           Ricky is about to cum in his teenage pants. He tries to avert 
           his eyes when she lifts his chin with her long seductive 
           fingernails, forcing him to make eye contact with her. 

                                 CATHY VOLSAN
                        Good. I just want my man to be 
                        happy, you know. 

           She is staring at him. Inches separate their lips. 

                                 CATHY VOLSAN (CONT’D)
                        You’re cute when you’re nervous.

           She moves closer to Ricky and it appears that she is going to 
           kiss him. But this is all an ego-feeding dance to Cathy, a 
           dance she’s undoubtedly been performing with men since a very 
           early age.     

           A moment before their lips meet, Cathy steps back into the 
           dressing room and whips the curtain shut, leaving Ricky 
           craning forward in the hallway, breathless with fear and 
           sexual desire. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        I was certain that hanging with 
                        Cathy would get me killed and I 
                        wanted to run away from her as fast 
                        as I could. But I couldn’t. And she 
                        knew it.

           INT. INTERNATIONAL HOUSE OF PANCAKES - CONTINUOUS

           The agents are hanging onto every salacious detail as though 
           Ricky were recounting some glorious sexual conquest.  

                                 AGENT TURNER
                        You dirty dog. You fucked her 
                        didn’t you? You went in the 
                        dressing room and bent her black 
                        ass over.  

           But Ricky does not share their enthusiasm. He’s pale with 
           sweat and nerves, his face creased with anxiety. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        I gotta get outta here. 

                                 AGENT BELL
                        Finish your waffles.

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        I don’t want to meet in places like 
                        this anymore. Anybody could see me 
                        here. 

                                 AGENT TURNER
                        Relax, kid. 

                                 AGENT BELL
                        We wouldn’t do anything to 
                        jeopardize your safety, Ricky. 

           Agent Bell reaches into his overcoat and produces a white 
           envelope and slides it across the table.

                                 AGENT BELL (CONT’D)
                        You played really well this week.

           Ricky takes the envelope and climbs out of the booth, his 
           eyes casting about for danger, and leaves the restaurant.

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        Yeah, it was all a big fucking game 
                        to them. 

           INT. THE WERSHE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Ricky opens the door to his room and walks over to his bed. 
           He kneels down and reaches underneath for his shoe box --

                                 RICK SR. (O.S.)
                        You’re a welcher, Ricky.   
           Ricky spins around and finds his dad standing in the far 
           corner, holding his shoe box of money.

                                 RICK SR. (CONT’D)
                        A fucking welcher. I didn’t raise a 
                        welcher, but you sure figured out 
                        how to become one. You must’ve 
                        gotten it from your mother.   

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        Gimme that. 

                                 RICK SR.
                        I tried to teach you right. To 
                        teach you how to be a good business 
                        partner. Real life lessons. But 
                        what do you do? You go behind my 
                        back and make side deals. Well, I 
                        won’t tolerate that, not in my 
                        house. I won’t be a rug, Ricky. I 
                        won’t get fucking stepped on.

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        Give it back. 

                                 RICK SR.
                        Give it back? Give it back? I’ll 
                        shove it down your fucking throat.

           In a violent lunge forward, Rick Sr. smashes Ricky in the 
           face with the shoe box. The top flies off and cash explodes 
           out like feathers from a pillow. 

           The blow knocks Ricky back onto the floor. His father pounces 
           and straddles him, scooping up handfuls of cash and stuffing 
           them into Ricky’s mouth. 

                                 RICK SR. (CONT’D)
                        You want it so bad -- then fucking 
                        eat it. Eat it you fucking brat. 

           But Ricky manages to squirm out from under his enraged 
           father, gain his feet, and draw his .25 automatic from his 
           waistband. 

           His chest heaving, lip bloodied and quivering, Ricky levels 
           his pistol on his father.

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        Get out.

                                 RICK SR.
                        You wanna be a big shot? You wanna 
                        shoot me? Do it you fucking punk. 
                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        Get out of my room. 

                                 RICK SR.
                        Shoot me. Go on. Show me how tough 
                        you are. Show all your new drug 
                        dealer friends how bad you are. 
                        Show the FBI you got what it takes 
                        to be a rat.  

           But Ricky, tears welling in his eyes, can’t shoot his father, 
           and both of them know it. 

                                 RICK SR. (CONT’D)
                        This is my house. This is my room. 
                        And this is my fucking money. 

           With his pistol still trained on his father, Ricky slowly 
           backs out of his room and leaves the house.  

           EXT. A GAS STATION - NIGHT

           Ricky stands next to a phone booth, watching each car that 
           pulls into the station as if expecting someone. Not far off, 
           a sedan idles in a parking slot, puffing exhaust into the 
           frozen night.  

           Headlights flash into his eyes as a beat up Chrysler pulls 
           into the station and parks beside him.

           Dawn steps out of the driver’s side and walks over to her 
           brother. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        Where you been at?

                                 DAWN
                        I’m here ain’t I?

           Now up close and in the light, Dawn looks tired and strung 
           out, the haggard and drawn features of an addict. She reaches 
           her hand up to Ricky’s swollen face and touches his bloodied 
           lip. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        You don’t look good.

                                 DAWN
                        Neither do you.
                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        You gotta get off that pipe, Dawn. 
                        You gotta leave that boyfriend of 
                        yours.

                                 DAWN
                        Baby brother, it ain’t him. It’s 
                        me. 

           Each of them is on the verge of tears: the raw frustration of 
           their lives, the bleak city around them, the frigid night air 
           clashing against their skin. 

           Dawn notices the sedan idling nearby and squints as if in 
           recognition.

                                 DAWN (CONT’D)
                        Is that grandma’s car?

           Ricky nods.

                                 DAWN (CONT’D)
                        She let you borrow it?

                                 RICKY WERSHE 
                        Well, not really.

           Dawn shakes her head with resignation and doesn’t pursue the 
           matter. What’s the point?  

           A thin smile creases her wearied face and she endearingly 
           rubs Ricky’s head, mussing his hair in an attempt to cheer 
           him up. She’ll always be his older sister.

                                 DAWN
                        In another year, you’ll whoop Dad’s 
                        ass. 

           Ricky smiles, shrugs. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        I meant what I said. 
                             (off Dawn’s look)
                        You need to leave your boyfriend 
                        and get off the crack pipe. I can 
                        get you an apartment, I’m making 
                        good money right now.

           Dawn looks away, fragile, about to fall apart -- when her 
           eyes widen --  

                                 DAWN
                        Ricky -- there’s a dude getting 
                        into grandma’s car.
           By the time she makes the observation, the man is already 
           behind the wheel and ripping out of the parking lot. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        Yeah, that’s Detroit for you. You 
                        slip for one moment, you leave the 
                        keys in your car -- well, your 
                        grandmother’s car, the car you just 
                        stole from her -- and some 
                        motherfucker will steal from you, 
                        what you just stole from someone 
                        else -- every goddamn time. It’s 
                        what people in Detroit like to 
                        call: The Circle of Fuck.

           Ricky pulls out his .25 auto and lines up a shot but the guy 
           is already out of range, leaving a wake of black rubber 
           smoke.

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        Let’s go. Let’s go.

           Ricky climbs into Dawn’s passenger side and Dawn gets behind 
           the wheel. She guns the car out of the gas station and across 
           the two lane street into oncoming traffic, nearly causing a 
           head-on collision with a couple of vehicles which lock up 
           their brakes and swerve and fishtail on the icy surface. 

           Dawn is an adept driver, but more than anything, she’s got 
           serious heart, and quickly closes ground on their 
           grandmother’s stolen vehicle, weaving in and out of the cars 
           she’s passing. 

           Pistol in hand, Ricky leans out the passenger side window, 
           trying to get an angle. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE (CONT’D)
                        Pull alongside him Dawn.

                                 DAWN
                        I got it pinned -- this is as fast 
                        as she’ll go.

           Ricky fires at their grandmother’s car -- BLAM -- BLAM. The 
           driver swerves in an attempt to elude the gunfire. 

           Ricky fires again, yells. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        Pull over motherfucker!

           He fires another volley, blowing out the back windshield, 
           yells in frustration. 
                                 RICKY WERSHE (CONT’D)
                        Can’t this piece of shit go any 
                        faster?

                                 DAWN
                        Fuck you.

           Ricky aims to fire once more -- when behind them the SWIRLING 
           BLUE AND RED LIGHTS of law enforcement flash along with a 
           wailing siren.  

           EXT. WAYNE COUNTY JAIL - NIGHT

           Officer Jackson opens the door to the parking lot, allowing 
           Ricky to exit first. They walk across.  

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        What about my sister?

                                 OFFICER JACKSON
                        Already took care of her. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        What are they charging me with?

                                 OFFICER JACKSON
                        Other than being a total fuckin’ 
                        dumbass? 
                             (then)
                        Here’s how it’s gonna go down. 
                        You’re gonna show up to court on 
                        the date they assign you, but the 
                        arresting officer ain’t gonna be 
                        there, and the charges will be 
                        dropped. Understand?

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        And it was that simple. The lesson 
                        was clear: when you work for the 
                        government, you can shoot at 
                        whoever the hell you want and get 
                        away with it. 

           Jackson arrives at his unmarked sedan. He reaches into his 
           pocket for the keys and unlocks the passenger door. 

                                 OFFICER JACKSON
                        Next time you wanna shoot someone, 
                        take ‘em down a dark fuckin’ alley, 
                        or wear a fuckin’ ski mask. But 
                        don’t go shooting at people in the 
                        middle of the fuckin’ freeway. 
                        That’s just fuckin’ stupid.
           Jackson opens the door for Ricky and pushes him inside. 

           INT. MARATHON GARAGE - DAY

           Ricky enters the garage where he is welcomed like a hero for 
           his high-speed shoot-out and subsequent arrest. Word gets 
           around fast on the street. 

                                 BOO
                        Thatta boy. Shit, White Boy got 
                        heart. He ain’t gonna let nobody 
                        steal granny’s ride.   

           This provokes laughter from the crew. Boo hugs Ricky, pushes 
           him in a brotherly manner. Other members of the crew 
           congratulate Ricky with high-fives and hugs. 

                                 BOO (CONT’D)
                        Don’t worry, Ricky, we’ll find the 
                        dude. Probably some cracked-out 
                        smoker. He’s gonna show up at one 
                        of the houses and try and trade 
                        granny’s ride for a dime rock, only 
                        instead of a dime rock --
                             (pulls gun from waistband)
                        -- he’s gonna get a cap in his ass.   

           Johnny shakes Ricky’s hand. 

                                 JOHNNY CURRY
                        You can’t let nobody take you for 
                        no punk. 
                             (then)
                        You were arrested last night, 
                        right?

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        Yeah.

                                 JOHNNY CURRY
                        Late night, huh?

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        Like three in the morning.

                                 JOHNNY CURRY
                        You bailed out quick.

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        I guess so.

                                 JOHNNY CURRY
                        How much was your bond? 
           On the surface the string of questions seem innocuous, but 
           there’s a subtle, calculated shrewdness to them that could 
           only come from a hard-bitten gangster. The last question 
           pauses Ricky, and he responds haltingly.

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        Uh, I think it was like fifty 
                        thousand. 

                                 JOHNNY CURRY
                        Fifty thousand?

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        Yeah, definitely. Fifty thousand.

           Johnny nods in a casual manner, looks around the garage, as 
           if not paying too much attention. He throws out the next 
           question in an offhand manner as well. 

                                 JOHNNY CURRY
                        Your dad bail you out?

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        Yeah, it was my dad. My dad paid 
                        for the bond.

                                 JOHNNY CURRY
                        Five grand? 

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        Five grand, what?

           Boo leans into the conversation.

                                 BOO
                        What the fuck, Johnny? You his 
                        fuckin’ P.O. or something? You want 
                        a beer Ricky?

           Ricky nods. Johnny halts his subtle questioning for another 
           time. But there has been a vague uneasiness about the 
           conversation, a threat of suspicion lingering in the air, 
           barely perceptible, but there. 

                                 JOHNNY CURRY
                        My dad bailed me out the first time 
                        I was arrested too. The moment the 
                        street thinks you’re a punk, the 
                        game’s over.  

           Johnny takes Ricky under his arm and leads him toward the 
           back of the garage. 
           EXT. AN ABANDONED CHURCH - NIGHT

           In a dark corner of the parking lot, Ricky meets with Agent 
           Bell and Agent Turner. Officer Jackson smokes a cigarette on 
           the back steps of the boarded-up church. The place is 
           abandoned and isolated. It’s a safe place to talk.

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        I can’t do this anymore. It doesn’t 
                        feel right.

                                 AGENT BELL
                        We get it, Ricky. It’s totally 
                        natural to have second thoughts 
                        about what you’re doing for the 
                        government. It happens to everyone 
                        who works undercover. You see the 
                        other side, they treat you well, 
                        make you feel like family, give you 
                        some money, get your dick wet -- 
                        and then you start doubting the 
                        mission. You start doubting the 
                        war. But it’s all an illusion, 
                        Ricky. These are bad people. The 
                        Curry Brothers are not your 
                        friends. They’re ruthless killers 
                        who pollute the community with 
                        their drugs. This isn’t a movie. 
                        This is real life.    

           Ricky fidgets, pulls a pack of cigarettes from his jacket, 
           and lights one. He is visibly nervous.

                                 AGENT BELL (CONT’D)
                        You’ll look back on this moment one 
                        day and realize that you were doing 
                        the right thing. We’re the good 
                        guys, and you’re one of us, 
                        remember that. We saw your 
                        potential the day we met you, and 
                        you’ve proven to be an invaluable 
                        asset. You haven’t let us down one 
                        moment. 

           Ricky takes a drag on his cigarette and then exhales a jet of 
           smoke into the cold night, a prolonged, stressful exhale.   

                                 AGENT BELL (CONT’D)
                        Look, you’re young, Ricky. We don’t 
                        need to rush things. We’ll slow the 
                        operation down a bit here in 
                        Detroit. But before we do, we need 
                        you to go out to Vegas for a few 
                        days. 
                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        Vegas?

                                 AGENT BELL
                        Yes. We’re sending you to the 
                        Thomas Hearns fight.

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        Tommy Hearns was the “Motor City 
                        Cobra,” “The Hit Man”. Raised on 
                        the streets of the East Side, he 
                        was a hometown hero, and wherever 
                        Tommy fought, the Detroit 
                        underworld followed.

                                                                CUT TO:

           TOMMY HEARNS -- rockin’ a jerry curl, delivers a series of 
           knockouts to various opponents. His race-horse cut muscles 
           glisten as he devastates his rivals with a ferocious and 
           balletic grace.

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        It was said, that when Tommy was 
                        fighting, it was the only time you 
                        couldn’t buy crack in Detroit, 
                        because everyone that sold it, was 
                        watching Tommy. 

           THE CROWD -- Detroit kingpins take up the first three rows 
           where they shout and cheer behind sunglasses, gold chains and 
           Rolex watches and double-breasted Armani suits.

                                                           CUT BACK TO:

           EXT. THE CHURCH PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

                                 AGENT TURNER
                        It’ll be a goddamn drug convention. 
                        All the major traffickers from 
                        Detroit, and many others from 
                        around the country will be there. 
                        You’ll be privileged to information 
                        that we otherwise wouldn’t have 
                        access to here.  

           Agent Bell leans into the sedan and retrieves a manila 
           envelope and starts removing the contents. 

                                 AGENT BELL
                        This is your Driver’s License. You 
                        are now 21 years old. Remember the 
                        birth date. Someone might ask you. 
                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        Nobody is gonna believe I’m 21.

                                 AGENT TURNER
                        If you believe it, they’ll believe 
                        it. Besides, they have to. It’s 
                        real. It’s legal.  

           Agent Bell hands Ricky the license. Then reaches inside the 
           envelope and retrieves another item.   

                                 AGENT BELL
                        This is a round trip ticket on 
                        United Airlines. You ever been on 
                        an plane?

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        No. 

                                 AGENT TURNER
                        You’re a lucky kid, Ricky. We treat 
                        you good here, don’t we? 

           Jackson chimes in from the shadows.

                                 OFFICER JACKSON
                        Yeah, you a lucky white boy. They 
                        should be sending my black ass 
                        instead.

           Agent Bell reaches back inside the envelope and produces a 
           smaller white envelope.

                                 AGENT BELL
                        And this is fifteen hundred dollars 
                        for meals and other incidental 
                        expenses. 

                                 AGENT TURNER
                        Now remember, Ricky, you’re not 
                        there to have fun. We need you to 
                        gather intelligence -- so pay 
                        attention. Vegas is a wild place, 
                        and we need you to be mature about 
                        it. In other words, don’t get 
                        carried away.  

                                 OFFICER JACKSON
                        If you make it to the Crazy Horse, 
                        tell my cousin Charmina that I sent 
                        you. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        What’s the Crazy Horse?
                                 AGENT TURNER
                        A place you’re only allowed to go 
                        to if the Curry’s go there. 
                        Understand? 

                                 OFFICER JACKSON
                        He’s 21 now. He can go wherever the 
                        hell he pleases.   

           Agent Bell throws Jackson a look. Then:

                                 AGENT BELL
                        Have a good time in Vegas, but 
                        remember: You’re working. If the 
                        Curry’s go to the Crazy Horse, then 
                        you follow. If not, stay the fuck 
                        out of there.
                             (turning to go, then)
                        And leave your fucking gun at home.

           EXT. LAS VEGAS, NEVADA - NIGHT

           The perfect place for a 15 year-old with a thousand dollars 
           in his pocket and a government issued fake ID. 

           The strip of the 1980s dazzles in all its bygone glory: The 
           Stardust, The El Rancho, The Flamingo, The Gold Nugget, 
           Caesar’s Palace -- the aura of the mob still present here.    

           We find Ricky strutting down Las Vegas Boulevard with the 
           Curry Brothers and crew, twenty deep, taking up the entire 
           sidewalk, draped in mink coats, thick gold ropes, Kangol 
           bucket hats, sunglasses and diamond rings, ivory-handled 
           canes, puffing cigars and proud of their kingpin status.  

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        Detroit went to Vegas to win, to 
                        represent Tommy Hearns, to 
                        represent the Motor City. But like 
                        everything else in Detroit, hard-
                        luck was all we found. 

           The famous final seconds of Round 3: Tommy Hearns, dazed, 
           eyes crossed, legs wobbling, probably unconscious already, 
           staggers backward with an inexplicable mindless smile as -- 
           Marvelous Marvin Hagler runs across the ring and finishes him 
           off with a crushing right hand. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        Tommy Hearns was nearly decapitated 
                        in the third round. A round that he 
                        never fully recovered from. 
           Ricky throws dice at the craps table. Snake eyes. The 
           croupier rakes in his chips. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        I lost the thousand dollars the FBI 
                        gave me at the craps table in ten 
                        minutes -- 

           INSIDE THE CRAZY HORSE -- Charmina, a full-bodied, luscious 
           woman of the night, escorts Ricky into a private room. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE V.O.
                        -- and a thousand more of my own 
                        money when we all went to the Crazy 
                        Horse and I introduced myself to 
                        Jackson’s niece Charmina. Needless 
                        to say, I didn’t receive no fuckin’ 
                        family discount. That stripper got 
                        me drunk and straight stole my 
                        money. But what proved the greatest 
                        loss of them all, and one that 
                        would eventually lead to the Curry 
                        Brother’s downfall, was a simple 
                        task that someone fucked up on. 

           INT. CAESAR’S PALACE - NIGHT

           CAMERA SPEEDS through the bustling lobby and over to the 
           front desk where Johnny and Leo Curry are having an argument 
           with the CONCIERGE. Ricky and the entire crew stand behind 
           them, milling about as they wait on the bosses.  

                                 JOHNNY CURRY
                        Can you please check again?

                                 CONCIERGE
                        I’m sorry, but there are no rooms 
                        under either Johnny or Leo Curry.

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        You see, the Curry Brothers had 
                        tasked one of their lieutenants, a 
                        dude named Leon Lucas, to make the 
                        hotel and ticket arrangements for 
                        the fight... 

           INT. A CRACK HOUSE, DETROIT - NIGHT

           LEON LUCAS takes a hit from a crack pipe. His eyes flutter in 
           euphoria and he leans back on the couch.
                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        ...And Leon, for whatever reason, 
                        had assured the Curry Brothers 
                        prior to jumping on the plane that 
                        everything was squared away and 
                        ready to go out in Vegas. 

           Leon, amid the swirling crack smoke, speaks into a phone.

                                 LEON LUCAS
                        You’re all set, Johnny. You’re fly 
                        like Super Fly, my brutha.  

           BACK TO CAESAR’S PALACE

           Johnny has opened a small suitcase and is removing tens of 
           thousands of dollars and stacking the money on the counter in 
           front of the concierge for the entire lobby to witness. 

                                 JOHNNY CURRY
                        How about the whole floor? We’ll 
                        buy out the whole fuckin’ floor 
                        then. 

                                 CONCIERGE
                        I’m sorry, but we’ve been sold out 
                        for two months. There’s nothing I 
                        can do.

                                 LEO CURRY
                        No. No. No. You don’t understand 
                        what my brother’s saying. Call up 
                        them peoples and tell them we’ll 
                        buy them out, two, three, four 
                        times what they paid. We don’t give 
                        a fuck. 

                                 CONCIERGE
                        I’m sorry, sir, but we don’t engage 
                        in that kind of brokering here at 
                        Caesar’s Palace. 

           EXT. CAESAR’S PALACE - LATER

           The entire crew stands around like a pack of orphans with no 
           place to go. Johnny Curry is on a pay phone, screaming into 
           it.  
                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        The Curry Brothers were humiliated. 
                        They had been disrespected in front 
                        of their crew, in front of every 
                        baller that had showed up in Vegas, 
                        the whole world as far as they were 
                        concerned.   

           EXT. DETROIT, LEON LUCAS’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           A van creeps along the street. The door slides open and THREE 
           GUNMAN spray the house with assault rifles.  

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        Two weeks later, Leon Lucas’s house 
                        was shot up. Problem was: Leon 
                        wasn’t home. But his thirteen year-
                        old cousin was. 

           LATER - The house is now swarming with Detroit cops, news 
           crews, the coroner’s office.  

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        The death of young Damian Lucas 
                        made national headlines and brought 
                        the heat down on the Curry Brothers 
                        like never before. It’s one thing 
                        when drug dealers kill other drug 
                        dealers. No one really gives a 
                        fuck. But when innocent children 
                        start dying, even the white people 
                        in the suburbs start caring. And 
                        once they start caring, your days 
                        as an outlaw are numbered. Even the 
                        corrupt cops become Boy Scouts.  

           INT. THE MARATHON GARAGE - NIGHT

           A meeting is underway in the back room as Johnny and Leo 
           stand in front of Ricky and about a dozen members of the 
           crew.

                                 JOHNNY CURRY
                        Look, we had nothing to do with 
                        that kid getting killed, no matter 
                        what the news is saying.

                        It’s all a bunch of bullshit. 

                                 JOHNNY CURRY
                        We know the cops are offering to 
                        pay for information on the case.

                                 JOHNNY CURRY (CONT'D)
                        Those muthafuckus been trying to 
                        find a way to take us down for over 
                        a decade now, and they think this 
                        bullshit is the best way -- 
                        branding us as child killers. But 
                        we’ll pay more to keep mouths shut. 
                        Whatever the cops are offering, 
                        we’ll pay double. You let people 
                        know that.

           EXT. THE EAST SIDE, CRACK HOUSE - NIGHT

           Ricky exits a car with a duffel bag in hand and up the cement 
           walkway toward the front door.

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        Two guys that no one had ever seen 
                        sweat, were now sweating, and they 
                        became paranoid. And in the drug 
                        game, when organizations become 
                        paranoid, everyone becomes a 
                        suspect, and the guns start 
                        blazing. 

           Ricky climbs the front steps and knocks on the door. When no 
           one answers he tries the doorknob, which is unlocked, and he 
           slowly pushes open the door -- when a BLINDING FLASH and 
           THUNDEROUS BELLOW from a gunshot swallows the night and Ricky 
           is blown backward off the porch with a gaping hole in his 
           stomach. 

           INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT

           Rick Sr. and Dawn rush through the front door and into the 
           the emergency room toward the receptionist --

           INT. HOSPITAL - MOMENTS LATER

           The hallway doors swing open as Rick Sr. and Dawn sprint down 
           the linoleum floor toward --

           Agent Turner and Agent Bell who are standing outside of 
           Ricky’s room. 

                                 AGENT BELL
                        You can’t go in there, Rick. 

                                 RICK SR.
                        What the fuck you mean I can’t go 
                        in there. He’s my goddamn son. Get 
                        the fuck out of my way.
           Rick Sr. looks in through the door window and sees several 
           doctors and nurses huddled over his son. This image sets him 
           off and he lunges straight for Turner and grabs him by the 
           lapels and slams him against the wall. 

                                 RICK SR. (CONT’D)
                        You motherfuckers. This is all your 
                        fault. 

           Agent Bell grabs Rick Sr. and tries to pry him off Agent 
           Turner when Dawn jumps into the fray and slaps Agent Bell in 
           the face and then jumps on his shoulders and starts biting 
           the back of his neck. 

           Rick Sr. then turns on Agent Bell and the four of them fall 
           to the tile floor in a tangle of accusations, slaps, kicks, 
           and curses, maybe some pulled hair. 

           Orderlies and nurses rush out of doors and stream into the 
           hallway and pull the parties off each other. 

                                 RICK SR. (CONT’D)
                        Get your fucking hands off me. Get 
                        your hands off. 

           Agent Bell removes his badge and brandishes it to the 
           hospital staff. 

                                 AGENT BELL
                        FBI... Appreciate the assistance, 
                        but we got it all covered.

           The staff looks on with bewilderment -- they’ve seen a lot in 
           their duties but never anything quite like this and they 
           slowly go back to their tasks.

           Rick Sr. and Dawn are frothing, ready to jump back into a 
           tangle with the Agents. 

                                 RICK SR.
                        I want to see my son. Get out of 
                        the way. 

           A doctor finally emerges from Ricky’s room. 

                                 DOCTOR
                        You can’t go in there right now. 
                        Please keep it down. We’ll give you 
                        an update shortly.

           The doctor steps back inside.

                                 RICK SR.
                        You’re prostituting my son.
                                 AGENT TURNER
                        You pimped him out.

           Rick Sr. jumps across the hallway for Agent Turner when Agent 
           Bell intercepts the attack and subdues Rick Sr. in a 
           wrestling hold.  

                                 AGENT TURNER (CONT’D)
                        I can send you to prison for 
                        striking a Federal Agent.

                                 RICK SR.
                        I can send you to prison for 
                        playing with a child’s life.

                                 AGENT TURNER
                        Your son is a central informant in 
                        an ongoing criminal investigation. 
                        He is crucial to its successful 
                        outcome. 

                                 RICK SR.
                        I don’t give a shit what he is to 
                        you. He’s my son. And we’re 
                        through. We’re through working with 
                        you -- you fucking maggots. 

           Agent Bell takes a deep breath and composes himself. The 
           momentary pause has a slightly calming effect on the 
           situation. He adjusts his posture to one of accommodation and 
           takes Rick Sr. aside. They move down the corridor. 

                                 AGENT BELL
                        We live in a great country, Rick. 

                                 RICK SR.
                        You got that right -- greatest 
                        goddamn country in the world. 

                                 AGENT BELL
                        Do you realize how important you 
                        and your son are right now to the 
                        security of this nation?  

           As their conversation trails off down the corridor with 
           patriotic platitudes -- CAMERA pushes through the window and 
           into Ricky’s room and over to his bed and the doctors and 
           nurses administering to him. He’s unconscious, tubes in his 
           mouth, his intestines, all the machinery associated with a 
           near-fatal injury. 
           EXT. THE WERSHE’S HOUSE - DAY

           Ricky sits in a wheelchair as his father pushes him up the 
           front walk. A colostomy bag rests in Ricky’s lap.

                                 RICK SR.
                        You’re not a quitter, Ricky. And 
                        that’s why you’re still alive. 
                        Because you don’t give up. You 
                        never have. 

           Rick Sr. pauses to remove his keys. He unlocks the door and 
           wheels Ricky inside. 

           Rick Sr. is speaking with an ingratiating, overly 
           accommodating tone, as if not only attempting to regain the 
           favor of his son, but also persuade him to a certain course 
           of action.   

                                 RICK SR. (CONT’D)
                        I know it sounds crazy, but the 
                        fact that you got shot was actually 
                        a really good thing. You’ll have 
                        more credibility now on the street. 
                        They’ll trust you even more when 
                        you go back. I think when this is 
                        all over we’ll be heroes. You’ll be 
                        a hero. We’ll also be, and this is 
                        important too -- a little better 
                        off financially.
                             (then)
                        The FBI promised us a big bonus.  

           He wheels Ricky into the living room and sets him up beside 
           the couch. Rick Sr. takes the remote control and turns on the 
           television. 

                                 RICK SR. (CONT’D)
                        What do you want to watch?

           He hands Ricky the controller.

                                 RICK SR. (CONT’D)
                        Here, I’ll let you decide. 

           Rick Sr. freezes with mock surprise.

                                 RICK SR. (CONT’D)
                        I almost forgot. I got something 
                        for you.

           Rick Sr. disappears into the other room and reappears with 
           Ricky’s shoe box. 
                                 RICK SR. (CONT’D)
                        You were right. This is your money. 
                        You earned it kiddo.

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        I had been shot in the stomach with 
                        a .357 magnum, and not many people 
                        live from that. Other than shitting 
                        in a bag for a couple months, I was 
                        back on my feet in a matter of 
                        days.  

           INT. JOHNNY CURRY’S HOUSE - DAY

           Johnny slings his arm around Ricky, who still has a colostomy 
           bag protruding from his side.  

                                 JOHNNY CURRY
                        It was an accident. A horrible 
                        accident. Peeps thought you was 
                        someone trying to rob the house.

           Johnny looks to PEEPS, one of his lieutenants, who is playing 
           dominoes with several young men.   

                                 PEEPS
                        Sorry, man. Thought you was a 
                        jacker. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        Whether it was an accident or not, 
                        the fact that I got shot by someone 
                        within the crew and came back to 
                        work for them gained me a whole new 
                        level of trust and respect within 
                        the organization. If they had 
                        suspected me of being an informant, 
                        they no longer did. It also, in a 
                        strange way, made me a whole lot 
                        cockier. I now felt invincible. 

           Cathy, never shy about her affection for Ricky, slides over 
           and places both hands on his shoulders. Maybe it’s Ricky’s 
           age, maybe it’s because he’s white, but Johnny does not pay 
           any attention to her flirtations with the teenager.

                                 CATHY VOLSAN
                        We were so worried about you, 
                        sweetheart. 

           She kisses Ricky on the cheek and moves off. Johnny goes back 
           to business. 
                                 JOHNNY CURRY
                        You good to drive with that bag in 
                        your side?

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        It’s nothing.

                                 JOHNNY CURRY
                        Good. I need you to make a run for 
                        me up to Harper Woods to a very 
                        important person’s house.  

           EXT. A LARGE ESTATE - NIGHT

           A woodsy suburb. An electronic iron gate slides open and 
           Ricky pulls down a sweeping tree-lined driveway toward a 
           stately mansion bordered with manicured lawns and marble 
           statuary. 

           Ricky exits the car and rings the doorbell.

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        Art Derrick was pumping. He single-
                        handedly supplied the entire city 
                        of Detroit with cocaine. He was 
                        also out of his fucking mind.

           ART DERRICK, an eccentric and slovenly middle-aged white dude 
           in a bathrobe, opens the front door. 

                                 ART DERRICK
                        Holy shit. You’re white.

           Ricky shrugs at the obvious.

                                 ART DERRICK (CONT’D)
                        They said they were sending up a 
                        white boy, but I just figured they 
                        meant some light-skinned brother. 
                        But you son --
                             (he taps Ricky’s chest)
                        -- are white.

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        Like the snow.

           Art loves the poetic simile -- 

                                 ART DERRICK
                        Like the fucking snow! 

           Art reaches into his left pocket and fishes inside it.
                                 ART DERRICK (CONT’D)
                        Why are you carrying around a 
                        shitbag -- you a fucking cancer 
                        patient or something?

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        I got shot.

                                 ART DERRICK
                        That’ll do it. You live on the East 
                        Side?

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        Born and raised.

           Finding nothing in his left pocket, Art reaches into his 
           right pocket.

                                 ART DERRICK
                        The East Side is a scary fucking 
                        movie. It’s not even real anymore. 
                        I don’t even like driving through 
                        there in the day time. I’m waiting 
                        for some fucking zombie cannibal to 
                        rip me out of my car and start 
                        chewing my fucking arm off. Know 
                        what I mean? I don’t even stop at 
                        the red lights no more --- no sir, 
                        chirp chirp -- I just keep motoring 
                        right through like Mario fucking 
                        Andretti. Do you guys even have any 
                        food left over there? What about 
                        fresh water?

           Art finally removes a MASTER LOCK KEY from his pocket. 

                                 ART DERRICK (CONT’D)
                        A key for the keys. 
                             (hands it to Ricky)
                        Don’t lose it. 

           And just like that he smiles and shuts the massive door. Then 
           he yells from inside --

                                 ART DERRICK (CONT’D)
                        Come back and see me anytime -- you 
                        fucking zombie cannibal.

           A great bellowing laugh reverberates and fades down the 
           hallway inside. 
           EXT. A STORAGE UNIT - NIGHT

           TIGHT ON THE KEY as it slides into a Master Lock and the 
           shackle pops open.  

           Ricky removes the lock from the staple as Boo pulls open the 
           roll-up aluminum door. 

           The two of them enter the storage unit and approach a pallet 
           loaded with 100 kilograms of cocaine. 

           Ricky and Boo stuff the kilos into sea bags.

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        About a month later, the hammer 
                        dropped. 

           EXT. A CRACK HOUSE - DAY

           A battering ram busts down the front door.

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        Earlier in the year the FBI had 
                        managed to break into Johnny 
                        Curry’s house and tap his phone.

           Federal Agents crash into the house and slam Boo to the 
           kitchen floor as he cooks up a batch of crack on the stove. 
           Two Agents tackle Peeps and slam his face into a mountain of 
           cocaine on a coffee table. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        And after that, there was nothing 
                        that the Mayor or his cronies in 
                        the Detroit Police Department could 
                        do to protect the Curry Brothers 
                        from the Federal Government.  

           INT. THE MARATHON GARAGE - DAY

           Agents storm the garage. Leo Curry and several of his 
           lieutenants are caught by surprise and raise their hands in 
           surrender.

           Leo and his men are loaded into a paddy wagon.

           INT. JOHNNY CURRY’S HOUSE - DAY 

           Camera rushes through the house and up the staircase and into 
           the bedroom where Johnny throws off white satin sheets and 
           jumps out of bed in his boxers as ---
           Cathy Volsan leaps out of bed fully naked and runs over to a 
           robe on the chair as Federal Agents swarm into their master 
           bedroom with guns drawn.  

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        And just like that, Johnny, Leo, 
                        and Boo, and eighteen other members 
                        of the Curry organization were 
                        rounded up and thrown in jail. 
                        Their decade-long reign as East 
                        Side kingpins was over... And mine 
                        was just beginning. 

           EXT. CHURCH PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           In the dark corner, Ricky and Rick Sr. meet with Agent Bell 
           and Agent Turner. Officer Jackson smokes a cigarette from his 
           customary perch on the back steps.

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        I’m done. You guys got what you 
                        wanted.

                                 RICK SR.
                        Hold on, son. 
                             (to agents)
                        Fellas, he’s just a little hot 
                        right now. 

                                 AGENT BELL
                        Understandably. 

                                 RICK SR.
                        That’s right. Understandably.

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        I’m through. I ain’t doing this 
                        anymore. 

                                 AGENT TURNER
                        Ricky, you don’t make the rules. We 
                        make the rules. You don’t tell us 
                        when you’re through. We tell you 
                        when you’re through.

                                 RICK SR.
                        That’s right, Ricky. They’re our 
                        bosses. And they’ve taken pretty 
                        good care of us so far. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        They nearly got me fucking killed.  
                                 RICK SR.
                        Don’t fucking swear at me. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        They fucking used us.  

                                 RICK SR.
                        Don’t fucking swear at me 
                        goddamnit.

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        Dad, nobody is gonna invite you to 
                        the White House. We’re not heroes. 
                        These guys don’t care about us. 
                        They never have. 

                                 AGENT TURNER
                        Right now, you guys are protected. 
                        Nobody knows about your 
                        involvement. Nobody knows that you 
                        guys were acting as informants. But 
                        that secrecy, that protection, 
                        comes from us. It’s called 
                        cooperation. It would be a horrible 
                        thing if we were forced to list you 
                        as a witness for the government in 
                        the Curry Brother’s trial.  

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        You can’t do that. 

                                 RICK SR.
                        Yes, son, they can. They can do 
                        whatever they want. They’re the 
                        government. Let’s just settle down 
                        everyone.

           Rick Sr. takes Ricky by the arm and leads him a few steps 
           away. 

                                 RICK SR. (CONT’D)
                        This well ain’t dry, Ricky. It’s 
                        far from dry. Relax. What are we 
                        going to do if they expose us? We 
                        need their protection. And we also 
                        need their money. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        I don’t need their money.

                                 RICK SR.
                        Well I do. I’m unemployed right 
                        now.
                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        You do what you want. I’m through. 

           Ricky turns and starts walking across the parking lot.

                                 AGENT TURNER
                        You can’t just walk away, Ricky. It 
                        doesn’t work like that.

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                             (over his shoulder)
                        Fuck you.

           Ricky glances over at Jackson, who is smoking in the shadows 
           of the church and staring at him with a dark and brooding 
           intensity. There’s a heavy threat in his voice when he says -- 

                                 OFFICER JACKSON
                        See you around White Boy.

           Ricky does not reply as he leaves the parking lot and turns 
           onto the sidewalk and into the night. 

                                 RICK SR.
                             (to agents)
                        I’ll talk to him, fellas. I’ll get 
                        everything back on track. We’ve got 
                        a lot more work to do together, let 
                        me tell you. There’s still a lot of 
                        cleaning up that needs to be done 
                        around here.

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        I was tired of being a pawn. I 
                        wanted to be a king. 

           EXT. ART DERRICK’S MANSION - DAY

           Under the flame of the midday sun, the gold-plated initials 
           AD shimmer with near-blinding intensity at the bottom of the 
           swimming pool. Art is giving Ricky a tour of his estate.

                                 ART DERRICK
                        You see that, Ricky? AD. Those are 
                        my initials. Women love it. They 
                        love that shit. They come swimming 
                        over here and they see my initials 
                        engraved in gold at the bottom of 
                        my pool, and they say to 
                        themselves, he’s creative. He’s got 
                        imagination. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ART DERRICK (CONT'D)
                        And all women, Ricky, whether they 
                        be skinny or fat, big tittied or 
                        little tittied, black assed or 
                        white assed, proud, loud, cock-
                        swallowing biker chicks or naughty 
                        housewives with buttermilk skin, 
                        want to be fucked by a man with 
                        imagination.     

           The tour moves on... 

           INT. ART DERRICK’S MANSION - MOMENTS LATER

           A gold disco ball spins from the ceiling of Art’s dance club 
           that he’s constructed in his basement. A full bar, lounge 
           area, mirrored ceiling and walls. 

                                 ART DERRICK
                        And this --  this tells them that 
                        I’m fun.

           He breaks into an enthusiastically cringe-worthy rendition of 
           Cyndi Lauper. 

                                 ART DERRICK (CONT’D)
                        ‘Cause girls just wanna have fuuu - 
                        un. They just wanna, they just 
                        wannnahhhahha. You know that song? 
                        When I play that down here, the 
                        panties start flying off like a 
                        flock of horny geese. You should 
                        see this place the next morning -- 
                        I’m literally peeling the panties 
                        off the ceiling --- ‘cause girls 
                        just wahhhaannaaa--hah-hah-have 
                        fuuuh-huh-huuunnnn. You probably 
                        like that rap shit, huh? You 
                        fucking Eastside cannibal.

           INT. ART DERRICK’S MANSION - MOMENTS LATER

           Upstairs now, in the ornate living room, a lavish decor of 
           Italian marble and gold trim. Art opens a humidor resting on 
           a table and hands Ricky a cigar. 

           Art produces a lighter and they start smoking. 

           Art points to a Gucci briefcase sitting on the couch. 

                                 ART DERRICK
                        You know what that is, Ricky?
                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        Of course.

                                 ART DERRICK
                        Then what is it?

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        What do you think I’m fucking 
                        retarded?

                                 ART DERRICK
                        No. I just want you to guess. I bet 
                        you can’t guess what it is. I bet 
                        you think you know what it is. But 
                        I’m like James Bond and everything 
                        isn’t always what it appears. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        I don’t know then. You got me.

                                 ART DERRICK
                        Of course you know what it is. Look 
                        at it. Come on. What is it?

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        This is stupid. 

                                 ART DERRICK
                        Sometimes, however, things are 
                        exactly what they appear to be. So 
                        is that what it appears to be -- or 
                        not what it appears to be? 

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        It’s a fucking briefcase, all 
                        right.

           Art takes the briefcase from the couch, and with both hands, 
           presents it flat-wise, as if about to render a magic trick. 

                                 ART DERRICK
                        No. It’s not a briefcase. 
                             (flips it open)
                        It’s a TWO MILLION DOLLAR 
                        BRIEFCASE.  

           The briefcase is stacked flush with two million in cash.

                        And this, my friend, tells the 
                        women that I have the final 
                        ingredient in the I-Wanna-Fuck-Him-
                        Cocktail... I’ve got imagination. 
                        I’m fun. And I’m rich.  
           He high-fives Ricky.

           EXT. ART DERRICK’S MANSION - LATER

           Art and Ricky have made their way out to the pool again where 
           they are now seated at a table under an umbrella, smoking 
           cigars and sipping cognac from crystal glasses.

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        I came out here today because I 
                        want to set up my own operation. I 
                        don’t want to deal with any 
                        middlemen. I want to buy directly 
                        from you. 
                             (motions to the estate)
                        I want this, I want what you have. 

           Art’s demeanor has changed considerably from that of the 
           flamboyant tour guide. He now assumes a more sober and 
           composed attitude. 

                                 ART DERRICK
                        There are two kinds of people in 
                        this business: those you think you 
                        can trust, and those that you don’t 
                        trust. Now, I think I can trust 
                        you. But there’s this one looming 
                        question that keeps swirling around 
                        in my head like some fucking pesky 
                        black fly in that shitty ass, 
                        neither fish nor fowl, month of 
                        May. And the question is this: The 
                        Curry Brothers and pretty much 
                        their entire organization are 
                        currently in jail awaiting trial, 
                        and will shortly, I am certain, be 
                        convicted and sent to prison for a 
                        very long time. Why, my friend, are 
                        you sitting here and not with them?

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        Why aren’t you?

           Art takes a pull on his cigar and exhales. 

                                 ART DERRICK
                        Maybe you were just smarter than 
                        everybody else.
                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        Maybe I just got lucky.

           Art nods. 

                                 ART DERRICK
                        How old are you?

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        Sixteen. 

                                 ART DERRICK
                        That’s a good age. A good age to 
                        start a career.

           Art stares across his expansive lawn and into the bordering 
           woods. 

                                 ART DERRICK (CONT’D)
                        The big money isn’t in the street 
                        hustling, hand-to-hand, nigger rich 
                        bullshit. You need to be moving 
                        weight -- major weight -- not crack 
                        rocks and eight balls, but hundreds 
                        of kilos. Planeloads full of the 
                        shit. I’m gonna get you off the 
                        street and into the air. 
                             (then)
                        You ever been to Miami?

           INT. ART DERRICK’S PRIVATE JET - DAY

           Art runs wind-sprints up and down the interior of his private 
           jet. He wears a burgundy Adidas track suit with matching 
           headband. He does not strike us as the athletic type. Ricky 
           sits in a plush leather chair as an amused spectator to the 
           peculiar exercise routine.  

                                 ART DERRICK
                        What do you think, Ricky? Sure 
                        beats the fuck out of Greyhound.  

           Art drops to the floor and starts doing push-ups with 
           considerable difficulty. He only completes a few before 
           giving up.

                                 ART DERRICK (CONT’D)
                        You know who I bought this plane 
                        from? Mick fucking Jagger. That’s 
                        right. You believe that shit? This 
                        thing used to belong to the Rolling 
                        Stones.  
           Art stands up, breathless, but smiling. He climbs atop a 
           couch.

                                 ART DERRICK (CONT’D)
                        I feel so goddamn good I might as 
                        well -- JUMP. 

           FREEZE FRAME as Art leaps from the couch and attempts a toe-
           touching David Lee Roth split-jump. But what his maneuver 
           flagrantly lacks in both grace and athleticism -- he is no 
           aerial dynamo -- Art makes up for with unabashed enthusiasm. 
           THE CAMERA PUSHES IN ON HIS HOWLING SMILE.

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        What do you expect? Do you expect 
                        him to be normal. His weekly 
                        commute was flying the White Bird 
                        Highway from Miami to Detroit with 
                        planeloads full of cocaine. He was 
                        making 30 million dollars a year -- 
                        a hundred thousand a day. And all 
                        of it illegal. Normal? There wasn’t 
                        anything normal about any of it. It 
                        was all day, every day, fucking 
                        CRAZY. 

           RESUME NORMAL SPEED as Art crashes to the floor, nearly 
           breaking an ankle or two. He braces himself on the ground 
           with both hands and starts performing mountain climbers.

                                 ART DERRICK
                        I called up Mick Jagger the other 
                        night. You know why? Because I 
                        wanted to let that fish-faced 
                        skeleton know that I’ve fucked more 
                        tail in his plane than he has. Him 
                        and his junkie-assed guitar player. 
                        Fuck ‘em both. You believe that 
                        shit! 

           He stands and high-fives Ricky. We FREEZE FRAME again.

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        I may not have been a rock star, 
                        but I sure as hell felt like one.

           EXT. MIAMI, FLORIDA - DAY

           A harbor for the armadas of the wealthy. Art and Ricky strut 
           down the dock. 
                                 ART DERRICK
                        The Colombianos are gonna love you. 
                        Most of these filthy bastards 
                        started out as lookouts in the 
                        slums of Medellin when they were 
                        still in diapers. Now they’re 
                        living the American Dream -- in 
                        fucking Miami. And do you know why 
                        they’re gonna love you, Ricky? 
                        Because they know what it takes to 
                        be successful in this business, the 
                        cojones that you gotta have. 
                        They’re gonna see themselves -- in 
                        you.

           Art and Ricky approach the end of the dock where the most 
           magnificent yacht in a harbor full of magnificent yachts 
           awaits them. 

           Art waves up to TWO COLOMBIAN MEN (LUIS and MANUELO) resting 
           their elbows on the deck railing thirty feet above.

                                 ART DERRICK (CONT’D)
                        !Quibo! Quibo! !Quibo! 
                        Motherfuckers!

           EXT. THE HARBOR - MOMENTS LATER

           The yacht cruises out of the harbor and into the turquoise 
           ocean waters. Art and Ricky sit across from Luis and Manuelo. 

                                 ART DERRICK
                        Did you bring the Cubans?

                                 MANUELO
                        Si, si. Down below. After business.

                                 ART DERRICK
                        What business Manuelo? I thought 
                        this was a fucking fishing trip.

           Art bites his knuckles and turns to Ricky, letting him in on 
           a little secret. 

                                 ART DERRICK (CONT’D)
                        I love Cuban whores. 

           Art throws his arm around Ricky.

                                 ART DERRICK (CONT’D)
                        This young man right here is going 
                        to do big things for us back in 
                        Detroit.
                                 LUIS
                        We like Detroit.

                                 ART DERRICK
                        They just don’t like to go there. 

           A round of laughter.

                                 LUIS
                        No, no, yes, si. Detroit is muy 
                        peligroso. Very dangerous. Y frio.

                                 ART DERRICK
                             (patting Ricky’s chest)
                        This kid’s a fucking cannibal.

           The word “cannibal” does not register with the Colombians. So 
           Art takes his own arm and starts chewing on the flesh.

                                 ART DERRICK (CONT’D)
                        A fucking cannibal. He eats people. 

           Now the Colombians get the gist of it and start laughing and 
           nodding.

                                 LUIS AND MANUELO
                        Bueno. Bueno.

           INT. THE YACHT - LATER

           A dispute is underway in one of the bedchambers where a naked 
           Cuban prostitute sits at the head of the bed, staring at 
           Ricky who is standing in the middle of the room, fully 
           clothed. 

           Art, a naked and hairy sweaty mess, slouches in a chair, 
           catching his breath. He’s clearly already had his turn. 

                                 CUBAN WHORE
                        I no sleep with him.

                                 ART DERRICK
                        What the fuck you mean you’re not 
                        sleeping with him?

                                 CUBAN WHORE
                        I not fucking no child. 

                                 ART DERRICK
                        He’s fucking sixteen, which makes 
                        him ten years older than you were 
                        when you first sucked-off your 
                        uncle Tito. 
                                 CUBAN WHORE
                        I bet he no have hair on his 
                        peepee.

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                             (grabbing his package)
                        Bitch, I got all the wood you need.

           She laughs with contempt. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE (CONT’D)
                        What time is it?

                                 CUBAN WHORE
                        No fuckee you.

                                 ART DERRICK
                        It’s 11:31, kid.

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                             (to prostitute)
                        You’ll be calling me daddy by high-
                        noon.

                                 ART DERRICK
                        That’s the spirit. 

           HIGH-NOON HAS ARRIVED

           SLOW-MO -- Ricky is now behind the Cuban prostitute and 
           thrusting into her like a human jackhammer. And yes, his 
           prophecy has been realized -- she’s calling him “Daddy” right 
           now.

           Behind the sexual event, Art emerges from the hallway, sneaky 
           and mischievous, waving his Colombian friends into the room -- 
           “hey take a look at this kid”. Then Art winds up and slaps 
           Ricky on the ass.

           FREEZE FRAME on Ricky at the bottom of his thrust as his face 
           contorts from the sting of Art’s slap on his bare ass -- 

                                 ART DERRICK (CONT’D)
                        He’s a fucking cannibal!

                                                                CUT TO:

           MIAMI IN IMAGES

           -- Ricky and Art race around on jet-skis with Cuban 
           prostitutes on back.
           -- Deep sea fishing. Ricky sets the hook on a massive 
           sailfish. The pole bends violently. Art cheers on his 
           protege. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        While my high school class was busy 
                        studying for their sophomore year 
                        finals, I was in Miami studying 
                        another type of education -- the 
                        education of living. 

           The guides pull the sailfish onto the deck. Ricky and Art 
           pose for a photo with the trophy catch.  

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        To a sixteen year-old from Detroit, 
                        Miami was as close to heaven as you 
                        could imagine.

           -- MEDIUM TWO SHOT of Art and Ricky watching a football game 
           which is reflected in the mirrors behind them. As CAMERA 
           TILTS down we reveal that they are both receiving fellatio 
           from their respective Cuban prostitutes, side-by-side, at the 
           same time, the ladies heads bobbing up and down in unison. 
           Art looks to Ricky and slaps him five -- 

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        Check that, it was heaven. 

           EXT. DETROIT CITY AIRPORT - DAY

           A small private airport on the outskirts of the city. Ricky 
           and Art climb down the stairs from the jet which has taxied 
           over to the hangar.

           Art moves toward his Mercedes parked on the tarmac. Ricky 
           walks abreast him.

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        What about the coke?

                                 ART DERRICK
                        The cops will take care of it. 

           Art motions to an unmarked sedan where TWO PLAIN CLOTHES COPS 
           exit and approach the jet with large duffel bags. 

           As the cops pass by -- TIME SEEMS TO STAND STILL -- as Ricky 
           squints with momentary confusion when he recognizes Officer 
           Jackson. 
           Officer Jackson grins and then puts his index finger to his 
           lips in an ironic shhhhh. He winks at Ricky and climbs the 
           stairs to the jet. 

                                 ART DERRICK (CONT’D)
                        Detroit’s finest. Who else do you 
                        want driving your coke into the 
                        city? I sure as hell ain’t. 

           Art and Ricky hop into the Mercedes. Ricky, slightly 
           unnerved, glances over his shoulder as Officer Jackson 
           disappears into the jet. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        The entire city was one big shit 
                        factory. The cops, the politicians, 
                        everyone and everything was for 
                        sale. As long as you paid, as long 
                        as your cash was green and plenty, 
                        you could do all right in Motown. 
                        The FBI, now, they were an entirely 
                        different beast. But I wasn’t 
                        worried about them at the moment.   

           INT. A FORD BRONCO - DAY

           Ricky drives down Gratiot Avenue toward the downtown skyline. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        I came back from Miami with a fire 
                        inside me, ready to take over the 
                        city. With the Curry Brothers out 
                        of the game, there was a vacuum on 
                        the East Side and I was going to 
                        move in and seize the opportunity.

           INT. DOWNTOWN HIGH RISE - NIGHT

           The building manager shows Ricky the apartment. It’s on the 
           10th floor with a view of the city. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        I needed to get everything squared 
                        away and organized. I moved out of 
                        my dad’s house and got me an 
                        apartment downtown. I wasn’t gonna 
                        be sleeping in the same 
                        neighborhood where I was selling.  

           Ricky nods. I’ll take it. He removes a wad of cash. 
                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        No paperwork.

           The manager looks at the robust bank roll in Ricky’s hand and 
           nods in agreement.

                                 BUILDING MANAGER
                        No paperwork.

           EXT. A STORAGE UNIT - NIGHT

           Ricky unlocks the storage unit and pulls up the door. He 
           climbs into his Bronco and backs it inside.   

           He walks over to a refrigerator and starts removing kilos of 
           cocaine and stacking them into a false floor in the rear 
           cargo area.

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        I was gonna be lean and mobile like 
                        the Special Forces. I wasn’t gonna 
                        run crack houses or get down and 
                        dirty in the street hustle, 
                        chopping up kilos and nickel and 
                        diming my way to the top. I was 
                        gonna move weight. I was gonna be a 
                        kingpin.   

           EXT. KENTUCKY FRIED CHICKEN - NIGHT

           Ricky stops at the drive-thru window. The KFC GIRL hands him 
           a bucket of chicken. He removes the lid and peers inside. But 
           the bucket isn’t filled with Colonel Sanders’s secret recipe, 
           it’s filled with neatly-bound bundles of cash.

           In a matter of seconds, Ricky removes the cash, stuffs two 
           kilos of cocaine inside, and hands the bucket back to the 
           girl.

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        This batch is all soggy and shit. 

                                 DRIVE-THRU GIRL
                        I’m sorry, sir. Let me get you 
                        another one.

           She hands him another bucket, this one filled with chicken. 
           He grabs a crispy drumstick, takes a bite, and drives out of 
           the parking lot.
                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        I was buying kilos from Art for 
                        twelve-thousand and flipping them 
                        for seventeen. I was making ten 
                        thousand a week from KFC...

           EXT. AMF LANES - NIGHT

           Ricky steps out of a yellow cab with two bowling ball bags 
           and enters the front door.

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        ...And another twenty-thousand at 
                        the bowling alley. Not to mention 
                        all the other weight I was moving 
                        to various crews across town.  

           He makes his way through the crowded lobby and down to Lane 7 
           where a group of YOUNG BLACK MEN are bowling. 

           He sits down at the bench seat and sets his bowling ball bags 
           underneath. He struts over to the ball rack and bowls a 
           strike. 

           He high-fives a few of the players, shoots down a cocktail 
           that was waiting for him, grabs two different bowling ball 
           bags where his bags had been, and exits through the back door 
           and into another taxi cab. Different driver. Different 
           company.  

           As the cab pulls away, Ricky unzips the ball bags where 
           stacks of cash stare back at him.

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        I even started moving into the 
                        suburbs, selling to college kids. 
                        Because I was white, I could drive 
                        up there and not get hassled by the 
                        cops. 

           EXT. SIGMA ALPHA EPSILON FRATERNITY HOUSE - NIGHT

           Wearing a backpack and letterman jacket, Ricky walks up to 
           the house and knocks on the door. TWO PREPPY FRATERNITY 
           BROTHERS let him inside and lead him up the stairs and into a 
           bedroom.

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        I was a fucking chameleon.
           Ricky takes off his backpack and unloads three kilos onto a 
           bed. The fraternity brothers’s eyes are practically popping 
           out of their heads.

                                 FRATERNITY BROTHER CRAIG
                        Jesus Christ. I’ve never seen so 
                        much coke in my life.

                                 FRATERNITY BROTHER LARRY
                        This is gonna be the best fucking 
                        party ever!!!

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        I always made sure the college kids 
                        paid double. Fuck ‘em. Their dads 
                        could afford it. 

           EXT. SIGMA ALPHA EPSILON FRATERNITY HOUSE - NIGHT

           Grinning to himself, Ricky climbs into a brand new white 
           Jeep. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        One of the problems with making a 
                        lot of money, is that it never 
                        wants to keep quiet, no matter how 
                        hard you try and silence it. Money 
                        has its own voice that always wants 
                        to express itself and be heard. It 
                        wants everybody to know that you’ve 
                        got it.     

           As he pulls away, CAMERA PUSHES IN ON -- “THE SNOWMAN” custom 
           painted across the tailgate. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        And when it speaks, it’s loud and 
                        cocky.

           And on that we cut to -- THE OPENING SHOT OF THE MOVIE --

           INT. THE PRIVATE JET - NIGHT

           -- AS THE CAMERA glides through the pools of moody lighting, 
           passing a young black man puffing a Cohiba as he receives a 
           blow-job from a prostitute, another black man fondling two 
           prostitutes on his lap, two more black men rifling money 
           through a Ribao currency counter, and further into the 
           interior, to the back, where Ricky is enthroned on a leather 
           chair, draped in a snowy mink coat. 
                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        Everything was flowing. I was doing 
                        it up big. I was moving major 
                        weight within a matter of weeks. 
                        Art even started to let me take his 
                        jet down to Miami on my own and 
                        make runs without him. 

           EXT. MIAMI, FLORIDA - DAY

           Ricky and his crew climb down from the jet where they’re 
           greeted by Manuelo and Luis, the Colombians. They file into 
           an awaiting stretch limousine. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        Back then, in the peak of the crack 
                        epidemic, you couldn’t get enough 
                        cocaine -- as soon as it came in it 
                        went out. The entire East Side, the 
                        entire city, every ghetto in 
                        America was hooked on that little 
                        fucking white rock.

           INSIDE A CRACK HOUSE -- a MAN cooks up a batch on the stove. 
           Then a SMOKER lights up. We rise above the house and climb 
           into the night, the house now represented by a RED DOT on a 
           satellite image of the East Side. There are dozens of other 
           RED DOTS representing crack houses. We continue rising above 
           Detroit and there are now hundreds of RED DOTS throughout the 
           city, and pretty soon we see an image of the entire United 
           States -- thousands of RED DOTS blanket every urban area. 

           INT. THE WERSHE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Ricky, dressed head-to-toe in kingpin regalia, sits with his 
           dad at the little formica table in the kitchen. His dad 
           admires his coat.  

                                 RICK SR.
                        Look at you. Double-breasted. Now 
                        that’s a show stopper. 

           He touches Ricky’s coat.

                                 RICK SR. (CONT’D)
                        Is that real fur? 

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        It’s mink. Giorgio Armani.

                                 RICK SR.
                        Is that like Italian or something?
                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        Yeah, Italian.

           His dad nods, impressed, looking him up and down. 

                                 RICK SR.
                        I know that chain ain’t real.

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        14 carat real.

                                 RICK SR.
                        Let me see that thing.

           Ricky pulls the donkey rope gold chain over his head and 
           hands it to his dad.

                                 RICK SR. (CONT’D)
                        You wear this thing long enough and 
                        you’re gonna have a neck like a 
                        bull.  

           Rick Sr. puts on the chain -- and they laugh.

                                 RICK SR. (CONT’D)
                        I miss having you in the house. You 
                        look good, Ricky. Really good.

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        Has the FBI come around?

                                 RICK SR.
                        Those guys are like fucking 
                        parasites. They suck the blood out 
                        of you and then they fly off to 
                        suck from someone else.

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        So you haven’t seen them? They 
                        haven’t called you or anything, 
                        asked about me? 

                                 RICK SR.
                        Nope. But I sure wish they would. I 
                        could use the money. I have some 
                        information that they would want. I 
                        know valuable things.

           Ricky reaches inside his mink coat and sets a ten-thousand 
           dollar stack of hundreds on the table. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        Fuck the FBI. 
                                 RICK SR.
                        Did they give you that? Are you 
                        working for them again? Is that how 
                        you got all this fancy shit?

           Ricky produces another stack of hundreds and slaps it on the 
           table.  

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        Fuck the FBI.

                                 RICK SR.
                        We can’t just fuck the FBI, Ricky. 
                        I mean, I wish we could. But --   

           Ricky reaches inside his coat and slams another stack on the 
           table, the intensity building each time he repeats the action 
           and rebellious declaration --

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        Fuck the FBI.

           His dad chuckles. So does Ricky as he slams another stack on 
           the table. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE (CONT’D)
                        Fuck the FBI.

           Their chuckles grow into laughter, a laughter fueled by anger 
           and defiance, escalating with each breath as father and son 
           feed off one another with a mania building toward delusion. 
           Ricky slams another stack on the table.  

                                 RICKY WERSHE (CONT’D)
                        Fuck the FBI.
                             (and another stack)
                        Fuck ‘em. 

                                 RICK SR.
                        Yeah, fuck ‘em. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        Fuck ‘em. 

                                 RICK SR.
                        Yeah fuck those motherfuckers! Fuck 
                        ‘em -- Fuck ‘em -- Fuck ‘em! 

           Rick Sr. leaps from his chair with furious animation and 
           starts throwing punches in the air around the kitchen, the 
           donkey rope gold chain flopping off his chest.
                                 RICK SR. (CONT’D)
                        You know I beat the crap out of 
                        those two faggot agents at the 
                        hospital?

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        Nah. I didn’t know that.

                                 RICK SR.
                        Ooooohhh yeeeaaahhhh. I kicked the 
                        living fucking shit out of them in 
                        the hallway. I straight mollywopped 
                        their asses. I was bouncing their 
                        faces off the walls like 
                        basketballs. They may teach those 
                        faggots how to lie, cheat, and 
                        deceive people at FBI school -- but 
                        they sure as hell don’t teach them 
                        how to fight with their fists. Let 
                        me tell you, it was pathetic. Those 
                        two fairies punched like a couple 
                        of screaming girls. I knocked Bell 
                        out with one punch -- one fucking 
                        punch -- boom -- and then I tackled 
                        Turner, that piece of shit, and 
                        pounded his face into hamburger 
                        meat. Dawn had to pull me off -- or 
                        I would’ve killed both of them with 
                        my bare hands. I swear to fucking 
                        God.

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        Where is Dawn? How’s she doing?

           The question deflates the mood. Rick Sr. becomes visibly 
           distressed. He sighs and shakes his head and lights a 
           cigarette.

                                 RICK SR.
                        She’s staying with that fucking 
                        dirt bag boyfriend of hers over on 
                        Chalmers, smoking crack with him 
                        and doing who knows what. I think 
                        he’s been getting her to write bad 
                        checks or something. 
                             (changing subject)
                        Let me come work for you, Ricky. 
                        Look at all this goddamn money. 
                        Gimme a chance. You know I’m a good 
                        worker. I learn quick -- you know 
                        that. Nobody works harder than me. 
                        Nobody. I don’t need to sleep. I’ll 
                        stay awake all night. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 RICK SR. (CONT'D)
                        Whatever you need me to do. Gimme a 
                        fucking chance.

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        Don’t worry about the money, Dad. I 
                        got you covered from now on. 
                             (then)
                        You said Dawn was staying over on 
                        Chalmers?

                                 RICK SR.
                        Yeah, Chalmers. I got the address 
                        written down somewhere. I tried 
                        talking to her, but she didn’t want 
                        to listen to me. I don’t know what 
                        to do with her at this point. I 
                        just don’t know what to do. 

           CAMERA PUSHES IN ON RICKY -- anger growing across his face -- 
           he knows exactly what to do. 

           EXT. A HOUSE ON CHALMERS AVENUE - NIGHT

           Ricky kicks down the door and storms inside. He’s followed by 
           five young black men -- his crew -- as they pour into the 
           trash-strewn living room and across the filthy carpet toward 
           a bedroom in back.

           Dawn’s boyfriend runs out of the bedroom and into the narrow 
           hallway, holding a pistol, when he is blind-sided by Ricky’s 
           fist which is armored with brass knuckles.

           The punch drops the boyfriend. Ricky straddles him and 
           pummels his face with the brass knuckles. 

           Ricky gets off the man and walks into the bedroom where Dawn 
           is curled up in the corner.

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        Dawn. Let’s go.

           Dawn appears numb and disoriented, groping through the haze 
           of a drug-addled stupor.    

                                 DAWN
                        I can’t go, Ricky. What about my 
                        stuff? I got all my stuff here.

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        Leave it. I’ll get you new stuff.
                                 DAWN
                        But it’s my stuff, Ricky. It’s my 
                        stuff. It’s all I have. My stuff. 
                        It’s here.

           Ricky takes Dawn by the shoulders and talks gently to her as 
           though she were a little child. There’s a part of her, deep 
           in her subconscious, that wants to be rescued from this 
           nightmare. Like every addict, she dreams of going home.

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        I’ll buy you whatever you need. All 
                        new stuff. Now let’s get the fuck 
                        out of this shithole.

           Two men help Dawn out of the bedroom and down the front steps 
           and into a car. 

           A couple other guys drag the limp and nearly unconscious 
           boyfriend down the steps and drop him in the weed-choked 
           front yard. 

           By the time Ricky steps out the front door, there is an 
           orange glow kindling behind him inside the house, the first 
           flickers of flame climbing the interior walls and moldering 
           curtains.   

           He stands over Dawn’s boyfriend.

                                 RICKY WERSHE (CONT’D)
                        If I ever see you with my sister, 
                        if you ever try and call her, if 
                        you ever step foot in this city 
                        again, you’re gonna die. You 
                        understand?

           The boyfriend is unable to nod for himself so Ricky lifts his 
           chin and nods for him. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE (CONT’D)
                        Good. Here’s a bus ticket. Now get 
                        the fuck out of here. 

           Ricky slaps the bus ticket on his chest and gets into the 
           awaiting car with Dawn inside. 

           As they drive away, the growing flames consume the house 
           behind them. 
           EXT. ART DERRICK’S MANSION - DAY

           Art pushes a wheelbarrow loaded with cellophane wrapped 
           bricks of cash across the backyard lawn. Ricky walks 
           alongside him with a shovel. 

                                 ART DERRICK
                        I’m pretty sure that you’re the 
                        highest paid sixteen year-old in 
                        the country right now, Ricky. 
                        Probably the world. Maybe ever... 
                        Take Rockefeller -- what the fuck 
                        was he doing at sixteen? He was 
                        making fifty cents a day, is what 
                        he was doing. You and him and me. 
                        That’s interesting. I think about 
                        stuff like that sometimes. How much 
                        you make last week?

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        More than Rockefeller. 

                                 ART DERRICK
                        Look at me -- I know how much you 
                        made.
                             (computing the math)
                        You made right around eighty 
                        thousand.

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        Eighty thousand, one hundred and 
                        twenty. 

                                 ART DERRICK
                        One hundred and twenty? 

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        I sold a watch. 

                                 ART DERRICK
                        A fucking watch -- Jesus Christ.

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        Every dollar counts.

                                 ART DERRICK
                        So does your time. Don’t fuck 
                        around with the watches anymore 
                        unless you wanna open a pawn shop.

           They arrive at a freshly dug hole. Inside the hole is a steel 
           safe, sunk on its ass, the door swung open. 
                                 ART DERRICK (CONT’D)
                        You see all these trees?

           Art points to landscaped maple trees throughout the backyard.

                                 ART DERRICK (CONT’D)
                        I got two million buried under each 
                        of them. If anything happens to me, 
                        be sure you come and dig them up. 
                        It’s my legal defense fund.

           Art takes a brick of cellophane wrapped cash and lobs it to 
           Ricky. 

                                 ART DERRICK (CONT’D)
                        Here’s your start. Always be saving 
                        for the day when you get popped. It 
                        happens to every one of us 
                        eventually. Whether you die in 
                        prison, or die sucking on fresh 
                        native titties in some tropical 
                        paradise, boils down to one 
                        question: How much justice can you 
                        afford?  

           Art dumps the wheelbarrow of cash into the metal safe and 
           shuts the door. He and Ricky start filling in the hole with 
           shovels.

           INT. RICKY’S DOWNTOWN APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Ricky is somewhere in the world of deep sleep when his 
           doorbell rings. He slowly bats his eyes -- did he just hear 
           that, or was he dreaming? 

           Then the doorbell rings again. He looks at his digital clock: 
           2:51am. His adrenaline kicks in and shocks him awake.

           He removes a sawed-off Mossberg shotgun from underneath his 
           bed and creeps silently in his boxers and bare feet across 
           the hardwood floor toward the front door -- the shotgun 
           barrel aimed straight ahead.  

           The doorbell rings again. He pauses and listens. 

           He hears the sound of a distant siren, the honking of a horn 
           somewhere in the vast city below. But nothing else, nothing 
           in the hallway on the other side of the front door.

           The doorbell rings again. And again -- impatiently. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        Who the fuck is it?
           After a momentary pause, a female voice responds from behind 
           the door, meek and forlorn. 

                                 FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        It’s me, Ricky. 

           He recognizes the voice and peers into the peephole -- and 
           opens the door to --

           CATHY VOLSAN

           She’s standing in the hallway in a black leather overcoat 
           cinched at the waist with a belt, black knee-high stiletto 
           boots, and black sunglasses.

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        Cathy...

           She hugs Ricky and kisses him on the neck before nearly 
           collapsing in his arms. 

           He cranes his neck out the door and looks up and down the 
           hallway. It’s empty. 

           He locks the door and moves inside with Cathy.

                                 RICKY WERSHE (CONT’D)
                        Cathy, what’s going on? What are 
                        you -- 

                                 CATHY VOLSAN
                        I need someone to talk to. Everyone 
                        is gone.  

           She sniffles and wipes a tear from her eye. But whether the 
           tears are genuine or not, we can’t quite tell. She’s 
           remarkably manipulative, the type of drama job they throw

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        Who told you I was living here? 
                        How’d you find me?

                                 CATHY VOLSAN
                        I’m scared. I don’t know what to 
                        do.

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        How’s Johnny doing?

                                 CATHY VOLSAN
                        Johnny is going to prison for 
                        twenty years. I’m all alone.
                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        Does he know you’re here?

                                 CATHY VOLSAN
                        I haven’t talked to him in a while.

           The initial shock of the unexpected visitor is wearing off as 
           Ricky gathers his wits and escorts Cathy into the living 
           room. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        Sit down. You want something to 
                        drink? 

                                 CATHY VOLSAN
                        What do you have?

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        I got some Cristal. I know you like 
                        that.

                                 CATHY VOLSAN
                        That would be nice, Ricky. Thank 
                        you sweetheart.

           Ricky walks into the kitchen and takes a bottle of Cristal 
           out of the fridge, removes two flutes from the cupboard, and 
           walks back into the living room where --- 

           Cathy is now standing in front of the couch. 

           When Ricky makes eye contact with her, she unties the leather 
           belt around her waist, and the leather coat falls to the 
           floor. She is not wearing anything underneath, her beautiful 
           naked body silhouetted against the city lights filtering in 
           from the window behind her.

           Cathy moves slowly over to Ricky and pulls off his boxers and 
           pushes him softly down onto the couch where she climbs on top 
           of him and begins kissing his neck and slowly riding up and 
           down.

                                 RICKY WERSHE V.O.
                        How could I say no to that? The 
                        bosses wife? It was straight out of 
                        Scarface. Only in this movie, I 
                        didn’t even have to try.

           INT. RICKY’S DOWNTOWN APARTMENT - LATER  

           Ricky and Cathy lie in bed as the morning sun kisses into the 
           room. Cathy has her head on Ricky’s chest.
                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        Are you still married to Johnny?

                                 CATHY VOLSAN
                        Let’s just be here. Me and you.

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        Are you?

           She sighs and looks away. 

                                 CATHY VOLSAN
                        Does it matter right now, Ricky? 
                        Does it really matter?

           She kisses him on his chest and works her way up to his neck 
           with expert seduction. Then slithers up to his ear. She can 
           sense his arousal. She has him where she wants him and so she 
           abruptly climbs out of bed.

                                 CATHY VOLSAN (CONT’D)
                        Maybe I should just go. This was a 
                        bad idea. 

           But Ricky has lost his power to resist. His discretion is 
           gone. His little head is now controlling his big head -- and 
           its yelling this: GET HER BACK IN BED YOU FUCKING IDIOT!  

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        No, Cathy. Stay. I’m glad you came. 

                                 CATHY VOLSAN
                        I should go. Really. This was 
                        stupid of me. This was a mistake.

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        No. Stay here, baby. It doesn’t 
                        matter. I don’t care what you and 
                        Johnny’s thing is. I like you. I 
                        really do. I’ve liked you since the 
                        first time I saw you at the skating 
                        rink. 

           He rises and kisses her. She succumbs to his touch and starts 
           crying. 

                                 CATHY VOLSAN
                        I’ve been so scared. I’ve been so 
                        lonely. I don’t have anyone to talk 
                        to. I just need someone right now. 
                        I need you, Ricky.

           He eases her back onto the bed for another round. 
                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        I never should’ve opened the door 
                        for that bitch. I knew she was 
                        nothing but trouble. But when 
                        trouble is that good-looking... 
                        Psshh. Hey, what can I say? I’m 
                        human.

           EXT. ART DERRICK’S MANSION - DAY

           Art is throwing a pool party. The assemblage is what you 
           would expect from a man with his tastes: Beautiful women in 
           bikinis, some topless, some baring it all, and a few shady-
           looking men smoking cigars and leering at every frolicking 
           part of the female anatomy. 

           Ricky arrives with Cathy on his arm. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        Overnight, Cathy was my girl, and 
                        we started going everywhere 
                        together. I knew Johnny would want 
                        to kill me, no matter what their 
                        status was. But by then my head was 
                        so big I didn’t give a shit.

           Art, cocktail in hand, belly hanging over a red Speedo, 
           greets them with his customary enthusiasm. Then starts 
           singing the Paul McCartney and Stevie Wonder duet:  

                                 ART DERRICK
                        Ebony and Ivory, live together in 
                        perfect harmony -- I love it. I 
                        love you two together. 

           Art throws his arm around Ricky and whispers into his ear. 

                                 ART DERRICK (CONT’D)
                        Johnny’s wife? 
                             (savoring the audacity)
                        You’re a fucking cannibal, kid. I 
                        had you picked the day I met you. A 
                        fucking cannibal.

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        It wasn’t like that. 

                                 ART DERRICK
                        Yeah - yeah - yeah. Who gives a 
                        fuck? 

           Art leads them over to the barbecue grill where a man in a 
           chef hat cooks for the party. 
                                 ART DERRICK (CONT’D)
                        Try the bratwurst. Rudy here will 
                        fix you up a plate. 

           As Art drifts along the pool side, flirting with his guests, 
           he continues singing the duet, mutilating the lyrics and 
           dancing to the sound of his off-key voice.

                                 ART DERRICK (CONT’D)
                        We all know that people are the 
                        same wherever you go... Learn to 
                        give each other what we need to 
                        survive.  

           Art downs his drink and runs toward the pool and tucks into a 
           cannonball.

                                 ART DERRICK (CONT’D)
                        Watch out pretties.

           Splash.

           INT. THE PONTIAC SILVERDOME - NIGHT 

           The Detroit Pistons warm up prior to the game as Ricky and 
           Cathy find their seats at courtside.    

           Cathy waves to a PISTONS’S PLAYER, who jogs over and kisses 
           her on the cheek. They exchange flirtatious pleasantries: 
           Hey, sweetheart. How you doing? And a few other quick pieces 
           of small talk -- and the player jogs back over to warm-ups 
           without acknowledging Ricky. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        What the fuck was that all about?

                                 CATHY VOLSAN
                        It’s nothing. I was just saying hi 
                        to Vinnie. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        What do you mean nothing? It sure 
                        as fuck was something.

                                 CATHY VOLSAN
                        It’s just Vinnie. We used to date. 
                        He’s married now, OK? 

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        So are you.  

                                 CATHY VOLSAN
                        What does that mean? 
           The encounter has disrupted Ricky’s composure, and he doesn’t 
           have a cogent response, only: 

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        It means anything is possible, 
                        isn’t it? You’re married and so is 
                        he.  

                                 CATHY VOLSAN
                        Don’t be so insecure, sweetheart.

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        I ain’t insecure. I got more money 
                        than that punk. He’s the sixth man. 
                        He ain’t even a fucking starter.  

                                 CATHY VOLSAN
                        Let’s just have a good time.

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        I’m having a fucking great time. 
                        Shit.  

           Cathy cozies up to Ricky and tries to calm him. She nuzzles 
           into his neck and kisses him. 

                                 CATHY VOLSAN
                        Ricky, I’m here with you. You’re my 
                        man. You’re the one I’m in love 
                        with. You don’t have anything to 
                        worry about, baby.

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        I gotta take a leak.  

           Ricky stands and climbs the stairs.

           INT. MEN’S BATHROOM, THE PONTIAC SILVERDOME - MOMENTS LATER

           Ricky pisses into a urinal when a man slides into the urinal 
           next to him. Neither Ricky nor the camera get a look at the 
           man -- yet.

                                 MAN (O.S.)
                        Wow. Now that’s a penis.

           Ricky ignores the man, figures he’s some crazy talking to 
           someone else.

                                 MAN (CONT’D)
                        No wonder the black girls like you, 
                        kid. You got a dick like a rhino. 
           It’s now clear that the man is directing his lewd comments at 
           Ricky. So Ricky turns and throws the man a threatening glare 
           and recognizes Agent Turner --

                                 AGENT TURNER
                        Let me touch that thing --

           But before Ricky can react and zip up his pants, Agent Turner 
           plunges his hand into Ricky’s crotch and latches onto Ricky’s 
           penis -- and proceeds to thrash Ricky around the bathroom 
           before pulling him into a handicap stall -- and throwing him 
           into the corner.

           Ricky doubles over in pain. He falls to his knees and pukes.  

           Agent Turner locks the handicap stall door. We see that Agent 
           Bell and Officer Jackson have been waiting inside the roomy 
           stall for them to arrive. 

                                 AGENT BELL
                        Hey, Ricky. How’s your dicky?

           Ricky pukes again. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        Fuck you. 

                                 AGENT BELL
                        You still think you make the rules, 
                        Ricky. You still think you’re in 
                        charge.

           Agent Bell shakes his head with ironic disappointment. 

                                 AGENT BELL (CONT’D)
                        You know how you’re feeling right 
                        now? Well, everyday in prison will 
                        be worse than this. Every single 
                        day in prison another man is going 
                        to have his hand on your cock. He’s 
                        gonna use your cock as his tool, 
                        jamming and thrusting it wherever 
                        the hell he wants to. Every single 
                        fucking day for the rest of your 
                        life. And the most terrifying thing 
                        about it is that you’re eventually 
                        going to start liking it. You’re 
                        going to like being his tool. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 AGENT BELL (CONT’D)
                        And a little while after that, your 
                        hand is going to be on his cock, 
                        tugging, and spit-shining and 
                        working it back and forth in your 
                        mouth until it explodes and you’re 
                        sucking down hot prison protein 
                        shakes for breakfast, lunch, and 
                        dinner. 

                                 AGENT TURNER
                        And dessert.

                                 AGENT BELL
                        Even dessert. That’s your future, 
                        kiddo. 

                                 AGENT TURNER
                        A jailhouse fag. Fresh white 
                        teenage ass. So rare. And so sweet.    

                                 AGENT BELL 
                        You’re almost seventeen now, Ricky. 
                        We’ll charge you as an adult, and 
                        it’ll stick.  

           Agent Bell bends down and slides his business card into 
           Ricky’s pocket. 

                                 AGENT BELL (CONT’D)
                        In case you forgot where we’re at.
                             (then)
                        Come and see us again, Ricky. We 
                        miss you.

                                 AGENT TURNER
                        We’re the good guys. You need to 
                        decide whether you’re a piece of 
                        shit, or one of us.

           Agent Turner and Agent Bell exit the stall. 

           As the casual stroll of their footsteps recede across the 
           cement floor, Jackson kneels down to Ricky as though he’s a 
           friend imparting some trusted advice.  

                                 OFFICER JACKSON
                        They’re giving you one more chance, 
                        kid. Don’t fuck it up. Don’t 
                        fuckin’ waste it. You’re too young.

           Jackson stands upright. 
                                 OFFICER JACKSON (CONT’D)
                        I don’t want to see you end up on 
                        the other side. You’ll lose every 
                        time.

           Jackson exits the stall. 

           After some effort, Ricky pushes himself onto his feet and 
           pukes one last time. He retrieves Agent Bell’s card from his 
           pocket and flushes it down the toilet.

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        You would’ve thought that would 
                        scare me straight. But it didn’t. 
                        And suddenly, everybody was gunning 
                        for me.

           INT. A 1985 MONTE CARLO SS - DAY

           Ricky sits in the passenger seat as Dre, a member of his 
           crew, drives down the boulevard, bumping It’s Tricky by Run 
           D.M.C.. 

           They approach a busy intersection and stop at the red light. 

           Ricky looks in the side mirror at the vehicles behind them 
           when he spots a van approaching and eyes it with caution. 

           As Ricky studies the van, his instincts tell him something 
           ain’t right -- he squints -- the glare off the windshield, is 
           the driver wearing a ski mask? 

           Suddenly, the side door on the van slides back as it pulls 
           alongside them.

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        Go Dre! Go!

           Dre glances over at Ricky with momentary confusion -- when 
           Ricky swivels in his seat and jams his own foot down on the 
           gas pedal and the Monte Carlo peels rubber -- 

                                 RICKY WERSHE (CONT’D)
                        Drive motherfucker!!!

           Now the van door is pulled all the way open and AUTOMATIC 
           GUNFIRE BLAZES from inside -- 

           As Dre now understands the dire stakes and floors the Monte 
           Carlo through the intersection, dodging the cross-traffic as 
           a storm of gunfire follows them -- 
           Ricky and Dre duck the barrage -- The back window shatters 
           and bullets perforate the upholstery and blister the trunk -- 
           another window is blown out.  

           THE CROSS-TRAFFIC -- horns blaring, brakes screeching -- 

           When a pick-up truck smashes the back end of the Monte Carlo 
           and spins it sideways -- Ricky and Dre are thrown around the 
           interior -- but Dre manages to negotiate and steer out of the 
           collision and motor through the intersection and down the 
           boulevard on the other side. 

           The SS Monte Carlo is a very fast car and the van doesn’t 
           give chase, turns across the intersection, and flees in the 
           other direction.

                                 DRE 
                        Who the fuck was that?

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        The dude was wearing a mask. I 
                        couldn’t tell. 

           They speed down the boulevard and into the distance.

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        My days were numbered, and I could 
                        feel it. The fact is, it could’ve 
                        been a hundred different dudes from 
                        ten different crews. But I couldn’t 
                        walk away. Where would I go? What 
                        would I do? You reach a point when 
                        there’s no going back, when there’s 
                        no other world than the one you’re 
                        in... They say that no one walks 
                        away from the game. And it’s the 
                        god’s honest truth. 

           INT. RICKY’S DOWNTOWN APARTMENT, BATHROOM - DAY

           Ricky reads Sports Illustrated while sitting on the toilet. A 
           quiet moment in an unquiet life.

           Suddenly -- the blade of a steak knife rips through the 
           bathroom door. The magazine flies out of Ricky’s hands. 

           On the other side, holding the handle of the knife is -- 

                                 CATHY VOLSAN
                        Ricky -- You piece of shit. You 
                        cheating motherfucker.   
           Ricky pulls up his boxers, arms himself with the plunger, and 
           approaches the door.

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        Cathy. Just calm down. Wait a 
                        minute.

           But Cathy is hysterical -- tears and rage. 

                                 CATHY VOLSAN
                        You’re a liar, Ricky. A liar. I 
                        know you’re fucking half the 
                        bitches in this city.

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        I’m not sleeping with anyone else 
                        but you, sweetheart. You’re my 
                        girl. I don’t need anyone else.

                                 CATHY VOLSAN
                        You’re a fucking liar. I found her 
                        number in your fucking pants. 

           In Cathy’s other hand -- the hand not holding the knife -- 
           she is waving a crumpled paper napkin with a phone number 
           written across it. There’s a name on it as well. 

                                 CATHY VOLSAN (CONT’D)
                        Unique? Unique? What kind of ghetto 
                        ass name is that? 

           She puts the napkin to her nose.

                                 CATHY VOLSAN (CONT’D)
                        She smells like a fucking stripper.

           Cathy rips the knife out of the door and stomps across the 
           hardwood floor and over to the coffee table where she grabs 
           the cordless telephone sitting atop it. 

           She dials the number on the napkin.

                                 CATHY VOLSAN (CONT’D)
                             (yelling across room)
                        We’ll see motherfucker. 

           Ricky cracks open the bathroom door and peeks out. 

           Seeing that Cathy is on the other side of the apartment, he 
           bolts from the bathroom and turns the corner into his 
           bedroom. 
           He sets down the plunger and reaches between the mattress and 
           retrieves his sawed-off shotgun and walks back out to the 
           living room where Cathy has the phone to her ear. A woman has 
           just answered the other line. 

                                 CATHY VOLSAN (CONT’D)
                        Hey bitch. You need to stay the 
                        fuck away from my man you skanky 
                        ass cunt... Who the fuck is this? 
                        You know who the fuck this is...
                             (Unique hangs up)
                        Oh no you didn’t. You don’t hang up 
                        on me -- you fuckin’ ghetto ass 
                        bitch. 

           As Cathy re-dials, Ricky yanks the cord out of the wall jack 
           and the phone line goes dead. 

           Furious and unintimidated by the shotgun in Ricky’s hands, 
           Cathy throws the receiver at him. He ducks and the receiver 
           flies over his head and shatters the balcony window. 

           Ricky runs across the living room and looks down to the 
           street below at -- 

           CATHY’S POLICE DETAIL -- 

           The shards of glass shower their car and the surrounding 
           asphalt. The two plain clothes cops look up at Ricky’s 
           apartment and jump out of the car --

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        Cathy. Get your ass on over here 
                        and tell them everything is cool.

           Cathy is now smiling at Ricky. She just shifted the power 
           dynamic. She is once again the center of attention, the 
           pedestal she must always stand upon. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE (CONT’D)
                        Cathy. You come tell them 
                        everything is cool. I don’t need 
                        this shit right now. I don’t 
                        fucking need this.

           But Cathy doesn’t budge. She just stands there, gloating at 
           Ricky’s discomfort.  

           The cops are hustling across the street and getting ready to 
           charge into the building. 
                                 RICKY WERSHE (CONT’D)
                        Cathy. Get the fuck over here. 
                        Please. Please tell them everything 
                        is all right.

                                 CATHY VOLSAN
                        Get on your knees.

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        Cathy -- they’re coming up here 
                        goddamnit. I don’t need the fucking 
                        cops in my house.

                                 CATHY VOLSAN
                        On your knees. And beg.

           Without any leverage in the situation, Ricky gets on his 
           knees and clasps his hands.

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        Cathy. Please. Can you please tell 
                        them everything is all right?

                                 CATHY VOLSAN
                        Who is the queen bitch of this 
                        house? 

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        You’re the queen bitch, Cathy. You 
                        are the queen bitch of this house.

                                 CATHY VOLSAN
                        Who has the sweetest and juiciest 
                        pussy you’ve ever tasted?

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        You do Cathy. You have the sweetest 
                        and juiciest pussy I’ve ever 
                        tasted. 

                                 CATHY VOLSAN
                        And ever will taste.

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        And ever will taste. Yes, the 
                        sweetest and juiciest pussy I’ve 
                        ever tasted and ever will taste. 
                        The sweetest and juiciest pussy 
                        there is in the whole fucking 
                        universe.

           Ricky glances nervously at the balcony.
                                 RICKY WERSHE (CONT’D)
                        Cathy, please.

           Cathy sighs and then casually makes her way across the living 
           room. She steps onto the balcony and waves down to her police 
           detail gaining access to the front door.

                                 CATHY VOLSAN
                        Good morning. I’m fine fellas. 
                        Everything is fine. 

                                 COP
                        You sure?

                                 CATHY VOLSAN
                        Yes, we’re fine. The phone just 
                        slipped out of my hand.  

           She walks back over to Ricky and kisses him on the lips, 
           slowly, seductively, vindictively. Then she slaps him across 
           the face. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        She was affecting my business. She 
                        was affecting my piece of mind. She 
                        was a human fucking tornado and I 
                        was caught up in it. 

           INT. A FORD THUNDERBIRD, THE EAST SIDE - NIGHT

           Another night. Another car. Another run. 

           Dre drives and Ricky sits in the passenger seat as they roll 
           through the East Side. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        I gotta get her out of my house, 
                        bro. She’s fucking crazy.

                                 DRE
                        You want me to bust a cap in her?

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        Nah. It ain’t like that. I love 
                        her, I just can’t live with her.
                        One day she’s trying to stab me, 
                        the next day she’s buying me a 
                        diamond ring. It’s insane.

           They are a block from Ricky’s dad’s house when they make a 
           stop at a stop sign. 
           There’s a police cruiser parked catty-corner to them. Ricky 
           sees that Officer Jackson is sitting in the passenger seat as 
           if waiting for him. Jackson stares at Ricky with that cold 
           intensity we’ve seen before, hate-filled and ruthless -- the 
           most feared man of them all, a criminal with a badge.

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        On May 22, 1987, it all came 
                        crashing down.

           As the Ford Thunderbird rolls through the intersection, the 
           cop car pulls behind them. 

           The cop car trails them for half a block and then throws on 
           its lights. 

                                 DRE
                        What you want me to do?

           Ricky points up ahead.

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        Pull in front of my dad’s house.

           They stop in front of the Wershe house. 

           Both officers exit the cruiser. Officer Jackson approaches 
           the passenger side and halts at Ricky’s open window. 

           Ricky looks up at Jackson --

                                 RICKY WERSHE (CONT’D)
                        What’s up?

                                 OFFICER JACKSON
                        Don’t you wassup me, boy. Do I know 
                        you? You don’t fuckin’ know me. Get 
                        your ass out of the car.

           Ricky stares up at Jackson.

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        What?

                                 OFFICER JACKSON
                        I said get the fuck out the car.

           Officer Jackson rips open the door and yanks out Ricky.

           The swirling police lights flash against the houses and 
           trees, creating their own blue and red strobing atmosphere 
           and attracting the attention of all those inhabiting the 
           neighborhood, including --
           Rick Sr. who pulls back the window curtain to see what’s 
           going on -- recognizes his son -- and bolts out the front 
           door and across the yard, followed by Dawn, ready to brawl.  

                                 RICK SR.
                        Get your fucking hands off my son. 
                        You got a fucking warrant? 

           AT THE CAR -- Jackson notices a grocery bag in the passenger 
           foot well. 

                                 JACKSON
                        What’s in that bag?

           Jackson reaches inside and removes the bag. 

           Ricky knocks it away from him. The bag lands on the ground 
           and Ricky scoops it up, tucks it under his arm like a 
           football and tries to run with it. 

           But Jackson pulls him down by his shirt collar -- just as the 
           furious Rick Sr. and Dawn arrive, punching and clawing, and 
           at once, the situation erupts into a chaotic and confused 
           melee.

           Ricky hands Dawn the bag -- and Dawn takes off running into 
           the house.

           Ricky and Dre bolt from the scene in separate directions.

           Jackson and the other officer chase after Ricky -- they 
           couldn’t give a fuck about Dre. 

           Ricky hops a short chain link fence and turns down an alley. 
           But Jackson is long and lean and athletic and Ricky cannot 
           outrun him.

           Jackson tackles Ricky against a wooden fence and he and the 
           other officer proceed to pummel Ricky, punching and kicking 
           him on the ground.

           MOMENTS LATER

           Jackson leads a battered and bloodied Ricky out of the alley 
           and down the sidewalk on Hampshire Street which is now 
           swarming with police cruisers, DEA Agents, and other task 
           force members.

           As Ricky is led through the assembly, two men start clapping, 
           and he looks over and sees Agent Bell and Agent Turner 
           leaning against their sedan. 
                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        They didn’t have anything on me 
                        except for the bag of money that I 
                        gave Dawn which she hid in the 
                        linen closet. Around thirty 
                        thousand, a slap on the wrist.

           INT. THE WERSHE’S HOUSE - LATER

           A cop finds the bag of money in the linen closet and waves it 
           at Rick Sr. and Dawn who sit in handcuffs on the couch.

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        But then, a few hours later, the 
                        cops claimed that they received an 
                        anonymous tip from a neighbor who 
                        said that they saw me stash a 
                        cardboard box underneath a porch 
                        earlier that night.

           EXT. HOUSE, EAST SIDE - LATER

           Officer Jackson crawls out from underneath a porch with a 
           cardboard box in his hands. He opens the box and proudly 
           displays the contents for the various law enforcement 
           gathered about. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        They charged me with possession of 
                        eight kilos of cocaine, which I 
                        knew could get me a life sentence 
                        if I was convicted. But I felt I 
                        had a strong case. It wasn’t mine. 
                        They didn’t even find it on me... 
                        But when I bailed out, the media 
                        got hold of my story, and turned me 
                        into a celebrity. The next day I 
                        was everywhere. The next day, I had 
                        become “White Boy Rick.” 

           CUT TO -- A photo of Ricky with the moniker “White Boy Rick” 
           is emblazoned on the front page of the city’s two major 
           newspapers, The Detroit Free Press and The Detroit News.

           CUT TO -- The Nightly News -- a photo of Ricky flashes on 
           screen behind the anchors. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        They labeled me a street prodigy, a 
                        drug-dealing wunderkind. I didn’t 
                        even know what those terms meant.

                        But all the attention just made my 
                        head swell, and I grew even more 
                        confident and cocky.

           INT. PONTIAC SILVERDOME - NIGHT

           Ricky sits courtside with Cathy -- when she startles with 
           excitement and points at the JUMBOTRON -- 

           Where Ricky appears on the digital screen, framed in a 
           flashing border of pulsing light bulbs like the intro for a 
           rockstar. 

           The public address announcer proclaims --

                                 P.A.
                        DETROIT’S OWN WHITE BOY RICK IS IN 
                        THE HOUSE! GIVE IT UP FOR HIM 
                        FOLKS! 

           The audience cheers with great passion and support, even a 
           few players trot over and shake Ricky’s hand. The fans behind 
           Ricky pat him on the back: “go get ’em son”. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        In a depressed working class city 
                        without many heroes, I had become 
                        one. Like Jesse James or Billy the 
                        Kid or even Al Capone, they saw me 
                        as an outlaw standing up against 
                        the system. I loved the attention. 
                        I couldn’t possibly see how it 
                        could work against me. 

           EXT. THE FRANK MURPHY HALL OF JUSTICE - DAY

           Ricky struts down the sidewalk in a double-breasted Armani 
           suit with his attorney, WILLIAM BUFALINO, a swaggering 
           heavyweight who cuts the figure of a mob boss. Behind them 
           walk Rick Sr. and Dawn. 

           As they near the courthouse steps the extent of the media 
           circus is on a scale fit for the largest and most infamous of 
           trials: Dozens of reporters and TV news crews mob them. 

           A group of security guards escort Ricky and his team through 
           the jostling media.  

           Bufalino answers a few questions as he scales the courthouse 
           steps:
                                 BUFALINO
                        This is a classic frame-up job. 
                        This case reeks from a mile away 
                        and the jury is going to smell 
                        right through it. This city is 
                        notorious for its corruption, and 
                        this case is a prime example of it. 
                        Moreover, my client, Ricky Wershe 
                        Junior, is a teenager, and the 
                        State’s draconian decision to try 
                        him as an adult is a moral outrage. 
                        This is a waste of taxpayer’s 
                        dollars. We shouldn’t even be here. 

           Never one to shy away from attention, Rick Sr. takes the 
           opportunity to speak his mind to several microphones shoved 
           in his face. 

                                 RICK SR.
                        After we win this joke of a case, 
                        we’re gonna sue the City of Detroit 
                        and the State of Michigan for a lot 
                        of money. You can count on that.

           INT. THE COURT ROOM - DAY

           Ricky and Bufalino stand before the judge. His family stands 
           behind him along with members from his crew. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        But the jury didn’t see things the 
                        way my attorney presented them. 
                        They found me guilty. And the judge 
                        -- well -- I’ll let him tell you 
                        what he thought of me in his own 
                        words.

           A stern and merciless JUDGE stares down from the bench. 

                                 JUDGE
                        You, son, are worse than a mass-
                        murderer. 

           The gavel strikes the sounding block. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        Under Michigan’s 650 Lifer Law, I 
                        was sentenced to life in prison 
                        without the possibility of parole. 
                        I was seventeen years old. 

           The bailiff handcuffs Ricky and escorts him out of the 
           chamber. 
           He glances over his shoulder at his family and nods to them 
           in farewell. The verdict hasn’t really sunk in yet -- how 
           could it? 

           The door closes behind Ricky and his father loses it.

                                 RICK SR.
                        It ain’t over, Ricky! Stay strong. 
                        We’re gonna get you out of here 
                        son! 

           As several Detroit cops file out of the courtroom and into 
           the hallway, Rick Sr. follows after them, unhinged and out 
           for blood. He charges toward Officer Jackson and gets in his 
           face.

                                 RICK SR. (CONT’D)
                        You better watch your back out 
                        there. You better not sleep too 
                        well. 

           And on those threatening words, several bailiff’s slam Rick 
           Sr. to the ground and cuff him. 

                                 RICK SR. (CONT’D)
                        Freedom of Speech! Freedom of 
                        Speech! I’m exercising my First 
                        Amendment rights. I didn’t do 
                        anything. I didn’t touch him. 

           Officer Jackson bends down to Rick Sr., whose face is 
           smooshed against the linoleum floor, and educates him on the 
           law.

                                 OFFICER JACKSON
                        You can’t threaten a cop, dipshit. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        My dad got a year in prison for 
                        that one. Suddenly, we were both 
                        behind bars.

           INT. MARQUETTE BRANCH PRISON - DAY

           Rain falls on a dreary winter day as CAMERA creeps toward the 
           forbidding sandstone dungeon. We stay on the outside of the 
           prison and listen to the nightmarish cacophony of the human 
           zoo behind its walls -- the taunts, the threats, the howling, 
           assault, rape, murder, the inhumanity of it all.     

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        My first year in prison was what 
                        you might expect -- Hell.

                        After a year or so, it started to 
                        set in that I was going to spend 
                        the rest of my life in a cage. The 
                        freedom I was used to, living like 
                        a king, eating whatever I wanted, 
                        sleeping with beautiful women, the 
                        privilege of owning nice things, 
                        was gone. I went from making 
                        thousands of dollars a day, to five 
                        cents an hour. 

           INT. MARQUETTE BRANCH PRISON - DAY

           At his work detail, Ricky removes towels from an industrial 
           dryer and starts folding them. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        The finality of it all caught up to 
                        me and threw me into a dark place. 

           He has put on some muscle, and whatever boyish charm he still 
           possessed going into this place, has vanished entirely. His 
           right eye is black and blue, slightly swollen.    

                                 INTERCOM
                        Wershe -- 193034. You have a 
                        visitor. 

           Ricky stops folding and walks past the laundry machines and 
           toward a GUARD standing by the door.

           INT. MARQUETTE BRANCH PRISON - MOMENTS LATER

           The guard escorts Ricky down the corridor. As they approach 
           the corridor leading to the visitation area, Ricky is 
           confused when the guard leads him in the opposite direction.

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        I thought I had a visitor?

                                 GUARD
                        You do. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        Then why aren’t we going to the 
                        visitation area.

                                 GUARD
                        Warden said to take you to his 
                        office.
           INT. MARQUETTE BRANCH PRISON - MOMENTS LATER

           The guard unlocks the door to a special visitation room 
           adjacent to the warden’s office where FBI Agent’s Bell and 
           Turner are sitting at a small table. 

                                 AGENT BELL
                        You can uncuff him.

           The guard removes Ricky’s handcuffs and steps outside.

                                 AGENT BELL (CONT’D)
                        How’s it going, Ricky?

           Taken aback, Ricky only stares at them, unable to hide his 
           animosity.

                                 AGENT BELL (CONT’D)
                        I know, stupid question. Sit down. 
                        Please.

           After several tense moments, Ricky seats himself at the 
           table.

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        Why are we meeting in here? 

                                 AGENT BELL
                        As you know, they record all the 
                        conversations in the visitation 
                        area. We don’t trust the guards 
                        here anymore than we do the Detroit 
                        Police Department.

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                             (sarcastically)
                        I thought they were your pals?

                                 AGENT BELL
                        Not anymore.

                                 AGENT TURNER
                        It’s criminal what the State has 
                        done to you. You don’t deserve a 
                        life sentence. You did some bad 
                        things, but they weren’t that bad.   

                                 AGENT BELL
                        We’re here to set things right. 
                        We’re here to make amends. We can 
                        get you out of here in a few years.

           A bitter chuckle from Ricky.
                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        How the fuck you gonna do that?

                                 AGENT TURNER
                        We’re the Federal Government. We’re 
                        above this pissant state that locks 
                        up teenagers for life. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        Why don’t you stop beating around 
                        the fucking bush and tell me why 
                        you drove eight hours to come see 
                        me.

                                 AGENT BELL
                        We were wrong about Jackson and we 
                        want your help in taking him down. 
                        The Detroit Police Department is 
                        one massive turd of corruption, and 
                        we want to flush all the filth down 
                        the toilet. And it starts with 
                        Jackson. We know he runs a ring of 
                        corrupt cops who are involved in 
                        everything from escorting shipments 
                        of drugs into the city to contract 
                        killings.

                                 AGENT TURNER
                        We need your help in getting to 
                        him. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        I can’t help you guys with that. I 
                        wouldn’t know where to start. 

                                 AGENT BELL
                        Sure you do. 
                             (then)
                        Your girlfriend.

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        Cathy?

                                 AGENT BELL
                        Yes, Cathy Volsan.

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        She ain’t my girlfriend no more.

                                 AGENT TURNER
                        Look, we know that you still talk 
                        with her.  
                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        So what? 

                                 AGENT BELL
                        The lieutenant in charge of Cathy’s  
                        police detail works hand-in-glove 
                        with Jackson.  

           Ricky ponders the revelation. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        I want something in writing. I want 
                        a piece of paper that says that if 
                        I cooperate with you, you’ll get me 
                        out of here. I want you to deliver 
                        it to my attorney. Then we can 
                        discuss things further.

                                 AGENT BELL
                        Ricky, we can’t put anything in 
                        writing. That’s not how it works. 
                        But you have our word. You help us, 
                        and we’ll get you out of here. What 
                        other options do you have?

                                 AGENT TURNER
                        Revenge, Ricky. Jackson is the one 
                        that put you in this shithole.  
                        We’re giving you a chance to get 
                        even. 

           CAMERA pushes in on Ricky. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        I didn’t give a fuck about getting 
                        even. I gave a fuck about getting 
                        out of prison... Art Derrick had 
                        already been arrested by the FBI so 
                        I wasn’t worried about protecting 
                        anyone on the outside. 

           EXT. ART DERRICK’S MANSION - DAY

           Art Derrick stands on the edge of his diving board, poised 
           like an Olympian moments before his gold medal plunge. He 
           inhales through his graceless belly and stares across his 
           property at a full-frontal assault of FBI and DEA agents. The 
           force is large enough to invade a small country.   

           Unruffled, and maintaining his world class aplomb, Art 
           springs off the board and rises into a brilliant swan dive. 
           He swims underwater to the shallow end of the pool where he’s 
           greeted by the muzzles from a score of assault rifles.
                                 ART DERRICK
                        Could one of you handsome gentlemen 
                        please hand me my robe?

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        I called up Dawn and told her that 
                        she needed to come and see me.

           INT. MARQUETTE BRANCH PRISON, VISITATION ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Ricky sits in a cubicle speaking into a phone. Dawn sits on 
           the other side of the plexiglass listening to her brother.  

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        I need you to call Cathy for me.

                                 DAWN
                        Why? I hate that bitch. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        I know you do. But she hasn’t been 
                        accepting my calls lately. That’s 
                        why I need you to call her for me.

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        I explained what I was doing with 
                        the FBI and how they had promised, 
                        that if I cooperated, they would 
                        see to my release.  

           A devilish grin creeps over Dawn. Setting up Cathy? The 
           Detroit Police Department? She can taste the poetic justice.

           INT. MARQUETTE BRANCH PRISON, VISITATION ROOM - DAY

           Cathy now sits across from Ricky in the cubicle. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                         Thanks for coming, Cathy.

           Ice from Cathy. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE (CONT’D)
                        You look beautiful. I like your 
                        nails. Your hair looks fly.

           But the ice storm continues.

                                 RICKY WERSHE (CONT’D)
                        How have you been?

           After an excruciatingly long pause -- 
                                 CATHY VOLSAN
                        How the fuck you think I’ve been, 
                        Ricky? I’m broke. You and Johnny 
                        didn’t leave me nothing.

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        I know baby. And that’s why I had 
                        Dawn call you. So I could help you 
                        out. You see, I have a friend 
                        coming in from Miami. 

           Upon hearing the word “Miami” and seeing the emphasis in 
           Ricky’s eyes, Cathy’s expression thaws from arctic chill to 
           millionaire dreams of lush palm trees and pina coladas. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE (CONT’D)
                        That’s right, baby. A friend of 
                        mine from Miami. Miami, Florida. 
                        He’s coming to Detroit next week, 
                        and wants to meet with you and take 
                        you out to dinner. Dawn will fill 
                        you in on the details.   

           Cathy’s sudden emotional transfiguration from scorching wrath 
           to loving kitten is nothing short of miraculous.

                                 CATHY VOLSAN
                        You know I’ll do anything for you, 
                        Ricky. You know that, don’t you?

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        Yeah, me and any other dick with a 
                        fat bankroll. Cathy was a Great 
                        White Shark and the word Miami was 
                        a bucket of blood dumped in the 
                        water.

           INT. A FINE STEAKHOUSE - NIGHT

           Cathy and Dawn sit across from undercover FBI agent EDUARDO 
           DIAZ. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        My friend from Miami was FBI agent 
                        Eduardo Diaz, or as his parents 
                        lovingly named him: Michael Hill... 
                        Cathy and Eduardo hit it off just 
                        like I knew they would.  

                                 CATHY VOLSAN
                        Nobody is connected like I am in 
                        Detroit. Nobody. 
                                 EDUARDO DIAZ
                        Are you sure the police will 
                        cooperate? Are you certain they 
                        will protect my shipments of 
                        cocaine and cash into the city? 

                                 CATHY VOLSAN
                        Yes. It’s all about knowing the 
                        right people. In Detroit, money 
                        talks.     

                                 EDUARDO DIAZ
                        Wonderful. 
                             (to Dawn)
                        Dawn, thank you so much for 
                        introducing me to this lovely 
                        friend of yours.

           Cathy, eager to ingratiate herself, chimes in with an 
           embarrassing cliche.

                                 CATHY VOLSAN
                        A friend in need, is a friend 
                        indeed.

           Dawn wants to puke. But it’s going swimmingly.

           Eduardo kisses his fingers and throws the kiss to the air ---

                                 EDUARDO DIAZ
                        Aye carrumba.

           Cathy locks eyes with him and moves in for the kill.

                                 CATHY VOLSAN
                        Spanish is so romantic.

                                 EDUARDO DIAZ
                        It is the language of love.

           A chill runs down Cathy’s spine -- she’s hit the jackpot 
           again!

           EXT. DETROIT METROPOLITAN AIRPORT - DAY

           A private jet descends and lands on the tarmac.

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        The next time Eduardo flew into 
                        Detroit from Miami, Jackson and his 
                        crew were there to escort him and 
                        his shipment of drugs and money 
                        into the city.
           The private jet taxis and parks. Eduardo steps out and shakes 
           hands with Jackson, who is standing beside two Lincoln Town 
           Cars with three other men. They exchange the customary 
           introductions. 

                                 EDUARDO DIAZ
                        So all of these gentlemen here are 
                        police officers, no?

                                 OFFICER JACKSON
                        Detroit’s finest. It’s the safest 
                        way to get your shit in and out of 
                        the city. 

                                 EDUARDO DIAZ
                        Wonderful. Safety is very important 
                        to me.

           They unload duffel bags from the plane into the Town Cars and 
           leave the airport.

           INT. A MOTEL - LATER

           Eduardo pays Jackson fifty-thousand in cash. As Jackson 
           counts the money, Eduardo opens the mini-bar. 

                                 EDUARDO DIAZ
                        What do you say we celebrate our 
                        partnership with a cocktail, no? 

                                 OFFICER JACKSON
                        Let’s do it. I can feel that this 
                        is the beginning of something big. 

                                 EDUARDO DIAZ
                        Bueno. I’ll get us some ice.

           Eduardo steps outside the room and closes the door. 

           When the door reopens, FBI and DEA agents storm inside and 
           slam Jackson onto the bed and handcuff him. Agent Bell and 
           Agent Turner enter the room wearing party hats. 

                                 AGENT BELL
                        Surprise surprise.

                                 AGENT TURNER
                        Let’s get this party started!

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        Operation Backbone went on for 
                        almost a year, leading to the 
                        arrest of 11 of Detroit’s finest.
           A SERIES OF SHOTS as FBI and DEA agents round up corrupt 
           police officers throughout the city.

                                 RICKY WERSHE (V.O.)
                        An undercover agent even paid one 
                        of the cops to sneak a machine gun 
                        past airport security that was 
                        going to be used in a contract 
                        killing in Chicago. The agent said 
                        he did it just to see how dirty the 
                        cops really were. It was totally 
                        filthy. It was totally corrupt. It 
                        was totally Detroit.

           EXT. MARQUETTE BRANCH PRISON - DAY

           The grim dungeon brings us back with the title:

                                 ONE YEAR LATER

           INT. MARQUETTE BRANCH PRISON, VISITATION ROOM - DAY

           Ricky speaks with Dawn through the plexiglass. 

                                 DAWN
                        We only got a few more minutes. 
                        I’ll let Dad speak to you last. 

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        Thanks for coming, Dawn. I know 
                        it’s a real long trek up here. Stay 
                        sober.

                                 DAWN
                        One day at a time. I love you, 
                        Ricky.

           She kisses her hand and presses it against the plexiglass.

           Behind Dawn, Rick Sr. rises out of a flimsy plastic chair and 
           takes the receiver from her and sits down.

                                 RICKY WERSHE
                        Hey, Dad. Have you heard from the 
                        FBI about my case?

           Rick Sr. exhales and hangs his head. He appears to be 
           carrying a heavy burden these days. He looks likes he’s aged 
           a decade since we last saw him. 
           His hair has thinned considerably and the dark rings under 
           his eyes are consistent with someone stressed to the brink. 

                                 RICK SR.
                        No. I haven’t heard from any of 
                        them. I even posted up down at 
                        their office and waited all day. I 
                        think those bastards were 
                        reassigned or something.

           Ricky is nearly emotionless from the disappointing news. He 
           appears resigned to his bleak future. But he does his best to 
           maintain his composure in front of his dad who is clearly 
           having a tough time. 

                                 RICK SR. (CONT’D)
                        I’m afraid they left us high and 
                        dry again. 

           Another long pause. Rick Sr. continues to struggle with his 
           emotions. He can barely look his son in the eyes. 

                                 RICK SR. (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry, Ricky... I didn’t know 
                        what I was doing... I was supposed 
                        to protect you and teach you the 
                        right things. I let you down. I 
                        failed you as a father. I should be 
                        sitting where you are... Not you. 
                        You were just a kid... and I didn’t 
                        protect you.   

           The words are crushing. He’s never spoken this way before, 
           never really expressed his feelings with any sort of honesty 
           or depth. 

                                 RICK SR. (CONT’D)
                        But I won’t ever give up on you, 
                        Ricky. I’m gonna get you outta 
                        here.

           A GUARD yells to the room. 

                                 GUARD (O.S.)
                        Visiting time is over. You need to 
                        wrap it up.

                                 RICK SR.
                        I’m gonna get you outta here, 
                        Ricky. No matter what it costs. If 
                        it costs me my last dollar, my last 
                        ounce of strength. I won’t give up 
                        on you. 
                             (he’s falling apart)
                                 (MORE)
                                 RICK SR. (CONT'D)
                        You hear me? I’m gonna get you out 
                        of here, son. You hear me? I’m 
                        gonna get you out of here... Stay 
                        strong, son. Stay strong... You’ll 
                        be coming home soon.

           Rick Sr. can’t even hang up the phone. So Dawn leans forward  
           and hangs it up for him. 

           She helps her dad to his feet and they wave goodbye to Ricky 
           and walk toward the doorway behind them. 

           THE CAMERA moves with his family as Ricky watches them go 
           from behind the plexiglass -- Ricky grows smaller and smaller 
           until a large steel door slams shut on the visitation room 
           and he is gone.

                                 POSTSCRIPT
                        Richard Wershe Jr. has been 
                        incarcerated in the Michigan State 
                        Prison system since February 4th, 
                        1988. Despite the repeal of the 650 
                        Lifer Law, and the Supreme Court’s 
                        ruling that sentencing juveniles to 
                        life in prison for non-violent 
                        offenses is unconstitutional, he 
                        remains behind bars. He has never 
                        spent a day of his adult life as a 
                        free man.

                        Richard Wershe Sr. passed away in 
                        2014, his promise to his son 
                        unfulfilled. 

                                 POSTSCRIPT (CONT’D)
                        Most of the FBI agents involved 
                        with using Ricky Wershe as an 
                        underage informant are now 
                        comfortably retired, spending their 
                        day’s fishing and relaxing with 
                        their grandchildren. None of the 
                        agents involved were ever punished 
                        for this gross violation of federal 
                        policy.

                        Every single one of the Detroit 
                        cops convicted in Operation 
                        Backbone have been released from 
                        prison. They are all free men... 

                                                               THE END.
