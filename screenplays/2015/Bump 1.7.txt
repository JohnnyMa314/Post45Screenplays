           INT. DARKNESS - UNKNOWN

           The sound of muted voices steadily grows louder, closer. 

           The cold metallic CLUNKING of locks being undone. 

           Light bleeds in as a SLIDING DOOR retracts up into the 
           ceiling of- 

           INT. MEAT-TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

           From inside the truck we watch as TWO WORKERS unload 
           frozen boxes of PACKED MEAT. 

           INT. RESTAURANT KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Members of the KITCHEN STAFF open the boxes, revealing a 
           dozen different cuts of RAW BLOODY MEAT. 

           A SERIES of nauseating shots follow the meat through its 
           various stages of preparation. 

           First, the meat gets tenderized. The CHUNKY, SPLATTERING 
           sounds and subsequent BLOOD EXCRETIONS become more and 
           more unbearable with every swing of the MALLET. 

           Finally the meat is thrown onto the grill. We become 
           hyper-focused on the crackling, sizzling sound of flesh 
           being cooked. The fat DRIPPING onto the iron, turning 
           BLACK and BLISTERED. 

           INT. RESTAURANT KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           The cooked meat is plopped onto a clean, CERAMIC WHITE 
           PLATE. Blood continues to ooze from beneath the steak as 
           the rest of the dish is garnished with vegetables and a 
           light drizzle of sauces. 

           The plate is set on top of a steel counter, joining 
           dozens of other dishes as they await the final step of 
           their journey. 

           INT. RESTAURANT - MOMENTS LATER

           A WAITER, mid 20s, scrawny-type, carries the cooked meat 
           through a sea of tables. He arrives at his destination 
           and sets the plate down in front of a SHARPLY DRESSED 
           MAN.

           CONTINUED:

                                 WAITER
                        Here you are, sir. My apologies 
                        again for the misunderstanding. 

           The man looks up at the waiter. This is CLINT REED, early 
           50s, well built, square cut jaw and a tan that would 
           comfortably grace the cover of Fortune Magazine. 

           The waiter turns to leave but Clint raises his right hand 
           in the air as if beckoning a dog. 

                                 CLINT
                        Hold up there, cowboy.

           Clint is joined at the table by THOMAS O’MALLY, early 
           30’s, also sharply dressed but seemingly much more 
           amiable than his colleague.    

                                 CLINT (CONT’D)
                                (looking up at the 
                                 waiter)
                        What’s your name again?

                                 WAITER
                        --My name? 

           Clint stares at the waiter. Thomas looks down at his 
           plate, bracing for what he knows is coming.

                                 CLINT
                        Son, am I looking at you?

                                 WAITER
                        ...yes?

                                 CLINT
                                (pointing to Thomas)
                        Did I ask him a question?

                                 WAITER
                        No.

                                 CLINT
                        Did I ask you a question?

                                 WAITER
                        Yes.

                                 CLINT
                        Ah, so you DID hear me-   

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 WAITER
                        ...my name is Blake sir, is there 
                        a problem?

                                 CLINT
                        Yes, Blake. You see, the problem 
                        is that a ‘misunderstanding’ 
                        implies there was an error made by 
                        both parties involved. Now, when I 
                        order my steak medium rare and it 
                        shows up looking like the crew of 
                        the challenger shuttle, that’s 
                        called a mistake...not a 
                        misunderstanding. 

           Thomas quietly chokes on his water.

                                 CLINT (CONT’D)
                        Do you see the problem now, Blake?

                                 WAITER
                                (swallows his pride)
                        Yes, sir. 
                                (beat)
                        I apologize for the mistake. 

                                 CLINT
                        There’s a good boy. Now grab us 
                        another round of gin and tonics 
                        and some A1 sauce before I send 
                        this thing back again for being 
                        cold. 

           The waiter turns and retreats back towards the kitchen. 
           Clint looks at Thomas who would clearly rather be 
           elsewhere. He gives him a testosterone-fueled slap on the 
           shoulder. 

                                 CLINT (CONT’D)
                        Oh cheer up, O’Mally. You know I’m 
                        just fucking with the kid. 

           Clint grabs his cutlery and begins to cut into the bloody 
           steak. He devours it like a wild animal.

                                 THOMAS
                        Believe me sir, I know it all too 
                        well. 

                                 CLINT
                                (in between bites of 
                                 steak)

                        Thomas--when you started with us 
                        you were as green as that fucking 
                        brussels sprout there on your 
                        plate. But look at you now. 
                                (chews)
                        On the cusp of a life-changing 
                        opportunity. Pretty wife by your 
                        side. Brand new five-series parked 
                        out back... 

                                 THOMAS
                        Well, what can I say, sir, I learn 
                        from the best, right? 

           Clint stops eating. He stares at Thomas.

                                 CLINT
                        You’re a fucking boy-scout aren’t 
                        you O’Mally?

                                 THOMAS
                                (unsure)
                        ...I was when I was younger, but 
                        technically I never made it past 
                        Tenderfoot-

                                 CLINT
                        You always fucking say exactly 
                        what people want to hear. Whatever 
                        makes ‘em happy just comes 
                        galloping out of that perfect 
                        little mouth of yours.

                                 THOMAS
                        I’m...not sure I follow, sir. 

                                 CLINT
                        Let me give you some advice, son. 
                        From where I’m sittin’ this 
                        promotion is down to you and that 
                        ass, Dick Stevens-

                        Rick Stevens-

                                 CLINT
                        Sure. Either way, I never liked 
                        the son of a bitch--but he has 
                        managed to consistently impress 
                        other members of the board.

                        Yes...he does have an impeccable 
                        track record. 

                                 CLINT
                        He’s a douchebag, O’Mally. If I 
                        had my way I’d make you partner 
                        right here, right now.  

           Thomas is visibly moved by this comment.

                                 THOMAS
                        I appreciate that, sir. You have 
                        no idea how much that means to me- 

           Clint drops his steak-knife which hits the plate with a 
           loud CLANG!

                                 CLINT
                        That’s my point right there, son. 
                        This ain’t the minor leagues 
                        anymore. You can’t go around being 
                        everyone’s best friend, always 
                        saying the right things-- 

           Clint picks up his drink and finishes it off. Thomas 
           casually tries to match Clint’s pace as he listens.

                                 CLINT (CONT’D)
                        --these people will chew you up 
                        and spit you right back out before 
                        you even know which hole they 
                        fucked you from. 

           Thomas’ eyes go slightly wide. He watches as Clint picks 
           up his knife and resumes hacking away at his steak. 

                                 CLINT (CONT’D)
                        These folk ain’t people anymore 
                        Thomas, they’re wolves. They are 
                        primal, savage and depraved 
                        creatures...and the only other 
                        beast that can go toe to toe with 
                        them day after day, year after 
                        year is another wolf. 

           Thomas is getting lost in the blood-bath taking place on 
           Clint’s plate. 

                                 CLINT (CONT’D)
                        Do you understand what I’m getting 
                        at here?

           CONTINUED: (5)

           Thomas’ attention snaps back to Clint.

                                 THOMAS
                        I do, sir. I can be a wolf. I know 
                        I can.  

           The waiter returns and puts two fresh GIN AND TONICS down 
           on the table and retrieves the empty glasses. 

                                 CLINT
                        Thomas, I’ve put in my decision 
                        with the board and I’ve said all I 
                        can to persuade them that you can 
                        be the man this firm needs right 
                        now.  

                                 THOMAS
                        I am that man, sir. 

                                 CLINT
                        I hope so, son. Because--and you 
                        didn’t hear this from me--but as 
                        long as you sack up and don’t fuck 
                        up...this race is yours to lose.  

           Thomas can hardly contain himself. 

                                 THOMAS
                        Sir, I--I don’t know what to say. 

                                 CLINT
                        Don’t say anything, Thomas. DO. 
                        Prove me right. Make me proud and 
                        I promise you, your life will 
                        change in ways you can’t even 
                        begin to imagine. Sound fair?

           Clint picks up his gin and tonic and motions for Thomas 
           to do the same. Thomas quickly grabs his. 

                                 THOMAS
                        I won’t let you down.

           Clint beams the million-dollar smile at him. 

           The two clink their glasses together and begin to drink. 
           Thomas watches as Clint downs his drink in ONE FELL 
           SWOOP. He struggles to keep up but just manages to finish 
           his as well. 

           The two SLAM the empty glasses onto the table and we-

                                                             SMASH-CUT TO:
           EXT. RESTAURANT - LATER

           Thomas and Clint wait by the valet-stand outside. Thomas 
           is animatedly finishing up a joke, he seems a little 
           tipsy. 

                                 THOMAS
                        So he takes a bite of the apple 
                        and he goes “oh my god, this 
                        tastes like crap!” and the 
                        bartender says “turn it around”! 

           Thomas laughs hysterically but Clint just offers a smug 
           grin. He takes out a cigar and begins to light it. 

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                        Because...you know the other side 
                        would’ve tasted like-

                                 CLINT
                        Pussy.

                                 THOMAS
                        Yeah, exactly... 

           Clint sucks in air through the cigar. The embers on the 
           front glow bright, filling his eyes with a menacing 
           orange glare. Smoke swirls around Clint as he stares at 
           Thomas.  

                                 CLINT
                        That’s a hell of a joke, O’Mally. 

                                 THOMAS
                        Thank you, sir. 

           Clint moves through the thick web of smoke till he is 
           almost face to face with Thomas. 

                                 CLINT
                        Don’t forget what I told you, son. 
                        About the wolf. 

                                 THOMAS
                        Of course not, I couldn’t even if 
                        I tried. Not that I would try- 

           Clint grabs Thomas’ shoulders firmly with both hands. His 
           voice suddenly drops to an uncomfortably low register as 
           he speaks. He sounds like a man possessed.

                                 CLINT
                        Tonight will be the night of your 
                        transformation, Thomas. Like the 
                        fables of old, under the full moon 
                        you will become a creature, a 
                        monster drunk with newfound 
                        desire. When I see you tomorrow I 
                        won’t even recognize you. Your 
                        eyes will be like those of a 
                        newborn child, baptized in the 
                        blood of a man you once were. This 
                        is the decision all great men must 
                        make. To cross these sacred 
                        waters...you must pay the boatman 
                        his toll.     

           Thomas stares at his boss, eyes and mouth wide open. He 
           tries to formulate a response but before he can the VALET 
           arrives with Clint’s car. 

           Clint smiles and lets go of Thomas. He gives him a slap 
           on the back as he turns towards his large BLACK SUV. 

                                 CLINT (CONT’D)
                        Good chat. Say hello to Karen for 
                        me. 

           Clint gets in the car and speeds off. Thomas just stares 
           at the SUV as it drives off into the night.

           Moments later the valet pulls up in Thomas’ new, WHITE 
           FIVE-SERIES BMW.  

           The valet exits the car and approaches Thomas. 

                                 VALET
                        Here you are, sir. 

           Thomas is miles away, still mystified by the end of his 
           conversation with Clint. 

                                 VALET (CONT’D)
                        Sir?

           Thomas snaps back to reality. 

                                 THOMAS
                        Oh, yes. Thank you. 

           He clumsily searches his jacket for his wallet. He takes 
           it out and starts fumbling through the small bills. 

           The valet can smell the alcohol on Thomas’ breath. 

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 VALET
                        Sir, I don’t want to be rude or 
                        imply anything here...but if I 
                        were you, I would stay off the 
                        main highway. Maybe try sticking 
                        to the back roads... 

           Thomas sees what the valet is getting after. 

                                 THOMAS
                        I’m fine, I only had a couple of 
                        drinks... 

           The valet stares at Thomas. 

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                        ...and I’ll stick to the back 
                        roads. Thank you. 

           He slaps a wad of dollar bills in the valet’s hand and 
           gets in his car. 

           The valet watches as Thomas’ exits the parking lot. A 
           FULL MOON shines high above the clouds. 

           INT/EXT. THOMAS’ CAR - NIGHT

           The white BMW shoots down the highway. It is the only car 
           on the road for miles. 

           Thomas bounces up and down in his seat, full of 
           intoxicated swagger. His blue-tooth system dials away at 
           a number labeled: HOME.

                                 THOMAS
                        C’mon baby, pick up...

           The line continues to ring until finally-

                        I’ll be home in just a little bit--

           Thomas hangs up. He eyes himself in the rear view mirror.

                                 THOMAS
                        You, Thomas O’Mally are a wolf. 
                        Just look how far you’ve come. You 
                        brought us here, you. It doesn’t 
                        get a whole better than this... 
                        just soak it in. Soak it all- 

           Suddenly, “Bohemian Rhapsody” by QUEEN comes on over the 
           radio.

                                 RADIO (O.S.)
                        Is this the real life?

                        Oh god, it DOES get a whole lot 
                        better- 

           Freddie Mercury’s voice gently serenades Thomas. He turns 
           up the volume.

                                 RADIO
                        Is this just fantasy?

                        from reality-

           He rolls down the front windows and lets the cool night 
           air rush in.

           Thomas hands off the invisible microphone to Freddie-

                        really maaaatter to meee...

           He taps the steering wheel along to the gentle piano, 
           getting more and more into it. 

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                                (singing)
                        Momma, just killed a man. Put a 
                        gun against his head, pulled my 
                        trigger...now he’s dead. 

           As the lyrics swell towards the big hit Thomas throws his 
           head back and sings at the top of his lungs.

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                                (singing)
                        Momma, life had juuuust begun, BUT 
                        NOW I’VE GONE AND THROWN IT ALLLLL 
                        AWAYYYY!

           Suddenly a MAN steps out into the road DIRECTLY IN FRONT 
           OF THOMAS’ CAR. His arms are waving about wildly in an 
           attempt to slow the oncoming vehicle.  

           Thomas looks down and sees him-

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                        JESUS CHRIST!-

           But it’s too late. The car SMASHES into the man at FULL 
           SPEED. His body WHIPLASHES VIOLENTLY ONTO THE HOOD. 

           Thomas SLAMS on the brakes sending the body FLAILING LIKE 
           A RAG-DOLL onto the asphalt.  

           The ceramic brakes bring the car to an efficient and 
           screeching halt.

           CONTINUED: (3)

           Thomas sits absolutely frozen in the driver seat, his 
           eyes locked on the dark road in front of him. 

                                 RADIO (O.S.)
                        Too late, my time has come... sent 
                        shivers down my spine, body’s 
                        aching all the time-

           Thomas quickly switches off the radio. A SINGLE DROPLET 
           OF BLOOD slides down the windshield into view.  

           Thomas opens the door and steps out. The edge of his 
           headlights faintly outline a BODY lying ever so still in 
           the road. 

           Thomas covers his mouth in shock, still too stunned to 
           fully leave the safety of his car.

                                 THOMAS
                                (weakly)
                        Uh, hello? Sir?

           The man offers no response. Thomas clears his throat. 

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                        Sir? Are you all right?

           Silence. 

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                                (whimpering)
                        ...Jesus fucking Christ- 

           Thomas bites down on his fist and begins the long 
           approach to the body, one shaky step at a time.  

           Based on the OLD AND TORN CLOTHING, the LONG UNKEMPT HAIR 
           and FRAZZLED BEARD, the man appears to have been a 
           TRANSIENT, a nobody. 

           The manner in which his limbs are twisted and mangled 
           answers the only question that matters in this type of 
           situation: The man is most definitely DEAD.

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                        Oh god. No, no, you’re not dead. 
                        You’re not dead. You’re not 
                        fucking dea-

           Thomas nudges the body with his foot but the man’s bloody 
           and severed neck FLOPS into a disgusting, contorted 
           position.

                        Jesus FUCKING Christ! 

           Thomas starts hyperventilating, he paces back and forth 
           around the body. 

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                                (shouting at the 
                                 body)
                        Why the fuck were you in the 
                        middle of the road?! What the hell 
                        were you doing?!

           Thomas’ voice is echoing off in the distance. He quickly 
           looks around, moving like a paranoid schizophrenic. Not a 
           soul in sight. It’s just him and his conscience.  

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                        Oh my god. What have I done? What 
                        the hell have I done-

           Suddenly his stomach lurches, he runs over to the side of 
           the road and VOMITS. 

           After the last recognizable chunks of his dinner splash 
           onto the ground, Thomas takes out his phone and begins to 
           tap in the numbers 9-1-1...but then he stops. 

           His thumb hovers, locked in place over the CALL button on 
           the screen, as if having developed a mind of its own.  

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                        Get a hold of yourself, Thomas. 
                        Think about what you’re doing

                        years...at best.

           His thumb begins to tremble. He grits his teeth in agony. 
           The veins on his forehead look like they’re about to 
           explode. 

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                        FUCK!

           He slams his phone onto the ground. He turns back to look 
           at the corpse. His hand covers his mouth, gripping the 
           flesh tightly, as if trying to stifle the thought that is 
           now spreading like a virus through his mind.

           But it has already become an infection.   

           Thomas once again approaches the body. He stands looking 
           down into the man’s vacant eyes. The wind picks up around 
           him.

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                                (quietly weeping)
                        Oh Christ...I’m sorry. Please 
                        forgive me. 

           He kneels down and begins to wrap his arms around the 
           body. He grabs it from beneath the arms and drags the 
           corpse quickly to the back of his car. 

           As Thomas opens the trunk, the wind picks up and a 
           familiar voice begins to whisper through his thoughts. 

                                 CLINT (V.O.)
                        Tonight will be the night of your 
                        transformation-

           Thomas tries to shake it off as he starts to lift the 
           body in.   

                                 THOMAS
                        Nope-

                                 CLINT (V.O.)
                        Like the fables of old, under the 
                        full moon you will become a 
                        creature, a monster-

                                 THOMAS
                        I’m not listening-

           Thomas manages to get the body over the lip of the trunk. 
           He nearly falls in trying to shove the rest inside. 

           He quickly walks to the front of the car. Most of the 
           grill seems in tact except for his driver-side headlight, 
           which is shattered and splashed with blood. 

           Thomas combs the area in front of his car and gathers any 
           scrap pieces of plastic or glass lying around. He throws 
           them all into the trunk.

           He looks down at the corpse now shoved into the back of 
           his car.

                                 CLINT (V.O.)
                        This is the decision all great men 
                        must make.

                        To cross these sacred waters, you 
                        must pay the boatman his toll...

           The man’s empty eyes still stare at Thomas. He grabs a 
           rag from one of the compartments and covers the man’s 
           face.

           Thomas shuts the trunk. A WHITE LIGHT reflects brightly 
           off the car. Thomas turns and looks up above him at its 
           source: the FULL MOON. 

           He quickly breaks his gaze and gets into the car. 

                                                                  CUT TO:

           EXT. THOMAS’ HOUSE - NIGHT

           Thomas’ car slowly creeps through the quiet houses in his 
           neighborhood. He brings the car to a stop along the curb 
           outside of his home.  

           Thomas kills the engine and sits quietly in the driver 
           seat. The lights are still on in the bedroom window and 
           down in the kitchen.

           Thomas spots the faint outline of a person walking around 
           in the bedroom. 

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                                (nervous)
                        Ok, just get your story 
                        straight...get your story 
                        straight...

           As Thomas thinks we-

                                                                  CUT TO:

           INT/EXT. THOMAS’ GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER

           Thomas pulls the car into the garage. He gets out and 
           walks around to the back, checking to make sure nothing 
           looks too out of the ordinary.  

                                 KAREN (O.S.)
                                (from inside the 
                                 house)
                        Thomas?

           Thomas quickly snaps out of it.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 THOMAS
                        Yeah, be right there-

           He closes the garage and walks towards the door leading 
           into the house. He pauses in front of it for a moment, 
           takes a deep breath, and opens it.  

           INT. THOMAS’ HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Thomas steps into the house.

                                 THOMAS
                        Hey you-

           He looks around for Karen but she is nowhere to be found. 
           Thomas moves quickly into the kitchen. 

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                        -Karen?

                                 KAREN (O.S.)
                        Thomas? Is that you?

           Karen’s voice echoes from upstairs.  

                                 THOMAS
                        Yeah, baby, it’s me-

                                 KAREN (O.S.)
                        What happened? I thought you were 
                        supposed to call me when you and 
                        Clint were done with dinner-

                                 THOMAS
                        I did, did you not get my message?

                                 KAREN (O.S.)
                        I must’ve been in the shower, 
                        sorry baby. How’d it go??

           Thomas starts opening different cabinets under the sink, 
           looking for anything he may need for the task awaiting 
           him back in the garage.

                                 THOMAS
                        It went fine. Listen, something 
                        happened on th--where are you?

                                 KAREN (O.S.)
                        I’m in the bathroom, sorry! This 
                        tea I made is making me pee every 
                        thirty seconds-

           CONTINUED:

           Karen’s footsteps can be heard moving around upstairs all 
           over the bedroom, Thomas is too busy gathering trash bags 
           to notice. 

                                 THOMAS
                        OK. Well--listen, something 
                        happened to me on the way home.

                                 KAREN (O.S.)
                        What? What are you talking about? 
                        Is everything okay? 

                                 THOMAS
                                (still grabbing bags)
                        Yeah, everything’s fine, it’s just-
                        -I uh--

           Karen finally comes downstairs and immediately sees the 
           one thing Thomas failed to remember.

                                 KAREN
                        OH MY GOD, THOMAS, WHY ARE YOU 
                        COVERED IN BLOOD?!

           Thomas stops gathering garbage bags and looks down. His 
           suit and white shirt are COVERED in DIRT and BLOOD. He 
           looks like he just stepped out of the opening scene of 
           GOODFELLAS. 

                                 THOMAS
                        Oh. Fuck.

                                 KAREN
                        Is this your blood?! Are you 
                        hurt??

                                 THOMAS
                        What? No, baby that’s what I’m 
                        trying to tell you.
                                (beat)
                        Why were you just running around 
                        upstairs? 

                                 KAREN
                                (getting angry)
                        I told you, I just got out of the 
                        shower--DON’T try and change the 
                        subject! What the hell is going 
                        on? And what are you doing with 
                        all these bags??

           Thomas realizes how ridiculous he looks. He stops and 
           takes a deep breath.

                        Stacy, isn’t it? I knew she was a

                        know, Dr. Tannenbaum taught me all 
                        about this at our last session, 
                        it’s called deflection. Maybe if

           Thomas’ distress finally stops her all out assault for a

                        This has nothing to do with you or

                                 KAREN
                        Oh yeah? If you “hit a coyote” 
                        then why are you covered in blood? 

           Thomas has nothing.

                        Answer me, Thomas.

           His mouth mimics the scattered thoughts pacing through 
           his head, weighing his options.

                        dead coyote back here??

                                 THOMAS
                        Because it had a--a thing on its 
                        neck-

           Thomas mimes a collar around his own neck.

                                 KAREN
                        A...collar?

                                 THOMAS
                        Yeah, a collar-

                                 KAREN
                        It had a collar on its neck??

                                 THOMAS
                        Yes-

                                 KAREN
                        -Who the FUCK has a pet coyote, 
                        Thomas??

                                 THOMAS
                        I don’t know, I felt bad! I 
                        thought the least I could do would 
                        be to--take it back to them--you 
                        know? In case they wanted to give 
                        it a proper burial or something...

           Karen’s eyes are ice. 

                                 KAREN
                        Are you fucking kidding me right 
                        now?

                                 THOMAS
                        Karen, I know this sounds 
                        ridiculous-

                                 KAREN
                        This happens every time you go out 
                        with Clint! Why do you let him do 
                        this to you? You have to stick up 
                        for yourself Thomas, you’re a 
                        grown man, not a boy!

                                 THOMAS
                        I know, baby, I’m sorry but I need 
                        you to listen to me right now-

                        Don’t baby me now, Thomas. Now is 
                        literally the WORST time for baby-

           Thomas grabs her firmly by the shoulders. 

                                 THOMAS
                        Karen, listen to me very 
                        carefully. I know what this seems 
                        like, but no matter what you think 
                        is going on here, or how angry you 
                        are with me...I need you to 
                        promise me that you will not go 
                        into the garage tonight. 

           Thomas’ change in mood finally breaks through to Karen.

                                 KAREN
                        ...Thomas, you’re scaring me.

                                 THOMAS
                        Do you love me?

                                 KAREN
                                (starting to tear up)
                        What? Of course I love you.

                                 THOMAS
                        Do you trust me?

                                 KAREN
                        ...yes.

                                 THOMAS
                        Then please, don’t go in there 
                        tonight. Promise me. 

           A beat.

                                 KAREN
                        Okay. I promise. 

                                 THOMAS
                                (walking her over to 
                                 the stairs)
                        Good. Everything is going to be 
                        fine, I swear.
                                (kisses her on the 
                                 forehead)
                        Now go upstairs, get into bed and 
                        put on House of Cards or 
                        something, okay?

           Karen pauses at the bottom of the stairs. 

                                 KAREN
                        Okay...

                                 THOMAS
                        I love you.

                                 KAREN
                        I love you too. 

           Karen watches Thomas as he swiftly turns and heads for 
           the garage. She watches him all the way till he gets to 
           the door, he enters and closes the door firmly behind 
           him. 

           As soon as the door shuts, Karen BOLTS up the stairs and 
           up towards the bedroom. 

           INT. GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

           Thomas locks the door behind him and collapses against 
           it. He lets out a deep sigh-

                                 THOMAS
                                (relieved)
                        Jesus Christ...

           INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Karen BURSTS into the bedroom and slams the door behind 
           her. 

                                 KAREN 
                                (distraught)

                                (beat)
                        Rick!

           Karen looks out into the empty bedroom. 

                                 KAREN (CONT’D)
                                (loudly whispering)
                        RICK! Where the hell are you?

           A voice loudly whispers back from under the bed-

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Down here-

           CONTINUED:

           Karen looks under the bed and sees RICK STEVENS hiding 
           while struggling to get his pants back on. 

                                 KAREN
                        Are you fucking crazy? Get out 
                        here, now!

           Rick crawls out from under the bed. He zips up his pants 
           and grabs his jacket. 

                                 KAREN (CONT’D)
                        In all that time the best place 
                        you could think of to hide was 
                        under the god damn bed??

                                 RICK
                        Hey, if I’m not getting any 
                        tonight I should at least get to 
                        listen-

           Karen shoves him, disgusted. 

                                 KAREN
                        You’re fucking unbelievable! You 
                        need to get out of here right now-

           Karen starts pushing him towards the window. 

                                 RICK
                        What’s going on? Did he sound 
                        suspicious?

                                 KAREN
                                (while pushing Rick)
                        I have no idea, something about a 
                        dead coyote in his trunk--just use 
                        the back gate-

           Rick starts climbing out the window. 

                                 RICK
                        Coyote. Interesting. Wait...did he 
                        say anything about his dinner with 
                        Clint?

           Karen SLAMS the window on him.

                                                                  CUT TO:
           INT. GARAGE - NIGHT

           A SERIES OF SHOTS follow Thomas as he turns his garage 
           upside down. 

           -He clears a large space, moving boxes and clutter around 
           to the outside edges of the garage. 

           -Thomas searches through different boxes for items that 
           will be of use in the all important next step. 

           -He gathers the miscellaneous pieces on a beautiful brand 
           new LARGE WOODEN WORKSTATION.   

           -Duct tape

           -Plastic wrap

           -Garbage bags 

           -Gloves

           -Safety Glasses

           -Dust masks

           -Thomas begins duct-taping black garbage bags over all 
           the windows in the garage. 

           -He cuts open DOZENS of garbage bags, spreads them out 
           all over the floor and drapes them over the shelves 
           trying to cover as much surface area as possible. 

           -He uses the remaining garbage bags to construct a 
           makeshift HAZMAT SUIT for himself. 

                                                                  CUT TO:

           INT. GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER

           Thomas stands behind the trunk of his car covered head to 
           toe in his garbage suit. He looks absolutely ridiculous. 

           He opens the trunk and looks down at the body. The man’s 
           face is still covered by the bloody rag Thomas threw on 
           it. The stench works it’s way up.

                                 THOMAS
                                (covering his mouth 
                                 and nose)
                        Ah, Christ-

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Thomas takes a deep breath and then begins to lift the 
           corpse out of the trunk. The man’s limbs flop and flail 
           out of Thomas’ grasp.

           He manages to awkwardly drag the body over to the open 
           space in the garage, which is now covered in a variety of 
           garbage bags and assorted plastic wrappings. It all looks 
           as absurd as he does. 

                                 THOMAS
                        Okay. First things first...we do a 
                        quick sweep of the body.

           Thomas gets down on his knees and begins to fish through 
           the man’s jacket and pants. He finds nothing but random 
           junk, some candy wrappers and spare change. 

           Then in the last pocket of the man’s jacket, Thomas feels 
           something. He pulls out a cracked CELL PHONE. 

           He looks back down at the man.

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                        ...why would you have a cell 
                        phone?

           He tries to power it on but it too appears to have lost 
           its life in the accident. He cautiously sets it aside. 

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                        Now the clothes-

           Thomas shakily begins to undress the man. He puts each 
           article of clothing into a separate garbage bag, 
           eventually stripping the man down to his underwear. 

           Next, he grabs a BLACK SHARPIE from his workstation. He 
           removes the cap, his hand holding the pen the same way a 
           child would unwittingly wield a knife.

           He drops down on the body, his hand struggles to bring 
           the felt tip to touch the cold, pale skin. Slowly he 
           makes contact, it is unnerving to watch as he begins to 
           crudely draws LINES along the intersections of the limbs.

           A few moments into it Thomas jerks his hand back, 
           disgusted with himself. He steps back and stares at the 
           bare body. His eyes grow red as he fights against a 
           complete collapse. 

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                        This is insane. This is fucking 
                        insane. I can’t do this.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

           Thomas turns and heads for the door leading back into the 
           house. He opens it and walks in, garbage suit and all. 

           The door closes behind him. After a few beats the door 
           opens and Thomas walks back in wielding a BOTTLE OF 
           BOURBON in his hand. 

           Thomas again stands over the body, forcing himself to 
           stare at it. He starts getting worked up. He shakily 
           unscrews the cap to the bourbon and takes a deep breath. 

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                        I can’t fucking do this- 

           He quickly lifts the bottle to his lips and starts 
           CHUGGING. After a painful amount he comes up for air. His 
           eyes are red and wet from the effort. 

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                                (gasping)
                        GAHH--I can’t...fucking...do this-

           He forces the bottle on himself again. This begins to 
           visually resemble a disturbing act of religious self-
           flagellation.   

           After an almost inhuman amount of time he rips the bottle 
           away from his lips, drooling all over the floor.

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                                (gagging)
                        I can’t--I can’t-

           He brings the bottle to his mouth again, this time 
           FINISHING every last drop. 

           He lets out a primal SCREAM and turns to throw the bottle 
           against the wall. 

           INT. THOMAS’ HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Karen sits in bed watching TV. She hears Thomas’ muffled 
           scream from down below followed by a loud THUNK!

           She covers her ears and slowly sinks beneath the covers. 

           INT. GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

           Downstairs, Thomas continues his rampage. Every heavy 
           breath is mixed with loud grunts and cries as he rides 
           the wave of adrenaline.  

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Thomas gets up and stumbles over to the brand new HOT-ROD 
           RED METALLIC TOOL CABINET. 

           He rips it open, grunting and moaning with each motion 
           now. Inside is a large shiny set of UNUSED TOOLS. Thomas 
           sees a big BIRTHDAY CARD still sitting on the middle 
           shelf.  

           He lets out another hysterical cry as he opens the card, 
           which reads: “To the best man a lucky girl like me could 
           ever ask for. Let’s build our new life together. I love 
           you so much - Karen” 

           Now Thomas’ drunken howls descend into full-bore WEEPING. 
           He tosses the card aside and stares at the beautiful 
           untarnished tools.  

           As he continues to sob he grabs an immaculate RED 
           ELECTRIC HANDSAW and plugs it into a nearby power strip.   

           Thomas drops to his knees in front of the body and turns 
           on the saw. It awakens violently with a high-pitched 
           whir, which only manages to slightly dampen Thomas’ 
           weeping. 

           In the heat of the moment, Thomas descends on the body 
           with the saw without putting on his safety goggles. 

           The first SPURT OF BLOOD sprays all over Thomas as the 
           blades make contact with the cold flesh, but he’s too far 
           gone to notice or care. 

           The FLUORESCENT LIGHTS above THOMAS begin to FLICKER on 
           and off creating an almost strobe-like effect on the 
           scene.  

           As the frames flicker in and out of darkness we witness a 
           hyper stylized sequence of images of Thomas as he 
           continues to scream and cry with every new incision of 
           the saw. 

           -Blood sprays all over the garage. 

           -Flesh tears from bone. 

           -Steel blades digging into the chest cavity.  

                                                                  CUT TO:
           EXT. THOMAS’ HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           A quick wide shot from the quiet neighborhood outside. 
           From across the street we see the lights flickering in 
           Thomas’ garage as his muffled, hysterical cries dissipate 
           into the dark night.  

                                                                 BACK TO:

           INT. THOMAS’ GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

           A small BROCHURE hangs on one of the new tools in the 
           cabinet. It depicts a burly, all-American man handsomely 
           sawing a piece of wood. The image is SPLATTERED and 
           DRIPPING with BLOOD. 

           Thomas collapses back against the cabinet. The lights 
           above cease their flickering.   

           He looks down at the brutal aftermath of his work, 
           catching his breath as the adrenaline slowly subsides. 

           Though the work is visually abominable, the body has been 
           effectively cut into manageable sized pieces. 

           He gathers himself and then begins to crawl on his hands 
           and knees towards the carcass. 

           His eyes glaze over, desensitized. Whatever conscience he 
           had before now lies lost somewhere amongst the bloody 
           debris covering his garage floor.   

           He drags over a large cardboard box lined with garbage 
           bags on the inside and begins packing the body parts into 
           the box.  

           Thomas gets to the lower abdominal section of the body 
           which has been cut in half. As he removes the first 
           section he notices SOMETHING UNUSUAL dangling out of the 
           body. 

           He moves the bloody flesh aside to reveal what looks like 
           a PIECE OF STRING leading into the abdomen. 

           Thomas stares at the string, deciding whether or not he 
           wants to know what it could possibly lead to.  

           But he does want to know. He needs to know. Maybe it 
           won’t lead to anything. Maybe the crazy fucking hobo ate 
           a piece of fucking string. Crazier things have happened. 

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           He begins to pull on it. Every millimeter that comes 
           gliding out of the flesh sounds like nails on a 
           chalkboard. 

                                 THOMAS
                        Oh my god...

           Thomas continues to pull, string continues to emerge. Now 
           it’s like pulling teeth. 

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                        Oh my GOD...

           There’s enough string now to require a two hand approach. 

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                        OH MY GOD- 

           Finally the string comes to a TIGHT STOP. There’s 
           something BIGGER caught on the other end. 

           Thomas pulls harder, he starts to see what looks like a 
           plastic bag beginning to crown through the flesh. 

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                                (as he continues to 
                                 pull)
                        Oh no. No, no no no no-

           The plastic bag continues to come out, it is 
           uncomfortably large. 

           Finally the string gives way. Thomas slowly brings the 
           end up to his face to see a LARGE BRICK-LIKE PLASTIC 
           BAGGIE packed SOLID with BLUE POWDER inside. 

           The bag slowly begins to spin around on the string. The 
           back of the bag comes into view revealing a SMALL BLACK 
           DEVICE buried inside the powder. 

           A little RED LIGHT blinks brightly through the plastic. 

           Thomas’ eyes go WIDE-   

           INT. THOMAS’ HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Karen SNAPS AWAKE as she hears an insane MUFFLED SCREAM 
           from below.
           INT. THOMAS’ GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

           Thomas drops the bag on the ground and backs away in 
           horror. 

                                 THOMAS
                        You’re a--you’re a fucking mule..I 
                        killed a fucking drug mule??

           Thomas now looks back to the man’s BROKEN CELL PHONE 
           sitting where he left it atop his work station. 

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                        This can’t--this can’t be fucking 
                        happening! 

           Suddenly Thomas hears TIRES SQUEALING outside. His eyes 
           go wide as he looks down at the DEVICE inside the baggie. 
           The RED LIGHT continues to blink rapidly. 

           Thomas darts over to the window, he quickly TEARS THROUGH 
           one of the garbage bags and looks out to the street.  

           A BLACK SUV SWERVES into view and drives straight down 
           the street towards Thomas’ house.  

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                        Oh SHIT-

           Just before the car gets to Thomas’ curb it makes a WILD 
           TURN and parks in the driveway ACROSS THE STREET. Without 
           the headlights blinding his vision, Thomas recognizes the 
           car as the driver exits the vehicle. This is PHIL, 30s, 
           his NEIGHBOR.  

           Thomas gushes a huge sigh of relief. 

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                        Oh, thank god-

                                 KAREN (O.S.)
                                (from inside the 
                                 house)
                        Tom?

           Thomas looks to the garage door. He can hear his wife’s 
           footsteps coming down the stairs inside. 

           He rushes towards the door as the KNOB BEGINS TO TURN. He 
           throws his entire body at it and just manages to grab the 
           doorknob and slam it shut. 

                                                               (CONTINUED)

                        Tom, what’s going on in there? I 
                        heard screaming-

                                 THOMAS
                        No, everything’s fine! 

           He LOCKS the deadbolt. 

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                        Go back upstairs, baby! I gotta 
                        run out real quick, I’ll be back 
                        soon!

                                 KAREN
                        What?? Thomas, where the hell are 
                        you going right now?? It’s almost 
                        one in the morning!

           Thomas starts ripping off his garbage suit. He rapidly 
           grabs all the remaining body parts lying on the floor and 
           dumps them in the cardboard box. 

           Karen is BANGING on the door now. The commotion makes it 
           hard for Thomas to concentrate as he awkwardly lifts the 
           box and places it in the trunk. 

                                 KAREN (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Thomas, answer me right now! 

           Thomas runs back to make sure nothing has been left 
           behind. The only thing now lying on the garage floor is 
           the plastic bag full of drugs and the tracking device, 
           which continues to blink rapidly like a ticking time 
           bomb. 

           Thomas grabs the bag and the man’s broken cell phone. 

                                 THOMAS
                        I have to do this, Karen, I’m 
                        sorry!  

                                 KAREN (O.S.)
                        Thomas!

           Thomas opens the baggie and gently removes the TRACKING 
           DEVICE. He ties the bag off and walks over to his car, 
           moving like a man on a mission. 

           He tosses the tracking device into the passenger seat and 
           throws the cell phone and bag into the trunk on top of 
           the body parts

                        Thomas! You can’t just leave me 
                        like this!

           Thomas gets in the driver seat and shuts the door. He 
           starts the engine and opens the garage. He rolls down the 
           window and leans his head out.  

                                 THOMAS
                        I love you, baby!

           INT/EXT. THOMAS’ HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           The car flies out of the garage in reverse and out onto 
           the street. 

           Thomas shifts the gear into drive and slams his foot on 
           the accelerator but looks up and sees his NEIGHBOR, PHIL 
           standing DIRECTLY in front of his car with his hands 
           outstretched. 

                                 THOMAS
                        AHHH!

           Thomas slams on the brakes stopping a few feet in front 
           of Phil. 

           He opens the door and steps halfway out the car. 

                                 PHIL
                        Jesus, Tom, you trying to kill me 
                        or something?

                                 THOMAS
                        Phil, what the hell are you doing

                        --get out of the street please?

                        I’ve given that woman everything. 
                        I’ve put on this god damn suit 
                        every day for twenty years, I’ve 
                        taken out a second mortgage for 
                        this fucking house. I spend my 
                        days feeling like I might drop 
                        dead any second from some massive, 
                        stress-induced aneurysm. I’ve been 
                        on eight different paleo grass-fed 
                        anal-bursting diets but--it just 
                        isn’t enough...it’ll never be 
                        enough.

                        I can’t do it anymore, Tom...I 
                        just can’t...

                        Phil, you’re drunk. Go home.

                        No. No, you don’t understand. I 
                        need to talk to someone about this 
                        right now. I feel like my head is 
                        going to explode like a freaking 
                        watermelon if I don’t do something 
                        about this-

                                 THOMAS
                        PHIL. I cannot help you right now. 
                        I need you to go inside and-  

           Phil suddenly bends over and VOMITS all over the hood of 
           Thomas’ car. 

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                        Oh, for fucks sake!

           Thomas walks around to the front of the car where Phil is 
           keeled over. Suddenly a dark object FALLS OUT of Phil’s 
           jacket and hits the floor with a loud metallic CLANK! 

                                                               (CONTINUED)

                        I’m sorry, Tom. I shouldn’t have 
                        done that. I know you just bought 
                        the damn thing--I just didn’t want 
                        you to leave. 

           Thomas bends over as Phil clumsily reaches around for the 
           object, which Thomas now sees is a HANDGUN. 

                                 THOMAS

                        really need to talk to someone 
                        about this. I’m sure you

                        with all this-

           Thomas quickly grabs the gun before Phil can get to it. 

                                 THOMAS
                        Why the fuck do you have a gun, 
                        Phil??

                                 PHIL
                        ...I just told you. Nina-

                                 THOMAS
                        Nina? What were you going to do? 
                        Fucking kill her?! Have you lost 
                        your fucking mind?

                                 PHIL
                                (offended)
                        What--what else am I supposed to 
                        do? I just told you I can’t go on 
                        living like this-

           Thomas suddenly slaps Phil and grabs him by the collar. 

                                 THOMAS
                                (seething)
                        Listen to me very carefully, Phil. 
                        You’re going to get a hold of 
                        yourself, right now.

                        You’re going to get up, get out of 
                        my way and you’re going to go 
                        inside and deal with your own 
                        fucking problems, okay? Come on 
                        now, up we go-

           Thomas stands and forcibly raises Phil with him. Phil 
           stands there absolutely stunned.

                                 PHIL
                        But-

                                 THOMAS
                        GO HOME, PHIL.

           Thomas turns and walks back to the driver side of the 
           car. He gets in, puts the gun in the backseat and slams 
           the door.  

                                 PHIL
                        Hey, Tom, come on, don’t leave me 
                        like this, please-

           Thomas backs up, then floors it and peels off down the 
           street, leaving Phil alone under the streetlights. 

                                 PHIL (CONT’D)
                        TOM!!! 

           As the car gradually disappears down the street we hear 
           the steady sound of rain and thunder building as it leads 
           into the opening of “Riders On the Storm” by THE DOORS. 
           The song gently plays as we-

                                                                  CUT TO:

           INT/EXT. THOMAS’ CAR - NIGHT

           A series of sweeping nighttime vistas following Thomas as 
           he drives from freeways to highways and eventually to a 
           lone road headed way out of town.  

           From a distance the headlights resemble a lone pair of 
           tiny fireflies against the ominous rock formations.    

           LOW SHOT from the pavement as the BMW comes speeding 
           towards us. Just before it passes, something comes FLYING 
           OUT THE DRIVER-SIDE WINDOW and skids across the road till 
           it settles in the dirt. It’s the TRACKING DEVICE, the 
           little red light continues to blink as Thomas accelerates 
           off deeper into the night.

           INT. THOMAS’ CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Thomas has one hand on the wheel and the other supporting 
           the enormous weight of his aching head. 

           Jim Morrison’s voice does its best to soothe his nerves.

                        this world we’re thrown...

           Thomas lets out a deep sigh. The road ahead seems like a 
           never-ending blur of dotted yellow lines and black 
           asphalt...

                        storm. 

           Thomas spots his own reflection in the rearview mirror. 
           His blood-shot eyes look unfamiliar to him, lifeless...

           He quickly smacks the power button on the dash. Silence. 

                                 THOMAS
                        C’mon. Keep it together. You’re 
                        almost there. Just a few more

                        We just go home and forget it ever 
                        happened.  

           He looks back at his reflection and notices a splash of 
           dry blood on his forehead. He tries to rub it off but it 
           won’t budge. 

           He licks his finger and tries again. It still isn’t 
           coming off. He starts rubbing faster and harder. 

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                        Come off, you son of a bitch-

           It’s starting to look painful now. 

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                        Come off!

           Suddenly a LIGHT comes into view up head. He looks at the 
           road and sees a lone pair of HEADLIGHTS moving towards 
           him in the oncoming lane. 

           He stops rubbing his forehead and slowly settles back 
           into the driving position. 

           The headlights get bigger and bigger. Eventually, Thomas 
           is able to make out the shape of the car...SIRENS on the 
           roof. 

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                        You have got to be fucking 
                        shitting me. 

           The HIGHWAY PATROL CRUISER drives past Thomas. His eyes 
           dart immediately to his side-mirror. He watches intently, 
           praying that the tail lights keep moving away from him. 

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                        Keep going--please god, keep going-

           But they don’t. The cruiser flips a u-turn and starts 
           speeding up Thomas’ rear. 

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                        Shit!

           The car is gaining on him, but the officer hasn’t flashed 
           the sirens yet. 

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                        Just act normal, you haven’t done 
                        anything wrong-

           CONTINUED: (2)

           And now the SIRENS GO OFF. Flashes of red and blue 
           illuminate Thomas’ bewildered eyes. 

                                 OFFICER (O.S.)
                                (over the PA system)
                        Pull the vehicle to the shoulder-

           Thomas slams his hand against the steering wheel.

                                 THOMAS
                        Shit!

           He pulls the car off the road and comes to a gradual 
           stop. The black cruiser parks firmly behind him. The 
           flood lights are blinding Thomas. 

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                        Ok, calm down. No one knows but 
                        you. No one knows but you...  

           Thomas looks at the driver-side mirror, he sees an 
           OFFICER step out of the cruiser and into the headlights,  
           transforming the man into a dark, imposing silhouette. 

           Thomas is holding his breath as the shadow slowly 
           approaches. The dark uniform and black leather gloves 
           arrive outside of Thomas’ window. 

           After a moment, the officer taps his flashlight on the 
           glass. The sound startles Thomas.   

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                        Shit, sorry-

           Thomas rolls down the window. The flashlight is shined 
           directly in his face. 

                                 OFFICER
                        License and registration, please.  

           The man’s voice is devoid of all emotion.  

                                 THOMAS
                        Yes, of course. No problem-

           Thomas reaches over to his glove box and pulls out his 
           registration. He hands it over. 

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)

           He quickly reaches into his pocket for his wallet and 
           fishes out his drivers license. He hands it over. 

                                 OFFICER
                        I pulled you over because you have

                        side of your vehicle Mr. O’Mally. 

           Thomas almost laughs out of self pity

                                 THOMAS
                        Of course...how could I be so 
                        stupid. That actually just 
                        happened tonight. I’ll get it 
                        fixed first thing tomorrow, 
                        Officer, you have my word.   

                                 OFFICER
                        Was the incident reported, sir?

                                 THOMAS
                        Well--I was the only one involved 
                        so there wasn’t anything to 
                        report.

           Officer Morgan walks around to the front of the car and 
           shines his flashlight on the damaged area. He inspects 
           the dented metal and then aims his light back in Thomas’ 
           face. 

                                 OFFICER
                        Okay, here’s how this is going to 
                        work, Mr. O’Mally. I’m going to 
                        ask you what happened to your 
                        headlight and if I don’t get a 
                        straight answer from you then 
                        we’re going to have a big problem 
                        on our hands. Do you understand 
                        me? 

                                 THOMAS
                        --yes sir, absolutely. Is 
                        something wrong?

           Officer Morgan slowly approaches the driver-side window. 
           Eyes fixed on Thomas.

                                (dead serious)
                        What happened to your headlight,

                        Coyote don’t stand half as tall as 
                        the impact point on your car, Mr. 
                        O’Mally. 

                                 THOMAS
                        What? Is that a fact you have 
                        written down somewhere?

           Morgan leans down now and takes off his glasses. His eyes 
           could cut granite. 

                                 OFFICER
                        Let me tell you a little fact I do 
                        have written down somewhere. Do 
                        you know what the number one 
                        unreported crime on this highway 
                        is?

                                 THOMAS
                        ...I’m guessing it’s not missing 
                        coyotes?

           Thomas’ attempt at humor is obliterated by Morgan’s 
           stare.

                                 OFFICER
                        Hit and run, Mr. O’Mally. Also 
                        known as vehicular manslaughter. 
                        Which, for those who try to run  
                        boils down to murder.  

           Thomas is starting to sweat. He won’t be able to hold 
           much longer, Morgan is relentless. 

                                 THOMAS
                                (shakily)
                        That’s--terrible.

                                 THOMAS (CONT'D)
                        It’s sad to think that there are 
                        people capable of such a thing--
                        especially in this day and age 
                        with all the technology and 
                        cameras everywhere and-

           As Thomas goes on, Morgan’s eyes drift to the backseat 
           and land on: Phil’s HANDGUN. He quickly steps back and 
           draws his sidearm. 

                                 OFFICER (CONT’D)
                        Hands where I can see em’-

           Thomas nearly shits himself, immediately lifting both 
           hands out the window.

                                 THOMAS
                        Woah, woah--what the hell is going 
                        on?!

                                 OFFICER
                        Using one hand, toss your keys to 
                        me out your driver-side window. 
                        NOW.

                                 THOMAS
                        Okay! Okay one hand, here you go-

           Thomas tosses the keys to Morgans feet. Morgan kicks them 
           backwards, they SLIDE across to the other side of the 
           road. 

                                 OFFICER
                        What’s that sitting in your 
                        backseat, Mr. O’Mally?

           Thomas tries to turn and look but Morgan cocks his piece. 

                                 OFFICER (CONT’D)
                        Don’t you fucking move, you little 
                        Irish prick! I’ll blow your head 
                        off right here right now!

                                 THOMAS
                        How am I supposed to tell you 
                        what’s in the back seat if I can’t 
                        turn around?!

                                 OFFICER
                        There is a GUN in your backseat, 
                        Mr. O’Mally.

                                 THOMAS
                        Oh, Jesus--look I can explain 
                        that!

                                 OFFICER
                        Do you have a license for that 
                        firearm?

                                 THOMAS
                        What??--No, it’s not mine-

                                 OFFICER
                        Then there’s nothing to explain. 
                        Step out of the vehicle, sir. 

                                 THOMAS
                        Wait, just listen to me-

                                 OFFICER
                        I’m not going to ask you again! 
                        Step out of the vehicle. 

                                 THOMAS
                        Jesus Christ, okay! Please don’t 
                        shoot me!

           Thomas steps out of the vehicle. Morgan immediately grabs 
           him and twists his arm around.  

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                        Ow!

           He drags him to the back of the car and throws him face 
           down on top of the trunk. 

                                 OFFICER
                        Hands behind your back. 

                                 THOMAS
                        Please, will you just listen to me 
                        for a second?

           Morgan stops handling him for a second and leans over 
           him, his mouth hovering inches from Thomas’ ear. 

                                 OFFICER
                        I tried listening to you, Mr. 
                        O’Mally. But I have zero tolerance 
                        for listening to people lie- 

           As Thomas pleads with Morgan we drift under the car to 
           REVEAL drops of DARK LIQUID building up beneath the 
           trunk.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (7)

                                 THOMAS
                        I’m trying to tell you the truth! 
                        Just listen to me! The gun is my 
                        neighbors. His name is Phil 
                        Miller. I took it away from him 
                        tonight because he was drunk and 
                        threatening to kill his wife!

           Morgan stops putting the handcuffs on. 

                                 OFFICER
                        Is that true?

                                 THOMAS
                        Yes, I swear!

           Suddenly Morgan feels and hears a gentle TAPPING on his 
           boot. He looks down and notices some sort of liquid 
           dripping from beneath the trunk.  

           He bends over and dabs his finger in the small pool 
           collecting in the dirt. He raises his finger into the 
           light, it’s covered in BLOOD. 

                                 OFFICER
                        My god- 

                                 THOMAS
                        What? What’s going on?

           Morgan grabs the radio strapped to his shoulder while 
           keeping one arm on Thomas. 

                                 OFFICER
                                (into radio)
                        This is Officer Morgan, I have a 
                        possible homicide suspect in 
                        custody out on highway one-
                        eighteen. Requesting a back up 
                        unit immediately, over. 

                                 THOMAS
                        Oh Jesus, oh god-

                                 OFFICER
                        Shut the fuck up! Step away from 
                        the vehicle. NOW.

           Morgan aims his gun with both hands squarely on Thomas. 

                                 OFFICER (CONT’D)
                        What’s in the trunk, sir-

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (8)

           Thomas is in no condition to answer questions, he’s 
           starting to sob hysterically. 

                                 THOMAS
                                (crying)
                        I’m sorry-it was an accident--I 
                        swear I never meant for this to 
                        happen...

                                 OFFICER
                        That’s what they all say, you sick 
                        fuck. Open the trunk nice and slow 
                        or I will put a bullet in you. 

           Thomas slowly reaches his hand under the lip of the trunk 
           and presses the release mechanism. The trunk begins to 
           open on its own.

                                 OFFICER (CONT’D)
                        Now step away from the vehicle-

           Thomas slowly steps back. Morgan approaches the trunk and 
           looks inside. His eyes go wide, he almost dry heaves-

                                 OFFICER (CONT’D)
                                (horrified)
                        Jesus Christ- 

           He whips around and points his gun at Thomas’ head. 

                                 OFFICER (CONT’D)
                        Get on your knees and put your 
                        hands above your head!

           Thomas drops down to his knees. 

                                 THOMAS
                        I’m sorry...I’m so sorry...

                                 OFFICER
                        Hands above your head, now!

           Thomas raises his hands. Officer Morgan quickly whips out 
           a set of HANDCUFFS and forces Thomas’ arms behind his 
           back.  

                                 OFFICER (CONT’D)
                                (while applying the 
                                 cuffs)
                        You have the right to remain 
                        silent, anything you say can and 
                        will be used against you in a 
                        court of law-

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (9)

           Thomas begins to weep. Morgan locks the second cuff and  
           steps back in front of Thomas.

                                 THOMAS
                        Please, god--help me...

                                 OFFICER
                        God? God can’t help you.
                                (leans down to 
                                 Thomas)
                        You sold your soul to the 
                        devil...and now he’s come to 
                        collect-

           ZIP! A BULLET quietly bursts through Officer Morgan’s 
           head, showering Thomas in a bloodbath of brain and skull. 

           A distant CONCUSSION of sound echoes off the desert rocks 
           like a thunder-clap all around Thomas. 

           Morgan’s lifeless body collapses face first in front of 
           Thomas, who looks up in utter shock.

           Suddenly another SHOT rings out and a bullet ROCKETS into 
           the TAIL-LIGHT just to the right of Thomas. 

                                 THOMAS
                        JESUS FUCK!

           Thomas falls onto his stomach out of instinct. His 
           movement is limited by the fact that his arms are still 
           cuffed behind his back. 

           Another shot hits the dirt a few feet in front of Thomas. 
           He slowly looks up and sees THE KEYS to the handcuffs 
           latched to the back of Officer Morgan’s belt. 

           He makes a break for it and crawls to the body and then 
           FLOPS himself on top of Morgan’s corpse so that his hands 
           are on the keys. 

                                 THOMAS
                        Please, please-

           Thomas manages to get his fingers on one of the keys and 
           shakily guides it into the keyhole but--BANG!

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                        AAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!

           Another stray bullet BLASTS into the car just missing 
           Thomas who is now screaming uncontrollably. 

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (10)

           He jerks the key sideways and the cuffs POP OPEN.

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                                (genuinely surprised)
                        AH! AHA!-

           Suddenly a pair of high-powered HEADLIGHTS ignite in the 
           distance.

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                        Oh god- 

           A cluster of FOG LIGHTS attached to the unknown VEHICLE 
           light up the hillside as the violent, guttural sound of a 
           large TRUCK ENGINE is heard roaring into life.

           Thomas quickly gets up and sprints to his car and dives 
           into the driver seat.

           The truck lurches into gear and descends down the hill,  
           like a vessel from hell.  

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                        Oh god, oh Jesus--please-

           Thomas punches the ignition switch, but nothing happens.  

                                 RADIO 
                        Key not in range-

                                 THOMAS
                        What?!

           Thomas punches it again and again but still nothing 
           happens. 

                                 RADIO
                        Key-key-k-k-k-key not in range-

           Thomas looks around for the key but then remembers the 
           last thing he did with it. He looks ACROSS THE ROAD and 
           sees his keys lying where Officer Morgan kicked them. 

                                 THOMAS
                        Son of a bitch!-

           The cabin becomes consumed in a blinding WHITE LIGHT. 
           Thomas turns to see the demonic PICK UP TRUCK on a full 
           speed collision course with his car. Thomas braces for 
           impact- 

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                        GAHHHHHH!!!!

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (11)

           The truck SMASHES into the rear of Thomas’ car, sending 
           it SPINNING VIOLENTLY across the road.  

           Thomas hangs on to the steering wheel for dear life as 
           glass flies all around him. 

           His car comes to a stop on the other side of the road. 
           The pick up truck slams on its brakes a few hundred feet 
           ahead.  

           Thomas looks up and sees the truck whip into a u-turn, it 
           tail-spins in the dirt until the headlights face Thomas 
           once again. 

           The radio finally gives him some good news-

                                 RADIO (V.O.)
                        Key detected-

           Thomas looks out of his driver door, which is hanging 
           open. The truck has smashed his car within arms reach of 
           his keys. 

           Thomas grabs the keys but as soon as he does the truck 
           lurches forward, speeding directly at Thomas.

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                        Fuck--come on!!

           He punches the IGNITION BUTTON and the exquisite German-
           built engine sucks in air and comes to life.   

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                        Yes!

           Thomas shifts into reverse and slams the pedal to the 
           floor. The car rockets backwards, just missing another 
           oncoming collision with the truck. 

           The truck corrects itself and comes full speed at Thomas, 
           who is now doing almost fifty miles an hour going in 
           reverse, off road...in a sports sedan.  

           He looks at the blinding headlights in front of him. A 
           small flash goes off followed immediately by a BULLET 
           blasting through his WINDSHIELD. 

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                        FUCKING CHRIST!

           Thomas ducks down as another two shots pierce the glass 
           in front of him. 

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (12)

           The road is now becoming extremely unforgiving. Thomas’ 
           car is rattling and shaking so badly that his head shoots 
           up into the ceiling.  

           The trunk, which was left open, spits out the occasional 
           body part as the entire rear bounces up and down.

           Thomas quickly looks back to try and see where he’s 
           going, he sees nothing but blackness out the rear window. 

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                        WOAH!!!!

           Thomas WHIPS the steering wheel, swerving the car away 
           from the EDGE of the HILL he’s been blindly steering 
           towards. 

           The truck doesn’t see the drop-off in time and goes 
           FLYING OFF THE EDGE. It SMASHES into a LARGE ROCK on it’s 
           way down and FLIPS violently till it comes to a stop at 
           the bottom. 

           Thomas slams on the brakes and brings his car to a quick 
           stop. He holds his breath for a second, waiting to see if 
           the headlights return...they don’t. 

           He turns around and frantically searches the backseat for 
           his neighbor’s GUN. After a few awkward moments he finds 
           it lying underneath the passenger seat. 

           Thomas steps out of his car and cautiously approaches the 
           hillside, gun at the ready.  

           He peers over the dark edge and spots the truck lying in 
           a steaming wreck down at the bottom of the hill. 

           Thomas hears movement coming from inside the truck. The 
           driver door is KICKED OPEN and a MAN flops out onto the 
           ground.

                                 THOMAS
                                (horrified)
                        Jesus Christ-

           The man is extremely disoriented from the crash. He looks 
           up and spots Thomas standing at the top of the hill. 

           The man crawls back to the car and reaches into the 
           wreckage. After a few seconds he pulls out a HANDGUN, its 
           reflection catches Thomas’ eye. 

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                        No, no just wait on a minute- 

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (13)

           Thomas looks back at his car, he spots the open trunk and 
           rushes over to it. 

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                                (yelling back)
                        I have what you want, just hold on 
                        a second-

           He arrives at the trunk and lifts the lid open all the 
           way.

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                        -GOD DAMN IT.

           The limbs which were neatly packed in the cardboard box 
           are now strewn all about the trunk in a bloody mess. 
           Thomas sifts through them till he finds what he’s looking 
           for: THE DRUGS. 

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                        Aha! Here! I got it right here-

           He grabs the bag and turns back towards the hill, but THE 
           MAN has already made it to the top. He limps towards 
           Thomas, one of his legs looks to be horribly broken. 

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                        Jesus--how did you get up that so 
                        fast??

           The man says nothing. He resembles one of the classic 
           Terminators as he advances slowly and methodically 
           towards Thomas. 

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                        Listen, this is what you’re here 
                        for, right?

           Thomas lifts the bag as he backs away from the man. 

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                        They’re yours, okay? I don’t want 
                        anything to do with this. This 
                        whole thing was all one big 
                        misunderstanding. 

           The man continues to advance. 

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                        Do you understand what I’m saying? 
                        Ables ingles? No quiero el 
                        druggos! Here, take em’!

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (14)

           Thomas tosses the bag. It lands at the man’s feet but he 
           lifts his gun and FIRES A SHOT at Thomas. The bullet 
           strays wide. 

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                        FUCK! What the hell do you want 
                        from me?!

           The man’s arm is waving about. He barely manages to aim 
           the gun in Thomas’ general direction and pulls the 
           trigger AGAIN, again firing wide.  

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                        Jesus Christ! Stop!

           He pulls the trigger again but this time all he gets is a 
           hollow CLICK! Now Thomas aims his gun at the man. 

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                        Okay--look, I gave you the fucking 
                        drugs, I don’t want to hurt you. 
                        Just turn around and take the bag. 

           The man doesn’t stop. Now he brandishes a large knife 
           from his belt. Thomas awkwardly cocks his gun, he’s 
           obviously never held one before.  

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                        I’m warning you, you fucking 
                        lunatic. 

           The man raises the knife at Thomas and continues his 
           death march.

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                        Hey! Stop walking at me or I’ll 
                        shoo-

           Suddenly Thomas’ trigger finger slips and fires a PERFECT 
           HEAD SHOT through the man’s skull. 

           A spray of blood explodes out the back of the man’s head 
           as he drops to his knees and collapses face first into 
           the dirt. 

           Thomas stares at the man’s body, his mouth wide open in 
           shock. The desert wind picks up as blood begins to pool 
           into the sand around the body. 

           Thomas drops the gun in disgust.

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (15)

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                        ....I was--just trying to make you 
                        stop. 
                                (beat)
                        Why wouldn’t you stop?

           Again, Thomas finds himself in a one-sided conversation 
           with a corpse. 

           Suddenly the crashed pick-up truck EXPLODES at the bottom 
           of the hill, knocking Thomas to the ground. He watches as 
           a plume of smoke and flame rises into the night sky.

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                        Why is this happening to me?
                                (looking up at the 
                                 sky)
                        What did I do to deserve this?! 
                        Have I asked for too much?! HUH?!

           Thomas’ voice is bouncing off the empty desert rocks, he 
           is truly alone. 

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                        ANSWER ME YOU SON OF A BITCH!

           As if in response to Thomas’ request, a familiar sound 
           begins to emanate from inside the deceased man’s pocket.  

           Thomas turns around and spots a pale white light bleeding 
           through the man’s blood-soaked jeans: a CELL PHONE. 

           The ringtone plays on incessantly. Thomas approaches the 
           body, carefully tip-toeing around the large pool of blood 
           that has drained out of the man’s exploded head. 

           He gently reaches into the man’s pocket and pulls out the 
           cell phone. He flips it over and wipes the blood from the 
           screen to reveal the CALLER ID: “Unknown”...

           Thomas stares at the screen as the phone continues to 
           ring. The SLIDE TO ANSWER bar glimmers with every 
           vibration. 

           After a few moments the ringing ceases, the screen 
           displays a ONE MISSED CALL notification and then goes 
           black. 

           Thomas looks up, lost in thought. 

                                                                  CUT TO:
           EXT. ROADSIDE DINER - NIGHT

           A wide establishing shot of a lone 50s style DINER 
           somewhere off the highway.  

           The battered BMW is parked out front. We see Thomas 
           sitting alone in a booth by a window. 

           A familiar ringtone plays over and over...

           INT. DINER - CONTINUOUS

           Thomas sits in the booth staring at the ringing cell 
           phone on the table in front of him. He lets it ring 
           out...the screen now reads TWENTY SEVEN MISSED CALLS.   

           Thomas goes to take a sip of coffee but realizes that 
           it’s empty. Across the diner the WAITRESS spots Thomas 
           and walks over with a fresh pot. 

                                 WAITRESS 
                        ‘nother cup? 

                                 THOMAS
                        Yes, please. 

           As she pours, the phone starts to ring again. She looks 
           at Thomas who just stares blankly at the screen and the 
           “Unknown” caller and lets it ring out again.  

           The Waitress finishes pouring. She lingers, perplexed by 
           what she just witnessed. 

                                 WAITRESS
                        Everything all right?

           Thomas doesn’t hear her. 

                                 WAITRESS (CONT’D)
                        Sir?

           She taps him on the shoulder. He slowly looks up at her 
           in a daze. 

                                 THOMAS
                        What?

                                 WAITRESS
                        You’ve been lettin’ that phone 
                        ring for over half an hour. Is 
                        everything all right?

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 THOMAS
                                (deadpan)
                        Yes. Thank you. 

           Thomas looks back down at the phone and takes a long sip 
           of his coffee. 

           The Waitress watches for another moment and then decides 
           to sit down across from him. She has an almost absurd 
           smile on her face. 

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                        ...what are you doing?

                                 WAITRESS
                        You look like you could use a good 
                        listener. Lucky for you there just 
                        so happens to be one who works at 
                        this very diner. Her name is Dee--
                                (motions to her name-
                                 tag)
                        --and that’s me!

           Thomas stares at her dumbfounded. Her enthusiasm is 
           extremely unsettling. 

                                 THOMAS
                        Look, lady--

                                 DEE
                                (pointing to her name-
                                 tag again)
                        Dee...and you are? 

           Thomas is grinding his teeth into a fine powder. 

                                 THOMAS
                        ...I would really like to be left 
                        alone right now. Do you think you 
                        could please just...go away?

                                 DEE
                                (enthusiasm 
                                 unaffected)
                        Aw, c’mon now, mister...I know 
                        what that really means. 

                                 THOMAS
                        No, actually I’m not so sure you 
                        do--

                        You know, my momma always used to 
                        tell me that I had a knack for 
                        readin’ people. Every day when I’d 
                        come home from school I could tell 
                        whether she was happy, mad, sad or 
                        glad just by lookin’ at her face.

                                 THOMAS
                        Please, stop. 

                                 DEE
                        Here’s a good one. Did you know 
                        that you can tell whether someone 
                        is genuinely smiling or not by 
                        looking at the corners of their 
                        eyes? If they have wrinkles near 
                        the corners when they smile it 
                        means it’s a real emotion. No 
                        wrinkles means it’s just a big 
                        piece of phony baloney. Want to 
                        practice on me?? 

           Dee offers him a smile that would make a child run for 
           the hills. Thomas can’t even muster up a response. He 
           looks like he’s staring into the deepest circle of hell. 

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        DEE, KUSOGAKI!

           Thomas jumps in his seat as a little thundering ASIAN 
           WOMAN appears from the kitchen, this is MRS. LEE, 60s, co-
           owner of the diner with her husband Mr. Lee. 

                                 DEE
                        Now that is Mrs. Lee...and she 
                        never smiles. And if she does 
                        there are certainly no wrinkles 
                        present, that much I can promise 
                        you. 
                                (leans in and 
                                 whispers)
                        ...I wonder if it’s because she’s 
                        Asian...they always seem to have 
                        such elastic skin-

                                 MRS. LEE

                                 DEE
                        Hai, Mrs. Lee, hai!

           Dee gets up and walks back to the kitchen where Mrs. Lee 
           is slapping the counter-top with a rag in anger. Thomas 
           watches this scene in fear. 

           The cell phone STARTS TO RING again, snatching his 
           attention away from the circus act taking place behind 
           the counter.  

           Once again, the screen reads: “Unknown”.

           Thomas grabs the phone and moves quickly past Dee and 
           Mrs. Lee who are still yelling at each other loudly in 
           Japanese. 

           EXT. DINER - CONTINUOUS

           Thomas steps out into the dirt parking lot. He looks down 
           at the ringing phone and takes a deep breath. 

           His fingers drag the slider across the screen. He raises 
           the phone to his ear but says nothing, just listens. 

           At first there’s a long silence...but then-

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                                (over the phone)
                        Hello?

           The voice is deep and strangely soothing with a slight 
           Spanish kick. 

                                 THOMAS
                        Who is this?

                                (deep breath)
                        I assume this means you’ve taken 
                        care of Javier. You must be quite 
                        good...he does not usually fail 
                        his assignments.

                                 THOMAS
                        It was an accident.

                        Of course not. Life is too 
                        precious a gift to ever want to

                        Listen to me, my entire fucking 
                        life has come undone in the last 
                        six hours. I have literally lost 
                        every shred of normality that I 
                        have worked very hard to 
                        accumulate over the last ten 
                        fucking years. So what do I want 
                        out of this situation? I want to 
                        go home. I want to go home and 
                        pretend like this whole FUCKING 
                        night never happened. I just want 
                        my life back...

                        very dear to you seeing as you 
                        strapped a long-range tracking 
                        device to it and shoved it half 
                        way up a homeless man’s rectum. Am

                        the rest of my brand new house

           EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - NIGHT

           The body of Officer Morgan lies face first on the asphalt 
           in the bloody aftermath of the shooting.

           A flash of RED and BLUE lights slowly builds in intensity 
           around the body as we hear a car approaching down the 
           road. 

           The camera pans over to reveal another POLICE CRUISER 
           pulling up to the scene. TWO HIGHWAY PATROL OFFICERS exit 
           the vehicle. The first, OFFICER HANNA, early 30s, steps 
           out from the driver side door.  

                                 HANNA

           The second, OFFICER MILLS, also early 30s, slowly gets 
           out on the passenger side. 

           The two approach Morgan’s blood-soaked corpse. They stand 
           over it, surveying the scene. 

                                 MILLS (CONT’D)

                        ...nothin’ good. 

           Mills leans down and inspects Officer Morgans body, he 
           shines his flashlight on the area of face still left 
           intact.

                        Oh god-

           Mills immediately walks away from the body. Hanna stays 
           by it, analyzing the carnage.

                                 HANNA
                        Well, between you and me, Morgan 
                        always was an asshole.

                        to go out like this. 

           Mills notices the busted tail-light and shines his 
           flashlight along the broken plastic.

                                 MILLS
                        Christ. I got an impact hole here 
                        the size of a half-dollar. 

                                 HANNA
                        Fifty cal?

                                 MILLS
                        I’d reckon so. 
                                (beat)
                        This certainly don’t feel like

                        wrong, does it...

                                 HANNA
                        No. It don’t.

           Mills walks up to the front of the car. His flashlight 
           catches the trail of dirt leading off the road. He spots  
           TIRE TRACKS. 

                                 MILLS

                        Go on. I’ll call it in. 

           Mills takes out his gun and sets off into the dark. Hanna 
           gets into the driver seat of Morgan’s cruiser and picks 
           up the radio.

                                 HANNA
                        I have an officer down out on 
                        highway one-eighteen, ten miles 
                        north of Deerfield. Requesting CSI 
                        and a medical unit, over-

           Hanna begins to click away on the LAPTOP built in to 
           Morgan’s dash.

                                 RADIO (O.S.)
                        Copy that. Sit tight 307.

           Hanna finds the dash-cam surveillance footage and rewinds 
           till he sees Thomas’ WHITE BMW in the frame. He pauses 
           the video.  

                                 HANNA
                        Gotcha, you son of a bitch.

                                                                  CUT TO:

           INT/EXT. THOMAS’ CAR - NIGHT

           Thomas drives his ragged BMW down a desert highway. The 
           full moon has begun to set over the mountains on the 
           horizon. 

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Thomas exits the freeway and drives down a dirt road past 
           a number of PRIVATE RANCHES. 

           He passes a large WOODEN SIGN with the name “Gallardo 
           Ranch” branded into it. 

           EXT. GALLARDO RANCH - CONTINUOUS

           Thomas turns down the road and arrives at a LARGE GATED 
           COMPOUND. He pulls up to the intercom in front of an 
           enormous WROUGHT IRON GATE. 

           He pushes the buzzer, waiting anxiously as it rings.

                                 INTERCOM
                        Que?-

                                 THOMAS
                        Uh--hello, this is Thomas, Thomas 
                        O’Mally?

           Voices can be heard discussing in the background through 
           the intercom. 

           The intercom BUZZES and the large gate starts to SWING 
           OPEN, revealing a beautiful RUSTIC ESTATE up ahead. 

           EXT. GALLARDO ESTATE - CONTINUOUS

           Thomas pulls his car into a small roundabout surrounding 
           an exquisite fountain. He sees a MAN dressed in black 
           waiting for him near the entrance of the house.   

           This is ANGEL, EARLY 30s, MEXICAN. 

           Thomas parks the car and gets out. He starts walking down 
           the long the walkway leading to the front of the house. 

           ANGEL doesn’t move a muscle until Thomas is standing 
           right in front of him. His dark, uninviting eyes lock on 
           Thomas. 

                                 ANGEL
                        O’Mally.

                                 THOMAS
                                (nervous)
                        Yes-

                                 ANGEL
                        He’s waiting for you.  
           INT. GALLARDO ESTATE - CONTINUOUS

           Thomas follows Angel through the decadent hallways of the 
           house. Every room has been tastefully decorated in a warm 
           south-western theme. 

           They reach a big open living room surrounded by a 
           gorgeous wall of floor-to-ceiling windows. There is a 
           healthy fire roaring in the large stone fireplace. 

           A tall and well built gentleman stands with his back to 
           Thomas facing the fire. 

                                 ANGEL
                        Señor Gallardo, your guest is 
                        here. 

           The man slowly turns to face Thomas. 

           This is VINCENTE GALLARDO, MID 50s. A handsome man with 
           an extremely charming face. His perfectly groomed salt 
           and pepper beard and sharp cut suit make him seem like he 
           stepped out of an elegant Mexican beer commercial.   

           He smiles at Thomas and offers out his hand. 

                                 VINCENT
                        Mister O’Mally. Nice to finally 
                        meet you. 

           Thomas is caught off guard by the man’s charm.

                                 THOMAS
                        ...thank you--Señor Gallardo. You 
                        have a beautiful home. 

                                 VINCENT
                        Please, call me Vincent. 

           Vincent notices the condition of Thomas’ attire. At this 
           point it looks as though Thomas has been killed, buried, 
           resurrected and then killed again.

                                 VINCENT (CONT’D)
                        You know, I don’t think it’s 
                        possible to imagine a man who 
                        looks like he could use a drink 
                        more than you right now. 

           Thomas looks down at himself and for the first time 
           realizes just how absurd he looks. 

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 THOMAS
                        ...I don’t think it’s possible to 
                        explain just how horrible these 
                        past twelve hours have been.

                                 VINCENT
                        I’m afraid you’re going to have 
                        to, one way or another...

           Thomas hears a metallic CLICK and turns to see Angel and 
           a second CARTEL GOON pointing PISTOLS right at his head. 

                                 THOMAS
                                (betrayed)
                        I thought you said there would be 
                        no harm done. 

           The Goon PISTOL WHIPS Thomas in the back, he screams in 
           pain and collapses to his knees.

                                 VINCENT
                        You’re right, I did...and I am a 
                        man of my word. But first we must 
                        find out if you are a man of 
                        yours. 

           EXT. GALLARDO ESTATE - NIGHT

           Angel and Goon #2 lead Thomas at gunpoint back to his 
           car. Vincent walks calmly behind them.  

                                 ANGEL
                        Where is it?

                                 THOMAS
                        It’s in the glove-box. 

                                 ANGEL
                        Take it out. 

           Thomas slowly opens the door.

                                 ANGEL (CONT’D)
                        One wrong move and I blow your 
                        brains out right here, right now, 
                        Gringo. Comprende? 

                                 THOMAS
                        I never thought I’d hear that 
                        twice in one day- 

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Thomas opens the glove-box and retrieves the BAG OF DRUGS 
           inside. He hands it over to Goon #2 who looks to Vincent. 

                                 VINCENT
                                (to Goon)
                        Probarlo...

           Thomas watches anxiously as the Goon opens up the baggie 
           and licks his finger. He dabs it in the powder and 
           brushes the residue along the inside of his gums. 

           He pauses for a moment, letting the dopamine rush through 
           to his brain. He looks up at Vincent and nods. 

                                 VINCENT (CONT’D)
                                (to Goon)
                        Take it inside and have it 
                        weighed. I want to know if there’s 
                        anything missing. 

                                 THOMAS
                        There won’t be. I told you I have 
                        nothing to gain from this. 

                                 VINCENT
                        Don’t get upset, Thomas. You’ve 
                        done very well, but in my line of 
                        work one can never be too careful. 
                                (beat)
                        Now why don’t you show me your 
                        little “situation”...

           INT. THOMAS’ CAR - CONTINUOUS

           The trunk opens, we are staring up at Thomas, Vincent and 
           Angel from inside the trunk.

                                 VINCENT
                        Ah.

           Now to their POV looking down into the trunk which now 
           contains JAVIER’S body on top of the mess of DISMEMBERED 
           LIMBS from Thomas’ first victim. 

           Angel catches a glimpse of the drug mule’s SEVERED HEAD, 
           it seems to fill him with a seething anger. 

           Goon #2 returns, Vincent turns to him. 

                                 GOON
                        Todo està ahì.

                        Well, Thomas, seems you are indeed 
                        a man of your word. 
                                (puts his arm around 
                                 Thomas)
                        Why don’t we go inside and discuss 
                        how you ever managed to get 
                        yourself into such a mess...
                                (to Angel)
                        Take the bodies to the shed. 

           Angel watches on in a silent rage as Vincent leads Thomas 
           back into the house. 

           EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - NIGHT

           A SMALL TEAM finishes cleaning up the crime scene on the 
           side of the road. OFFICER MORGAN’S REMAINS are zipped up 
           in a black body-bag and wheeled away into an ambulance. 

           Officer Mills stands and talks to the FORENSICS TEAM. 

           INT. POLICE CRUISER - CONTINUOUS

           Officer Hanna sits in his cruiser scanning through data 
           on his dash-computer. Suddenly his WALKIE goes off-

           Hanna grabs his walkie, his eyes stay fixed on the screen 
           in front of him.

                                 HANNA
                        Yeah, go-

           Hanna looks up from the screen.

           Mills walks Hanna along the tracks leading towards the 
           edge of the hill.

           They arrive at the top of the hill and look down. A crew 
           of FIREMEN are cleaning up the smoldering wreckage down 
           at the bottom.

                        Our guys just found a whole lotta 
                        blood down there with no other 
                        body in sight.

           Hanna thinks about this.

                                 HANNA
                        It wasn’t Morgan’s?

                                 MILLS
                        Nope. Forensics said it wasn’t a 
                        match. On top of that, Morgan 
                        called in a homicide before he was 
                        killed and then this whole circus

                        So...there should be two bodies

                                 HANNA
                        So I pulled up our recently 
                        deceased colleague’s dash-cam 
                        footage and-

           Mills hits the keyboard and a SCREENSHOT of THOMAS’ CAR 
           pops up on the screen.

                                 MILLS
                                (entranced)
                        Well, heelloooo beautiful. Now, 
                        I’d think a nice piece like that 
                        would have some sort of lo-jack 
                        system installed on it.

                                 HANNA
                        As did I. I ran the plates through 
                        the database and sure enough the 
                        car has a recovery system 
                        installed. 

                                 MILLS
                        So...who is he?

           Hanna punches a few buttons and Thomas’ DRIVER’S LICENSE 
           comes up on screen.

                        He sure drove a pretty mile to get 
                        all the way out here. Must’ve been 
                        in quite a hurry to skip town. 

                                 HANNA
                        Sure was. But as of three minutes 
                        ago that car is parked just twenty 
                        miles up the highway...

                                 MILLS
                        Huh...

           Hanna looks at Mills.

                                 HANNA
                        Huh? I know exactly what “huh” 
                        means Mills and the only reason 
                        I’m even considerin’ it is because 
                        I know that even if I say no 
                        you’re gonna go off and get 
                        yourself killed like a goddamn

                                 MILLS
                        You’re damn right I will. 

           Beat.

                                 MILLS (CONT’D)
                        So?

                                (sighs)
                        ...Did you bring the big guns?

                                 MILLS
                        Got em’ both in the back. 

           Hanna looks out the window, contemplating. Mills watches 
           him like a dog watches an owner with a tennis ball in his 
           hand.

                                 HANNA
                        Screw it, lets go bag the son of a 
                        bitch.

                        There’s my partner!

           Hanna turns the key in the ignition and the cruiser ROARS 
           to life.

                        He really don’t look like all 
                        that.

           The two stare at Thomas’ photo on his license. He’s 
           grinning like a moron.

                                 HANNA
                                (sighs)

                        Yeah, yeah, ”I watch wayyy too 
                        many movies”--punch that shit-

           Hanna hits the gas and fishtails the cruiser back onto 
           the road. The car speeds off down the highway and we-

                                                                  CUT TO:

           INT. GALLARDO ESTATE - NIGHT

           Thomas sits at a beautiful circular wooden table across 
           from Vincent and another associate, this is ENRIQUE, 40s. 

           Vincent and Enrique each have a glass of tequila in front 
           of them. 

           They watch as Thomas’ recounts the chain of events that 
           brought him here-

                                 THOMAS
                                (in mid sentence)
                        -so I tried telling him to stop, 
                        but he didn’t. I even threw the 
                        bag at him but he just wouldn’t 
                        stop coming at me. So I took the 
                        gun, which by the way, I’ve never 
                        even held a real gun before, and I 
                        tried firing a warning shot--you 
                        know--just to get him to stop. But 
                        the gun kicked so hard that I 
                        ended up--well yeah...

           Vincent and Enrique stare blankly at Thomas. 

                                 VINCENT
                        So...what you’re saying is that 
                        this whole thing was all one 
                        big...mistake?

                                 THOMAS
                        Yes. That’s exactly what I’m 
                        saying. 

           Vincent leans back and pours himself another serving of 
           tequila, still at a loss for words.  

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                        Do you not believe me?

           Beat.

                        ...I just can’t believe you told 
                        your wife you hit someone’s pet 
                        coyote!

           Enrique and Vincent both break out LAUGHING. Thomas 
           stares at the two, not nearly as amused. 

                                 ENRIQUE (CONT’D)
                                (still laughing)
                        I mean, seriously, who the fuck 
                        would have a pet coyote??

                                 THOMAS
                                (quietly)
                        Yeah...that’s actually exactly 
                        what she said.

                                 ENRIQUE
                        What did you expect her to say, 
                        cabròn?? You’re lucky she didn’t 
                        call your gringo-ass out right 
                        then and there!

                                 VINCENT
                        A man should never lie to his 
                        wife, Thomas...where I come from 
                        lying to your woman is said to 
                        bring terrible luck upon the 
                        husband. Which in all honesty, 
                        till I met you I always believed 
                        was a bunch of bullshit. But

                        There’s coyotes crawling all over 
                        this place-

           Enrique turns to GOON who’s standing guard in the 
           doorway. He snaps his fingers at him. 

                                 ENRIQUE (CONT’D)
                        Cupo! Ve a buscar a un coyote en 
                        algún lugar y lo puso en el coche 
                        del señor O'Mally antes de irse. 
                        Àndele!  

           Goon turns and heads for the door. 

                                 THOMAS
                        Oh--no, hey, whatever he just said-
                        -you really don’t need to do that-

           But Goon is already out the door. 

                                 ENRIQUE
                        Ah, let him go. Poor guy can’t 
                        even find his way around a circle 
                        if he tried. He’ll be fine. 

           Enrique gets up and walks to the bar. Vincent takes out a 
           cigar and begins to light it. 

                                 VINCENT
                        I must say, Thomas. That is quite 
                        a story you have there. 

                                 THOMAS
                        Yeah...well, I’m sure someone like 
                        you has probably heard a lot worse 
                        than that. 

           Vincent takes a long drag of his cigar, Thomas worries he 
           may have said something wrong.

                        No. You should not “remove” him

                        of happiness. And you all become 
                        so obsessed with the pursuit of 
                        this idea that somewhere in 
                        between chasing your “year end 
                        bonus” and your “two week 
                        vacations”...you lose what it 
                        means to be you. To be an 
                        individual with his own thoughts 
                        and his own desires. 
                                (beat)
                        You buy into this system and tell 
                        yourself “if only I had this job, 
                        if only I made that much money, if 
                        only I drove that car and had that 
                        house with that wife, THEN I’d be 
                        happy”...but you never will be. 
                        You know why? 

           Thomas has clearly been moved by this. 

                                 THOMAS
                        Why?...

                                 VINCENT
                        Because you were busy fighting for 
                        someone else’s idea of happiness 
                        in the first place.
                                (beat)
                        Life is a short and meaningless 
                        endeavor, Thomas. If we truly are 
                        just here to be pissed on, I’d 
                        rather be the one holding the cock 
                        in my hand.   

           Thomas is speechless. Suddenly a quiet voice is heard 
           from behind the table. 

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Papi?

           Thomas turns around to see a LITTLE GIRL, 7, standing 
           behind him in her nightgown. 

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (5)

                                 VINCENT
                        Ai, mi amor-

           Vincent rises from the table and walks over to his 
           DAUGHTER. He gently picks her up as she rubs the sleep 
           from her eyes.

                                 VINCENT (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing up so late? Did 
                        you have a bad dream? 

                                 GIRL
                        No...you never came to tuck me in.

                                 VINCENT
                        Ai--you’re right, how could I 
                        forget...let’s go fix this right 
                        away.

           Thomas gets up, Vincent throws him a wink as his daughter 
           puts her arms around his neck.

                                 VINCENT (CONT’D)
                        Well my friend, this is where we 
                        say goodbye. Enrique will get your 
                        car cleaned up so you can go back 
                        home to your wife and wash your 
                        hands of this. I’m throwing in a 
                        little something extra for your 
                        troubles...and because I like you.

           Enrique walks up behind Thomas and hands him a STUFFED 
           WHITE ENVELOPE. Thomas hesitates but Enrique gives him an 
           assured nod.

           He takes it and opens the envelope...it’s full of COLD 
           HARD CASH.

                                 THOMAS
                        Oh--Mister Gallardo--I can’t 
                        accept this-

                                 VINCENT
                        It’s fine Thomas, you don’t owe me 
                        anything for that. But I hope this 
                        evening has been a lesson for you. 
                        Because it certainly has been for 
                        me. 

           Thomas rises and offers his hand. 

                                 THOMAS
                        ...thank you Señor Gallardo. 

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (6)

           Vincent shakes it firmly. 

                                 VINCENT
                        Thomas, Señor Gallardo was my 
                        drunk, abusive father. So for the 
                        last time... call me Vincent. 

                                 THOMAS
                        Thank you, Vincent. 

           Vincent turns to leave, his daughter is now fast asleep 
           in his arms. 

                                 VINCENT
                                (as he walks away)
                        You can stay in the guest bedroom 
                        if you’d like. It’s almost morning 
                        anyway-

           Thomas watches him as he turns the corner and disappears. 

           EXT. DESERT - DAWN

           The first pale streaks of blue light have begun to break 
           over the mountains on the horizon.

           A herd of CATTLE graze leisurely on a small patch of 
           green outside a ranch. One of the cows slowly looks up as 
           a lone HIGHWAY PATROL CAR BLASTS down the empty highway 
           towards the rising sun. 

           INT. GALLARDO ESTATE, GUEST ROOM - DAWN

           Thomas stands in front of a window watching the first 
           beams of light begin to vanquish the never-ending night. 

           He turns away and sits down at the table by the window. 
           The WHITE ENVELOPE sits opened with the LARGE STACK OF 
           BILLS poking out of the crease.  

           Thomas takes the stack and flips through the thick bundle 
           of cash, but it doesn’t seem to bring him much comfort. 
           He tosses it back down on the table.

           A loud KNOCK on the door startles Thomas out of his 
           trance. He sits still, waiting to see if the knocking 
           returns. It does. 

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                        Who is it?

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 ANGEL (O.S.)
                        It’s Angel, open the door. 

           Beat.

                                 THOMAS
                        Is something wrong?

                                 ANGEL
                        Señor Gallardo asked me to check 
                        on you before you go. Open the 
                        door.  

           Thomas is slightly hesitant but cracks the door open. 
           Angel forcibly SHOVES his way in and closes the door 
           behind him. 

                                 ANGEL
                        What took you so long? 

                                 THOMAS
                        I--was on the other side of the 
                        room. Is there something I can 
                        help you with?-

           Angel PUNCHES Thomas SQUARE IN THE FACE, leveling him. 

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                                (grabbing at his 
                                 nose)
                        Ah, fuck!

           Angel GRABS him by the collar and DRAGS HIM across the 
           room. He sits Thomas down in a chair and quickly whips 
           out a SWITCHBLADE. 

           He takes the cold steel edge and plants it firmly on 
           Thomas’ jugular. 

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                        JESUS--what the hell are you 
                        doing??

           Angel SLAPS Thomas across the face. 

                                 ANGEL
                        One more peep out of you and I’ll 
                        slice your fucking throat. Who are 
                        you?

                                 THOMAS
                        What?

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

           Angel slaps him again. 

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                        OW!

                                 ANGEL
                        ...Who the fuck are you?

                                 THOMAS
                        I’m--I’m Thomas O’Mally-

           Another backhand to the face.

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                        Ah--god STOP!

           Angel furiously shoves his finger in Thomas’ face.

                                 ANGEL
                        Don’t give me that “Thomas 
                        O’Mally” bullshit. Who are you 
                        working for? DEA? FBI? 

                                 THOMAS
                        FBI? I have no idea what you’re 
                        fucking talking about, man! I 
                        don’t work for anybody! I’m a 
                        fucking corporate lawyer!

           Angel shoves Thomas backwards and brings him down to the 
           floor. He gets on top of him and covers his mouth with 
           one hand while taking the switchblade in the other and 
           SLICING a LONG CUT down Thomas’ cheek.

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                        GAHHHH-

           Thomas’ screams are muffled by Angel’s firm hand. 

                                 ANGEL
                        Shhhhhhh-be quiet. BE QUIET.

           Thomas stops screaming, his body is heaving up and down 
           with every breath. 

                                 ANGEL (CONT’D)
                        Now, I’m gonna ask you one last 
                        time...and if you lie to me again 
                        you will die on this carpet 
                        drowning in your own blood.
                                (beat)
                        Do you understand?

           CONTINUED: (3)

           Thomas nods, Angel removes his hand. 

                                 THOMAS
                                (gasping for air)
                        --I’m not--lying to you--my name 
                        is Thomas O’Mally--I’m a corporate 
                        fucking lawyer. I live in 
                        Columbus, New Mexico--I have a 
                        wife named Karen--she’s six months 
                        pregnant right now--please...

           Angel slowly loosens his grip, it’s clear that Thomas 
           isn’t lying. He gets up and sits on the bed. 

                                 ANGEL
                        How the fuck did you get involved 
                        in all this? 

                                 THOMAS
                                (hesitant)
                        ...I-

                                (warning)
                        The truth.

                                 THOMAS
                        Last night I was on my way home 
                        from dinner...I had a few drinks 
                        so I was driving the back-roads. I 
                        closed my eyes for one second and 
                        the next thing I know I crashed 
                        into this guy standing in the 
                        middle of the fucking road...

           Angel processes this information.

                                 ANGEL
                        A man? 

           Thomas nods.

                                 ANGEL
                        Did you kill him?

                                 THOMAS
                                (guilty)
                        Yes--but it was a complete 
                        accident. I didn’t even see him 
                        standing there, he came out of 
                        nowhere. 

           Angel stares blankly at Thomas.

                        ...I had to...cut up the body so I 
                        could try and--get rid of him. I 
                        found the drugs in his stomach by 
                        accident. 

           Beat.

                                 ANGEL
                        There was a tracking device in the 
                        bag.

                                 THOMAS
                        Yes. As soon as I found it I tried 
                        to get it as far away as possible-

                                 ANGEL
                        And Javier, you killed him too?

                                 THOMAS
                        Well--yes, but also a complete 
                        accident, I swear to god.

                        So...after killing two people you 
                        cut a deal with a druglord and 
                        brought the bodies here to his 
                        home to be disposed of. Do I have 
                        this right so far?

                                 THOMAS
                                (shameful)
                        Yes.

           Angel gets up from the bed and starts pacing back and 
           forth.

                                 THOMAS
                        Look, I’ve had a really long 
                        night, can I just go-

                        Miguel Hernandez? But I thought-

           Angel waits for Thomas to piece it together.

                        Excellent work inspector fucking 
                        gadget. Now ask me who the man in 
                        your trunk was.

                                 THOMAS

           Angel settles in and gets right in Thomas’ face.

                        The man in your trunk just so 
                        happened to be my partner AND my 
                        best friend. He was supposed to 
                        deliver a shipment tonight which 
                        would’ve let us put Vincent away

           Angel leans down and looks Thomas right in the eye.

                                 ANGEL
                        No you’re not. You killed a man

                        days to file a search warrant.   

           Hanna accepts Mill’s logic. He looks around, still no 
           sign of the white BMW.

                                 HANNA
                        GET DOWN!
           INT/EXT. POLICE CRUISER - CONTINUOUS

           Goon UNLOADS on the gate and the cruiser. THIRTY TWO 
           BULLETS come spewing out of his hand EVERY SECOND.  

           Lead PEPPERS the car, bullet holes blast into the 
           windshield as Hanna and Mills take cover. 

           INT. GALLARDO ESTATE, GUEST ROOM  - CONTINUOUS

           Angel comes to a halt as he hears the gunfire going off 
           outside. 

                                 THOMAS
                        What the hell is that??

           Angel moves quickly towards the window and pulls down the 
           blinds. He can see GOON outside walking towards the gate, 
           unloading on the POLICE CRUISER just beyond it.

                                 ANGEL
                        You gotta be fucking shitting me-

           INT/EXT. POLICE CRUISER - CONTINUOUS

           Goon finishes unloading the magazine. 

                                 HANNA
                        He’s reloading!

                                 MILLS
                        PUNCH IT!

           Hanna starts the car and SLAMS the gear into drive. He 
           PUNCHES THE GAS and sends the cruiser HURTLING TOWARDS 
           THE GATE. 

           EXT. GALLARDO ESTATE - CONTINUOUS

           The cruiser SLAMS THROUGH THE GATE at full speed knocking 
           it clean off it’s hinges. 

           Goon finally finishes reloading. He stands his ground and 
           manages to get a quick burst off before the cruiser SLAMS 
           INTO HIM and SENDS HIM FLYING. 

           INT. GALLARDO ESTATE, GUEST ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Thomas and Angel witness the collision from the window.

           Angel steps away from the window and takes out TWO HAND 
           GUNS from his jacket. 

                                 ANGEL
                        Judgement day, gringo. Your fate 
                        is in god’s hands now. I hope he 
                        gives you a swift sentence. 

           Angel grabs Thomas by the collar and heads for the door. 

                                 THOMAS
                        What are you doing??

           INT. GALLARDO ESTATE - CONTINUOUS

           Angel opens the door and comes out of the guest room. He 
           sees Enrique stumbling through the house, loading a gun 
           of his own. 

                                 ENRIQUE
                                (in Spanish)
                        Angel! What the hell is going on?-

           Angel THROWS Thomas to the ground in front of him and 
           FIRES BOTH PISTOLS at Enrique. Both shots find their 
           target, one to the CHEST, one to the HEAD. 

           EXT. GALLARDO ESTATE - CONTINUOUS

           Mills and Hanna jump out of the cruiser. 

                                 HANNA
                        Get the AR’s out here! NOW!

           Hanna runs over to GOON who is crawling on the floor 
           towards his gun. Hanna kicks the gun away from Goon, 
           takes out his pistol and SHOOTS GOON in the head. 

                                 MILLS
                        Hanna, three o’ clock!

           Hanna looks up towards the shed and sees a GROUP OF FIVE 
           MEXICANS emerge with guns. 

           He runs back towards the cruiser, firing pot-shots at 
           them as he goes. Mills is grabbing the AR-15 rifles from 
           the back seat.

                        Get behind the car!

           Mills tosses Hanna his rifle. Hanna drops his handgun and 
           catches the AR and quickly loads his magazine. Mills 
           finishes loading his and the two take up positions behind 
           the hood and tail end of the car. 

                                 MILLS
                        Say when!

           Hanna lets the Mexicans gain a little ground.

                                 HANNA
                        NOW!

           Hanna and Mills UNLOAD on the Mexicans. They take out the 
           FRONT TWO, the rest of the group scatter behind cover and 
           begin to return fire. 

           INT. GALLARDO ESTATE - CONTINUOUS

           Inside the house, more FOOT-SOLDIERS continue to emerge 
           from various rooms. Angel BRUTALLY SLAUGHTERS THEM one by 
           one as they come into view.

           Meanwhile Thomas continues to lie in the fetal position 
           behind a large couch. 

           EXT. GALLARDO ESTATE - CONTINUOUS

           Hanna and Mills are engaged in a full on fire-fight with 
           the remaining Mexicans from the group. 

           Hanna manages to hit one IN THE NECK. 

                                 HANNA
                        Reloading!

           Hanna ducks down behind the cruiser while Mills continues 
           to lay down suppressive fire. 

           As Hanna reloads a BLAST shatters through one of the 
           large panes of glass leading into the house. 

           Hanna looks up towards the house and sees VINCENT emerge 
           from inside, dressed in a SILK ROBE brandishing a LARGE 
           SHOTGUN. 

                                 HANNA (CONT’D)
                        ...oh my god-

           CONTINUED:

           Vincent cocks the shotgun then FIRES another round, 
           BLASTING the front of the cruiser apart. The spray HITS 
           HANNA in the arm, he screams out in pain. 

                                 MILLS
                        Hanna!

           INT. GALLARDO ESTATE - CONTINUOUS

           Angel hears the shotgun blast go off and stops dead in 
           his tracks. He looks towards the front of the house.

                                 ANGEL
                        ...Vincent.

           EXT. GALLARDO RANCH - CONTINUOUS

           Vincent advances on the cop cruiser. 

                                 VINCENT
                        ¡Cerdos de mierda!

           Vincent FIRES another shot, the spray shreds the front 
           tire providing Hanna and Mills cover. The car heaves 
           downwards. 

           Mills quickly grabs Hanna by the shirt and drags him 
           towards the back of the car. Another shotgun blast rips 
           through the car. 

                                 VINCENT (CONT’D)
                        You should have known better than 
                        to come here and start trouble-

           He fires off another shot, it rips into the cruiser’s 
           tail light. Mills and Hanna are pinned down. Hanna is in 
           serious pain. 

                                 MILLS
                        Hang in there, partner. We’re 
                        gonna get you out of here, I 
                        promise-

           Another shot BLASTS into the cruiser. Vincent is almost 
           on them. 

                                 VINCENT (CONT’D)
                        Did you pigs forget who you’re 
                        dealing with? HUH?!

           Vincent stops and looks over his shoulder to see ANGEL 
           aiming a PISTOL RIGHT AT HIM, Thomas is on his hands and 
           knees behind him. 

           Vincent slowly turns to face Angel. He smiles at him, 
           keeping his gun level.

                                 ANGEL
                        Put the gun down.

           Vincent stands defiant, the gun stays aimed right at 
           Angel. 

                                 ANGEL (CONT’D)
                        I said put the gun down...now.

           Vincent makes eye contact with Thomas, he painfully 
           smiles at him. 

                                 VINCENT
                        I’m sorry it had to end like this, 
                        Thomas. I was hoping to not drag 
                        you further into this mess.

                                 THOMAS

                        You don’t have to do this, Vincent-
                        -just put the gun down and listen 
                        to him!

           Vincent and Angel stay locked on each other.

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                        Vincent, I can help you--you can 
                        work out a deal with these people. 
                        You don’t have to die here.

                        Think about your daughter.

           Vincent thinks.

                                 VINCENT
                        Thomas...I would rather have my 
                        daughter grow up with the memory 
                        of a man...than in the shadow of a 
                        coward.
                                (beat)
                        I’m sorry-

           CONTINUED: (2)

           Vincent raises the shotgun but Angel pulls the trigger 
           and POPS one right into Vincent’s heart. 

           Vincent stumbles back, trying to aim the shotgun but life 
           is quickly slipping away from him.  

           Thomas watches in anguish as Vincent drops to his knees 
           and then falls onto his face. 

           Angel takes a deep breath, he turns and aims his gun at 
           Thomas. 

                                 THOMAS
                                (in tears)
                        W-what are you doing?

                                 ANGEL
                        I changed my mind. You’re a 
                        fucking lawyer. You’ll probably 
                        slime your way to a mild sentence 
                        and walk away from all this clean 
                        as a fucking whistle. 
                                (beat)
                        I can’t live with that. 

           His thumb clicks back the hammer on the gun.

                                 ANGEL (CONT’D)
                        Besides...they got more room for 
                        you in hell than prison-

           BAM! Thomas flinches as a bullet BLASTS THROUGH ANGEL’S 
           HEAD FROM BEHIND. 

           Angel’s lifeless eyes remain locked on Thomas as he falls 
           backwards, limp as a rag doll. 

           Thomas looks up and sees MILLS standing behind the 
           battered cruiser with his AR-15. He lowers the gun and 
           advances quickly towards Thomas. 

                                 THOMAS
                        Wait, wait--just hold on a second-

           Mills takes the butt of the rifle and SLAMS IT INTO 
           THOMAS’ FACE-

                                                           SMASH TO BLACK.

           OVER DARKNESS WE HEAR A DISTANT LOW HUMMING. IT SLOWLY 
           BUILDS UNTIL WE RECOGNIZE IT AS THE CONSTANT DULL HUM OF 
           FLUORESCENT LIGHTS. 
           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - UNKNOWN

           Thomas’ POV as his eyes slowly open. 

           CLOSE ON HIS EYES. One of them is badly swollen.  

           Thomas looks around, he is seated in a steel chair at a 
           steel table placed in the middle of an empty room. 

           His hands are HANDCUFFED to the arms of the seat. 

           The walls are covered in monochromatic tiles. To the 
           right is a LARGE ONE-WAY MIRROR. On the opposite wall in 
           front of him is a BIG METAL DOOR.  

           The incessant humming from the lights is becoming 
           overwhelming. Thomas tries to shift his wrists in the 
           handcuffs but as he does he hears the sound of a door 
           being opened deep within the walls.  

           He looks up at the door in front of him. He hears the 
           echoing sound of ANOTHER door begin opened. Now he can 
           hear a number of footsteps approaching. 

           The sound of yet ANOTHER DOOR opening is heard. The 
           footsteps get louder till they reach ANOTHER DOOR that is 
           opened. 

           Finally the door leading into the room OPENS. 

           A MAN dressed in ALL BLACK TACTICAL GEAR walks in and 
           holds the door open. Moments later TWO OLDER LOOKING MEN 
           dressed in suits walk through.  

           One of the men is carrying a STAINLESS STEEL SUITCASE. 
           The two sit down at the table across from Thomas. The man 
           with the suitcase sets it down on the table and calmly 
           begins to open it. 

           This is SIMMONS, LATE 50s. His eyes quickly scan over the 
           paperwork he has removed from the suitcase. 

           Thomas sits there with his mouth hanging open as if he’s 
           perpetually about to ask a question.

           The SECOND MAN sits just a little further back from 
           Simmons. He stares right at Thomas, saying nothing. 

                                 SIMMONS
                                (still looking down 
                                 at the paperwork)
                        So...you are Thomas O’Mally...

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           After a few moments, Simmons realizes that Thomas isn’t 
           responding and looks up at him.

                                 SIMMONS (CONT’D)
                        Is that correct?

                                 THOMAS
                                (unsure)
                        Yes...

           Simmons shifts into a much more amicable tone.

                                 SIMMONS
                        Very good. I’m Deputy Administra-

           Simmons notices that Thomas is handcuffed.

                                 SIMMONS (CONT’D)
                        Jesus--can someone please get rid 
                        of the handcuffs?

           Simmons looks around and waves the guard in the tactical 
           gear over. The man takes out a set of keys and begins to 
           take off the handcuffs.

                                 SIMMONS (CONT’D)
                                (while the guard 
                                 removes the cuffs)
                        We had to put those on so you’d 
                        stop falling out of the 
                        chair...completely unnecessary now 
                        as long as you remain compliant. 

           The guard removes the second cuff. Thomas looks at 
           Simmons confused.  

                                 THOMAS
                        Where am I?

                                 SIMMONS
                        Well, as I was saying, I’m Deputy 
                        Administrator Simmons. 
                                (motioning to the 
                                 second man)
                        This is Mr. Radney, he’s here on 
                        behalf of the office of 
                        professional conduct. We’re with 
                        the United States drug enforcement 
                        administration.   

           Thomas looks at Mr. Radney who still hasn’t broken eye 
           contact or said anything.

           CONTINUED: (2)

                                 THOMAS
                        You’re DEA?

                                 SIMMONS
                        Yes, you clearly have an 
                        impeccable ability for deductive 
                        reasoning, Mr. O’ Mally, 
                        congratulations. 
                                (beat)
                        Now...I need you to tell me why 
                        you think we have you in custody, 
                        and please-  

           Simmons takes out a TAPE RECORDER places it in the middle 
           of the table and hits RECORD. 

                                 SIMMONS (CONT’D)
                        -don’t lie. Things will be much 
                        easier on both of us if you just 
                        tell us what really happened.

           Thomas looks down at the table, at this point he doesn’t 
           have any fight left in him physically or emotionally.

                                 THOMAS
                        ...Where do you want me to start?

                                 SIMMONS
                        I think you know where to start, 
                        Mr. O’ Mally. 

           Thomas lets out a deep breath. His eyes begin to water. 

                                 THOMAS
                        Last night... I had gone to dinner 
                        with my boss to celebrate some 
                        good news. 
                                (beat)
                        It wasn’t even good news, 
                        really...it was just the--
                        pathetic, potential of good news. 
                        We both had a few drinks and then 
                        after dinner I--I decided to drive 
                        home...  

           Thomas is getting animated, speaking almost to himself. 

                                 THOMAS (CONT’D)
                        Which, looking back was so stupid 
                        because I only did it to try and 
                        impress this fucking guy who at 
                        the end of the day is just a giant 
                        narcissistic asshole.

           CONTINUED: (3)

           Simmons and Radney watch on unaffected. An entire night 
           along with a decade of pent up emotions now begin to 
           breach the surface.

                                 THOMAS
                        On the drive home... I had just 
                        finished talking to my wife, 
                        Karen, when I...
                                (starting to get 
                                 emotional)
                        ...I hit someone. I looked up 
                        and...there he was...just standing 
                        in the middle of the road with his 
                        hands up in the air...
                                (motions with his 
                                 hands)
                        ...almost like he was trying to--
                        stop me or--warn me about 
                        something?
                                (beat)
                        I didn’t even have enough time to 
                        hit the brakes, I just smashed 
                        into him going full speed...and I 
                        killed him. It was an accident 
                        but...I killed him. 
                                (beat)
                        I got out of the car and went over 
                        to him, he looked like...some--
                        hobo, a nobody. Some guy who no 
                        one would ever notice was gone.  
                                (beat)
                        And that’s when I decided to try 
                        and get away with it. 
                                (beat)
                        I tried to get away with 
                        murder...and for what? So that I 
                        could go back and live my perfect 
                        little life and fight for some-- 
                        promotion? 
                                (beat)
                        I sold my soul for a pile of 
                        meaningless bullshit. So I could 
                        go on living some life I bought 
                        out of a fucking “Better Living” 
                        magazine? 
                                (beat)
                        I’m done trying to pretend that 
                        everything can go back to the way 
                        it was, because it can’t. I can’t 
                        change what happened, I can’t take 
                        back what I did...but maybe I’m 
                        not supposed to.

                        am going to be.
                                (beat)
                        But it starts with accepting the 
                        consequences of my actions. So... 
                        let’s just get this over with.  

           Simmons and Radney stare dumbfounded at Thomas.  

                                 SIMMONS
                        Huh-

           Simmons reaches over to the tape and stops the recording. 

                                 SIMMONS (CONT’D)
                        ...that was far more information 
                        than we needed from you, Mr. 
                        O’Mally. Though I suppose your 
                        honesty is something to be 
                        appreciated in this day and age. 

           Simmons removes a form from his suitcase and slides it 
           over to Thomas along with a pen. 

                                 SIMMONS (CONT’D)
                        Now that we’re all on the same 
                        page, if you could quickly read 
                        through that there and sign at the 
                        bottom we can all--wash our hands 
                        of this and be on our way.

           Thomas stares at the document, confused.

                                 THOMAS
                        ...what is this?

                                 SIMMONS
                        It’s a confidentiality agreement. 

                                 THOMAS
                        What for? I just confessed to you-

                                 SIMMONS
                        Yes. But as you said yourself, 
                        this was an accident. So if you 
                        just sign right there at the 
                        bottom agreeing to never disclose 
                        or openly discuss any of the 
                        events you witnessed last night or 
                        this morning then we have nothing 
                        left to discuss Mr. O’Mally. 

           Thomas’ mouth is hanging open again.

                        in a bit of a rush here.

                                 THOMAS
                        Did you not hear a word of what I 
                        just said? I killed a man. For 
                        god’s sake I killed one of your 
                        operatives!

           Simmons starts to pack up the suitcase.

                                 SIMMONS
                        Mr. O’Mally, these sort of 
                        mistakes happen all the time. We 
                        can’t hold civilians accountable 
                        for getting tangled in our rather 
                        sizeable web. Agent McCoy should 
                        never have been there for you to 
                        hit in the first place. At the end 
                        of the day our operation was still 
                        a success and no one got hurt.

                                 THOMAS

                        No one got hurt? I just watched 
                        more people die in one night than 
                        I’ve known in my entire life! I 
                        killed two people! I don’t want to 
                        just wash my hands of this! This 
                        happened to me for a reason, don’t 
                        you understand?!

           Beat.

                                 SIMMONS
                        I understand your frustration, Mr.

                        can’t reconcile that one for you. 

           Thomas stares at him bewildered. Simmons picks up the 
           suitcase.

                        you sign the form there. Good luck 
                        to you, Mr. O’Mally.

           The guard opens the door for Simmons who quickly leaves 
           the room.

           Thomas is left sitting in front of Mr. Radney who still 
           hasn’t moved a single facial muscle.

           As the door slowly slams shut we-

                                                                  CUT TO:

           INT. FEDERAL BUILDING - MORNING

           Thomas stands in front of a clerk’s desk watching an 
           OVERWEIGHT MAN type information into a computer. Thomas’ 
           demeanor looks like that of a man who has lost the will 
           to live.

           The clerk studies Thomas’ outfit as he types.

                                 CLERK
                        Looks like someone could’a used 
                        the day off, huh?

           Thomas stares at the man blankly. The clerk starts 
           laughing. 

                                 CLERK (CONT’D)
                        Shoot, I had me some crazy nights 
                        in my time too, brother, let me 
                        tell you. I wasn’ always sittin’ 
                        behind a desk like this. But when 
                        the bull bucks ye off ye just 
                        gotta get right back on, am I 
                        right, my friend?

           Thomas looks like he might be suffering some sort of 
           aneurysm. The clerk doesn’t seem to notice. 

                                 CLERK (CONT’D)
                        All right then, Mr. O’Mally, looks 
                        like everything checks out. Let me 
                        just get yer keys fer ya. 

           The clerk swivels his large body around, he opens a lock 
           box and takes out Thomas’ keys.

           EXT. FEDERAL BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER

           Thomas slowly shuffles across the parking lot towards his 
           car, which at this point looks almost as bad as he does.

           He walks around to the trunk and stands for a moment 
           staring at it in silence. There is definitely an 
           undeniable odor in the air around it.

           Thomas pushes down on his keyless entry and the trunk 
           slowly opens to reveal a DEAD COYOTE WITH A COLLAR lying 
           in the trunk-bed. 

           Thomas just stands there and stares at it.  

           INT/EXT. THOMAS’ CAR - DAY

           Thomas drives his car down the street, still in a daze. 

                                 RADIO

                        Phil just came over here crying 
                        about how he’s sorry that he threw 
                        up on your car or something?-

           Phil’s voice can be heard in the background of the 
           message.

                        back here and take care of this 
                        RIGHT NOW-

           Thomas hits the skip button.

                        Thomas, where are you, we have a 
                        meeting in the conference room in 
                        one hour. Christ, I thought you 
                        could handle a few drinks on a 
                        weeknight, remind me to buy you a 
                        little pink dress to go with those

                        Tom, it’s Rick Stevens. Look, I 
                        got the call from Clint this 
                        morning. Sounds like you two had 
                        one hell of a dinner. I just 
                        wanted to call and say...I respect 
                        you as a co-worker and--regardless 
                        of who ends up making partner, I’m 
                        looking forward to working with 
                        you either way. 
                                (beat)
                        Oh and by the way, just in case it 
                        ends up being you, I’ve totally 
                        been porking Karen for the last 
                        three weeks. And if it’s not--well 
                        then--sorry about that buddy. See 
                        you at work- 

           Thomas turns off the radio. He comes to a stop at a red 
           light. 

           Thomas looks to his left and sees a haggard OLD MAN 
           sitting on a bus bench across the street. The man’s head 
           is leaned up at the sky, his mouth hangs wide open, his 
           eyes stare blankly into the blazing sun. 
           INT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY

           Thomas walks through the halls of the law firm. As he 
           approaches his office his SECRETARY sees him, her eyes go 
           wide.

                                 SECRETARY
                        Mr. O’Mally?

           Thomas shuffles past her like a zombie and walks into his 
           office. 

           INT. THOMAS’ OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Thomas sits in his chair staring at the wall. His 
           secretary walks in. 

                                 SECRETARY
                        Mr. O’Mally-

           He slowly looks up at her. 

                                 SECRETARY (CONT’D)
                        ...they’re all waiting for you in 
                        the conference room. 

           INT. OFFICE BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER

           Thomas’ secretary leads him down the hall towards the big 
           double doors leading into the conference room. She stops 
           and KNOCKS on the door. After a moment she motions for 
           him to go inside. 

           Thomas opens the door-

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           -and walks in. 

           POP!

           A CHAMPAGNE CORK goes flying as THE ENTIRE FIRM EMERGES 
           from around the room.

                                 GROUP
                        SURPRISE!!!!!

           Thomas looks up and sees a LARGE BANNER hanging in front 
           of him that reads: “CONGRATULATIONS THOMAS!”

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

           Everyone jumps up and down and applauds Thomas, no one 
           seems to notice that he looks like an extra from THE 
           WALKING DEAD. 

           CLINT and KAREN make their way over. Karen jumps up and 
           wraps her arms around him. 

                                 KAREN
                                (ecstatic)
                        I’m so proud of you, baby!! 

           Karen forces a big wet kiss on him, but Thomas is still 
           utterly bewildered by the scene taking place all around 
           him.

                                 KAREN (CONT’D)
                        You had me worried sick last 
                        night, but after Clint told me the 
                        news I knew everything was going 
                        to be all right! I love you!!

           The office applauds and cheers enthusiastically. She 
           tries to plant another kiss but Thomas pulls away.

                                 THOMAS
                        What the hell is going on?

           Clint forces a glass of champagne into Thomas’ hand-

                                 CLINT
                        Congratulations, my little girl 
                        scout. The position is yours, 
                        signed, sealed and delivered.

           Clint clinks glasses with Thomas and starts to down his 
           champagne.

                                 THOMAS
                        Where’s Rick?

           Clint almost chokes on his champagne-

                                 CLINT
                                (loudly to Thomas 
                                 over the chaos)
                        --I almost forgot! They just found 
                        Rick dead in his condo with enough 
                        illegal drugs to feed half of 
                        Mexico! Who would’ve known?? 

                                 KAREN
                        What???

                                                               (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED: (2)

           Clint lets out a MANIACAL LAUGH and then slaps Thomas’ 
           back. 

                                 CLINT 
                        I told you he was a douchebag 
                        didn’t I, O’Mally??

           Karen begins to WEEP hysterically.

                                 CLINT (CONT’D)
                        Christ, Karen, get a hold of 
                        yourself-

           Karen continues to sob but her cries are lost in the 
           joyous celebrations. Clint lifts his glass to the entire 
           office.

                                 CLINT (CONT’D)
                                (toasting)
                        To Thomas!

                                 GROUP
                        TO THOMAS!!!!

           Everyone cheers and dances around and spraying champagne 
           on each other in the background like a bunch of lunatics. 

           Clint puts his arm around Thomas and then kicks his head 
           back and HOWLS LIKE A WOLF.

           The song “Tell All the People” by THE DOORS begins to 
           play as the camera slowly pushes in on Thomas’ BLANK 
           STARE until we- 

                                                           SMASH TO BLACK.
