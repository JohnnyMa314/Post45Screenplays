           EXT. JENSEN HOUSE BACKYARD (1993) - DAY

           A backyard BBQ party in full swing. Family. Friends. “HAPPY 
           21ST MIKE!” Laughter, drinking, children running around, 
           playing with a Labrador puppy. We pick up details as we move 
           through it all.

                                 TOM (V.O.)
                        At the end of the day, what are the 
                        things that make us feel safe? Make 
                        us feel like we’re in control? 

           An attractive, middle-aged woman, CHARLAINE, giving her son, 
           MIKE (21), a hug.

                                 TOM (V.O.)
                        A loving family? Good friends? A 
                        nice home?

           INT. KENWORTH TRUCK PLANT, LOCKER ROOM - MORNING

           Now moving past men in overalls, readying themselves for a 
           days work. 

                                 TOM (V.O.)
                        And work, too. Gives us a sense of 
                        purpose, a goal, something we can 
                        feel good at.

           A MAN stands with his back to us, (GARY), busying himself at 
           his locker. He takes out a protective MASK, closes his locker 
           and walks off down a corridor, holding it at his side.

           EXT. JENSEN HOUSE (1993) - DAY

           Moving out of the backyard now, along the side-passage to the 
           front of the house.

                                 TOM (V.O.)
                        Then there’s the rules of course. 
                        Not just the laws. The other rules. 
                        Spoken and unspoken.

           Through the front door, the quiet of the hallway. We pass 
           family photographs on the walls, framed police certificates.

                                 TOM (V.O.)
                        How we agree to behave. How we all 
                        rub along together. It’s a 
                        complicated business. Keeping it 
                        all working. 
           INT. KENWORTH TRUCK PLANT, LOCKER ROOM - MORNING

           We move slowly towards the locker we saw earlier. It’s locked 
           but there’s a gap where the door is bent out of shape.

                                 TOM (V.O.)
                        Sometimes, so complicated, we can 
                        forget there’s a whole other world 
                        out there, and that world doesn’t 
                        care what rules we make up, spoken 
                        or unspoken. It speaks a whole 
                        other language.

           Move closer to peer in through the gap.

           EXT. JENSEN HOUSE KITCHEN (1993) - DAY

           Out of the hallway and into the dark-wood panelled walls of 
           the lounge and kitchen. In contrast to the gloom hanging over 
           everything here, we see the backyard party in full swing 
           through the window.

                                 TOM (V.O.)
                        And even though we like to think 
                        we’re in control of our world, with 
                        our homes, and our rules, and our 
                        TV shows and all the rest...

           We realize someone’s in here, sitting alone, hidden in 
           shadow. He watches his family and friends beyond the window, 
           cut off from their talk and laughter. 

                                 TOM (V.O.)
                         ... in the end, we are all at the 
                        mercy of that other world.

           INT. KENWORTH TRUCK PLANT, LOCKER ROOM - MORNING

           Through the small gap in the metal door, a shaft of light 
           reveals a piece of paper stuck to the inside.

                                 TOM (V.O.)
                        And if we ever seem to forget that, 
                        it will always let us know...

            Written on it,”NO KILL. DON’T KILL.”
           EXT. JENSEN HOUSE, KITCHEN (1993) - DAY

           Close on TOM JENSEN,(40s) sitting in the darkness, almost 
           lost in it.

                                 TOM (V.O.)
                        ... always...

           INT. KENWORTH TRUCK PLANT - DAY

           Roiling ORANGE CLOUDS fill the screen. A MAN, (GARY), in 
           light-blue overalls, his face hidden by a spray-painter’s 
           PROTECTIVE MASK, slowly emerges through them. An alien 
           stepping out of some apocalyptic sky.

                                 TOM (V.O.)
                        ... and by any means necessary.

           He comes closer, begins to remove the MASK. Before we can see 
           his face, we CUT TO:

           TITLE (yellow on green) - “GREEN RIVER KILLER”   

           EXT. RIDGWAY HOUSE (AUBURN) BACKYARD (2001) - DAY

           A distorted, savage, animal noise. Sharp teeth and snapping, 
           slavering jaws. A POODLE stands in the yard, furiously 
           barking at something, as yet, unseen.

           INT. RIDGWAY HOUSE (AUBURN) KITCHEN (2001) - CONTINUOUS

           JUDITH RIDGWAY,(mid-50s), moves through the house towards the 
           back-door.

                                 JUDITH
                             (over the yapping)
                        Oscar! You stop that now! 

           EXT. RIDGWAY HOUSE (AUBURN) BACKYARD (2001) - CONTINUOUS

           OSCAR, the poodle, going crazy. JUDITH opens the screen-door.

                                 JUDITH
                        What in heaven’s name has gotten 
                        into you?

           There in the yard, bold but watchful, a large COYOTE, a DEAD 
           CAT hanging limp in its jaws. OSCAR quiets. JUDITH freezes. 
           COYOTE slowly moves towards her. Suddenly, a noise from the 
           front of the house sets OSCAR off again. The COYOTE stops.
                                 JUDITH (CONT’D)
                             (calling, frightened)
                        Gary? Is that you? Come quick.

           It begins to back out of the yard. JUDITH, eyes on the 
           COYOTE, pulls OSCAR back inside the house, shuts the door. A 
           KNOCK at the front. Holding OSCAR tight, she moves to the 
           front door. The shape of TWO FIGURES through the thick glass.

                                 DET. SUE PETERS (O.S.)
                             (slightly muffled)
                        Mrs. Ridgway?

           JUDITH warily moves closer to see who’s there.

                                 JUDITH
                             (nervous)
                        What do you want?

                                 DET. SUE PETERS (O.S.)
                        We need to talk to you about your 
                        husband.

           A pair of King County detective BADGES slam up against the 
           glass.

           INT. TASK FORCE OFFICE, REGIONAL JUSTICE CENTER (2001) - DAY

           Over BLACK SCREEN, the crackle of police radios. Disembodied 
           voices, like they’re speaking from the moon. Tense, hushed.

                                 VOICE 1
                        Do you see him? 

                                 VOICE 2 
                        Not yet.

                                 VOICE 1 
                        I want to know as soon as he’s out 
                        the exit, alright?

                                 VOICE 2 
                        Understood.

           A group of MEN stand totally still, silent, focused on the 
           voices coming out of the office RADIO. Tense, expectant.

                                 VOICE 1 (O.S.)
                        What’s happening? Someone talk to 
                        me. 

                                 VOICE 2 (O.S.)
                        Hold on. I think he’s on the move.
                                 VOICE 1 (O.S.)
                        Where is he? Is he leaving?
                             (pause)
                        Where is he?

                                 VOICE 2 (O.S.)
                        No visual yet.

                                 VOICE 1 (O.S.)
                        I need you to find him. Where did 
                        he go?

           No-one dares move in the office. One man, distinctive white 
           hair and full uniform, SHERIFF DAVID REICHERT, his eyes bore 
           into the radio.

                                 VOICE 2 (O.S.)
                        There he is... He’s coming out.

                                 VOICE 1 (O.S.)
                        Go, Mike!

                                 VOICE 2 (O.S.)
                        He’s coming out.

           We hear engines revving, squeal of tires. Then nothing. 
           Silence. It seems to go on forever. Eventually..

                                 VOICE 3 (O.S.)
                        We have one in custody. En route to 
                        the RJC.

           Cheers and relief from these detectives of the ‘GREEN RIVER 
           TASK FORCE’. This has been a long time coming.

                                 SHERIFF REICHERT
                             (immensely satisfied)
                        Gotcha, asshole.

           We realize TOM JENSEN, the man sitting in the darkened 
           kitchen earlier, is one of the men here, now in his 50s. 
           Tall, fair haired, moustache. No cheering or laughter for 
           him. 

           EXT. JENSEN HOUSE, KITCHEN (1993) - DAY

           TITLE - ‘EIGHT YEARS EARLIER”

           We’re back with TOM sitting in the dark, watching his son’s 
           21st birthday in the backyard. Through the window, MIKE 
           goofing around with his brother JEFF.
                                 TOM (O.S.)
                        Hey, Mike!

           MIKE turns to the sound of his father’s voice.

           EXT. JENSEN HOUSE, BACKYARD (1982) - DAY

           A much younger TOM carries a birthday cake out from the 
           kitchen. On the cake, the words: ‘HAPPY 10TH BIRTHDAY MIKE!”. 

           Little MIKE and JEFF stand wide-eyed as TOM approaches, 
           singing a lively “Happy Birthday”, CHARLAINE carrying 
           presents. A very different TOM makes the boys laugh, goofing 
           around with the cake, joking around, bathing in the warmth of 
           his family. 

           INT. JENSEN HOUSE, KITCHEN (1993) - DAY

           TOM sits alone in the dark, watching his now grown-up sons, 
           remembering. JIM DOYON,(late 40s) comes in from the hallway.

                                 DOYON
                        This is where you’re hiding. What 
                        you doing sitting in the dark, 
                        buddy? You okay?

                                 TOM
                        I’m good. Just, uh... needed a 
                        break from all that excitement.

           DOYON hands him a beer.

                                 DOYON
                        Here. Try not to get too excited 
                        now.

                                 TOM
                        I’ll try.
                             (pause)
                        I appreciate you coming, Jim. I’m 
                        sure Mike does.

                                 DOYON
                             (good-naturedly)
                        Oh, I’m real sure he appreciates a 
                        guy he’s never met before turning 
                        up at his birthday. It’s yours too 
                        though, huh?
                                 TOM
                        Few days. Charlaine thought it 
                        would be a good idea to have a 
                        joint party. If it means I don’t 
                        have to do anything else, I’m fine 
                        with it. I didn’t know she’d 
                        invited you, so... thanks.

                                 DOYON
                        Listen, any kid can make it to 
                        twenty-one with you as a father, 
                        deserves to meet me at some point.

           TOM nods. They look out the window, at the group outside. 
           Silence. 

                                 DOYON (CONT’D)
                        You sure you’re okay, pal?

                                 TOM
                             (nods, then..)
                        You ever talk to your family about 
                        Green River?

                                 DOYON
                             (takes a breath)
                        A little. You?

                                 TOM
                        Nah. Pretty bleak stuff..

           DOYON nods. They stand, drink their beers.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        I used to read them comic books at 
                        night. The boys. When I got off 
                        patrol. Batman, Superman, that kind 
                        of thing. Hero stuff. When I made 
                        detective, they thought it’d be 
                        like that. I tried to tell them it 
                        was mostly sitting at a desk, but I 
                        don’t think they believed me. And 
                        the rest of it, the real dark 
                        stuff, I try not to think about 
                        that myself, let alone make them 
                        have to listen to it. I never 
                        really felt like the hero type, did 
                        you? Even grew the moustache so I’d 
                        look a little tougher. Then I get 
                        asked to join the Green River Task 
                        Force. Remember how good that felt? 
                        To be one of the chosen ones?

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        Boy, I swear there were times I 
                        could hear my cape flapping behind 
                        me when I walked... It’s been a 
                        while since I’ve heard that sound. 
                        I guess they don’t write comic 
                        books about guys with good 
                        organizational skills and quick 
                        typing. I mean, don’t get me wrong, 
                        I’ll do anything to keep this case 
                        open. If it’s just me, on the end 
                        of a phone talking to crazy folks, 
                        then so be it. But, sometimes,... I 
                        wonder if I’ve still got it, 
                        y’know? 

           They stand silently looking out.

                                 DOYON
                        Tom, no one would blame you if you 
                        said you’d had enough. No one.

           TOM just carries on looking out the window.

                                 DOYON (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry I haven’t been able to 
                        help out much for a while.

                                 TOM
                        You don’t have to apologize...

                                 DOYON
                        Been wrapped up in this other 
                        case..

                                 TOM
                        Sure. We’re good.

                                 DOYON
                             (after a pause)
                        I just kinda need to be out there, 
                        catching bad guys, you know?

           TOM nods.

                                 DOYON (CONT’D)
                        Look, Tom, I’m pretty sure if you 
                        dropped Green River and put in for 
                        a promotion, you’d be a dead 
                        cert...

                                 TOM
                        This why Charl invited you, Jim?  
           TOM sees CHARLAINE looking towards the kitchen window, 
           concerned. DOYON shakes his head.

                                 DOYON
                             (not too convincing)
                        No... She’s just worried about you, 
                        I guess. About.. y’know, what it’s 
                        doing to you.

                                 TOM
                        I’d be more worried about what 
                        stopping would do to me. If I walk 
                        away, that’s it. There’s no one 
                        else. It’s over. But he’s still out 
                        there, Jim. He’s killed nearly 
                        fifty women, maybe more. Maybe a 
                        lot more. Still killing, for all we 
                        know. So...

           JIM doesn’t know what to say. They stand there in silence.

                                 ADAMSON (O.S.)
                        You have been hand-picked, each one 
                        of you, from across all 
                        departments, all precincts, because 
                        you are the best.

           INT. GREEN RIVER TASK FORCE H.Q., BURIEN (1984) - MORNING

           CAPT. FRANK ADAMSON(43), Task Force commander, addresses a 
           large room of people sitting in rows of plastic chairs. 
           Behind him, a board with PHOTOs of the dead and missing 
           women, MAPS of the area, etc.

                                 ADAMSON
                        And that is what this Task Force 
                        needs to be. The best. We have to 
                        stop whoever is out there killing 
                        these women. And we have to do it 
                        fast. 

           TITLE - “NINE YEARS EARLIER”

           Towards the back of the room, a younger TOM,(30s) sits next 
           to a younger JIM DOYON. As ADAMSON continues.

                                 DOYON
                             (offering his hand)
                        Jim.
                                 TOM
                             (shakes it)
                        Yeah, I know. We were at the 
                        academy around the same time. Tom.

                                 DOYON
                        Tom Jensen? The ‘Tom Jensen’?

                                 TOM
                             (thrown)
                        Uh... yeah, I guess? What’ve you 
                        heard?

                                 DOYON
                        Nothing, that’s just what it says 
                        on your nice sticker there.

           JIM points to the name badge stuck on TOM’s jacket.

                                 TOM
                             (smiles)
                        Right. Okay.

           Up front, ADAMSON calls someone over to him.

                                 ADAMSON
                        You all know Dave Reichert, lead 
                        investigator on this case. Go 
                        ahead, Dave.

           A young, dark-haired REICHERT (35), steps up. Handsome, 
           confident. The star quarter-back.

                                 REICHERT
                        The first five victims were 
                        discovered in or around the Green 
                        River in the Summer of ‘82. In the 
                        year and a half since then, bodies 
                        have been showing up in woods all 
                        over the county. All prostitutes, 
                        all strangled. Most just teenagers. 
                        Nearly all last seen working the 
                        area of Pacific Highway South 
                        commonly referred to as ‘The 
                        Strip’. 

           As REICHERT starts pointing out areas on a map.

                                 DOYON
                             (quietly)
                        Which department you from, Tom?

                                 TOM
                        Burglary. You?
                                 DOYON
                        Major crimes. It’s a shame this is 
                        only going to take a few months. 
                        High profile case, regular hours? 
                        Our wives might actually start 
                        talking to us again.

                                 TOM
                        Just hope they keep my place there 
                        for when this is over. 

           ADAMSON takes over from REICHERT, again.

                                 ADAMSON
                        Right now, the higher-ups are 
                        signing cheques for this, but, 
                        apparently, it’s hard to convince 
                        people an outbreak of murdered 
                        hookers is a threat to public 
                        safety. So, have no doubt that 
                        support will evaporate if we do not 
                        deliver results, soon. 

                                 DOYON
                             (quietly, to TOM)
                        Don’t worry, with everything we’re 
                        about to throw at this guy, you’ll 
                        be back in burglary before they 
                        even know you’re gone.

           INT. KENT POLICE STATION, JENSEN OFFICE (1993) - DAY

                                 TOM (O.S.)
                             (answering a call)
                        Green River. Detective Jensen 
                        speaking...

           TITLE - “NINE YEARS LATER”.

           At the end of many corridors, away from the bustle of the 
           main station, we find an isolated office. TOM,(40s), is on a 
           call.

                                 TOM (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Uh huh... How old did you say he 
                        was?... I see. Well, you know, the 
                        first bodies were found in the 
                        Green River eleven years ago. So, 
                        ma’am, that would have to mean your 
                        husband started killing prostitutes 
                        at the age of twelve... No, not 
                        impossible, but I would say 
                        unlikely...

                                 TOM (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        No, ma’am, the Green River Task 
                        Force hasn’t been in operation for 
                        three years now. It’s just me... 
                        Well, our understanding is that he 
                        stopped killing almost ten years 
                        ago, so... 

           DET. JIM DOYON stands in the doorway. TOM nods to him.

                                 TOM (CONT'D)
                        Listen, I am not going to come down 
                        and interrogate your husband. If I 
                        need to speak to him, I’ll be in 
                        touch, but don’t hold your 
                        breath... Rude? Well, I prefer to 
                        think of myself as ‘endearingly 
                        crabby’. Have a nice day.

           Puts down the phone. Shakes his head in disbelief.

                                 TOM (CONT'D)
                        You would not believe the amount of 
                        women out there who think they’re 
                        married to a serial killer.

                                 TOM
                        To what do I owe the pleasure, Jim?

                                 DOYON
                        We just found something out by the 
                        Racetrack. I think you should come 
                        take a look.

           EXT. WOODED AREA, NEAR SEATTLE INTERNATIONAL RACEWAY (1993) -  
           DAY

           Two men in the rain. The naked body of a dead WOMAN before 
           them, a ligature wrapped around her neck. 

                                 DOYON
                        Bring back happy memories?

           TOM, staring at the bleak sight in front of him, wipes the 
           rain off his face and feels an all too familiar dread.

           INT. KING COUNTY SHERIFF’S OFFICE, SEATTLE (1993) - DAY

           TOM sits opposite SHERIFF JAMES MONTGOMERY.
                                 SHERIFF MONTGOMERY
                        I’ve got to tell you, Tom, I think 
                        you’re reaching here. We all know 
                        he stopped in ‘84.

                                 TOM
                        Sir, I think there’s a strong case 
                        that a number of the bodies we’ve 
                        found in the last three years could 
                        turn out to be more Green River...

                                 SHERIFF MONTGOMERY
                        Tom, let me stop you there...

                                 TOM
                        All strangled, all found near dump 
                        sites he’s used before...

                                 SHERIFF MONTGOMERY
                        Let me ask you something. Do you 
                        realize what would happen if I was 
                        to say the Green River Killer was 
                        still active? Do you understand 
                        what a political nightmare that 
                        would be? 

                                 TOM
                        With respect, sir...

                                 SHERIFF MONTGOMERY
                        And the press go crazy if they 
                        smell anything to do with Green 
                        River. You know that.

                                 TOM
                        But I still think...

                                 SHERIFF MONTGOMERY
                        I’m not going down that road again, 
                        Tom. He stopped in ‘84.

                                 TOM
                        But what if...

                                 SHERIFF MONTGOMERY
                             (the final word)
                        He stopped in ‘84!

           INT. JENSEN HOUSE, KITCHEN (1993) - NIGHT

           TOM can’t sleep. He sits feeding scraps to JOEY, their 
           labrador puppy. CHARLAINE enters, in her robe.
                                 CHARLAINE
                        Can’t sleep?

                                 TOM
                        Did I wake you?

                                 CHARLAINE
                        I could hear you worrying.

           TOM attempts a smile.

                                 CHARLAINE (CONT’D)
                        I know it’s not what you do, but 
                        you can talk to me about... 
                        whatever.

           TOM nods. CHARLAINE looks at her poker-faced husband, trying 
           to read him.

                                 CHARLAINE (CONT’D)
                             (looking at JOEY)
                        Well, if you won’t talk to me about 
                        it, maybe talk to him. Just talk to 
                        someone, okay?

            Eventually, she goes to leave.

                                 TOM
                             (with difficulty)
                        Why would anyone want to hurt 
                        people so much?

           CHARLAINE stops, turns to listen.

                                 TOM (CONT'D)
                        Why would one human being want to 
                        cause so much misery, so much pain, 
                        to other human beings?

           She joins him at the table.

                                 CHARLAINE
                        I don’t know... but I don’t see him 
                        hurting a whole lot of men.

                                 TOM
                        Everyone wants to think he’s 
                        stopped, but... we keep finding 
                        bodies. Maybe the Sheriff’s right. 
                        It’s easy to find links. The more 
                        bodies there are, the easier it 
                        becomes. Doesn’t prove anything. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 TOM (CONT'D)
                        Let’s say he really hasn’t killed 
                        anyone in years, why start up 
                        again? Why now?

                                 CHARLAINE
                        Well... maybe because he doesn’t 
                        have the entire police force in the 
                        woods anymore, searching for him.

           TOM thinks about this.

           EXT. WOODS NEAR KEN’S TRUCK TOWN, NORTH BEND (1993) - DUSK

           TOM walking through the woods. Stops. It’s very quiet. Only 
           sound the wind, only movement the tree branches and leaves. 
           Looks around. Finds a spot, settles in for a long wait. 

           As the late afternoon light fades, TOM hears the occasional 
           noise, odd flashes of movement. A hidden world coming to 
           life. Not a human world. A sense of being watched. Unnerving. 
           The wind picks up. As it blows through the trees it becomes 
           magnified, violent, angry. TOM suddenly feels very out of 
           place. Very vulnerable. 

           Hurriedly getting into his car. It’s dark now. Turns the 
           radio on. Sits there breathing hard, the radio commercials 
           make him feel better. Thinks back to his meeting with the 
           SHERIFF the day before.

           INT. KING COUNTY SHERIFF’S OFFICE, SEATTLE (1993) - DAY

           TOM is listening as the SHERIFF wraps up the meeting.

                                 SHERIFF MONTGOMERY
                        I’m sure this is hard for you to 
                        hear, Tom, but the truth is, it 
                        looks like he got away with it. 
                        We’re never going to find him now.

                                 DOYON (O.S.)
                        Tom! 

           EXT. THE BUNKER, BOEING FIELD (2003) - DAY

           Older TOM (50s), stands in the parking lot outside a large, 
           squat CONCRETE BUILDING, smoking a cigarette, planes flying 
           overhead. He checks his watch. 

                                 DOYON (O.S.)
                        Tom! 
           Older JIM DOYON calls from the building. The roar of a plane 
           overhead means TOM doesn’t hear.

                                 DOYON (CONT’D)
                        Tom!

           The plane passes over, and TOM hears JIM. He turns.

                                 DOYON (CONT’D)
                        He’s here!

           TITLE over black screen.

           “TEN YEARS LATER. JUNE 13 2003, ‘THE BUNKER’ - DAY ONE” 

           INT. THE BUNKER, MAIN ROOM (2003) - DAY

           Headquarters for the Ridgway interviews, at the airport south 
           of Seattle. Work cubicles, filing cabinets, etc.  Photos, 
           maps on the walls and desks. Windows blacked out.

           TOM and DOYON, along with DETECTIVES, PROSECUTORS and STAFF, 
           watch as a group enter through the main door. Four heavily 
           armed SWAT TEAM MEMBERS, two plain clothed INTELLIGENCE UNIT 
           DETECTIVES, and three members of the Ridgway DEFENCE TEAM. 
           Somewhere, in amongst them all, the small figure of GARY 
           RIDGWAY(early 50s), in leg irons, handcuffs and waist irons. 
           A beige jacket over his prison issue outfit, big GLASSES, 
           moustache, and a baseball cap on his head.

           There to greet him, DET. RANDY MULLINAX and JIM GRADDON, the 
           new Task Force Captain. Everyone else keeps back at a 
           discrete distance.

                                 MULLINAX
                        Hello Gary. It’s good to see you 
                        again. Welcome to ‘The Bunker’.

                                 GARY
                        Thank you, Detective Mullinax. 
                        It’s, uh, good to be here.

                                 MULLINAX
                        This is Captain Jim Graddon, he’s 
                        the boss around here.

                                 GRADDON
                             (with a nod)
                        Gary.

                                 GARY
                        Sir.
                                 MULLINAX
                        And this is the rest of the crew.

           He gestures to the gathering. A strange air of awkward 
           politeness and forced pleasantry suffuses the room. 

                                 GARY
                             (with a smile)
                        Nice to see you all.

           A few awkward “Hi”s and perhaps the odd wave hello. 

                                 MULLINAX
                        Well... why don’t I show you where 
                        you’ll be staying. It’s this way.

           MULLINAX leads GARY off, escorted by his black uniformed 
           guards. TOM observes GARY walk through a room covered in 
           PHOTOs of the Green River victims.

                                 GRADDON
                             (calls him over)
                        Tom, come on over here.

           TOM joins them.

                                 GRADDON (CONT’D)
                        Tom, this is Gary’s defence team. 
                        Part of it anyways. Tony Savage, 
                        Mark Prothero and Todd Gruenhagen. 
                        This is Detective Tom Jensen. 

                                 PROTHERO
                        You new to this case, Detective?

                                 TOM
                        Not really.

                                 PROTHERO
                        Oh, I’ve handled criminal cases in 
                        King County for about twenty years 
                        now. Thought I knew just about 
                        every detective around.

                                 GRADDON
                        Well, y’see, this is the only case 
                        Tom’s worked the last twenty 
                        years...

                                 PROTHERO
                             (taken aback)
                        The only one...?
                                 GRADDON
                        C’mon, I’ll give you guys the 
                        nickel tour. If this whole deal 
                        falls apart, and we have to go back 
                        to trial, we don’t want you using 
                        any of this stuff here, so no 
                        peaking. 

           They follow GRADDON down the corridor, leaving TOM behind.

           INT. THE BUNKER, GARY’S ROOM (2003) - DAY

           MULLINAX is showing GARY his new living space, as his GUARDS 
           unshackle him. A small room with no windows, bare, off-white, 
           concrete walls. Mattress, chair, wall outlets taped over, 
           door taken off its hinges. A video camera attached to the 
           ceiling records his every move.

                                 MULLINAX
                        It’s not the Hilton, but I’ve seen 
                        worse. Hell, I’ve stayed in worse.
                        The interviews will start in a 
                        little while, Gary, so go ahead and 
                        make yourself at home.

                                 GARY
                             (upbeat)
                        Okay.

           INT. THE BUNKER, MAIN ROOM (2003) - DAY

           TOM joins DOYON watching from the end of the room, as 
           MULLINAX leaves GARY standing framed in the doorless doorway, 
           and a DESK is placed in front of it. Even though this is all 
           that stops GARY from leaving, the four tooled-up SWAT GUARDS 
           on duty at all times suggest he’s not going anywhere.

                                 TOM
                        Well, this isn’t weird at all.

                                 DOYON 
                        All serial killers end up living 
                        with the guys who’ve spent twenty 
                        years chasing them. Perfectly 
                        normal. 

           INT. THE BUNKER, GARY’S ROOM (2003) - DAY

           GARY sits on the edge of his make-shift bed. On GARY’s face, 
           thinking, remembering.
                                 JUDITH (O.S.)
                             (panicked)
                        Why is it taking so long, Gary? Are 
                        you sure this is all a mistake?

           INT. KING COUNTY JAIL, SEATTLE (2002) - DAY

           The previous year. JUDITH on one side of a glass partition, 
           GARY in his jail uniform on the other. They speak via a 
           telephone hookup. JUDITH has her palm against the glass.

                                 JUDITH
                        I hate this. It’s like you’re in a 
                        zoo. Won’t you put your hand on the 
                        glass?

                                 GARY
                        We need to get a divorce, honey.

           JUDITH drops her hand.

                                 JUDITH
                        Oh.

                                 GARY
                        It’s what the detective said. I 
                        have to make sure you’re protected.

           This hangs over them both. GARY looks at the small microphone 
           near the glass.

                                 GARY (CONT'D)
                        Judith, I didn’t do what they’re 
                        saying, but... but I do have a 
                        problem. With prostitutes. Dating 
                        them, I mean. I’m not proud of it.

                                 JUDITH
                        I don’t understand. You said you 
                        were done with all that.

                                 GARY
                        I’m not a bad person, honey. I’m 
                        not. This is so hard. I never 
                        thought it was possible for me to 
                        have what you’ve given me. 

                                 JUDITH
                             (shakes her head, in 
                              tears)
                        Gary, that man was on the TV again, 
                        saying he’s going to get you the 
                        death penalty. Is that true? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JUDITH (CONT'D)
                        Can they do that? Don’t let them, 
                        Gary. Don’t let them kill you. 
                        Please. I don’t know what I’d do. 
                        Really I don’t. Please... 

           On GARY, as he watches JUDITH sob, uncontrollably.

                                 SHERIFF REICHERT (O.S.)
                        He wants to make a deal.

           INT. THE BUNKER, CONFERENCE ROOM (2003) - DAY

           TOM, DOYON, MULLINAX and the rest of the Task Force are 
           sitting around the large table, some standing.

                                 SHERIFF REICHERT
                        Full confession in exchange for 
                        dropping the death penalty.

                                 MULLINAX
                        He’s owning up to the seven bodies 
                        the DNA ties him to?

                                 SHERIFF REICHERT
                        No. He says he’ll confess to them 
                        all. Forty-eight counts of murder. 

           The room reacts excitedly to this.

                                 GRADDON
                        And that’s not all. His defence 
                        team are saying in exchange for 
                        life imprisonment, Ridgway will 
                        take us to bodies we haven’t found 
                        yet. More victims.

                                 TOM
                        How many more?

                                 SHERIFF REICHERT
                        Maybe dozens...

                                 DOYON
                        Jesus...

                                 MULLINAX
                        This is great!

           Everyone is very enthusiastic about this.

                                 SHERIFF REICHERT
                        Yes... Yes, it is. But... we have 
                        one fairly major obstacle.
           INT. KING COUNTY COURTHOUSE, SEATTLE (2001) - DAY

           Standing at a microphone-covered podium, the imposing figure 
           of NORM MALENG is holding a post-arrest press conference.

                                 MALENG
                             (forcefully)
                        As the Prosecutor for King County, 
                        let me make one thing very clear - 
                        in the case of Gary Ridgway this 
                        office will not plea bargain with 
                        the death penalty.

           INT. KING COUNTY PROSECUTOR’S OFFICE (2003) - DAY

           A Task Force delegation of REICHERT, GRADDON, TOM, MULLINAX, 
           PETERS, MATTSEN and DOYON, sit across from MALENG’S trusted 
           advisors, MARK LARSON and DAN SATTERBERG.

                                 SATTERBERG
                        If the Prosecutor were to take this 
                        deal, you do realize he could never 
                        justify giving the death penalty 
                        ever again.

                                 LARSON
                        If Ridgway doesn’t deserve it, then 
                        who does?

                                 GRADDON
                        I can see that..

                                 SATTERBERG
                        A lot of people fond of the Death 
                        Penalty round here. As an elected 
                        official, it could prove costly for 
                        him. 

                                 SHERIFF REICHERT
                        Well, this case has cost King 
                        County taxpayers a huge amount 
                        already. A trial this size, nearly 
                        fifty murders, that’s millions more 
                        of voter’s tax dollars.

                                 SATTERBERG
                        He says when it comes to deciding 
                        the death penalty, the budget’s not 
                        a factor, just the crime. The money 
                        doesn’t matter.

                                 SHERIFF REICHERT
                        The money always matters.
           They don’t show it, but this has landed.

                                 LARSON
                        The mission of this office is 
                        justice. And justice must be seen 
                        to be done.

                                 MULLINAX
                        It’s not just about justice for 
                        Ridgway though, is it? What about 
                        his victims? And their families? 

                                 PETERS
                        Sure, we have enough to see him die 
                        for the seven the DNA proves he 
                        killed, but that would leave more 
                        than forty, maybe a lot more, we’d 
                        never be sure about. Don’t those 
                        families deserve to know what 
                        happened to their daughters, their 
                        sisters... mothers? 

                                 DOYON
                        And the ones we haven’t found yet? 
                        They’ve spent twenty years some of 
                        them, not knowing where their 
                        daughters are, if they’re still 
                        alive or not. 

                                 MATTSEN
                        Those young women deserve to have 
                        the world know what happened to 
                        them.

                                 SHERIFF REICHERT
                        We could give them some peace, 
                        maybe. A proper burial. Don’t they 
                        deserve that? After twenty years?

           LARSON and SATTERBERG take all this in, poker-faced.

                                 TOM
                        I don’t think any of us would say 
                        he deserves to live. We just want 
                        him to give us answers more than we 
                        want to see him dead. If what 
                        Ridgway claims is true, we have an 
                        unprecedented opportunity here - to 
                        get inside the head of the most 
                        prolific serial killer in American 
                        history. I know this deal will 
                        cause you all kinds of problems, 
                        but imagine what we could learn. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 TOM (CONT'D)
                        It might even stop another Ridgway 
                        from ever happening again. If we 
                        could do that, then maybe all the 
                        suffering, all the lives wasted, 
                        everything this has cost, maybe it 
                        could all mean something. That 
                        would be justice. 

           INT. THE BUNKER MAIN ROOM (2003) - DAY

           Back to the day of GARY’s arrival. From his workspace, TOM is 
           watching GARY in his make-shift cell at the other end of the 
           room. A few DETECTIVES stand nearby, watching also. 

                                 DETECTIVE 1 
                        I can’t believe I have to look at 
                        this sick fuck every day at work 
                        now.

                                 NOONEY
                        He has an IQ of what?

                                 CHANG
                        Like eighty-two, or something...

                                 NOONEY
                        Eighty-two. I’ve had dogs with 
                        higher IQ’s. He’s practically a 
                        retard. 

           MULLINAX walks over.

                                 MULLINAX
                        He fooled us and everyone else for 
                        twenty years, remember? Not too 
                        shabby for a ‘retard’. Tom, Sheriff 
                        wants us in the conference room 
                        before it gets started.

           INT. THE BUNKER, CONFERENCE ROOM (2003) - DAY

           GRADDON and SHERIFF REICHERT address the INTERVIEW team - 
           MULLINAX, PETERS, MATTSEN and TOM. 

                                 SHERIFF REICHERT
                        The rights and wrongs of this thing 
                        don’t matter anymore. We have a 
                        gentleman in the next room waiting 
                        to tell us he’s the Green River 
                        Killer, and you four have been 
                        chosen to handle these interviews. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 SHERIFF REICHERT (CONT'D)
                        Let’s hear what he has to say, pick 
                        up those extra bodies he’s gonna 
                        tell us about, and then we can all 
                        go home. Case closed.

                                 GRADDON
                        Before we start, I just want to 
                        remind you. We get one shot at 
                        this. If this falls apart, for any 
                        reason, and it becomes public 
                        knowledge that Gary Ridgway was 
                        making a deal to confess, no jury 
                        in the world could be impartial. 
                        We’d have a hard time getting a 
                        trial, and we’d have made the 
                        biggest fuck-up in the history of 
                        fuck-ups. There is no margin for 
                        error. I know how important this is 
                        to you all. Some of you have been 
                        on this case a very long time. 

           On TOM, listening.

                                 GRADDON (CONT'D)
                        So, I warn you now, if at any point 
                        we feel like one of you is not up 
                        to this, if any one of you lets 
                        your own personal feelings get in 
                        the way, or jeopardizes, for any 
                        reason whatsoever, what we’re 
                        trying to do here, then you will be 
                        taken off this team immediately, no 
                        questions asked, and you will play 
                        no further part in these 
                        proceedings. Is that clear? 

           The TEAM take this in. TOM tries not to show any nerves. 

           INT. THE BUNKER, PROSECUTION VIEWING ROOM (2003) - LATER

           On a MONITOR SCREEN we see GARY sitting in the INTERROGATION 
           ROOM ready to start the first interview. Across the table 
           from him is Prosecuting Attorney, JEFF MCDONALD, reading from 
           a file, VIDEO CAMERA on a tripod beside him. To one side, at 
           another table, sits MARK PROTHERO,(GARY’s defence attorney). 

           We hear MCDONALD over a live-feed, as we realize this is 
           being watched by a room full of DETECTIVES, including 
           MULLINAX, MATTSEN, PETERS, DOYON and TOM. 
                                 MCDONALD (O.S.)
                        “The time is approximately 4:03 
                        P.M. on Friday, June 13th, 2003. 
                        Present are...”

                                 MATTSEN
                        It’s Friday the 13th? You’re 
                        kidding me.

                                 DOYON
                        If he pulls out a hockey mask, I’m 
                        getting the hell outta here!

           Enter SHERIFF REICHERT and GRADDON. The room quiets.

                                 GRADDON
                        Once Brian’s done going over the 
                        formalities in there with him, 
                        we’ll get started.

           INT. THE BUNKER, INTERROGATION ROOM (2003) - CONTINUOUS

                                 MCDONALD
                        Mr. Ridgway, in your previous 
                        appearances before the court, you 
                        have pled not guilty to these 
                        crimes. Is that correct?

                                 GARY
                        Yes.

                                 MCDONALD
                        It is our understanding that you 
                        are now prepared to confess that 
                        you are responsible for the deaths 
                        of forty-eight women in total, and 
                        several additional women whose 
                        bodies have not yet been found. Is 
                        this accurate?

                                 GARY
                        Uh, it’s.. Well, it’s around.. or, 
                        uh, pretty close.

                                 MCDONALD
                        Is it accurate or not?

                                 GARY
                        It depends on how many they... not 
                        100 percent sure. I mean 99.9 
                        percent.
                                 MCDONALD
                        As to what?

                                 GARY
                        ...is forty-eight.

                                 MCDONALD
                             (confused)
                        That is the number ‘forty-eight’?

                                 GARY
                        It is.

                                 MCDONALD
                        It is what?

           GARY looks confused and worried. Everyone is thrown. This 
           wasn’t part of anyone’s plan. MCDONALD looks over at 
           PROTHERO. Sort your guy out.

                                 MCDONALD (CONT’D)
                        Perhaps you should take a moment to 
                        consult with your attorney?

           INT. THE BUNKER, PROSECUTION VIEWING ROOM (2003) - CONTINUOUS

                                 SHERIFF REICHERT
                        I’m completely confused. Can 
                        someone please explain to me what 
                        the hell is going on?

                                 TOM
                        I think he’s worried about being 
                        tied to a specific number. If we 
                        don’t find them all, then he’s 
                        worried he might be back on death 
                        row.

           INT. THE BUNKER, INTERROGATION ROOM (2003) - CONTINUOUS

           GARY turns back to MCDONALD after talking with PROTHERO.

                                 GARY
                        Okay.

                                 MCDONALD
                             (unsure)
                        So, where are we?
                                 GARY
                             (points to the file)
                        I believe it says in there, I 
                        recall forty-eight to fifty-three?

                                 MCDONALD
                        Is that the ambiguity you have, 
                        about the number of murders you’ve 
                        committed?

                                 GARY
                        Uh, yes, it is. I think.

                                 MCDONALD
                        So it’s somewhere between forty-
                        eight and fifty-three?

                                 GARY
                             (looks at PROTHERO, he 
                              nods)
                        Yes, it is.

                                 MCDONALD
                        Okay.

           INT. THE BUNKER, PROSECUTION VIEWING ROOM (2003) - CONTINUOUS

           SHERIFF REICHERT looks around at everyone, confused.

                                 SHERIFF REICHERT
                        He said it, right? He just admitted 
                        he’s the Green River Killer.

                                 TOM
                             (quite a moment)
                        Yes, he did. Now we just have to 
                        get him to prove it.

           A GUARD enters and nods to GRADDON, who turns to MULLINAX and 
           TOM. 

                                 GRADDON
                        Tom? Randy? You’re up.

           They both go to leave. TOM feels the eyes of GRADDON and 
           REICHERT on him as he exits to make his way to the first 
           interview.

                                 MCDONALD (O.S.)
                        Gary Ridgway, we are prepared to 
                        accept your confession... 
           INT. THE BUNKER, CORRIDOR (2003) - DAY

           TOM and MULLINAX walk down the corridor.

                                 MCDONALD (O.S.)
                        ... provided that you furnish our 
                        detectives with complete, truthful 
                        and candid information about your 
                        crimes within King County...

           TOM hears a phone ring in a nearby office. Remembers...   

           INT. JENSEN HOUSE, KITCHEN (2001) - DAY

           Two years earlier. Someone is leaving a message on the answer 
           machine to an empty kitchen. Through the window we see TOM in 
           the early stages of building his deck.

                                 HIMICK (V.O.)
                        “Detective Jensen, this is Beverly 
                        Himick at the Washington State 
                        Police Crime Lab. We need to meet.”

           The loud BEEP at the end makes TOM look up, out back.

           INT. THE BUNKER, MAIN ROOM (2003) - CONTINUOUS

           On TOM, as he and MULLINAX walk through the main workspace, 
           watched by everyone there. 

                                 MCDONALD (O.S.)

                        victims.

           INT. KING COUNTY SHERIFF’S OFFICE, SEATTLE (2001) - DAY

           TOM sits opposite SHERIFF REICHERT, holding a folder.

                                 TOM
                        As you know, he didn’t leave us 
                        with much DNA to work with. And the 
                        stuff we did get was impossible to 
                        test with the technology at the 
                        time. But things have moved on a 
                        lot, so earlier this year I sent 
                        samples from three of our possible 
                        suspects.

           They look at each other. The room is starting to crackle.
                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        They’ve found a match for two of 
                        the River girls. Marcia Chapman and 
                        Opal Mills. 

           TOM places photographs of the BODIES down as he names them.

                                 TOM (CONT'D)
                        Which means it’s statistically 
                        probable that Cynthia Hinds was 
                        placed there by the same man. 

           TOM points her out next to MARCIA under the river. REICHERT 
           has stopped breathing.

                                 SHERIFF REICHERT
                        But that’s just three. What about 
                        the ones we found on land? There’s 
                        a lot more of them. That doesn’t 
                        help us tie him to those. 

           TOM takes a photograph out of his folder.

                                 TOM
                        The lab also believes it can match 
                        the same suspect... to Carol 
                        Christensen.

           He shows a photograph of CAROL with a PAPER BAG over her 
           head, her arms placed across her abdomen, a FISH across her 
           throat, another over her left breast, SAUSAGE MEAT on top of 
           her left hand, and an empty, green WINE BOTTLE between her 
           legs.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        It’s a very good start.

            TOM takes out an envelope and pushes it across the desk to 
           REICHERT. They look at each other.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        His name is in there.

                        Gary Ridgway, if you fail to prove 
                        your claims, we will move forward 
                        to trial. 
           TOM and MULLINAX pass TONY SAVAGE and TODD GRUENHAGAN at the 
           monitors. They sit with headphones on, behind CHANG and 
           NOONEY, the A.V. guys.

           TOM and RANDY walk towards the GUARDS outside the INTERVIEW

                                 MCDONALD (O.S.)
                        Where you will be tried for the 
                        original seven counts of 1st degree

           INT. TASK FORCE OFFICE, REGIONAL JUSTICE CENTER (2001) - DAY

           TOM sits in GRADDON’S office.

                                 GRADDON
                        Once we make the arrest on Friday, 
                        we can’t let him get away because 
                        of jury doubts about DNA. We’re 
                        going to need a full confession. We 
                        get maybe a few hours with him  
                        before he gets lawyered up, so I 
                        want skilled interviewers in there. 
                        Who do you think it should be? 

                                 TOM
                        That’s easy. Me.

                                 GRADDON
                        I don’t think that’s a good idea, 
                        Tom.

                                 TOM
                             (shocked)
                        What?!

                                 GRADDON
                        You haven’t interrogated a suspect 
                        like this in years. You’re going to 
                        be rusty, of course...

                                 TOM
                        Rusty?! I’ve spent more time on 
                        this case than any...
                                 GRADDON
                        I know how personal this is for 
                        you, Tom. We need cool heads in 
                        that room.

                                 TOM
                        There’s no one here better...

                                 GRADDON
                             (firm)
                        You won’t be taking part in the 
                        arrest or the interview, Tom. I’m 
                        sorry. That’s the way it’s going to 
                        be.

           TOM, swallowing down his frustration, trying to be calm.

                                 MCDONALD
                        Do we have an understanding?

                                 GARY
                        Yes, we do.

           TOM, standing with the other DETECTIVES as they hear GARY 
           being arrested over the radio. (The scene we saw earlier.) 
           Close on TOM, wishing he was there.

           INT. REGIONAL JUSTICE CENTER, HOLDING ROOM (2001) - EVENING

           Post arrest, GARY sits on a plastic chair, being questioned 
           by an increasingly frustrated DOYON and MULLINAX. 

           Unseen behind the TWO-WAY MIRROR, TOM watches. THE DIGITAL 
           CLOCK CHANGES TO “7:10”. MULLINAX speaks into the air, 
           knowing he’ll be heard.

                                 MULLINAX
                        He wants a lawyer. Bring him the 
                        phone book.

           TOM’s head drops. Wishing he’d had his chance.
           INT. THE BUNKER, OUTSIDE INTERVIEW ROOM (2003) - CONTINUOUS

           TOM and MULLINAX are handing their side-arms to the SWAT guys 
           guarding the door to the Interview Room.

                                 MCDONALD (O.S.)
                        Okay. Let’s bring in the 
                        detectives.

           The DOOR opens, and we’re looking at GARY sitting there, 
           waiting. On TOM, his chance arrived.

                                 MULLINAX
                             (to TOM)
                        Show-time.

           And now we’re moving into the room, and the man we’ve waited 
           a very long time to get answers from is looking up at us.

           INT. THE BUNKER, INTERVIEW ROOM (2003) - CONTINUOUS

           MULLINAX and TOM sit opposite GARY.

                                 MULLINAX
                        Gary, I believe you’ve met my 
                        colleague, Tom Jensen.

                                 TOM
                        Gary.

                                 GARY
                        Detective.

                                 TOM
                        How you doing today?

                                 GARY
                        Yeah, pretty good. Everyone’s been 
                        real nice. Real civilized.

                                 TOM
                        Well, Gary, we’d like to start with 
                        the additional victims, that you 
                        say we never found.

           He starts to spread a large map over the table.
                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        The longer these bodies remain out 
                        there, the more chance they could 
                        be dragged off by animals or 
                        covered up by construction, that 
                        kind of thing. So... where do we 
                        start?

           GARY looks at the map, a little lost.

                                 GARY
                        Uh... It’s hard, y’know, ‘cause I 
                        wasn’t planning on killing any of 
                        ‘em. And it was a long time ago 
                        now, ‘cause, remember, I stopped in 
                        ‘85 once I met Judith. Meeting 
                        Judith changed everything...

                        Well, just tell us about the first 
                        one you remember, and where it is?

                        The first woman I ever killed? I 
                        always thought that was Coffield...

                        Gary, Ms. Coffield is one of the 
                        seven murders you’re currently 
                        charged with. Let’s not talk about

                        If this deal doesn’t work out, 
                        you’ll still be tried on those 
                        counts, and it’s up to them to 
                        prove you guilty.

                                 TOM
                        Gary, I just want to make sure you 
                        understand what’s going on here. 
                        You’re making some pretty big 
                        claims. Saying you’ve killed a lot 
                        of women. The DNA evidence proves 
                        you killed seven. So that means, 
                        right now, we’ve only got your word 
                        for the rest of them. If you want 
                        to stay alive, like you say you do, 
                        you have to give us something that 
                        proves it really was you who did 
                        all that. You understand? Prove 
                        you’re not just making this up to 
                        avoid the death penalty.

                                 GARY
                        Making it up. I understand.

                        If we find out you’re wasting our 
                        time here, that’s a very serious 
                        business. There’s a lot of families 
                        been waiting a long time to know 
                        the truth. And if it wasn’t you, 
                        that means whoever did do it is 
                        still out there.

                                 GARY

                        Okay. So let’s just go with the 
                        ones you’re saying we haven’t found 
                        yet. That would prove you know 
                        things only the man who did all 
                        this could know. Got it? 
                                 GARY
                        Okay. Well, the furthest I ever 
                        went was uh, over by the Fall City 
                        exit, off of I-90. There’s one over

                        You’ve given us about a dozen 
                        locations there, you must remember

                        It’s been a long time. I stopped in 
                        uh, in ‘85, like I said.

                                 TOM
                        There’s no possibility any of this 
                        is going into ‘86, or...?

                        Okay. Let’s try something else. 
                        Gary, can you tell us a little 
                        about how the killings would 
                        happen?

                        Well, it would always happen in the 
                        middle of the ‘date’ because 
                        something went wrong and I’d 
                        snap...

                                 TOM

                        from the start.

                                 GARY
                        Okay. Well, I’d pick up a... one of 
                        the ladies up, in my truck, and 
                        we’d agree to go for a ‘date’, 
                        y’know... to have sex.

                                 MULLINAX

                        the woods, or somewhere. Sometimes, 
                        just the back of my truck. And we’d 
                        start to have sex, but if she 
                        starts hurrying me, or it don’t 
                        feel right ‘cause she’s not into 
                        it, or she’s lyin’ to me, y’know... 
                        ’cause I had a lot of rage in me at

                        women... times I wouldn’t stand up 
                        for myself. Well, I would feel the 
                        rage coming and, eventually, they’d 
                        make me snap.

                                 MULLINAX

                         And then I’d choke ‘em.

           Again, the hands. TOM watching him.

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                             (slight pause)
                        Anyway, that’s how I killed ‘em.

                        Didn’t mean to. It just, uh... just 
                        happened.

           TOM’s eyes fixed on him. GARY gives him an eager smile.

           EXT. BOEING FIELD PERIMETER (2003) - EVENING

           TOM stands near to a fence overlooking the airport runway. He 
           smokes a cigarette and watches the planes coming in. The 
           landing lights make the obscured planes look ghostly as they 
           move slowly through the heavy, low-hanging, grey cloud.

                                 SHERIFF REICHERT (O.S.)
                        We’ve waited a long time for this 
                        day, you and me.

           TOM is joined by the SHERIFF.

                                 SHERIFF REICHERT (CONT’D)
                        Couldn’t have hoped for better.

                                 TOM
                        They find anything yet?

                                 SHERIFF REICHERT
                        No, but we’ll start again tomorrow.

                                 TOM
                        So... am I still on the team?

                                 SHERIFF REICHERT
                             (smiles)
                        You put your case forward that you 
                        should be in that room, and you 
                        convinced us. You’ve earned it. Now 
                        we need to get it done, quickly and 
                        smoothly. Put this whole thing 
                        behind us. Right? 

           TOM doesn’t answer. 

                                 SHERIFF REICHERT (CONT'D)
                         Yes, you’re still on the team.

           TOM nods. They stand in silence for a little. 

                                 SHERIFF REICHERT (CONT’D)
                        I guess it’ll be strange for you to 
                        work on another case after this?
                                 TOM
                        Once this is over, I’m done. I 
                        never want to see another dead 
                        girl’s face looking up at me, ever 
                        again.

           REICHERT nods. They watch a plane come in. Hidden, wreathed 
           in cloud, lights searching for the runway.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        What if it’s not quick, Dave? Or 
                        smooth?

                                 SHERIFF REICHERT
                        What do you mean?

                                 TOM
                        What if he’s not telling us the 
                        truth? What happens then?

                                 SHERIFF REICHERT
                        He’s the Green River Killer. All 
                        the evidence says it. And now he’s 
                        saying it. Why would he lie to us 
                        now? 

                                 TOM
                        I don’t know, I’m just asking, what 
                        if he is lying? About the rest of 
                        them, I mean. What happens then? 

                                 SHERIFF REICHERT
                        That makes no sense! He’s the one 
                        who wants to do this... 

                                 TOM
                        But we can’t trust this guy! Just 
                        because he says...

                                 SHERIFF REICHERT
                        Right here, this is what we’re 
                        concerned about, Tom. Look, I get 
                        it. I want to punch this little 
                        sonuvabitch in the face every time 
                        I see him. Worse, even. But we 
                        can’t. We take him out tomorrow, 
                        start collecting bodies, we get our 
                        proof and we can finish it. After 
                        twenty years, we can finish this. 
                        And if you can just control 
                        yourself, you’ll see this through 
                        to the end. I need you in there 
                        with him, Tom, but you’ve got to 
                        have total control over him. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 SHERIFF REICHERT (CONT'D)
                        That’s what it’s all about. How are 
                        you going to control someone else, 
                        if you can’t control yourself?

           EXT. JENSEN HOUSE, FRONT PORCH (2003) - EVENING

           CHARLAINE stands on the front stoop, gardening gloves on, and 
           meets TOM as he gets home, briefcase and a bag of fast food 
           in his hands. She hugs him. JOEY, now quite elderly, next to 
           her.

                                 CHARLAINE (O.S.)
                        So, how was your first day?

                                 TOM (O.S.)
                        Yeah, pretty good.

           INT. JENSEN HOUSE, KITCHEN - NIGHT

           TOM sits at the kitchen table eating his burger and fries out 
           of the bag in front of him. CHARLAINE brings him a plate, 
           knife and fork. JOEY waits patiently, eyeing the food.

                                 CHARLAINE
                        The work you’ve done in the 
                        bathroom so far looks great. How 
                        much longer ‘til you’re done in 
                        there, y’think?

                                 TOM
                        I was hoping to spend some time 
                        this weekend, but... 

                                 CHARLAINE
                        Oh, Mike called. He asked if we 
                        could have the kids Sunday?

                                 TOM
                        Well, I... uh, might be tied up 
                        over the weekend... with the case. 
                        So... 

                                 CHARLAINE
                        Shall I say you might be working 
                        and leave it at that?

                                 TOM
                        Sure... Whatever you say, just 
                        don’t mention Gary. To anyone.
                                 CHARLAINE
                        I know, I know...

                                 TOM
                        If the press finds out we have him 
                        living in our office, negotiating a 
                        plea deal...

                                 CHARLAINE
                        It won’t be good, I know. Don’t 
                        worry. I will try to curb my 
                        natural tendency to gossip when I 
                        meet the other washer-women at the 
                        water-pump. Ketchup?

           Mouth full he shakes his head. Gives JOEY a fry.

                                 CHARLAINE (CONT'D)
                        So..? What’s he like?

           TOM thinks.

                                 TOM
                        I don’t know. Bland. Just... bland. 
                        Him and his wife, they go to swap 
                        meets. Love their poodles. Go 
                        camping in an RV. He’s the last 
                        person you’d think was a serial 
                        killer.

                                 CHARLAINE
                        I guess that’s how he got away with 
                        it. No-one expected the Green River 
                        Killer could be so normal.

                                 TOM
                        We still don’t know that he is. 
                        “The Green River Killer”. Not for 
                        sure.

                                 CHARLAINE
                        You don’t know? You’re the one who 
                        caught him! If you don’t know, who 
                        does?

                                 TOM
                        The DNA says he probably killed 
                        seven of the women. Right now, 
                        that’s all we know. We just have 
                        his word for the rest of it.

                                 CHARLAINE
                        I’m no expert but isn’t that called 
                        a confession? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 CHARLAINE (CONT'D)
                        You know, bad guys make them when 
                        they’ve been caught and they know 
                        the game is up?

                                 TOM
                        I don’t... It just...

                                 CHARLAINE
                        What?

                                 TOM
                             (after a few beats)
                        He says he started killing in ‘82, 
                        and stopped after he met Judith, 
                        his third wife, in ‘85. Just like 
                        everyone has always said.

                                 CHARLAINE
                        1985? I guess she saved a lot of 
                        women’s lives then, huh? Over 15 
                        years worth...

                                 TOM
                        So, Mr. Totally-Normal-Average-Guy 
                        goes on a killing rampage for three 
                        years, kills more women than anyone 
                        before, and then just stops. Loses 
                        the taste for it. Decides he likes 
                        poodles more than killing 
                        prostitutes. He was so dumb as a 
                        kid he was going to be put in the 
                        special needs school. At his work 
                        they call him “Wrong-Way Ridgway”, 
                        he messes up so much. The guy’s an 
                        idiot. But he somehow manages to 
                        avoid getting caught by every major 
                        police force in the area, plus the 
                        FBI. Then, after twenty years, when 
                        he is caught, he just can’t do 
                        enough to help us. Falling over 
                        himself. It just doesn’t add up.

                                 CHARLAINE
                        At this point, after everything 
                        you’ve been through, I don’t think 
                        you’d be satisfied unless he sat 
                        there in front of you with horns 
                        and a tail.  Give yourself a break, 
                        honey. You caught him, and now he 
                        just wants to come clean.

                                 TOM
                        Then why is he lying?
                                 CHARLAINE
                        ...what?

                                 TOM
                        One of the undiscovered bodies he 
                        gave us today? I already found her, 
                        back in ‘93, out at Seattle 
                        International Raceway. But he 
                        doesn’t know that, because she was 
                        never on the list. They wouldn’t 
                        let me put her on there.

           INT. THE BUNKER, MAIN ROOM (2003) - NIGHT

           MULLINAX crossing the MAIN ROOM with a bag of fast-food, 
           heading for GARY, who sits at the desk that blocks his room. 
           MULLINAX passes one of the GUARDS.

                                 GUARD 1
                        Well, look at that. Room service 
                        for our guest?

                                 MULLINAX
                             (as he passes)
                        Yup.

                                 GUARD 1
                        Nice. What’d you get for me?

                                 MULLINAX
                             (looks back)
                        How many you kill?

           INT. JENSEN HOUSE, KITCHEN (2003) - NIGHT

           CHARLAINE leans across for one of TOM’s fries. 

                                 CHARLAINE
                        But, that proves he’s telling the 
                        truth, not that he’s lying. He gave 
                        you one you already found.

                                 TOM
                        Patricia Barczak disappeared in 
                        October of ‘86. A year and a half 
                        after he swears he stopped killing.

           INT. THE BUNKER, GARY’S ROOM (2003) - NIGHT

           MULLINAX takes the food out for GARY.
                                 MULLINAX
                        Got you something from Joanne’s. 
                        Ever been there?

                                 GARY
                        Sure. Used to take Judith there 
                        when we first started dating. 
                        Pretty good. 

           GARY starts eating the food.

                                 MULLINAX
                        Get some rest, okay? Field trip 
                        starts early tomorrow. Let the 
                        guards know if you need that heated 
                        up.

                                 GARY
                        Thanks. I appreciate it. 

           INT. JENSEN HOUSE, KITCHEN (2003) - NIGHT

                                 CHARLAINE 
                        So... what are you thinking?

                                 TOM
                        I don’t know. 

           INT. THE BUNKER, GARY’S BATHROOM (2003) - NIGHT

           GARY stands at the sink, brushing his teeth. We see the 
           GUARDS in the mirror waiting at the door.

                                 TOM (O.S.)
                        The more I think about it, the more 
                        I don’t know what to think about 
                        this guy.

           GARY looking at himself in the mirror.

           INT. JENSEN HOUSE, KITCHEN (2003) - NIGHT

                                 TOM
                        But there’s so much pressure to 
                        wrap this up, get it over with. 
                        I’ve spent the best part of my 
                        career looking for Gary Ridgway. 
                        It’s not enough for me to see him 
                        put away. I need answers.
           INT. THE BUNKER, GARY’S ROOM (2003) - NIGHT

           GARY lays on his bed. He’s holding up a creased photograph of 
           him and JUDITH on holiday together, looking at it.

                                 GUARD 1 (O.S.)
                        Lights out. Goodnight.

                                 GARY
                        Goodnight.

           As GARY lowers the photograph, there is someone standing 
           there before him, in his room. A WOMAN with a paper bag over 
           her head, her arms crossed over her chest, holding a live 
           fish in each hand. Red wine spreads across the floor towards 
           him, from the green bottle at her feet.

                                 TOM (O.S.)
                        And he’s the only one who has them.

           GARY is plunged into the dark.

           EXT. ‘THE STRIP’, PACIFIC HIGHWAY SOUTH (1984) - NIGHT

           We’re now entering the amphetamine, neon-glamour of the 
           stretch of road serving the round-the-clock needs of Sea-Tac 
           airport’s human traffic - ‘The Strip’. In all its desperate 
           glory. 

           TITLE over black - “FEBRUARY, 1984 - ‘THE STRIP’.”

           The strange alien light, neither day nor night, washes over 
           us at last, and we feel our heart-beat quicken. Motels, honky-
           tonk saloons, fast-food joints, used-car lots, junk stores, 
           gas stations, billboards, gem shops and truck garages, all 
           battling each other to take whatever they can from whoever 
           will part with it. It’s like a drug-fuelled ‘pioneer town’. 
           And women everywhere. Girls really. Children. Offering the 
           temporary use of their bodies to us.  

           We watch them as we pass, slowly. We miss nothing. Cruising. 
           ‘PATROLLING’. Their faces. Their movements. Looking for the 
           signs. The ‘tells’. Like a shark moving through an ocean 
           teeming with prey. “Like candy in a dish.” 

           As we wait at the lights, we look out of the side window and 
           see a girl, MARY (16) a slight distance away, standing alone. 
           She waves to us in slow-motion, a strange, SLOW WAVE, that 
           will become familiar to us. We keep our eyes locked on her as 
           the lights change and we move off.
           INT. FAST-FOOD JOINT, ‘THE STRIP’ - LATER

           We’re sitting in the window of a fast-food place at a small 
           strip-mall. In the distance, on the other side of the road 
           from us, we watch MARY as she tries to attract customers. 

           EXT. SOUTH 144TH STREET, ‘THE STRIP’ - CONTINUOUS

           MARY is about sixteen, African-American, wearing very little 
           and feeling the cold. The fast-food joint in the distance. 
           From where MARY is, we see GARY sitting in the window sipping 
           on a coffee and watching her.

           INT. FAST-FOOD JOINT, ‘THE STRIP’ - CONTINUOUS

           GARY watches the action on ‘The Strip’ from this perfect 
           vantage point.

           EXT. ‘OLD FOREST’ - DAY

           We suddenly get a FLASH IMAGE of a FOREST standing before us, 
           under a cold, grey sky.( We’ll call it the ‘OLD FOREST’.) Its 
           darkened entrance a portal into another, hidden world. 
           Ancient, wild, uncivilized. Unfeeling. We begin to move 
           towards it.

           EXT. SOUTH 144TH STREET, ‘THE STRIP’ - LATER

           We’re with MARY, trying to see into CARS as they pass, 
           looking for business. 

           Everything slows down, strange, dream-like. A BUSINESSMAN in 
           a rental car drives by. He looks MARY up and down as he 
           passes, appraising her. 

           A TAXI-CAB  with a sleazy looking driver who leers at her. 

           A car with an OLDER WOMAN in the passenger seat, her face 
           searching, haunted. She holds up a picture of a young girl 
           against the window for MARY to see, the WOMAN’s eyes silently 
           pleading, and then she’s gone. 

           A PICK-UP TRUCK WITH A CAMPER SHELL on the back. We see GARY 
           looking out the window, waving a handful of money in slow-
           motion at MARY, and then pointing down the road. His TRUCK 
           pulls into a shadowy PARKING LOT further down the block.
           EXT. PARKING LOT, ‘THE STRIP - MOMENTS LATER

           MARY walks up to GARY’s TRUCK, looks in the open window.

                                 MARY
                        Hi. How ya doin?

                                 GARY
                        I’m doin’ real good, thanks.

                                 MARY
                        You lookin’ for a date?

                                 GARY
                        Could be.

           She opens the door and gets in.

                                 MARY
                        You’re lucky, I was just about to 
                        finish for the night. It’s cold out 
                        there.

           He shows her his ID. Next to his photo, a picture of his son, 
           MATTHEW.

                                 GARY
                        So, now you know I’m not a cop, you 
                        wanna beer?

           Slab of beers at his feet. She sees a child’s toys and action 
           figures around the truck. He’s got a kid, he’s safe.

                                 MARY
                        Sure.

           They crack their beers and take a sip. They share a small 
           laugh. This guy seems real nice.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        I’ve only done this a few times 
                        before. 

                                 GARY
                        I figured. You look pretty new. 
                        What are you, about fifteen?

                                 MARY
                        Sixteen.

                                 GARY
                        You doin’ ok? You need some food or 
                        anything? 
                                 MARY
                        I’m okay. Thanks though.

                                 GARY
                        I can go get you some coffee? 
                        That’ll warm you up.

                                 MARY
                             (little laugh)
                        That sounds pretty good.

                                 GARY
                        O-kay, then. Show me your titties 
                        or your pussy.

           She’s thrown momentarily.

                                 MARY
                        What...?

                                 GARY
                        I’ve been stung by them decoy cops 
                        before. Just need to make sure.

           Hesitantly, she starts to pull up her top.

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                        Can’t be too careful these days, 
                        y’know?

           INT. INTERVIEW ROOM, BURIEN PRECINCT (1984) - DAY

           CLOSE on the face of a bearded man being interviewed.

                                 BEARDED MAN
                        They are a fuckin’ plague and their 
                        diseased little pussies should be 
                        sewn up, y’know what I’m saying? 
                        This is God’s vengeance.

           INT. INTERVIEW ROOM, BURIEN PRECINCT - DAY

           A thin, buttoned up, soft-spoken man now.

                                 THIN MAN 
                        Women will always use men to get 
                        what they want, that is a fact. 
                        They are programmed to deceive. You 
                        can’t argue with science.
           INT. INTERVIEW ROOM, BURIEN PRECINCT - DAY

           Now, a man with a pony-tail.

                                 PONY-TAIL MAN
                        What do they expect? It goes with 
                        the job. C’mon, you’re telling me 
                        you’re not happy there’s a few less 
                        whores out there for you to deal 
                        with? 

           INT. GREEN RIVER TASK FORCE HEADQUARTERS, BURIEN (1984) - DAY

           A NOTICE-BOARD displays photos of the dead and the missing. 
           Under ‘DECEASED’, we see twelve faces and four JANE DOEs. 
           Under ‘MISSING’, we see another eight faces.

                                 TOM (O.S.)
                        There’s a lot of men out there who 
                        want to hurt women. 

           The headquarters, now fully operational, is full of activity. 
           TOM, and BRUCE PETERSON sit opposite sides of a desk, going 
           over interview transcripts.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        These “sick-trick” interviews? It’s 
                        like turning over a rock and 
                        watching all the bugs come 
                        scuttling out.

                                 PETERSON
                        This is one hell of a big rock.

           DOYON approaches.

                                 DOYON
                        I’ve been going over the missing 
                        persons reports for last year, and 
                        it looks like there could be four 
                        more to go up.

           He lays out four photos on their desk.

                                 DOYON (CONT'D)
                        These three are nineteen years old, 
                        this one fifteen. Not one of them 
                        been heard from for over a year.

                                 TOM
                        Why the hell had nobody looked at 
                        these before?
                                 PETERSON
                        Unless they’re known prostitutes, I 
                        guess they’ve been low priority. Do 
                        you know how many runaways are 
                        being reported every day?

                                 TOM
                        You think they might be our Jane 
                        Does?

                                 DOYON
                        Their dental charts just came back 
                        from Haglund, and he says they 
                        don’t match any of the 
                        unidentifieds so far. 

                                 TOM
                        So these could be four new victims 
                        still out there?

           INT. CAPTAIN’S OFFICE, TASK FORCE H.Q., BURIEN (1984) - DAY

           CAPTAIN ADAMSON sits at his desk, with the girl’s photos in 
           front of him. Silently, he shakes his head.

                                 ADAMSON
                        A year older than my son, this one.

                                 TOM
                        Yeah.

                                 ADAMSON
                        In less than a year, we’ve gone 
                        from six murders to a possible 
                        twenty-nine? 

                                 TOM
                        With these four, I make that twenty-
                        eight.

                                 ADAMSON
                        As of today, I’m putting Carol 
                        Christensen on the official list. I 
                        know not everyone agrees, but I’m 
                        doing it. I want you and Jim to go 
                        talk to her family before the press 
                        start sniffing around.

           EXT. HOLMIN RESIDENCE, HOQUIAM (1984) - DAY

           A five-year-old girl, SARAH, sits, playing in a sand-pit.
                                 MRS.HOLMIN (O.S.)
                        She stopped asking about her after 
                        a couple months. Doesn’t talk about 
                        her at all anymore.

           TOM and JIM stand with CAROL CHRISTENSEN’s mother, PATRICIA 
           HOLMIN. They watch Carol’s daughter playing over in the sand-
           pit.

                                 MRS.HOLMIN (CONT'D)
                        People always say children are so 
                        adaptable. Like that’s a good 
                        thing. Where does it all go? That’s 
                        what I worry about, you know?

                                 TOM
                             (delicately)
                        Your daughter was last seen in an 
                        area well known for prostitution. 
                        All the other victims...

                                 MRS.HOLMIN
                        Carol had made some poor choices in 
                        the past, but she was trying real 
                        hard to make things better for her 
                        and Sarah. When she got the 
                        waitress job, we were so happy. 
                        Meant we could see the baby a 
                        little more, too. Careful what you 
                        wish for. She was trying real 
                        hard... 

           Little SARAH looks up from her sand-pit. As she gazes over at 
           TOM, we see her face for the first time.

           INT. UNMARKED POLICE CAR (1984) - EVENING

           JIM behind the wheel. TOM looking at a photograph in the 
           CHRISTENSEN FILE, as they travel along the highway.

                                 TOM
                        Are we sure she’s really Green 
                        River? Everything about her case is 
                        irregular. 

                                 DOYON
                        I know.

                                 TOM
                        It just doesn’t seem to fit.
           And we see the photograph now. CAROL is laying fully clothed 
           upon the ground, with the bag over her head, the fish, meat, 
           the wine bottle.

                                 TOM (CONT'D)
                        What the hell did he do to her?

           INT. CARETAKER HUT, LITTLE LEAGUE FIELD (1984) - DAY

           Over darkness, we hear the whining of a DOG, and scratching 
           of claws on wood.

                                 CARETAKER (O.S.)
                        Quit that noise, y’hear? I’m 
                        comin’, I’m comin’!

           The door opens and there, framed in the light of the open 
           door, is a whining DOG. In its mouth a large bone.

                                 CARETAKER (CONT’D)
                        What ya got there, boy?

            In the background, we see a Little League field.

           EXT. LITTLE LEAGUE FIELD, NORTH AIRPORT SITE (1984) - DAY

           The ROAR of a plane over-head, as its huge SHADOW passes over 
           the field, and the Task Force members standing on it.

                                 ADAMSON
                             (trying to talk over it)
                        Turns out it’s a human leg bone... 
                        LET THIS PLANE PASS!

           About a DOZEN Task Force members stand waiting for the noise 
           to stop. They all wear BRIGHT GREEN WINDBREAKERS with ‘GRTF’ 
           in YELLOW on the back. Among them is TOM, DOYON, PETERSON, 
           PETERS and REICHERT. Bags of GARDENING TOOLS at their feet. 
           They stand still and silent, as TOM watches the wind blow 
           through the trees in the surrounding WOODS. What might be 
           waiting in there? An odd hiatus. The plane passes.

                                 ADAMSON (CONT'D)
                        As you know, we found a body last 
                        August by the water tower.

           We see the WATER TOWER behind, amongst the trees.

                                 ADAMSON (CONT'D)
                        So it seems we missed one. The rest 
                        of the skeleton is in the gully 
                        over there. Dave?
                                 REICHERT
                        Okay, the scouts will be here soon. 
                        In the meantime, grab something you 
                        can use and let’s go.

           EXT. WOODED AREA, OFF LITTLE LEAGUE FIELD (1984) - DAY

           The Task Force hack their way through thick brush and 
           branches.

           TOM is kneeling, using a sifting TRAY to look for trace 
           evidence in the soil, paper sheets and evidence bags around 
           him. 

                                 HAGLUND (O.S.)
                        I’m telling you, decomposition is 
                        our best friend, right now. The 
                        chemical change over time in a 
                        corpse left somewhere wild like 
                        this does all kinds of interesting 
                        things to the surrounding area. You 
                        see how those branches have turned 
                        yellow there, the vegetation too? 
                        That’s the decomposing body making 
                        the soil in the area real acidic. 
                        Limits growth too. 

           BILL HAGLUND, from the Medical Examiner’s office, kneels in 
           his neat, white overalls, lovingly tending to a set of 
           DECOMPOSED SKELETAL REMAINS, partially buried in the mud. The 
           area around it, and the over-hanging branches above, are 
           indeed YELLOW. A strange, eerie sight.

                                 HAGLUND (CONT’D)
                        Okay, look out.

           HAGLUND puts a mask over his face, and starts to work the 
           yellow soil. As PETERSON puts an arm across his face.

                                 PETERSON
                        Get ready...

                                 TOM
                        Why, what’s... Aargh! What is that?

           TOM recoils, gagging at the horrendous smell.

                                 HAGLUND
                             (through the mask)
                        Gas from the corpse gets trapped in 
                        the soil. I just released it. You 
                        never smelled a dead body before, 
                        detective?
           He hasn’t. Just stares at the remains, appalled.

                                 REICHERT (O.S.)
                             (calling over)
                        Guys? We’ve got another one!

           On TOM’s face, as he looks up at REICHERT calling to them 
           from the ridge, above.

           INT. TASK FORCE MINI-VAN, INTERSTATE 90 (2003) - MORNING

           And we’re still on TOM’s face, only it’s now 19 years older.

                                 TOM
                        How’d you sleep, Gary?

           TITLE over black - “JUNE 14, 2003 - DAY TWO”

           EXT. INTERSTATE 90 (2003) - MORNING

           A CONVOY of vehicles moving along the winding Interstate. A 
           few unmarked POLICE CARS, black SUVs, and a grey MINI-VAN.

           INT. TASK FORCE MINI-VAN, INTERSTATE 90 - MORNING

           GARY sits next to RANDY MULLINAX, and beside him, NOONEY, the 
           video man, recording everything with his CAMERA. TOM in the 
           seat behind, next to CHANG, the sound man. MIKE BROWN 
           driving, a SWAT guy next to him, and MARK PROTHERO and one of 
           the PROSECUTOR’s in the seats behind them. They’re all in 
           civilian clothes.

                                 GARY
                             (taking in the view)
                        Not too good. Woke up a few times. 
                        Thinking about the, uh, the 
                        killings, y’know? 

                                 TOM
                        Sure.

                                 GARY
                        Bad memories.

           TOM weighing him up.

                                 TOM
                        Right.
                                 PROTHERO
                        Have you thought about what happens 
                        if anyone sees us out here? Or 
                        recognizes Gary? 

                                 MULLINAX
                        That’s why we’re out here so early, 
                        Mark. Hopefully no-one will be 
                        around. Look, if anyone asks, we’re 
                        just a bunch of guys looking at 
                        some real estate.

                                 GARY
                             (pointing at the camera)
                        Or maybe making a movie? Like a Tom 
                        Cruise movie.

                                 TOM
                        Let’s stick with real estate.

           EXT. WOODS NEAR INTERSTATE 90/HIGHWAY 18 INTERSECTION - 
           MORNING

           The CONVOY has pulled off the empty road, parked up near the 
           entrance to a heavily WOODED AREA. TOM stands on the grass, 
           watching GARY being helped out of the MINI-VAN by SECURITY, 
           handcuffed. All in regular clothes, fleeces, hoodies, etc.

                                 TOM
                        You going to be okay walking in 
                        those shoes?

           We see GARY’s JAIL BOOTIES, and his legs shackled.

                                 GARY
                        Maybe we could stop by K-mart 
                        later, get some boots, just in 
                        case?

                                 PROTHERO
                        I don’t think we’ll be going shoe 
                        shopping today, Gary. 

                                 TOM
                        So, yesterday you said you left a 
                        body here that we never found. 
                        Still sure about that?

                                 GARY
                        Yes. This is where I went in. 
                        Definitely. Good view of the road, 
                        both directions.
           On GARY looking into the WOODS.

           Suddenly a FLASH image of the ‘OLD FOREST’. From behind, we 
           see GARY and a young WOMAN (TINA, 22) walking side-by-side 
           towards it.

           Back with GARY again, looking at the less dream-like WOODS 
           before him. 

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                        Absolutely. She’s going to be right 
                        up in there. Quite certain.

                                 TOM
                        Okay. 

           TOM looks over to MULLINAX and the others. Here we go...

                                 TOM (CONT'D)
                        Well... take us to her, Gary.

           Gestures into the woods. GARY shuffles off into the trees, 
           aided by his GUARDS. One of the SWAT TEAM stays at the 
           entrance keeping watch. TOM follows. 

           EXT. 90/18 WOODS - MORNING

           GARY leads them deeper, alert, alive. TOM, watching him.

           EXT. 90/18 WOODS - MOMENTS LATER

           GARY stands, looking around, trying to get his bearings.

                                 MULLINAX
                        This looking familiar, Gary?

                                 GARY
                        Sure. It’s just been awhile, 
                        y’know?

           TOM and MULLINAX share a look.

                                 TOM
                        So, what do you remember about this 
                        girl? 

                                 GARY
                        Uh...

                                 TOM
                        Do you remember where you killed 
                        her?
                                 GARY
                        In my house. My old house. That’s 
                        where I was most comfortable doing 
                        it.

           EXT. RIDGWAY HOUSE, DES MOINES (1983) - DAY

           We see a static, wide shot of the squat, single-storey house 
           where GARY killed most of his victims. 

                                 GARY (O.S.)
                        Sometimes they wouldn’t want to 
                        come in, so we’d sit outside in my 
                        truck and I’d say, “Well, here’s 
                        ten dollars for your trouble”, but 
                        they’d see I had another thirty or 
                        forty on me, and they’d figure, 
                        “What the hell”, y’know? 

           EXT. 90/18 WOODS - MORNING

           GARY looking around for something familiar, as he speaks.

                                 GARY
                        The money didn’t matter ‘cause I’d 
                        get it back after I killed them, 
                        anyway.
                             (with a smile of 
                              embarrassment)
                        I know, I’m cheap...

           Suddenly, GARY becomes hyper-alert. He’s completely still, 
           every sense alive to something unseen. It’s unsettling.

                                 TOM
                        What is it?

                                 GARY
                        Someone’s coming.

           Everyone looks around, nothing. Eventually, back through the 
           trees, TOM sees a PASSERBY walking his DOG along the road 
           towards the OFFICER standing guard at the entrance to the 
           WOOD. TOM quietly alerts the others.

           Everyone stands silently watching. The PASSERBY has a brief 
           conversation with the OFFICER, then moves on his way. TOM 
           looks at GARY. How did he know?

                                 GARY (CONT'D)
                        It’s this way.
           Starts shuffling ahead. TOM walks just behind.

                                 TOM
                        Once you got them inside the house, 
                        what happened then?

           We see GARY’s old house again. We start to move in slowly 
           towards it. As GARY speaks, we cut between this moving shot, 
           and GARY in the woods.

                                 GARY
                             (focus on his 
                              surroundings)
                        I’d let them take a look around, 
                        make sure they saw my son’s room, 
                        all his toys on the floor and such, 
                        they’d loosen up, y’know? Family 
                        man ain’t gonna hurt them, kind of 
                        thing. I’d tell them to go use the 
                        bathroom if they needed to. Save me 
                        cleaning up after them, later. I 
                        learned that lesson the hard way.

           EXT. RIDGWAY HOUSE, DES MOINES (1983) - DAY

           Moving slowly closer to the seemingly lifeless house and its 
           front screen-door.

                                 GARY (O.S.)
                        Then we’d go in the bedroom, and 
                        I’d get them naked. I didn’t want 
                        anything getting on their clothes 
                        for you guys to find. There was a 
                        plastic sheet under the bed waiting 
                        for them, so afterwards I could get 
                        them out real quick. Anyway, I’d 
                        get them on the bed, and then we’d 
                        have sex.

           EXT. 90/18 WOODS - MORNING

           The group moving slowly through the woods.

                                 GARY
                        Then I’d, uh.. I’d kill her. Choke 
                        her from behind, like I said. Got a 
                        pretty good system, after a while. 
                        In and out in about twenty minutes, 
                        if I was lucky.
           EXT. RIDGWAY HOUSE, DES MOINES (1983) - DAY

           Almost up to the door now.

                                 GARY (O.S.)
                        Except one time. There was one that 
                        tried to get away. She scratched my 
                        arm, and bit real hard, she was 
                        strong. I had to let go and she ran 
                        off. Got all the way to the front 
                        door.

           And as we reach the screen-door, we see a BLURRED FIGURE 
           behind the thick glass of the FRONT DOOR, desperately 
           scrabbling at it, trying to get out, and hear MUFFLED effort 
           noises. We see another SHAPE appear behind the glass. A brief 
           struggle, and the FIGURES move down to the floor. Eventually, 
           they’re still, and only one rises.

                                 GARY (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        That was real close.

           EXT. 90/18 WOODS - MORNING

           GARY has led them to an OPEN MARSHY AREA.

                                 GARY
                        I’m pretty sure it was this one. 
                        Afterward, I got her into my truck, 
                        and I dumped her right over there.

           He points into the MARSH. MATTSEN, PETERS and a few others 
           move off to take a closer look.

                                 TOM
                        You didn’t bury her? Because some 
                        of the others were buried.

                                 GARY
                        Not this one. I’m quite certain.

                                 MATTSEN
                             (calls back)
                        I’m not seeing anything.

                                 DOYON
                        Not surprising. It’s been twenty 
                        years.

                                 PETERS
                             (walking back)
                        We should bring in a crew for a 
                        more thorough search.
                                 GARY
                        Wait. Maybe I did bury her...

           GARY thinking.

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                        Or maybe I’m thinking of someone 
                        else. You guys found another one 
                        not far from here?

                                 TOM
                             (guarded)
                        Uh huh.

                                 GARY
                        Maybe she was the one who tried to 
                        run...

                                 TOM
                        Are you saying you didn’t leave a 
                        body here after all?

                                 GARY
                        No. I’m sure I did. Because I 
                        distinctly remember coming back and 
                        taking her skull, to put it 
                        someplace else...

           This gets everyone’s attention.

                                 TOM
                        Okay. Why did you do that?

                                 GARY
                        Uh, I don’t know. To, uh, mess with 
                        you guys, maybe. Confuse you, I 
                        guess... maybe.

                                 TOM
                        You like to mess with us, Gary?

           GARY not sure how to react. TOM stares at him. REICHERT 
           observing TOM. PROTHERO breaks the moment.

                                 PROTHERO
                        I think we should move to the next 
                        location.

                                 MULLINAX
                        Sure. We should keep things moving 
                        before there are too many people 
                        around, anyway.
           They all start to move back to the vehicles. TOM holds back, 
           looking out at the area. DOYON approaches him.

                                 DOYON
                        Just another day at the office, 
                        huh?
                             (looks out at the marsh)
                        Sue’s right. If there are bones 
                        here, they’d be buried pretty deep 
                        by now.

           TOM nods, looking around, unsure.

                                 GARY (O.S.)
                        Over here, maybe.

           EXT. VACANT LOT, SOUTH AIRPORT SITE (1983) - DAY

           Twenty years earlier. Empty, abandoned houses, reclaimed by 
           the wild. A pair of FERAL EYES stare out from a dark, 
           windowless opening. GARY’s parked TRUCK, empty in the vacant 
           lot nearby.

                                 TRUDY (O.S.)
                        C’mon, let’s just do it here. My 
                        feet are killin’ me.

           EXT. WOODS NEAR VACANT LOT, SOUTH AIRPORT SITE (1983) - DAY

           A younger GARY (34), and a young woman in a denim jacket, 
           TRUDY (19), walk along a trail through some WOODS. Behind 
           them, through the trees, we see GARY’s truck parked in the 
           vacant lot.

                                 GARY
                        Just, uh... just a bit further. 
                        There’s a real nice spot. You’ll 
                        like it, it’s real nice.

                                 TRUDY
                        That place we parked back there. 
                        What is that? All those creepy 
                        houses...

                                 GARY
                        Once the airport started using 
                        jets, it got too loud. They had to 
                        clear everyone out those houses. 
                        Now they’re just empty, full of 
                        animals...
                                 TRUDY
                             (she stops suddenly)
                        What the fuck is that? Is that a 
                        body?

           GARY stops. Just off the trail a few yards ahead, there is a 
           NAKED WOMAN laying among the trees.

                                 GARY
                        What...

                                 TRUDY
                        Jesus fucking Christ! That is a 
                        dead woman right there. Fuck! It 
                        is, right? 

           GARY looks over at the body. Confused. 

                                 TRUDY (CONT'D)
                        Shit... let’s get outta here!

           She starts back up the trail. GARY stands, looking around, 
           worried.

                                 TRUDY (CONT'D)
                        Come on! We should get the fuck out 
                        of here. He might still be 
                        around...

           GARY takes one more look at the body, then follows TRUDY back 
           to the truck. 

           EXT. WOODS, STAR LAKE ROAD SITE (1984) - DAY

           A distant FIGURE stands alone. Younger TOM, motionless in the 
           landscape, head bowed. A large, dark TREE, its leafless 
           branches reaching out like desperate arms, frames him against 
           the stark, grey sky behind. The only movement, loose ends of 
           police crime scene TAPE flapping in the breeze. A light RAIN 
           falls. 

           CAPTION - “APRIL 1, 1984 - STAR LAKE SITE”

           A steep, WOODED HILLSIDE falling away from the road above, 
           covered in illegally dumped TRASH. “NO DUMPING ALLOWED” sign 
           in the middle of it. Large amounts of GARBAGE accumulated in 
           the gully below. Yellow ‘CRIME SCENE’ tape going from tree to 
           tree, marking out the entire area.

                                 PETERSON (O.S.)
                        Makes perfect sense for our guy. 
                        Secluded, woodsy. Easy access from 
                        the road up there. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 PETERSON (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        He can just roll them down the 
                        hill, like they’re garbage. Simple.

           A SKULL, debris and litter all around. A small metal marker 
           with ‘1’ written on it, marks the spot.

                                 PETERSON (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Four bodies, separate spots, so 
                        probably dumped at different times.

           Most of a SKELETON lays up against a tree stump, surrounded 
           by trash. A marker says ‘2’.

                                 PETERSON  (CONT'D)
                        Looks like we’ve found ourselves a 
                        new ‘cluster site’, huh?

           Close on TOM, looking down, lost in what he’s seeing.

                                 PETERSON (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        You even listening to me, Tom?

           Now we see what TOM solemnly stands before. At the foot of 
           the tree in front of him, lay the decomposed skeletal remains 
           of TERRY MILLIGAN (16). A RED/WHITE STRIPED BLOUSE obscures 
           her face and raised upper arms, as though she was in the 
           middle of pulling it over her head. Her hips are flexed at 
           nearly a 90 degree angle, both legs bent at the knees. 

           TOM stands silently, horrified. BRUCE PETERSON a short 
           distance behind him.

                                 PETERSON (CONT’D)
                        Lets go, Tom.

           But TOM doesn’t respond. A darkness descends over everything. 
           TOM slowly looks up. In the patch of sky visible above the 
           trees, we see a BLACK HELICOPTER slowly pass over, like a 
           giant flying beetle, blocking out all light as it goes. TOM 
           watches a PHOTOGRAPHER take pictures of him from it. And now, 
           the tremendous noise suddenly cuts in.

                                 PETERSON (CONT’D)
                             (shouting over)
                        TOM! LET’S GO!

           TOM looks round at him in slow-motion, disorientated.

                                 PETERSON (CONT’D)
                        ADAMSON WANTS US TO NOTIFY THE 
                        FAMILY! CAN YOU HEAR ME? TOM?
           INT. MILLIGAN RESIDENCE, SEATTLE (1984) - DAY

           Deafening silence. MARY MILLIGAN, TERRY’s mother, sits 
           silently weeping in a worn armchair. Beneath a framed photo 
           of TERRY (in the same STRIPED TOP), TOM and PETERSON, in 
           suits and ties, sit on the sofa, opposite. A 2 year old BOY 
           at her feet, playing with a block. 

           TOM looks over at the dinner table, where TERRY’s 11 year old 
           BROTHER sits alone, elbows on the table, hand clenched around 
           his fist tight, covering most of his face. His eyes, angry, 
           hurt, pained.

                                 MRS. MILLIGAN
                        She was so smart. Good with 
                        computers. After she had the child, 
                        I hoped she’d do something with 
                        that kind of thing, but...

           TOM nods, looks at the BOY. BRUCE head down. This is tough.

                                 MRS. MILLIGAN (CONT’D)
                        She went to church. Used to take 
                        her little brother over there. He’d 
                        always fight with her about it.

           At the table, TERRY’s BROTHER stares ahead, eyes glassy, 
           trying to keep the tears back.

                                 MRS. MILLIGAN (CONT’D)
                        They were always fighting.

           TOM can see how hard this is for him.

                                 MRS. MILLIGAN (CONT’D)
                        Are you church people, detective?

                                 TOM
                        My wife. I, uh... I don’t, uh... 
                        myself.

           She nods. They sit in silence, once more. The BOY plays.

           INT. JENSEN HOUSE KITCHEN (1984) - EVENING

           CHARLAINE is preparing dinner in the kitchen, while the BOYS 
           chase each other and fight.

                                 CHARLAINE
                        Keep it down, you two!

            TOM enters, jacket off, loosening his tie.
                                 TOM
                        Hi.

                                 CHARLAINE
                        Oh, hey. I didn’t hear you come in.

           He goes over and kisses her, while she carries on working.

                                 CHARLAINE (CONT'D)
                        How was your day?

           Shouts from the BOYS as they wrestle. A large, white DOG 
           barks excitedly round them.

                                 CHARLAINE (CONT'D)
                        Grover, quiet! Hey! I’m not telling 
                        you boys again. You’re like 
                        animals. At least pretend to be 
                        civilized human beings, even if 
                        you’re not!
                             (to TOM)
                        Honestly, they’ve been like this 
                        since I got in from work...

                                 TOM
                        I’ll be downstairs for a while.

           He heads for the stairs to the basement.

                                 CHARLAINE
                             (concerned)
                        Are you okay, honey?

                                 TOM
                        Sure. 

           INT. TOM’S BASEMENT(1984) - EVENING

           TOM is in his basement WORKSHOP, hammering away in his shirt-
           sleeves, intensely trying to stay focussed on what he’s 
           doing. 

           Suddenly, a FLASH IMAGE of TERRY MILLIGAN’S DECOMPOSED 
           REMAINS, blouse over her head and legs spread.  

           TOM’s hammering becomes more desperate, wild almost. He’s 
           destroying whatever he’s working on now.

                                 GARY (O.S.)
                        I’ll never forget it.
           EXT. MIDDLE FORK ROAD, NORTH BEND SITE(2003) - DAY

           A picturesque, FORESTED area bisected by a two-lane road. The 
           older GARY and TOM stand, side by side, at the roads edge, 
           looking off towards the woods, the rest of the TEAM behind 
           them.

                                 GARY
                        I was real angry at the time, 
                        because I had to do the night 
                        shift. The women at work, they 
                        would, uh... manipulate people, to 
                        get the easy jobs, y’know? It 
                        really had me pissed. Well, I 
                        remember I was in a hurry, but I 
                        did the usual routine. Dump the 
                        body real quick by the side of the 
                        road here, then drive a ways 
                        further along, and stop. Just back 
                        there. That way if police or 
                        someone comes along and stops me, 
                        they won’t see the body. Then, I 
                        came back and took it further in to 
                        the woods.
                             (points ahead)
                        I dragged her in there about ten 
                        feet from where we are now. Of 
                        course, the forest came right up to 
                        where we’re standing, back then.

                                 TOM
                        You sure about that, Gary?

                                 GARY
                        Quite certain. One hundred percent. 
                        I mean, the trees are a lot taller 
                        now but...

                                 TOM
                        Uh huh? And I’m going to take a 
                        wild guess that this giant, fucking 
                        parking lot wasn’t here back then, 
                        either? 

           And now we see that they are looking at a large PARKING LOT 
           with the forest surrounding it.

                                 TOM (CONT'D)
                        Would that be correct, Gary? Would 
                        I be right in saying that your 
                        crime scene is now a parking lot?

           GARY looks a little nervous. REICHERT watching TOM.
                                 GARY
                        So, you didn’t find her? I, uh... I 
                        thought maybe you did.

                                 TOM
                        Nope. And I thought you were 
                        bringing us to places we hadn’t 
                        found anything?

                                 GARY
                        Maybe, uh... maybe they found her 
                        when they made this? But they’d let 
                        you know, huh..?

                                 TOM
                        Pretty sure.

           GARY looks to PROTHERO for help. Anyone.

                                 GARY
                        Or she could still be here, buried 
                        under the blacktop.

                                 DOYON
                             (to TOM)
                        We’ll just bust all this up, and 
                        ship it all off to the lab to test 
                        for human remains. Shouldn’t be 
                        more than a few thousand dollars.

                                 GARY
                        You can do that?

                                 DOYON
                        No.

                                 TOM
                        Detective Doyon was making a joke.
                        You know, just messing with you?

           SHERIFF REICHERT exchanges a look with MULLINAX, then steps 
           in to diffuse the situation.

                                 SHERIFF REICHERT
                        Okay... Let’s just look around real 
                        quick before we leave.

           GARY gets led away, as MULLINAX comes over to TOM.

                                 MULLINAX
                        Take it easy, okay?

           TOM takes out a cigarette. DOYON watches them.
                                 MULLINAX (CONT’D)
                        Remember, the plan is we’ll get 
                        more out of him if we butter him 
                        up, make him feel good.

                                 TOM
                             (nods)
                        Go ahead. I’m taking a cigarette 
                        break.

           EXT. BURIEN STREET, KING COUNTY (1984) - NIGHT

           A CANDLE FLAME flickers.

           A crowd, of four hundred FEMALE PROTESTERS, are holding a 
           candle-lit ‘TAKE BACK THE NIGHT’ march through the streets. 
           We see BANNERS and PLACARDS, - ‘Every Woman Deserves 
           Justice’, etc. TOM watches them pass, from his car.  

                                 COOKIE HUNT
                             (into loudspeaker)
                        ...and as women, we claim our right 
                        to live after sunset! The police 
                        need to tell us why, after more 
                        than two years...

           And the MARCH continues toward the Task Force building.

           INT. TASK FORCE HEADQUARTERS, BURIEN (1984) - MOMENTS LATER

           TOM heads through the sparsely occupied workspace. He sees 
           one of the detectives at his desk.

                                 TOM
                        Hey Matt, is Adamson still here?

                                 HANEY
                        Haven’t seen him since lunch. Ask 
                        Randy. He’s finishing up with a guy 
                        who took a polygraph test.

           INT. INTERVIEW ROOM CORRIDOR, BURIEN PRECINCT (1984) - NIGHT

           TOM knocks and opens the door to the INTERVIEW ROOM. Sticks 
           his head in. RANDY MULLINAX sits at one end of a desk, 
           writing, going over the results of a POLYGRAPH TEST with 
           someone.

                                 TOM
                        You got a second, Detective 
                        Mullinax?
                                 MULLINAX
                        Sure. We’re almost done here.

                                 TOM
                        There’s something I think you 
                        should see.

                                 MULLINAX
                        Now?

           TOM nods, goes back into the corridor and looks out a nearby 
           window to see the MARCHERS approaching.

                                 MULLINAX (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                             (to his interviewee)
                        So, just give me a minute here and 
                        then we can finish up, okay...

           MULLINAX joins TOM in the corridor.

                                 MULLINAX (CONT’D)
                        What’s going on?

           TOM indicates the window. MULLINAX takes a look.

                                 TOM
                        There’s about four hundred women 
                        heading this way and they want to 
                        talk to us.

                                 MULLINAX
                        Shit! It’s that Women’s Coalition 
                        march. I’ll get on the phone, see 
                        if I can find Adamson. Let him deal 
                        with them.

           He heads into the main workspace, leaving TOM in the 
           corridor. He checks on the march out the window, again.

           MULLINAX pokes his head through the door, phone to his ear.

                                 MULLINAX (CONT’D)
                        Tom, let that guy know he can go 
                        home, will ya? Tell him he passed 
                        the polygraph, he’s no longer under 
                        investigation. This may take a 
                        while.

                                 TOM
                        Sure.
           INT. INTERVIEW ROOM, BURIEN PRECINCT (1984) - NIGHT

           TOM enters, distracted by the noise of the MARCHERS growing 
           outside.

                                 TOM
                        Detective Mullinax has to attend to 
                        another matter. He said to tell you  
                        you’re no longer under 
                        investigation.

                                 INTERVIEWEE
                        So, I can... uh, go home?

                                 TOM
                        Yeah. You can go home.

           TOM sits at the desk. The INTERVIEWEE stands. We now see it’s 
           younger GARY. He starts to put his jacket on.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        You might want to wait a while 
                        though. There’s kind of a situation 
                        outside right now.

                                 GARY
                        What kind of situation?

                                 TOM
                        Some kind of protest.

           GARY sits back down. The ‘Green River Killer’ and the man who 
           will catch him sit alone in a room together. 

                                 COOKIE HUNT (O.S.)
                        Fact - most murderers are found 
                        within seventy-two hours of the 
                        crime. Two years later and the 
                        police are still nowhere! 

           TOM looks up, listening to what’s happening outside. GARY 
           watches him. 

                                 COOKIE HUNT (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        And if these women were white, 
                        middle-class, college girls you can 
                        guarantee the police would have 
                        found the killer by now!

           TOM looks over at GARY. GARY looks away. They both feel 
           awkward.
                                 COOKIE HUNT (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        Once they killed us because they 
                        said we were witches, now they kill 
                        us because they say we’re 
                        prostitutes. The truth is... THEY 
                        KILL US BECAUSE WE’RE WOMEN!

           They look at each other. After a few seconds, TOM stands, 
           makes for the door.

                                 TOM
                        You can wait down in the lobby. I’m 
                        sure it won’t be too...

                                 GARY
                             (standing)
                        Yeah, sure... of course.

           TOM holds the door open as GARY leaves. He stands in the 
           doorway, watching GARY head down the corridor, TOM’s mind on 
           what’s happening outside.

                                 COOKIE HUNT (O.S.)
                        WHY MUST WE DIE JUST BECAUSE WE’RE 
                        WOMEN?

           GARY, at the end of the corridor, confused about which door 
           is the exit. TOM points him in the right direction.

                                 COOKIE HUNT (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        WHY?

           With a familiar SLOW MOTION WAVE, GARY heads through the 
           door, and is gone.

           EXT. LITTLE LEAGUE FIELD, NORTH AIRPORT SITE (2003) - DAY

           Older TOM stands watching older GARY being helped out of the 
           MINI-VAN next to PROTHERO, as the rest of the TEAM gathers.

                                 GARY
                        You were right, Detective. They 
                        didn’t last too long, huh?

           GARY is looking down at his beaten up JAIL BOOTIES, covered 
           in mud.

                                 PROTHERO
                        I’ll get you something before we go 
                        out again tomorrow, Gary.
                                 TOM
                        Don’t worry. No hiking here. I just 
                        want you to tell us some things. 
                        Things that the Green River Killer 
                        should know.

           GARY nods, eager to please. TOM starts to move off, then 
           turns back to GARY.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        You are the Green River Killer, 
                        aren’t you?

                                 GARY
                        Yes. Of course. 

                                 TOM
                        So, tell me, how’d you pass the 
                        polygraph test that time? 

                                 GARY
                             (a nervous few beats)
                        I, uh... I just tried to stay real 
                        relaxed... I guess. Take a few deep 
                        breaths. Act normal.

                                 TOM
                        Deep breaths, huh? Well, Gary, you 
                        just take a few of them deep 
                        breaths now, and then you tell us 
                        about this place.

           We pull back to reveal that they are standing in the middle 
           of the LITTLE LEAGUE FIELD we saw back in 1984. 

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        Tell us everything you know.

           On GARY as he looks around, trying to remember. He sees the 
           WATER TOWER in the distance. Remembers... 

           EXT. VACANT LOT, NORTH AIRPORT SITE (1982) - NIGHT

           The large, white WATER TOWER looming over us, surrounded by 
           sky. We turn our head and we’re now looking at an EMPTY HOUSE 
           raised up on BLOCKS, about four or five feet in the air. It’s 
           an odd sight.

           A FOX appears in the dark doorway, stands, watching us. 

           On younger GARY’s face. His pale, clammy skin. Eyes cold, 
           locked onto the FOX. A sense of struggle, and then stillness.
           From above, GARY, laying on his back, his legs wrapped around 
           a small, young woman, SHAWNDA (17), his arms clamped around 
           her neck. Her lifeless body enveloped. Like some weird, 
           insectoid creature. The HOUSE ON BLOCKS, the FOX in the 
           doorway. Looking down over it all, the ghostly WATER TOWER.

           EXT. LITTLE LEAGUE FIELD, NORTH AIRPORT SITE (2003) - DAY

           On older GARY, looking at the WATER TOWER again.

                                 GARY
                        I remember this place. This was a 
                        good spot for... Pretty remote. No 
                        one around at night. Lot of 
                        airplane noise to, uh... muffle 
                        anything, y’know? 

           TOM silently nods. GARY points toward the WATER TOWER.

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                        One by the water tower. Black girl. 
                        Squirmy. Had to wrap my legs around 
                        her.

                                 TOM
                             (after a pause)
                        Uh huh...

           GARY looks around again, searching.

           EXT. 24TH AVENUE SOUTH, NORTH AIRPORT SITE (1983) - DAY

           Younger GARY walks along the edge of the road. Beside him, a 
           young girl, CHERYL (18), we don’t see her face. They walk in 
           silence. GARY notices CANDY WRAPPERS on the ground, an empty 
           SODA CAN.

                                 CHERYL
                        It’s my birthday.

           GARY looks up, the girl’s face is a blur. He looks back at 
           the road and notices a BROKEN TYRE laying there, we see it in 
           great detail.

           EXT. LITTLE LEAGUE FIELD, NORTH AIRPORT SITE (2003) - DAY

           GARY points over to the undergrowth just beyond the field.
                                 GARY
                        One over there, in the grass. White 
                        girl. Maybe about twenty-five or 
                        so?

           He looks at TOM. TOM waits. There’s nothing else coming.

                                 TOM
                        You got it almost right. You got 
                        the water tower one. That was well 
                        documented. But we didn’t find one 
                        in the grass. Maybe you’re thinking 
                        of the one we found in the gully. 
                        Except she wasn’t twenty-five, she 
                        was fifteen. I dug her out of the 
                        ground myself.

           GARY is not sure how to respond. DOYON watches.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        Tell us about the other one.

                                 GARY
                        I.. I don’t think I left another 
                        one out here...

                                 TOM
                        You just said you did! What’s going 
                        on here Gary? You messing with us 
                        again?

                                 GARY
                        ...no, I’m not...

                                 PROTHERO
                        It’s been a long day. It might be 
                        more productive if Gary has a 
                        little time to process everything.

                                 SHERIFF REICHERT
                        Good idea. Let’s resume this 
                        tomorrow.

           EXT. MINI-VAN, LITTLE LEAGUE FIELD, NORTH AIRPORT SITE (2003) 
           - DAY

           GARY stands with PROTHERO, as they prepare to get back into 
           the MINI-VAN.

                                 GARY
                        Struck out today, didn’t I?
                                 PROTHERO
                        You did fine Gary. It’s a good 
                        start.

           REICHERT takes TOM aside. DOYON notices.

                                 SHERIFF REICHERT
                        Give him a break, okay? It’s been a 
                        long time.

           He walks off. TOM approaches GARY at the VAN.

                                 GARY
                        I’m sorry, Detective Jensen.

           TOM stops.

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                        I guess there’s a lot I’ve 
                        forgotten over the past twenty 
                        years.

           A PLANE roars overhead, as GARY gets helped into the MINI-
           VAN.

                                 TOM
                             (under the noise)
                        It’s been twenty years for me too. 
                        And I haven’t forgotten anything.

           GARY turns back to TOM. Did he hear him over the plane?

                                 GARY
                        What?

                                 TOM
                        Never mind.

           They look at each other, then GARY smiles, goes to his seat.

           INT. THE BUNKER, MAIN ROOM (2003) - LATE AFTERNOON

           TOM sits at his desk in his CUBICLE, observing GARY as he 
           sits in the doorway of his room, writing in his notebook.

           TOM watches as a YOUNG WOMAN walks up to a desk near GARY’s 
           room. GARY looks up, watches her as she sorts through some 
           files. His eyes never leave her as she finds what she was 
           looking for, and walks off. TOM, unseen by GARY, observing 
           all this. GARY lost in thought even after she’s gone. 
           Eventually, he is brought out of his reverie as he realizes 
           TOM is looking at him. GARY smiles his innocent, dumb smile.
                                 ROSEN (O.S.)
                        Hey, Tom...

           Leaning over from another cubicle is one of the Prosecution 
           team.

                                 ROSEN (CONT’D)
                        You were in the Navy, right?

                                 TOM
                        Uh huh.

                                 ROSEN
                        Do you know the Navy chapel just 
                        outside Seattle? 

                                 TOM
                        Why?

                                 ROSEN
                        I’m going over the background 
                        stuff. It says Gary married his 
                        first wife there. Just wondering if 
                        it had a name..?

           On TOM, looking over to GARY, but he’s not in the doorway 
           anymore.

           INT. JENSEN HOUSE, BEDROOM (2003) - NIGHT

           CHARLAINE is in bed. TOM is getting undressed.

                                 CHARLAINE
                             (upset)
                        We had our wedding in the same 
                        church as that man?

           TOM, now wishing he hadn’t brought it up.

                                 TOM
                        I mean... it was a long time 
                        before... 

                                 CHARLAINE
                        That’s not the point, Tom. It was 
                        the most special day of my life, 
                        and now I can’t think about it 
                        without him being there..

                                 TOM
                        Oh, come on Charl. You’re being a 
                        little over dramatic, aren’t you?
                                 CHARLAINE
                        Over dramatic?

                                 TOM
                             (tries to change the 
                              subject)
                        Just forget it. So, did you pick 
                        which tiles you like for the 
                        bathroom floor, yet? I’m almost 
                        ready to...

                                 CHARLAINE
                        It was our wedding day, Tom. I’m 
                        allowed to have feelings about 
                        this. Don’t you?

                                 TOM
                        Of course...

                                 CHARLAINE
                             (waits)
                        So... what are they? These feelings 
                        that you have?

           TOM stands awkwardly, not knowing how to answer. 

                                 CHARLAINE (CONT'D)
                        Tell me what you’re feeling, Tom!

           He can’t. CHARLAINE buries her head in the pillow, turns 
           away, leaving TOM standing there, uncomfortable. 

                                 TOM
                        You can’t let him spoil our 
                        wedding, Charl. If you let him take 
                        that away, then... he wins, doesn’t 
                        he?

           INT. WILLIAMS HOUSE, KENT (1985) - NIGHT

           A dark-haired woman in a cowboy hat CHEERS excitedly, as a 
           country-music song starts up. A moderately drunk SUE (37), 
           stands in the middle of the living room of a small, run down 
           house. The man she met earlier tonight, T.J. WILLIAMS (38), 
           stoops over the record player.

                                 T.J.
                        This the one?

           A younger GARY (36) and JUDITH (40) sit on the sofa. They’re 
           a little drunk, but still on the best behavior that comes 
           with having only just met.
                                 SUE
                        This is it right, Judith? The one 
                        we danced to at the end, tonight?
                             (meaning T.J.)
                        This one says to me he’ll play it 
                        for us if we come back to his 
                        place. 

                                 T.J.
                        Am I not a man of my word?

           T.J. and SUE begin to slow-dance.

                                 JUDITH
                             (to GARY)
                        I liked this one too.

            GARY and JUDITH share a polite smile.

                                 SUE
                        I like a man who knows how to keep 
                        a promise.

                                 T.J.
                        You want to find another room to 
                        dance in?

           T.J. winks at GARY as he leads SUE to another room, leaving 
           JUDITH and GARY, a little awkwardly, on the sofa.

                                 GARY
                        So... you think you’ll go to 
                        another Parents Without Partners 
                        dance?

                                 JUDITH
                        Oh yes. I love country music. My 
                        husband... my ex-husband wouldn’t 
                        let me listen to it. He said it was 
                        for low class people.

                                 GARY
                        I guess that makes me real low 
                        class then, because I really like 
                        it.

           They smile.

                                 JUDITH
                        I had some lovely country records, 
                        from years ago. My... ex-husband 
                        took them out back one day and shot 
                        them to pieces right in front of 
                        me, with his shotgun. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JUDITH (CONT'D)
                        So I couldn’t listen to them 
                        anymore. He’d get like that, 
                        sometimes. Real scary...

                                 GARY
                        Well, you can listen to it all you 
                        want now. All day and all night, if 
                        you like.

                                 JUDITH
                             (laughs)
                        I guess I can.

           GARY flashes her a big grin. She’s very taken with him.

                                 JUDITH (CONT'D)
                        You have a real nice voice. Kind of 
                        soothing. Makes me feel calm.

           GARY smiles, gives her a gentle kiss.

                                 GARY
                        Is that okay? To do that?

           JUDITH nods, starts to cry a little.

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                        Did I upset you? I won’t do that 
                        again. I’m sorry.

                                 JUDITH
                        No, it’s fine. I liked it. It’s 
                        just... You’re so nice, Gary. I’m 
                        not used to it.

                                 GARY
                        Well, it’s going to be different 
                        from now on. Everything’s going to 
                        be different from now on.

           JUDITH sees that GARY too, has tears in his eyes.

           INT. GARY’S ‘CELL’, TASK FORCE HEADQUARTERS (2003) - NIGHT

           GARY is laying in bed awake, in the dark, looking at the 
           VICTIM’s photographs pinned up in the room beyond his open 
           doorway. He settles on one face, GISELE LOVVORN (19).

           FLASH IMAGE of the ‘OLD FOREST’ before us, under a grey sky. 
           GARY stands looking at it, the wind that moves among it’s 
           branches, blows his hair across his face. A figure steps out 
           of the ‘OLD FOREST’. 
           In the distance, she WAVES SLOWLY at him. It’s GISELE, the 
           girl from the photograph. Is she waving hello or goodbye?

           On GARY’s face, suddenly illuminated, as the lights are 
           switched on back in his room.

                                 GUARD 1 (O.S.)
                        It’s time, Mr. Ridgway.

           TITLE over black - “JUNE 15TH, 2003 - DAY THREE”

           INT. BACK EXIT AREA, ‘THE BUNKER’, BOEING FIELD - MORNING

           GARY is escorted by his SWAT GUARDS through the back of the 
           building, towards the MINI-VAN. PROTHERO is with him. TOM, 
           smoking, and the TASK FORCE team, wait near the VEHICLES.

                                 GARY
                        Morning fellas!

                                 SHERIFF REICHERT
                        Morning, Gary.

                                 TOM
                        Nice boots.

           GARY has a new pair of hiking boots on.

                                 GARY
                        Thank you. They’re rubbing a 
                        little. But they’re alright. Mark 
                        says there’s a pretty good mall 
                        near here. Maybe afterward, we can 
                        all go take a look together?

                                 TOM
                        How about you focus on giving us 
                        something we can actually use 
                        today? 

           GARY obediently heads into the VAN.

           INT. MINI-VAN, KENT SUBURB (2003) - MORNING

           TOM and GARY sit next to each other. Much to TOM’s 
           discomfort, GARY leans into him to look out, as they drive up 
           to an ABANDONED LOT.

                                 GARY
                        There used to be a restaurant here, 
                        with some trees behind it. I dumped 
                        some clothes back there.
           TOM gives GARY a look.

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                        But I guess those woods ain’t there 
                        anymore.

           EXT. LEWIS & CLARK THEATRE, PACIFIC HIGHWAY SOUTH (2003) - 
           MORNING

           The MINI-VAN parked in the empty PARKING LOT.

                                 GARY (O.S.)
                        I know I left a body here back when 
                        I was killing... but this place was 
                        all grass back then.

           EXT. RENTON SUBURB (2003) - MORNING

           The MINI-VAN crawls, stopping and starting along the deserted 
           suburban street, followed by the rest of the CONVOY. A 
           peculiar sight.

                                 GARY
                        Here. No... further on. I’m pretty 
                        sure I left something... or someone 
                        right here. Back when those houses 
                        weren’t there. Keep going...

           GARY leans all over TOM as he desperately tries to see 
           something he remembers. 

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                        Wait!

           The VAN comes to an abrupt halt. GARY seems on the verge of 
           some important pronouncement.

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                        Actually... I don’t think I left 
                        anything here at all.

           GARY pleased with himself, looks to TOM. TOM head in hands.

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                             (disappointed)
                        I’m trying. I really am.

           EXT. ROADSIDE EMBANKMENT, NEAR KENT VALLEY (2003) - DAY

           The CONVOY is parked up along the edge of a very steep 
           embankment. A GUARD RAIL runs along it. 
           TOM stands by his open door, looking over the edge of the 
           embankment. SUE PETERS and PROTHERO nearby, talking with 
           GRADDON. 

                                 TOM
                        You’re telling me you managed to 
                        get a body over this rail, and all 
                        the way down there, on your own?

                                 GARY
                             (in the car)
                        No.

                                 TOM
                        That’s what you just said!

                                 GARY
                        No, it was further along, just over 
                        there.

           He points a bit further along the road to an identical area.

                                 GARY (CONT'D)
                        You want me to show you?

           TOM sees GRADDON approaching, tries to keep himself under 
           control.

                                 TOM
                        No. I want you to stay here. You 
                        can direct me. I’m sure this won’t 
                        take long.

           TOM stalks off along the road, as PETERS, PROTHERO and 
           GRADDON join GARY. 

                                 GARY
                             (watching TOM)
                        He shouldn’t walk with his hands in 
                        his pockets like that. If he 
                        tripped he wouldn’t be able to 
                        break his fall.

                                 PETERS
                        I’ll be sure to tell him that.

           TOM muttering to himself as he walks along.

                                 TOM
                        ... such bullshit...

           PETERS’ voice comes over TOM’s radio, as we see GARY emerge 
           from the VAN, off in the distance.
                                 PETERS
                             (on radio)
                        Gary says to look over the rail 
                        about there.

           TOM looks back at them. GARY, standing with PETERS and 
           PROTHERO, points to the rail where TOM stands. TOM tries to 
           see down the embankment but there’s too much of a lip the 
           other side of the rail. He starts to climb over.

                                 PETERS (CONT'D)
                             (on the radio)
                        Gary says “be careful”.

                                 TOM
                             (mutters to himself)
                        ...yeah, right...

           He gets over, and tentatively moves about halfway towards the 
           edge. He’s really high up.

           On GARY watching him.

                                 GARY
                        If he gets closer to the edge, I’m 
                        sure he’ll see something.

                                 PETERS
                             (on radio)
                        Gary says, can you get a little 
                        closer?

           With a deep breath, TOM moves slowly to the edge. GARY 
           watching him.

                                 GARY
                        Just a little further.

                                 PETERS
                             (into radio)
                        A little further, Tom.

           TOM looks over at GARY. Is he ‘messing’ with him? GARY looks 
           over at TOM, impossible to read. TOM summons his nerve and 
           takes a step onto the very edge. As he does so, the earth 
           gives way under his footing, and he starts to slide down the 
           steep slope. 

                                 PROTHERO
                        Did he just fall?

                                 PETERS
                             (into radio)
                        Tom? Tom, are you okay? Tom!
           TOM scrabbles to stop himself sliding down the embankment, 
           earth and stones falling around him. GARY watches, 
           implacable, as TOM keeps sliding.

           INT. ADAMSON’S OFFICE, TASK FORCE HEADQUARTERS (1990) - DAY

           TOM sits across from a tired looking ADAMSON.

                                 ADAMSON
                        It’s over, Tom. We’re shutting down 
                        the Task Force.

                                 TOM
                        What do you mean, you’re shutting 
                        it down?

                                 ADAMSON
                        The Executive says we’re done. Too 
                        much money, not enough to show for 
                        it. They say it’s been eight years 
                        now and we’ve got nothing. So 
                        they’re not prepared to keep 
                        supporting us. I guess dead 
                        prostitutes don’t win you too many 
                        votes.

                                 TOM
                        But... what if we go to the press? 
                        We could tell them...

                                 ADAMSON
                        Look, Tom. We all know he stopped 
                        killing a long time ago. He’d 
                        pretty much stopped before the Task 
                        Force was even put together. He’s 
                        either dead, in prison for 
                        something else, or he’s just... 
                        gone away.

           TOM is in shock, can’t find the words.

                                 ADAMSON (CONT’D)
                        I’m being moved. They’re calling it 
                        a promotion, but... well, it sure 
                        doesn’t feel like it. There’s a 
                        place for you in Major Crimes if 
                        you want it, but... How would you 
                        feel about keeping the lights on 
                        here at Green River? Apparently, it 
                        would look bad if it was shut down 
                        altogether, politically-speaking, 
                        and you know the case better than 
                        anyone.

                        Besides, you’re the only one who 
                        knows how to turn that damn 
                        computer on.

                                 TOM
                             (grabs at this life-line)
                        Sir, I’ll... I’ll sweep the floors, 
                        if that’s what it takes to stay on 
                        this.

                                 ADAMSON
                        Good. I’m glad you feel that way.

           As ADAMSON continues, cut to:-

           INT. TASK FORCE HEADQUARTERS (1990) - DAY

           TOM stands in the large room as it starts to be dismantled. 
           In a series of time-cuts we see charts, files, everything 
           being boxed up and removed.

                                 ADAMSON (O.S.)
                        We’ll find you an office. You’ll 
                        still have access to everything, of 
                        course, but it all has to be put in 
                        storage. You can call on Jim Doyon 
                        if you need any help, but... well, 
                        it’s pretty much just you now, Tom.

           TOM is left, alone, in the large, empty room. 

                                 ADAMSON (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        You know none of us want to let 
                        this go. We’ll all be pulling for 
                        you, Detective.

           Just TOM and the VICTIM’S PHOTOGRAPHS. He stands looking at 
           them.

                                 REICHERT (O.S.)
                        I didn’t realize anyone was still 
                        here.

           TOM turns to see REICHERT, resplendent in full uniform, 
           standing in the doorway. His hair is now almost completely 
           white.

                                 TOM
                        Hey, Dave. Sorry, I guess it’s 
                        Sergeant Dave now, right?
                                 REICHERT
                             (smiles)
                        Just came from the ceremony. 

           REICHERT takes in the, now empty, room.

                                 REICHERT (CONT’D)
                        They all came in here, one after 
                        another. The ‘experts’. “Reichert’s 
                        an idiot. We’ll find this guy, no 
                        problem.” Well, they didn’t. Not 
                        one of them. They didn’t beat me.

           He picks up his boxes. TOM holds the doors open for him and 
           follows him out to the ELEVATOR. REICHERT gets in.

                                 TOM
                        Good luck, Dave.

           As the doors close.

                                 REICHERT
                        Thanks.

           The elevator starts to go up. As REICHERT starts to 
           disappear, he suddenly remembers.

                                 REICHERT (CONT’D)
                        Hey, you too, Tom! Let’s keep in 
                        touch...

           He’s gone. As we slowly pull away from TOM, he becomes an 
           increasingly small and lonely figure in a very large 
           corridor. 

           INT. RIDGWAY HOUSE BATHROOM, SEA-TAC (1990) - NIGHT

           GARY and JUDITH stand in the bathroom, naked. They each wash 
           their own genitals. Clearly, this is a regular routine.

           INT. RIDGWAY HOUSE BEDROOM, SEA-TAC (1990) - NIGHT

           GARY and JUDITH, in bed, having sex. JUDITH looking at GARY, 
           moved by his tenderness.

           INT. KING COUNTY COURTHOUSE STORAGE WAREHOUSE (1990) - DAY

           We move slowly forward through this vast storage area, 
           passing boxes and boxes of ‘Green River’ evidence, sitting on 
           huge shelving units. We move towards a large SEALED DOOR. 
           As we get closer we see a sign above it, saying REFRIGERATION 
           UNIT. We pass through the small, partially frosted window. 
           Inside are various temperature-sensitive pieces of EVIDENCE. 
           We see some JARS containing SALIVA SAMPLES, etc. They have 
           NAMES of suspects on them. ”FOSTER”, “STEVENS”, “McLEAN”. 
           And, finally, partially hidden behind one of these, we can 
           just see a JAR containing a SALIVA SWAB, and on it the name - 
           “RIDGWAY, GARY LEON”.

                                 PETERS (O.S.)
                        Tom?

           EXT. ROADSIDE EMBANKMENT, NEAR KENT VALLEY (2003) - DAY

           Older TOM is on his back, having slid almost halfway down the 
           steep embankment. PETERS’ voice comes over his radio.

                                 PETERS (O.S.)
                        Tom? You okay?

                                 TOM
                             (grunts into radio)
                        I’m fine.

           TOM starts climbing back up the embankment. Muddy and out of 
           breath, he angrily heads for the VAN.

           INT. MINI-VAN, ROADSIDE EMBANKMENT, KENT VALLEY (2003) - DAY

           TOM gets back into the VAN, breathing hard, sits with GARY. 

                                 TOM
                        I’m a little frustrated Gary, I 
                        don’t mind telling you.

                                 GARY
                        I tried to warn you. Maybe if you 
                        didn’t smoke so much...

                                 TOM
                        Listen to me. We are zero for 
                        twelve on these field trips, Gary. 
                        No bodies, no evidence.

                                 GARY
                        No evidence. I know, it’s real 
                        frustrating...

                                 TOM
                        You need to start coming up with 
                        something we can use here.

                        If you blow any more smoke up my 
                        ass, it’s going to start coming out 
                        my ears, understand?

           We see GRADDON watching this in the rear-view mirror.

           INT. THE BUNKER, MEETING ROOM (2003) - DAY

           TOM is with GRADDON and REICHERT. MATTSEN, MULLINAX and 
           PETERS there too.

                                 TOM
                        I’m not the only one who’s getting 
                        frustrated, surely?

                                 GRADDON
                        I’m getting phone calls every day 
                        reminding me we’re on a meter here. 
                        They want to know what their money 
                        is paying for. And so far we have 
                        nothing to show for it. They’re 
                        telling me there are parks and 
                        kiddie pools being closed down as 
                        we speak because of budget cuts, 
                        and the last thing they want is to 
                        carry on spending money they don’t 
                        have, to keep a guy alive that the 
                        people who vote for them would much 
                        rather see dead anyway, and then 
                        still have to pay millions for a 
                        trial at the end of it. This deal 
                        was supposed to avoid all that. And 
                        we’re getting nowhere with it. So, 
                        no, you’re not the only one who’s 
                        frustrated, Tom. 

           TOM nods, keeps quiet.

                                 GRADDON (CONT’D)
                        What is going on here? Why is this 
                        happening? Anyone?

           They all look uncomfortable.

                                 MULLINAX
                        It’s been a long time. A lot’s 
                        changed.

                                 MATTSEN
                        He’s clearly got a few... mental 
                        challenges.
                                 PETERS
                        Maybe he’s remembered all he’s 
                        going to.

                                 TOM
                        I think he, uh... I think he may be 
                        lying to us.

                                 SHERIFF REICHERT
                        Why the hell would he lie to us if 
                        this is to keep himself alive?

                                 TOM
                        Because... well, maybe he isn’t the 
                        Green River Killer, after all?

                                 GRADDON
                        Hold on...

                                 TOM
                        Yes, he killed some of them. But 
                        all of them? I’m starting to have 
                        doubts.

                                 MULLINAX
                        Or maybe he’s just been lying so 
                        long, he doesn’t know how to tell 
                        the truth any more.

                                 GRADDON
                        You’re saying he’s doing this just 
                        to dodge the death penalty? 

                                 SHERIFF REICHERT
                        He knows we need proof. How could 
                        he think that would ever work?

                                 TOM
                        Until he arrived here, he’d spent 
                        eighteen months in a ten by eight 
                        cell, twenty-three hours a day. If 
                        I knew I was going to die anyway, 
                        I’d maybe want to spend my last 
                        summer out of there too.

                                 GRADDON
                        So what you’re telling us Tom, is 
                        that we are currently engaged in a 
                        plea deal that is possibly going to 
                        end up bankrupting this county and 
                        costing all our jobs, in order to 
                        get information out of a man that 
                        you now say maybe never had that 
                        information in the first place.

                        And we all were the ones who told 
                        the County Prosecutor that he 
                        should do this. Have I got that 
                        right?

                                 TOM
                             (eventually)
                        All I know for certain is, Gary is 
                        holding out on us, and we don’t 
                        know why. Now, I know that matters 
                        to everyone here, but it matters a 
                        very great deal to me. This has 
                        been my whole career. This has been 
                        my life. I, for one, do not want to 
                        walk away from here without knowing 
                        what really happened.

                                 SHERIFF REICHERT
                        Well, Tom, looks like you might 
                        have to, because this deal is 
                        falling apart. If you guys can’t 
                        get something out of him very soon 
                        indeed, something concrete, that we 
                        can show it’s worth continuing with 
                        this, then they are going to shut 
                        us down. And then, either Gary gets 
                        executed for the seven we can tie 
                        him to, or we may have messed up 
                        our one chance to put that monster 
                        on trial, and we will be crucified 
                        for it. 

           EXT. REAR CAR-PARK, ‘THE BUNKER’ (2003) - EVENING

           TOM stands smoking, alone in the parking lot, his head 
           spinning. He sees PROTHERO walk to his car. TOM heads over to 
           him.

                                 TOM
                        Be straight with me here. What the 
                        fuck is going on with your guy?

                                 PROTHERO
                        Interesting approach. Direct...

                                 TOM
                        Mark, it’s in your interest that he 
                        gives us something, too. And most 
                        of all his. If he is who he says he 
                        is.

           PROTHERO takes a moment.
                                 PROTHERO
                        Look, I’ve been talking to him 
                        about this stuff for the last year 
                        and a half. Believe me, I feel your 
                        pain. You think you’ve got a hold 
                        of him, then you realize there’s 
                        nothing there. He’s spent his whole 
                        life trying to work out how to look 
                        normal, how to get people to like 
                        him. He’s all outside, and no 
                        inside.

                                 TOM
                        Or he’s just extremely good at 
                        hiding it.

                                 PROTHERO
                        Maybe even from himself. You know 
                        the thing he’s most scared of? Not 
                        that he’ll be killed. It’s what 
                        people will think of him. That he’s 
                        some kind of monster. 

           PROTHERO gets in his car.

                                 PROTHERO (CONT’D)
                        I think he’s trying to tell the 
                        truth. He just doesn’t want to 
                        remember.

           He drives off, leaving TOM alone in the lot, thinking.

           INT. BACK EXIT AREA, ‘THE BUNKER’ (2003)- MORNING

           TITLE over black - “JUNE 16TH, 2003, DAY FOUR.”

           TOM stands with a group of DETECTIVES, watching GARY and his 
           group heading out for the VAN.

           TOM looks over to REICHERT and GRADDON, who watch at a 
           distance, then nods to DET. CRENSHAW, a large, African-
           American man. CRENSHAW walks over to GARY, heads him off.

                                 CRENSHAW (O.S.)
                        Where the hell you think you’re 
                        going?

           GARY stops, hands in his jacket pockets.
                                 CRENSHAW (CONT’D)
                        You think you’re going out for a 
                        nice little walk in the sunshine 
                        after the bullshit display you’ve 
                        been putting on for us? Huh?

                                 GARY
                             (quietly)
                        I don’t know...

                                 CRENSHAW
                        What did you say? You think I’m 
                        stupid? Look at me, you piece of 
                        shit. Do you think I’m a fucking 
                        idiot?

           PROTHERO looks over to TOM, who gives him a “wait” look.

                                 CRENSHAW (CONT'D)
                        Tell me.

                                 GARY
                             (meekly)
                        No.

                                 CRENSHAW
                        So why are you bullshitting me, 
                        Gary?

                                 GARY
                        I’m not bullshitting you.

                                 CRENSHAW
                        Yes you are, Gary. You can’t even 
                        look me in the eye. You got us all 
                        running around, and you’re just 
                        sitting back with a fuckin’ smirk 
                        on your face. I’m out there every 
                        day, digging and clearing brush in 
                        ninety fucking degrees, because of 
                        your bullshit stories, when I could 
                        be home with my kids.

                                 GARY
                        They’re not bullshit.

                                 CRENSHAW
                        They are bullshit, and you know 
                        they’re bullshit. You’re not going 
                        anywhere today. Take his ass back 
                        to his fuckin’ cell.

           GARY is led off. CRENSHAW calls after him.
                                 CRENSHAW (CONT’D)
                        You want to keep going on your 
                        little field trips, then you better 
                        man up and start telling the truth!

           TOM looks over to see REICHERT and GRADDON walking off.

           INT. GARY’S CELL, ‘THE BUNKER’ (2003) - MOMENTS LATER

           TOM approaches GARY, who sits at the desk in his doorway, 
           reading. GUARDS nearby.

                                 GARY
                        Hello, Detective... uh..?

                                 TOM
                        You know my name, Gary.

                                 GARY
                        I’m sorry,.. I’m not good with that 
                        kind of thing...

           TOM looks around, makes sure the GUARDS can’t hear them.

                                 TOM
                        I know you’re lying.

                                 GARY
                        I promise, I can’t remember names. 
                        When I was a kid, I’d forget my own 
                        address...

                                 TOM
                        I know you’ve been lying to us from  
                        the moment you got here. I just 
                        don’t know why.

           GARY goes quiet, just looks at him.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        You killed every single one of 
                        those women?

           GARY just nods.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        And you stopped in ‘85?

           GARY just nods, again.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        The one out at the racetrack you 
                        told us about on the first day? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        Patricia Barczak?  Well, I found 
                        her already, back in ‘93, but they 
                        wouldn’t let me put her on the 
                        Green River list. Patricia 
                        disappeared in October ‘86, though. 
                        So, how’d that happen, Gary? If you 
                        stopped in ‘85? How could she have 
                        disappeared in ‘86?

           GARY looks blankly at him.

                                 TOM (CONT'D)
                        That means either you didn’t do it, 
                        or you never stopped doing it? 
                        Which is it, Gary? How many have 
                        you really killed? Just the seven 
                        the DNA ties you to? Or did you 
                        just keep on going, until we picked 
                        you up that day at work? That’s 
                        another 15 years of killing. How 
                        many more are out there?

           GARY implacable.

                                 TOM (CONT'D)
                        Had to keep travelling further and 
                        further to do it though, I guess. 
                        Throw us off your scent. How many 
                        state lines you cross to do it? 
                        That’s a lot of other death 
                        penalties you’d have to wriggle out 
                        of, huh? Once you’re done with this 
                        one. Is that why you’re lying? But 
                        why lie about Patricia? You killed 
                        her here in King County. All part 
                        of the same deal. No reason to lie 
                        about her. Unless it wasn’t you? Is 
                        that it? Maybe you know who did 
                        though, huh? Maybe that’s where you 
                        get your information? Or did? 
                        Supply all cut off now, Gary? No 
                        more juicy morsels to tease us 
                        with? 

           GARY just looking at him.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        Listen to me, this party is very 
                        nearly over. For you and me both. 
                        That means this deal falls apart 
                        and you go back to where you were. 
                        Sitting in a box, waiting to die.

                        No more interviews, no more fun 
                        little trips in the van, no more 
                        nothing. This is it. Either you 
                        give me something I can use or they 
                        are going to shut this down. And 
                        right now, the two people who want 
                        to stop that happening the most, 
                        are you and me. So, I really need 
                        you to help me here, Gary. Can you 
                        do that? 

           A group of DETECTIVES approach. TOM gives GARY one last look 
           and then walks off. On GARY, thinking.

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM, ‘THE BUNKER’ (2003) - DAY

           TOM and SUE PETERS sit across from GARY, who has his NOTE-
           BOOK open in front of him. We see he’s written, “Do NOT tell 
           a lie. Tell the TRUTH and do not GUESS.” PROTHERO behind him.

                                 TOM
                        You’ve written some notes?

                                 GARY
                        I’ve been remembering some things.

           GRADDON and SHERIFF REICHERT watching on the monitor, along 
           with the rest of the team.

                                 TOM
                        I’m very glad to hear that. I hope 
                        there’s something worthwhile in 
                        there.

                                 GARY
                             (refers to his note-book)
                        Couple of things... uh, the airport 
                        site. Na... uh, Nao... Noa...

                        Yes, on her right breast. I, uh... 
                        I bit her breast... afterwards.
                        And there was another lady...

                        in ‘82, I got in a rage...

           INT. PROSECUTION ROOM, ‘THE BUNKER’ (2003) -  CONTINUOUS

           Excitement growing in the room.

                                 SHERIFF REICHERT
                        Has any of this been made public?

                                 MATTSEN
                        No. The bite and the arm break? No.

                                 GARY
                        One out by the hospital, I found 
                        some matches on her, so I, uh...

                                 TOM
                        Hold on, Gary. Let’s rewind here.

                                 PETERS
                        This is great. This is exactly what 
                        we need.

                                 TOM
                        So, Connie Naon. Why did you bite 
                        her?

                                 GARY
                        I, uh, I don’t know...

                        You must have been angry with her.

                                 GARY
                        Angry with her, I guess...

                                 PETERS
                        What did she do to make you angry, 
                        Gary?

                                 GARY
                        She wouldn’t let me touch her... 
                        touch her chest. Made me mad.

                                 PETERS
                        So you bit her.

                                 GARY
                        So I bit her.
                                 TOM
                        You do anything else to her?

           On GARY, pinching at his hand.

                                 TOM
                        Something had been put inside 
                        Connie, Gary. You know what that 
                        was? Did you put something inside 
                        her?

                                 GARY
                        I, uh... I might have put, uh... 
                        put a rock in there, maybe.

                                 PETERS
                        A rock?

                                 GARY
                        Yeah. I’d done that before. If 
                        there was a rock nearby, I’d, uh... 
                        I might do that.

                                 TOM
                        You put a rock in her vagina?

                                 GARY
                        I put a rock...

                        guess. Who else? C’mon Tom, get him 
                        to tell us who else he did that to.

                        Was it something to do with burying 
                        them?

           GARY looking at TOM, hesitant.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        Because you buried some and not 
                        others didn’t you? Why was that?

                                 SHERIFF REICHERT
                        No! Go back to the rocks. If he 
                        says he did it to the river girls 
                        as well, we’ve got him. We’ll get 
                        him on the rocks!

                                 GARY
                        I started burying them because I...

           GARY has a FLASH IMAGE of JUDITH when she visited him in 
           prison, her hand up against the window that divides them, 
           looking at him, tears in her eyes, confused, frightened. 

           Then we’re back in the INTERVIEW. GARY seems to change his 
           mind. TOM sees it.

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                        I liked knowing where they were, 
                        and I didn’t want them scattered 
                        all over. So, I started burying 
                        them so they wouldn’t be found...

                                 TOM
                        So, is that where you’d get the 
                        rocks from? From digging to bury 
                        someone...

                        I just saw it there, so... and I’d 
                        already done it with the other

                        Which other ladies, Gary?

                                 GARY (ON THE MONITOR)
                             (after a long pause)
                         The ones at the river.

                        son-of-a-bitch!

           Celebration among the TEAM.

           INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE INTERROGATION ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           TOM enters the corridor, turns the corner and DOYON is there, 
           elated, punches the air with joy, laughing. TOM smiling, huge 
           relief. He’s done it.

           INT. RESTROOM, “THE BUNKER’ (2003) - LATER

           TOM stands at the urinal, as PROTHERO enters and joins him. 
           PROTHERO seems uncomfortable.

                                 TOM
                        Well, your client just brought my 
                        retirement a whole lot closer. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 TOM (CONT'D)
                        Maybe my bathroom will get 
                        finished, after all.

           PROTHERO just nods, doesn’t look at him.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        I suppose it’s congratulations all 
                        round. Gary just gave us all what 
                        we’ve been waiting for, huh? 

           PROTHERO doesn’t answer. TOM starts to leave.

                                 PROTHERO
                             (with difficulty)
                        It would be remiss of me to, uh...

                                 TOM
                        What?

                                 PROTHERO
                        Well... Gary’s seen all the 
                        ‘discovery’ materials. The case 
                        against him. We showed him all 
                        that. All perfectly legal, but... 
                        Everything he just told you? It’s 
                        all in there. 

           TOM takes this in, as PROTHERO, guiltily, goes to leave.

                                 PROTHERO (CONT’D)
                        I just thought you should know.

           INT. JENSEN HOUSE, BATHROOM (2003) - EVENING

           The bathroom remodel is near to completion. TOM is on his 
           hands and knees, placing small tiles onto the floor. He’s 
           having difficulty, his hand shakes. He gets increasingly 
           frustrated. Eventually, something in him snaps. He angrily 
           throws the tile across the room, and smashes into the ones 
           already laid.

                                 TOM
                             (furious)
                        Fuck this! Fuck you! Fuck you!

           He wildly hurls the bucket next to him against the wall, its 
           contents splattering everywhere. He wants to destroy 
           everything he’s done in here. Totally losing control. 

           He stops, breathing hard. He hangs his head. Eventually, he 
           looks up into the mournful eyes of JOEY, their elderly lab, 
           beyond the door. With him, CHARLAINE, looking at her husband, 
           distressed by the havoc he has wrought.
                                 CHARLAINE
                             (almost in tears)
                        What’s happening, Tom?

           TOM walks past her in silence and shame, and goes out. 

           EXT. EMPTY PARKING LOT (2003) - EVENING

           TOM sits in his parked car, silently staring ahead. His mind 
           full of images, memories from the last 20 years. Haunted.

           INT. MILLIGAN RESIDENCE, KING COUNTY (1984) - DAY

           MRS. MILLIGAN sits in her chair. CHILD at her feet. The YOUNG 
           BOY, his eyes full of pain and anger. The picture of TERRY on 
           the wall. The CLOCK ticking.

           INT. R.J.C., VIEWING/HOLDING ROOM (2001) - EVENING

           A familiar DIGITAL CLOCK changes from “7:29” to “7:30”. 
           (We’re back at GARY’s post-arrest interview.) TOM watches 
           GARY through the TWO-WAY MIRROR, as GARY, now alone, 
           confusedly looks through a phone book. On TOM, thinking. He 
           starts writing on a piece of paper.

           TOM comes out the door of the VIEWING ROOM, sees DOYON 
           standing outside the closed HOLDING ROOM door. No-one else 
           around. TOM takes out his GUN, offers it to DOYON.

                                 TOM
                             (vulnerable but covering)
                        Will you hold this for me?

                                 DOYON
                             (taking gun)
                        He’s all yours, detective.

           TOM opens the door.

           INT. REGIONAL JUSTICE CENTER, HOLDING ROOM (2001) - 
           CONTINUOUS

           TOM enters. GARY still looking through phone book. TOM sits 
           at the table. Silence.

                                 TOM
                        You found anyone?
                                 GARY
                             (embarrassed)
                        I don’t know who to call.

           TOM puts the piece of PAPER down, on the table.

                                 TOM
                        That’s the number for the Public 
                        Defender’s office. You should try 
                        them.

                                 GARY
                             (grateful)
                        Thanks.

           Nervy silence. TOM pretends to look over a FILE. Then...

                                 TOM
                        Do you know who I am?

                                 GARY
                        You’re the man looking for the 
                        Green River Killer.

                                 TOM
                        That’s right.

           They look at each other. GARY breaks it.

                                 GARY
                        I need to call my wife. She’ll be 
                        worried.

                                 TOM
                        Your wife knows. There are 
                        detectives at your house right now, 
                        talking to her.

           GARY is visibly distraught at this.

                                 GARY
                        What... what are you telling her? 
                        Judith doesn’t know anything. 
                        She’ll be so scared.

           TOM sees that GARY has tears in his eyes.

                                 TOM
                        Gary, do you love your wife?

           GARY nods.
                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        Then can I give you some advice? 
                        The kindest thing you can do for 
                        her is divorce her, immediately. 
                        This is going to cost you every 
                        penny you have. But you divorce her 
                        now, she’ll get half.

           GARY takes this in, gets more teared up. His head drops.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        Don’t take everything away from 
                        her. Let her keep something. You 
                        owe her that.

           GARY looks up at TOM. TOM sees something in his eyes.

           INT. TOM’S CAR - EMPTY PARKING LOT (2003) - EVENING

           TOM remembering that look, that moment.

           EXT. EMPTY PARKING LOT (2003) - EVENING

           TOM’s car, tiny in the large empty lot, slowly pulls away. 

           EXT. JENSEN HOUSE BEDROOM (2003) - EVENING

           TOM enters the bedroom. CHARLAINE is there, ready for bed. In 
           silence, TOM begins to undress.

                                 CHARLAINE
                        Where did you go?

           TOM just shakes his head.

                                 TOM
                        I’m sorry. I didn’t want you to see 
                        me like that. I’ll clean it up 
                        tomorrow.

           She reaches for his hand. They sit together, quietly.

           INT. JENSEN HOUSE, BEDROOM (2003) - NIGHT

           TOM sits on the edge of the bed, while CHARLAINE sleeps. In 
           the pale moonlight, he stares out the window, alone in this 
           other world. He sees a small figure out on the street below, 
           looking up at his window. It’s GARY. After a beat, GARY turns 
           and walks off up the street.
           EXT. STREET - NIGHT

           TOM walking along the dark street, following GARY ahead in 
           the distance.

           EXT. ‘OLD FOREST’ - DAY

           TOM is walking towards us in a grey landscape. He stops, and 
           sees GARY up ahead, standing at the edge of the ‘Old Forest’. 
           GARY disappears into it. TOM follows. He walks through dense, 
           dark forest, trying to keep GARY in his sights. He sees a 
           clearing up ahead and moves toward it.

           EXT. ‘OLD FOREST’ CLEARING - DAY

           As TOM reaches the clearing, he sees an empty, ABANDONED 
           HOUSE, (like the ones at the airport sites from earlier). He 
           stands looking at it across the clearing. Hidden in the 
           darkness of the doorway, a PAIR OF EYES, watching TOM. TOM 
           heads toward the HOUSE. 

           INT. ABANDONED HOUSE - NIGHT

           TOM walks down a dark CORRIDOR. A FOX runs down the corridor 
           ahead of him. It disappears through an OPEN DOOR at the end. 
           TOM keeps moving, slowly, towards it. Again, we see EYES 
           hidden in the dark beyond the door, watching TOM. As he 
           approaches, the DOOR bangs shut. We hear it being locked from 
           the inside. TOM tries the handle.

                                 TOM
                        Gary? Gary!

           We notice a MIRROR on the wall beside him. Unseen by TOM, 
           instead of his own reflection in the glass, we see GARY 
           there. GARY turns to face TOM, throws a TRIANGULAR ROCK from 
           out of the mirror, which lands at TOM’s feet. TOM turns to 
           the mirror, it’s his own reflection looking back at him. He 
           looks down for the ROCK. Not there. Turns round, JUDITH is 
           there, the ROCK in her outstretched hand, offered to him. As 
           he takes it, the DOOR clicks open in front of him. JUDITH is 
           gone. He enters.

           INT. JENSEN HOUSE, BATHROOM - - NIGHT

           TOM stands in his now cleaned up bathroom. He looks down at 
           the newly tiled floor. Notices a WET PATCH in one area. He 
           looks closer, sees water leaking out around the edges of the 
           tiles. He gets down on the floor, pulls at some of them, and 
           as they come away, he sees that beneath them is more water. 
           Beneath the water, a FACE looking up at him, eyes open. A 
           YOUNG WOMAN under there, standing naked, totally submerged. 
           As he takes away more tiles, he sees another YOUNG WOMAN, and 
           another, and another. All of them naked, standing there, 
           silently looking up at him from beneath the surface. Waiting.

           INT. THE BUNKER, GARY’S ROOM (2003) - MORNING

           Eyes open. GARY lays in his make-shift BED in his small room. 

           TITLE over black - “JUNE 17TH, 2003 - DAY FIVE”

           INT. THE BUNKER, INTERROGATION ROOM (2003) - MORNING

           GARY and TOM. Facing each other. An unspoken connection.

                                 TOM
                        How’d you sleep?

                                 GARY
                        Pretty good. You?

                                 TOM
                             (nods)
                        Breakfast okay?

                                 GARY
                        Decent. Didn’t eat much of it.

           INT. THE BUNKER, PROSECUTION VIEWING ROOM (2003) - CONTINUOUS

           The rest of the TEAM watching, settling in for the session.

                                 GARY (O.S.)
                        Had a stomach-ache. Didn’t want to 
                        make it worse.

                                 DOYON
                        Great. There goes our Zagat rating.

           INT. THE BUNKER, INTERROGATION ROOM (2003) - CONTINUOUS

           TOM puts a photograph, of GARY from the ‘80s, on the table.

                                 TOM
                        A man can change a lot in twenty 
                        years. I know that’s not you 
                        anymore. The person who did all 
                        those terrible things. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 TOM (CONT'D)
                        I think the man I’m looking at now, 
                        wants to be a good man. He wants to 
                        help us. Help the families.

                                 GARY
                             (with difficulty)
                        It’s just... that’s the way... 
                        that’s the way I... when I put that 
                        in there, it’s a place where I 
                        locked it in there. My mind doesn’t 
                        want to give it up.

                                 TOM
                        I understand, Gary. And I think 
                        it’s important for you to remember, 
                        that individual there, is very 
                        different to this individual I’m 
                        talking to now, okay? I know that’s 
                        not who you want to be. 

           GARY nods.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        That’s the ‘Old Gary’. He did those 
                        things, not you. And I want you to 
                        know, it’s alright for you to tell 
                        us anything. We’re not going to be 
                        shocked, by any of it. Okay?

                                 GARY
                        Okay.

                                 MATTSEN
                        Alright. Gary, we want to go back 
                        over what you told us yesterday 
                        about Connie Naon.

           GARY looks blank.

                                 MATTSEN (CONT’D)
                        The one you bit afterwards?

                                 TOM
                        And the rock.

           A moment between GARY and TOM.

                                 GARY
                        Uh huh.

                                 MATTSEN
                        Tell us what you remember about 
                        her.
           GARY looks at the photograph of his ‘old’ self, thinks.

                                 GARY
                        I remember picking her up near the 
                        Red Lion, I think...

                        This is everything we’ve got on her 
                        that he could have seen, right? 
                        Discovery materials, anything 
                        that’s gone public, everything,

                                 PETERS
                        Yes, sir. This is everything.

           INT. THE BUNKER, INTERROGATION ROOM (2003) - CONTINUOUS

                                 GARY
                        We drove out south of the airport, 
                        into the woods. We walked out to 
                        the area where we had sex. I 
                        couldn’t climax on top of her... 
                        Got behind her, and climaxed, and 
                        then after I climaxed I killed her.

                                 TOM
                        Okay.

                                 GARY
                        And like I said, she didn’t let me 
                        touch her chest, so... I was kinda 
                        mad I guess, and I bit her.

           TOM nods, encouraging.

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                        Then I dug the hole. Close to where 
                        she was. And I put her in there 
                        face up...

                                 TOM
                        So, she was another one you buried?

                                 GARY
                        She was another one I buried.

                        I covered her up with the rocks and 
                        stuff from the hole, and the dirt..

                                 TOM
                        Is that where you got the rock 
                        from?

                                 GARY
                        Uh...

                                 TOM
                        The rock you put inside her?

                                 GARY
                        The rock I put inside her. Yes, I 
                        think so...

                                 TOM
                        Were you still mad at her? Is that 
                        why you did that with the rock?

                                 GARY
                        I, uh... I was, uh... I’d started 
                        getting... I had to bury her 
                        because... and the rock... I was 
                        trying to, uh...

           GARY unsure how to go on. TOM has a FLASH IMAGE of TERRY 
           MILLIGAN’S DECOMPOSED REMAINS, striped blouse over her head 
           and legs spread. 

                                 TOM
                             (gently)
                        You started wanting to go back?

           GARY stares at TOM, clearly struggling with something.

                                 GARY
                        I, uh... I had a tendency... not a 
                        tendency... of wanting... ever 
                        since the first ones, at the river, 
                        I had these...
           TOM slowly nodding, willing him on.

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                        ... these urges... to go back to 
                        the bodies. They were just urges. I 
                        never acted on them.

                                 TOM
                        What you’re saying is, you had an 
                        urge to go back and have sex with 
                        the bodies, right?

           PROTHERO clearly unaware of this.

                                 GARY
                        I did have an urge, but I didn’t do 
                        it... and that’s why I started 
                        burying them. Taking them out to 
                        where I wouldn’t go back.

                                 TOM
                        That’s not unusual Gary. That’s 
                        okay.

                                 GARY
                        ‘Cause I... I didn’t want to...

                                 TOM
                        Didn’t want to do that.

                        We suspected something, but... no, 
                        nothing in there, nothing he could

           TOM senses GARY could shut down, knows he has to be careful.

                                 TOM
                        I know it was more than an urge. 
                        Okay? I know that you went back to 
                        some of them.

           GARY just looks at him.
                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        Nothing to be ashamed of. Thousands 
                        of people have done it before you. 
                        You’re not the first one and you

                        Uh huh.

                                 TOM
                        It’s okay to let it out.  

                                 GARY
                        This is... the Gary I was before...

                                 TOM
                        That’s right. If he went back and 
                        had sex with the bodies... that was 
                        him. That’s not you.

                                 GARY
                        I can’t keep holding it in...

                                 TOM
                        It’s building up inside you, like a 
                        bad cheeseburger and... you need to 
                        take a shit...

           GARY and TOM locked into each other, as everyone else looks 
           on.

                                 GARY
                        Yes, I did lie about that. I tried 
                        to stop, but it didn’t work...

                                 TOM
                        Which ones did you go back to, 
                        Gary?

           EXT. RIVER BANK, GREEN RIVER (1982) - DAY

           The LONG GRASS on the banks of the Green River. There is 
           movement in there, but the grass obscures whatever is 
           happening.

                                 GARY (O.S.)
                        The ones at the river. Three of 
                        them.
           INT. THE BUNKER, INTERROGATION ROOM (2003) - CONTINUOUS

                                 GARY
                         One out near the airport.

           EXT. WOODED AREA, NORTH AIRPORT SITE (1982) - DAY

           In the distance, partially obscured amongst the trees, we see 
           the pale, fleshy figure of GARY, naked and having sex with a 
           lifeless body. Like an animal rutting in the forest.

           INT. THE BUNKER, INTERROGATION ROOM (2003) - CONTINUOUS

           TOM trying to contain his emotions, not to put GARY off.

                                 GARY
                        One off Highway 18.

           EXT. WORKMAN’S HUT AREA, NEAR HIGHWAY 18 (1983) - NIGHT

           We watch this scene as if through a black and white infra-red 
           security camera. In the darkness, we can just see some 
           WORKMEN approaching. As they get close to their hut, they 
           trigger the sensors and some lights come on.

                                 GARY (O.S.)
                        Out where they had some work going 
                        on, I think.

           The WORKMEN turn a corner, so don’t notice that the lights 
           have revealed GARY having sex with a woman’s body off near a 
           fence. As he turns mid-act, to see where the light has come 
           from, his eyes reflect the light, like an animal caught on a 
           night camera.

           INT. THE BUNKER, INTERROGATION ROOM (2003) - CONTINUOUS

                                 GARY
                        The one at the bottom of Star Lake 
                        Road. The one I strangled with her 
                        clothes.

           TOM knows who this is immediately. Tries not to show emotion.

           EXT. STAR LAKE ROAD SITE (1984) - DAY

           TERRY MILLIGAN on the ground, dead. Her striped blouse over 
           her head, the rest of her naked body obscured by GARY 
           standing over her, breathing hard, doing up his pants. 
                                 GARY (O.S.)
                        I don’t know how many. I did it to 
                        any one of them that was close by.

           GARY turns to check on his VAN parked the other side of the 
           trees. Through the branches, he sees his son, MATTHEW, 
           sitting in the front seat.

                                 GARY (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        It was a release, y’know... Didn’t 
                        have to pay for it. I was brought 
                        up to not waste anything if it 
                        still had use in it.

           In the VAN, MATTHEW obediently plays with his toys, whilst 
           through the window, we see GARY in the distance, looking at 
           us. 

           INT. THE BUNKER, INTERROGATION ROOM (2003) - CONTINUOUS

                                 GARY
                        I’d go back... few times, maybe. 
                        Until it got too difficult. They’d 
                        be, y’know, too stiff... too many 
                        maggots. 

           TOM is having a tough time hearing this, trying to keep it 
           together.

                                 GARY (CONT'D)
                        That’s why I started burying them, 
                        and putting the rocks in there. 
                        Dumping them further away. I wanted 
                        to stop... I wanted to stop..

           INT. THE BUNKER, PROSECUTION VIEWING ROOM (2003) - CONTINUOUS

           REICHERT and the team celebrate. This is the breakthrough 
           they’ve been waiting for. JIM DOYON staring at the screen.

                                 DOYON
                        You fucking animal.

           INT. THE BUNKER, INTERROGATION ROOM (2003) - CONTINUOUS

           MATTSEN looks across at TOM, sees he’s struggling 
           emotionally.

                                 MATTSEN
                        You’re doing great, Gary. Really 
                        great..
           INT. THE BUNKER, PROSECUTION VIEWING ROOM (2003) - CONTINUOUS

           GRADDON looking at TOM on the monitor.

                                 GRADDON
                        Is Tom okay in there? Do we need to 
                        call a break? Pull him out?

           INT. THE BUNKER, INTERROGATION ROOM (2003) - CONTINUOUS

           TOM gives a slight nod to MATTSEN. MATTSEN keeps pushing.

                                 MATTSEN
                        Was this always outside? You ever 
                        keep a body at your house, to have 
                        sex with later?

                                 GARY
                        No. Never in my house. Always got 
                        ‘em out real quick. Within fifteen 
                        minutes. Well, except one...
                             (looks to PROTHERO)
                        But you don’t need to know about 
                        that.

                                 TOM
                        Don’t need to know what?

                                 GARY
                        She’s one of the charged ones, that 
                        I’m not supposed to, uh..

                                 PROTHERO
                        Don’t worry about that now, Gary. 
                        Go ahead.

                                 GARY
                        She was the one that was closest to 
                        me. She was special. Christensen... 
                        uh, Carol Christensen.

           FLASH IMAGE of TOM back in 1984 in the car with DOYON, 
           looking at the photograph of CAROL CHRISTENSEN with the fish, 
           sausage, wine bottle and bag over her head.

                                 TOM
                        Why... why was Carol special?

                                 GARY
                        I’d dated her a couple times 
                        before. She’d always been real nice 
                        to me. She liked me touching her. 
                        She took her time. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 GARY (CONT'D)
                        She made me feel good... about 
                        being with her. But this time she 
                        was in a real hurry, and it didn’t 
                        turn out right.

                                 TOM
                        She hurried you too much this time?

                                 GARY
                        Hurried me too much...

                                 TOM
                        She had to be somewhere?

                                 GARY
                        I don’t know. I know she had a 
                        daughter...

           TOM has a FLASH IMAGE of little SARAH, playing in the sand-
           pit as he talks to CAROL’s mother in 1984. She looks up at 
           him. Her beautiful face.

           Back in the room with GARY, TOM is clearly affected by this, 
           but again tries to hide it.

                                 TOM
                        So what happened?

           INT. RIDGWAY HOUSE, SEA-TAC (1983) - NIGHT

           We melt through the front door of GARY’s house, and very 
           slowly move along the dark hallway. All is still, quiet.

                                 GARY (O.S.)
                        I waited for her outside the bar 
                        she worked at. Asked her if she 
                        wanted to date.

           At the end of the hallway, a momentary flash of white as a 
           figure crosses the open kitchen doorway, like a ghost in the 
           moonlight. We keep moving slowly forwards.

                                 GARY (CONT'D)
                        Said she was tired, had to be 
                        someplace, I don’t know. 

           We round the corner into a darkened kitchen.

                                 GARY (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        She said we’d have to be quick 
                        about it. I took her to the house.
           Moving into the living room now. Someone is sitting with 
           their back to us on the sofa.

                                 GARY (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        The other times we’d done it in my 
                        truck, but I wanted her, uh... to 
                        be more comfortable there. 

           As we slowly move in, keeping our distance, we see it’s GARY 
           sitting naked in the dark, drinking from a bottle of wine, 
           eyes glistening.

                                 GARY (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        But she wouldn’t wash herself with 
                        me... too much in a hurry. 

           Now we’re moving along another corridor. On the wall a framed 
           picture of GARY and his son MATTHEW. In the reflection, we 
           see GARY, naked, pulling a TRUNK along the corridor towards a 
           room at the end.

                                 GARY (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        It had been so good before, but... 
                        she wasn’t satisfying me. She 
                        wasn’t enjoying it.

           INT. BEDROOM, RIDGWAY HOUSE, SEA-TAC (1983)

           Very close on GARY’s face. Locks of blonde hair across it. 
           Slow pullback over the next speech, revealing GARY laying 
           next to CAROL CHRISTENSEN, both naked in his bed, sheets 
           pulled back. He holds her lifeless body close to him. Clothes 
           on the floor, a belt at the foot of the bed, the trunk 
           waiting near the doorway.

                                 GARY (O.S.)
                        I couldn’t climax on top of her, 
                        like before... and every time she 
                        said hurry, I got madder and 
                        madder. I got behind her, and after 
                        I was done... I killed her.

           INT. THE BUNKER, INTERROGATION ROOM (2003) - CONTINUOUS

                                 GARY
                        I cried afterwards.

                                 TOM
                        Did you keep her overnight?

                                 GARY
                        Uh, maybe...
                                 TOM
                        Did you have sex with her again?

                                 GARY
                        I don’t remember...

                                 TOM
                        It’s okay.

                                 GARY
                        I, uh... I might have. 

           EXT. WOODED AREA, MAPLE VALLEY (1983) - DAY

           Close on FISH SCALES. Another slow pullback reveals the fish 
           laying on the body of CAROL CHRISTENSEN, laying on the ground 
           among bits of trash, fully clothed, bag over her head, 
           sausage meat in her hands. Finally, a wine bottle is placed 
           on her by an unseen GARY.

                                 GARY (O.S.)
                        When I dropped off her body, it was 
                        in the day, I know that. I had some 
                        stuff in the refrigerator, the fish 
                        and the sausage meat and... They 
                        didn’t mean nothing. I was just 
                        trying to confuse you guys. I put 
                        her clothes back on, because I 
                        didn’t want to go back. I couldn’t 
                        do that to her. I cared for her. 

           INT. THE BUNKER, INTERROGATION ROOM (2003) - CONTINUOUS

                                 GARY
                        I really cared for her. I’d had 
                        great times with her before. Why 
                        not this time?

           GARY stops. The room is silent. TOM just looking at GARY. 
           MATTSEN unsure where TOM is at. PROTHERO looks up from 
           writing.

           INT. THE BUNKER, PROSECUTION VIEWING ROOM (2003) - CONTINUOUS

           REICHERT standing, watching on the monitor, next to him JIM 
           DOYON.

                                 SHERIFF REICHERT
                        I think Tom’s losing it. Do we stop 
                        it now?
                                 DOYON
                        Just give him a little longer...

           REICHERT looks to GRADDON. GRADDON gives a small nod.

           INT. THE BUNKER, INTERROGATION ROOM (2003) - CONTINUOUS

           TOM staring at GARY. Looks down, shakes his head.

                                 TOM
                        Help me here, Gary.

           GARY just looks at him.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        Carol was special to you, right?

                                 GARY
                        Yes.

                                 TOM
                        You cared about her?

                                 GARY
                        Yes. 

                                 TOM
                        Okay. So, why kill her?

                                 GARY
                        I told you. Because of the 
                        hurryingness, and...

                                 TOM
                        I know what you told me, Gary. But 
                        it doesn’t make any sense.

           GARY stares at him, blankly.

                                 TOM (CONT'D)
                        In all these interviews you say you 
                        just wanted sex, and these women, 
                        they do something wrong, they piss 
                        you off, and you snap. They tap 
                        your ‘rage’ and you end up choking 
                        them.

           GARY just blinks.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        But Carol, she tells you right 
                        away, she’s in a hurry. She can’t 
                        give you the time you want.

                                 TOM (CONT’D)
                        Right there, you should have known. 
                        And I think you did. You say this 
                        was just about the sex. But it was 
                        about the killing too. Wasn’t it?

           GARY and TOM, eyes locked, no-one else exists.

                                 TOM (CONT'D)
                        You’d killed before. Many times.

                                 GARY
                        Yes.

                                 TOM
                        You know what’s going to happen if 
                        she pisses you off?

                                 GARY
                        Uh huh.

                                 TOM
                        And you like this woman. You care 
                        about her?

                                 GARY
                        Yes.

                                 TOM
                        And you get into this anyway. 
                        Knowing full well she could end up 
                        dead.

                                 GARY
                        Yes.

           TOM looking into this man’s face. Into the last twenty years. 
           Into nothingness. Finally -

                                 TOM
                        Why?

                                 GARY
                             (not understanding)
                        What’s that?

                                 TOM
                        Why? Why’d you do this?

           GARY looks at him. 

                                 GARY
                        I just...
           GARY has a FLASH IMAGE of standing among the trees inside the 
           ‘OLD FOREST’. He is looking at JUDITH, who stands just 
           outside in the grey light. (We cut between the room and the 
           forest).

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                        I needed to kill.

           JUDITH is walking away across the fields towards the rise in 
           the distance. TOM intent on GARY’s face, his words.

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                        Because of... that.

           Just before JUDITH disappears over the rise, she turns and 
           SLOWLY WAVES in that familiar way. GARY watches her from 
           within the darkness. And then she’s gone.

                                 GARY (CONT’D)
                        I just needed to kill.

           Everyone sits in silence. We realize TOM is crying.

                                 TOM
                        You touched me, Gary. You touched 
                        me. I need to take a break.

           TOM stands. He leaves the room, as MATTSEN turns off the 
           camera.

                                 GARY
                             (to PROTHERO)
                        What happened? Did I say something 
                        wrong?

           INT. THE BUNKER, CORRIDOR (2003) - CONTINUOUS

           TOM walks along the corridor. Enters an empty room. Sits at a 
           table and starts to weep. JIM DOYON stands outside the door, 
           watches his friend sobbing. A man who has looked into the 
           abyss and found no answers, only darkness.

           EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY

           We’re travelling along a mountain road. We can’t see 
           surroundings yet, just the ground beneath us moving fast.

                                 TOM (V.O.)
                        The interviews with Gary Ridgway 
                        went on to last 188 days.

                                 TOM (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Even though he continued to 
                        frustrate, the breakthroughs of 
                        that day gave us what we needed to 
                        continue.

           EXT. JENSEN HOUSE BACKYARD (2003) - DAY

           TOM and CHARLAINE sit next to each other on the deck. She can 
           see he’s been through something shattering.

                                 CHARLAINE
                        How was your day?

           TOM just smiles and shakes his head. It’s all he can do not 
           to break down again. He takes her hand.

                                 TOM (V.O.)
                        The next day I went back to work 
                        and resumed my place.

           EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY

           As we travel along, the camera rises and we see that we’re on 
           a mountain road, steep bank to one side.

                                 TOM (V.O.)
                        We never discussed what happened, 
                        my ‘breakdown’ as I call it, and 
                        nothing like it occurred again.

           INT. KING COUNTY COURTHOUSE (2003) - DAY

           A packed courtroom, nearly three hundred people squashed in. 
           Jury box crammed with REPORTERS. Cameras. POLICE and SWAT 
           team members everywhere. The main seating area full of the 
           VICTIM’S FAMILY members. TOM sits to one side of them. At the 
           very front, GARY. PROTHERO next to him.

                                 TOM (V.O.)
                        On November 5, 2003, Gary Leon 
                        Ridgway was formally charged with 
                        forty-eight counts of murder.

           We hear the names of the victims being read out. (This will 
           now continue under until the end.) “...Wendy Lee Coffield... 
           Giselle A. Lovvorn... Debra Lynn Bonner...” 
           EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY

           As we travel along, we look down the embankment at the side 
           of the road. In the distance below us, we see two pale 
           figures, naked, dirty, watching us as we pass. They stand 
           where their lifeless bodies were left. “...Alma Ann Smith... 
           Carrie Ann Rois...”

                                 TOM (V.O.)
                        On December 18th 2003, Ridgway was 
                        sentenced to life in prison.

           INT. KING COUNTY COURTHOUSE (2003) - DAY

           We’re back at the courtroom. Packed, sombre. GARY in the same 
           place, a white v-neck over his red jumpsuit. TOM at the back. 

                                 TOM (V.O.)
                        The family members of his victims 
                        were given the chance to face him.

           “... Marie Malvar... Gail Matthews...”

           A young woman stands at the podium, dabbing her eyes.

                                 SARAH KING
                        I was only five when my mother 
                        died. I was at home, waiting for my 
                        mom to come back. This has been my 
                        life. She wasn’t a prostitute. She 
                        was my mother. And I miss her...

           TOM has a FLASH IMAGE of the little girl in the sand-pit, 
           looking at him, all those years ago. Here she is, CAROL 
           CHRISTENSEN’s daughter, 25 now.

           “... Carol Ann Christensen... Mary Bridget Meehan..”

           EXT. WOODED AREA - DAY

           We’re moving through forest now. As we pass by trees, four 
           more naked figures look at us off in the distance.

           “... Andrea M. Childers... Constance Naon... Cindy Ann Smith”

                                 TOM (V.O.)
                        Of the forty-eight convictions, 
                        four were women who Gary led us to 
                        as a result of the interviews.

           “.. Pammy Avent.. Patricia Barczak.. Marta Reeves..”
           EXT. VACANT LOT AREA - DAY

           We move past the empty, abandoned houses and see, dotted off 
           among the trees, four young women, naked, dirty, watching.

           “.. Shawnda Leea Summers.. Cheryl Lee Wims.. Lisa L. Yates..”

                                 TOM (V.O.)
                        Eventually, after a lot of 
                        pressure, Gary admitted he’d lied  
                        about not killing after ‘85, but he 
                        only told us about the ones he knew 
                        we were aware of already, so we may 
                        never know the real number.

           “..Kimberly Nelson.. Maureen Sue Feeney.. Mary West..”

           EXT. PARK AREA (1965) - DAY

           On the edge of a park, near some houses, we see a YOUNG BOY 
           dressed in cowboy gear, playing alone. We slowly move towards 
           him.

                                 TOM (V.O.)
                        As to when he began? He told us 
                        that when he was sixteen, he 
                        happened upon a child playing 
                        alone, lured him into the woods and 
                        stabbed him. The boy, who survived, 
                        said that his attacker told him, “I 
                        wanted to know what it felt like to 
                        kill someone”. Gary was never even 
                        suspected. It’s hard to believe 
                        that he could have waited another 
                        33 years to try it again.

           INT. PRISON CELL - DAY

           GARY sits alone in his cell, plucking at his hand. We move 
           towards him. “... Terry Renee Milligan... Kelly Ware... April 
           Buttram...”

                                 TOM (V.O.)
                        He said it was the only thing he’d 
                        ever found that he was good at.

           “.. Debbie May Abernathy.. Denise Darcel Bush.. Martina 
           Authorlee..”
                                 TOM (V.O.)
                        Asked to rate his evil on a scale 
                        of one to five, Gary gave himself a 
                        three.

           “... Mary Sue Bello... Tracy Winston... Roberta Hayes..”

           EXT. LITTLE LEAGUE FIELD - DAY

           Travelling across the field now towards the woods.

           “... Linda Rule... Sandra K. Gabbert... Kimi Kai Pitsor..”

           There looking out at us among the trees as we pass, stand 
           five more young women.

                                 TOM (V.O.)
                        I never did get an answer to “why”. 
                        Not from Gary, at least.

           INT. MILLIGAN RESIDENCE, SEATTLE (1984) - DAY

           TOM sits on the sofa opposite MRS. MILLIGAN in the armchair.

                                 TOM (V.O.)
                        I had told Mrs. Milligan I would 
                        try and find out why this had 
                        happened to her daughter, Terry. 

                                 MRS. MILLIGAN
                        If a fox keeps stealing away your 
                        hens you don’t waste time asking 
                        why the fox is doing it. He’s a 
                        fox. You just need to do better 
                        looking after those hens, 
                        detective.

           “...Debra Lorraine Estes... Shirley Marie Sherrill...”

           INT. KING COUNTY SHERIFF’S DEPARTMENT, SEATTLE - DAY

           TOM sits in shirt-sleeves at an office cubicle.

                                 TOM (V.O.)
                        Once it was all over, I decided to 
                        do three things. The first was to 
                        quit smoking. The second was I 
                        started working in the Cold Case 
                        Unit at the Sheriffs Department.

           TOM talks on the phone.
                                 TOM
                        I just wanted you to know I’ve re-
                        opened your daughter’s case, Mrs. 
                        Adams... Well, as long as someone 
                        is looking, there’s always hope...

           “ Tina Marie Thompson... Yvonne Shelly Antosh... Denise 
           Plager”

           EXT. MAUI BEACH (2005) - DAY

           TOM and CHARLAINE walk along the white sands. 

                                 TOM (V.O.)
                        The third was I decided to take my 
                        wife to Maui. We’d last been there 
                        thirty-seven years ago. Just before 
                        our wedding.

           TOM can see a small gathering of people on the beach up 
           ahead. CHARLAINE unaware. With a small smile, he keeps 
           heading toward them.

                                 TOM (V.O.)
                        The wedding that we’d argued about, 
                        because of Gary. My wife felt the 
                        memory had been ruined, and I said 
                        we couldn’t let him take that away 
                        from us. That would be letting him 
                        win. 

           Closer to the gathering now, and CHARLAINE finally notices 
           them. Turns to TOM confused, who just smiles.

                                 TOM (V.O.)
                        Well, I realized it’s not about 
                        winning or losing.

           We now see that among those gathered there on the beach are 
           MIKE and JEFF, and their families, a local PRIEST and a lady 
           approaching CHARLAINE with a LEI. CHARLAINE overwhelmed as 
           she realizes what is happening.

                                 TOM (V.O.)
                        Everything we have that matters to 
                        us is always under threat. There 
                        will always be someone or something 
                        trying to take it from us. Trying 
                        to destroy it. 

           Later, mid-ceremony. TOM and CHARLAINE, LEIS around their 
           necks and surrounded by smiling faces, kiss.
                                 TOM (V.O.)
                        Things that are wild and 
                        uncivilized and don’t play by our 
                        rules. 

           EXT. MAUI HOTEL BALCONY (2005) - NIGHT

           TOM stands on the balcony, looking out at the night sky.

                                 TOM (V.O.)
                        You don’t win against an 
                        earthquake, or a hurricane, or even 
                        a Gary. You have to live with it. 
                        You do your best to survive it, and 
                        you try to learn from it. Learn 
                        everything you can. Because it will 
                        be coming again. You just have to 
                        keep at it. 

           CHARLAINE comes out, puts her arms around him.

                                 TOM (V.O.)
                        Try your best. And if that means 
                        just showing up, again and again, 
                        day after day...

                                 CHARLAINE
                             (amused)
                        Have you been smoking out here, Tom 
                        Jensen?

                                 TOM
                             (caught out)
                        I’m trying, hon. I’m trying.

           She kisses him on the cheek and they walk back into the room, 
           leaving us outside, looking into the dark. Faint sound of a 
           CURTAIN FLAPPING in the breeze, somewhere. 

                                 TOM (V.O.)
                        ... well, that might be good 
                        enough.

           “...Delores Lavern Williams... Patricia Yellowrobe...”

           EXT. GREEN RIVER - DAY

           We’re travelling over the surface of the water now.

           “... Colleen Renee Brockman... Kimberly Nelson...”
           As we move along, we see up ahead on the riverbank, standing 
           in the tall grass, the small, naked figure of OPAL MILLS.

           “... Opal Charmaine Mills...”

           Then we see a woman standing in the river in front of us, the 
           water up to her waist. 

           “... Cynthia Jean Hinds...”

           She slowly looks into the water beside her, guiding our eyes. 
           We hover above the river, then go beneath the surface, and 
           see the naked figure of a WOMAN held down by rocks, looking 
           at us, her right arm loose and swayed by the current, back 
           and forth, like she’s SLOWLY WAVING. 

           We pull up out of the water and slowly move backwards and 
           away over the surface again, OPAL and CYNTHIA no longer 
           there.

                                 NEWS REPORTER (V.O.)
                        The body of 31 year old Marcia Faye 
                        Chapman was found in the Green 
                        River today, weighted down by 
                        rocks. The local rafter who found 
                        her, said that one of the rocks had 
                        come loose, and that she appeared 
                        to be waving to him from under the 
                        water. This is only the latest in a 
                        number of grisly discoveries, 
                        leading local police to believe it 
                        may well be the work of a serial 
                        killer... 

           As we keep moving away, a MAN standing on a RUBBER RAFT 
           filled with items of river-junk, drifts by us. He pushes 
           himself along with a hooked pole, unwittingly moving slowly 
           closer to making his discovery, and the start of a twenty 
           year search.
