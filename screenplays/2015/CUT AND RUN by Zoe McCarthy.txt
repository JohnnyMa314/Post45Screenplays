           Planes. Shuttles. Taxis. Busses. Palm trees. PANDEMONIUM. 

           INT. MIAMI INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY

           QUICK CUTS FROM VARIOUS INTERNATIONAL GATES/AIRLINES/ 
           TERMINALS - 

           A bodacious BRAZILIAN GIRL, 17, struggles to lift her giant 
           brightly-colored suitcase.

           A petit, Japanese decora-style HARAJUKU GIRL, 16, impatiently 
           taps a neon pink six-inch heel in the CUSTOMS LINE. 

           A skinny SCANDINAVIAN SNOW PRINCESS, 15, takes off another 
           furry layer before being allowed through security. 

           As we JUMP AROUND the airport starts to feel like a SUPER HOT 
           YOUNG ADULT MELTING POT.

           EXT. MIAMI INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - ARRIVALS - DAY

           A white CADILLAC ESCALADE LIMO circles picking up: a gorgeous 
           AUSTRALIAN GIRL, a stunning AFRICAN GIRL, a beautiful INDIAN 
           GIRL, a balletic CHINESE GIRL etc. 

           The limo, now stuffed with girlie excitement, parks illegally 
           in front of the Lufthansa terminal and waits - 

           Finally, a UKRAINIAN KNOCKOUT, 17, rushes outside, lost and 
           overwhelmed.

           The driver-side window rolls down slowly. We don’t see the 
           driver as we stay on the girl. 

                                 RAY (O.S.)
                        Irina Obuchowa?

           Irina stares at the limo, stunned.

                                 IRINA
                        Yes! That is me!

           Irina dives inside the vehicle. 

           INT./EXT. ESCALADE LIMO - MIAMI INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY

           Irina stares at the young, eclectic sorority and smiles as 
           tears of hope fill her weary grey eyes. 
           EXTREMELY CLOSE ON: A numb, wrinkly, pinkish SACK that 
           appears to be breathing. Alien life? A SHARP HEMOSTAT 
           punctures the terrified sack like a claw of an arcade game 
           digging for a prize. The sharp instrument opens the sack and 
           retrieves a pale colored tube which is held in place with a 
           small ring clamp. The hemostat sneaks under the tube--SNIP.  

                                 ANNA (O.S.)
                        You should feel a little pressure--

           INT. SOUTH BEACH MEDICAL GROUP - EXAM ROOM - DAY

           ANNA ROCKPORT, 34, a lovably neurotic and romantically 
           frustrated urologist performs a no-scalpel vasectomy on 
           cranky ALBERT BERGSTEIN, 52.

                                 ALBERT
                        Pressure? You kidding? Dr. Rockport 
                        I got five kids! This here snip 
                        snip’s the greatest gift the Good 
                        Lord’s brought me in years.

                                 ANNA
                             (winks)
                        You have modern medicine to thank 
                        for your vasectomy, Mr. Bergstein.

                                 ALBERT
                        Call me Albert.
                             (beat)
                        You got kids?

                                 ANNA
                        No. Not yet. Maybe one day. 
                             (beat)
                        Now hold still for me--

           Albert closes his eyes as Anna seals up the tissue.

                                 ALBERT
                        My advice: Don’t have more than 
                        two. The novelty wears off and you 
                        still gotta do the diapers.
                             (beat)
                        You married at least?

           Anna puts the instruments down, snaps off her gloves, and 
           raises a neurotically threaded eyebrow.

                                 ALBERT (CONT’D)
                        Didn’t mean nothing by it, Doc-- 
                        ‘specially when you got me by the 
                        balls. Just, at your age--
           Not taking the bait, Anna steps back and admires her work.

                                 ANNA
                        Everything looks great. Ice your 
                        testicles tonight, take it easy for 
                        the next few days, and I’ll see you 
                        in six weeks to test your sperm 
                        count. 
                             (excited)
                        Don’t worry about me, Albert. I 
                        have a date tonight. 

           INT. WAXING SALON - SOUTH BEACH - AFTERNOON

           The apathetic WAXER, 40s, preps Anna for a Brazilian.

                                 ANNA
                             (nervous)
                        So, I’ve never done this before, 
                        but my vision is put-together-
                        potential-life-partner, not 
                        prepubescent moon rock. 
                             (gushes)
                        His name is Dennis--

           The waxer RIPS OFF ANNA’S ERRANT PUBES.  

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        AAAHHH!!!

           INT. BLOW DRY BAR - SOUTH BEACH - LATER

           Anna perspires profusely while getting a BLOW OUT from a 
           trendy STYLIST, 30s. 

                                 ANNA
                             (over the BLOW DRYER)
                        ...We haven’t met in person yet, 
                        but I just feel so comfortable 
                        around him, which is huge because I 
                        haven’t been able to be myself 
                        around a man since working with 
                        cadavers in med school. 

           INT. SEXY DRESS BOUTIQUE - SOUTH BEACH - LATER

           Anna, barefoot and wearing a sexy, sequined dress she hasn’t 
           yet paid for, blocks the exhausted SALES GIRL from the line 
           of IMPATIENT CUSTOMERS at the register.
                                 ANNA
                        ...It’s not like I have any 
                        expectations or anything, I just 
                        want to make sure I’ve done 
                        everything in my power to ensure a 
                        nice evening. This might shock you, 
                        but I don’t date that much--

           The customers GROAN/EYE ROLL. 

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        I’ll take the dress if it makes my 
                        butt look big in that good way... 
                        thoughts?

           The sales girl SIGHS.

           EXT. PACKED TRENDY ROOFTOP BAR - SOUTH BEACH - NIGHT 

           Anna, very out of place despite her efforts in the sea of 
           SEXY MIAMIANS, sits at the bar sipping white wine, alone. 

           Anna waves the stupidly hot, bikini-clad BARTENDER, 25, over - 

                                 BARTENDER
                        Another Chardonnay?

                                 ANNA
                        Make it one of those skinny-bitch 
                        drinks that’s mostly tequila and 
                        keep ‘em coming. 
                             (SIGHS)
                        No, everything’s not okay... I got 
                        stood up... Again...

           The bartender pours Anna tequila shots as she rants.

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        I’m a urologist. My love life’s an 
                        ironic failure loop...

           Before the bartender can comment - 

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        Pity only makes it worse.
                             (leans in, whispers)
                        I need to get laid tonight. 
                             (takes a shot)
                        I wanna go home with someone hot 
                        and dangerous, in a white collar 
                        way. Someone deep and Don 
                        Drapery... Someone like...

           Anna scans the scene and feasts her eyes on EDDIE CHARROW, 
           38, tall, tan, and intense with great hair, holding court at 
           the best table in the house.  

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        Him. 
                             (throws a shot back)
                        But, who am I kidding? I could 
                        never get a guy with a full head of 
                        hair...

                                 BARTENDER
                             (chirpy)
                        Sounds like someone’s lacking 
                        confidence.

                                 ANNA
                             (ignores her)
                        Unless... What if I turned my 
                        handicap into a handiCAN? WHAT IF, 
                        and I realize I might be a little 
                        drunk, but when did that ever hurt 
                        a female person trying to get 
                        laid... What if THIS WHOLE TIME 
                        I’ve just been lacking confidence?! 

           The bartender opens her mouth when Anna, like she’s done it a 
           million times, tucks a couple twenties in the bartender’s 
           bikini top and pats her bouncy breast. 

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        Good talk.
           EXT. PACKED TRENDY ROOFTOP BAR - EDDIE’S TABLE- MOMENTS LATER

           Anna drunkenly CLOMPS over to Eddie’s table, interrupting his 
           conversation with two DULL AS SHIT HOT GIRLS, 25, and 
           snatches his scotch and drains it -  

                                 ANNA
                        How’d you like to share a wild but 
                        respectful night with a woman who 
                        knows more about your ding-a-ling 
                        than you do?

           The hot girls glower at Anna.

                                 EDDIE
                        Do I know you?

                                 ANNA
                        No... That’s the point. But, if you 
                        insist I’m Anna, The Dick Doctor. 

                                 EDDIE
                        Sorry, but it’s not my birthday and 
                        I didn’t order a clown.

           Eddie turns back to the hot girls who prattle at him, boring 
           him to death. 

                                 ANNA
                        Good cause I hate birthdays and I’m 
                        a urologist. 

           Eddie LAUGHS. 

                                 EDDIE
                             (bemused)
                        You’re really a dick doctor?

           Anna summons every ounce of confidence inside her and nods. 

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        What’s the craziest thing you’ve 
                        ever seen on a dude’s sack?

                                 ANNA
                        A dick mole with an uncanny 
                        resemblance to Oprah. 

           Eddie BURSTS OUT LAUGHING as the grossed out hot girls stomp 
           back to their table. 

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        Too weird?
                                 EDDIE
                        Refreshing.
                             (beat)
                        Anna, I’m Eddie. 

           Eddie flashes his killer smile and points to the three 
           tallest buildings on the South Beach skyline. 

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        I own a couple hotels on Collins.

                                 ANNA
                        You wanna keep bragging or do you 
                        wanna buy me a drink? 

           Eddie grins at Anna, intrigued.

           INT. EDDIE’S MANSION - LOFT STYLE LIVING ROOM - SOUTH BEACH - 
           MOMENTS LATER

           Anna and Eddie stumble inside his art deco-inspired luxury 
           home, making out.

           Eddie unbuckles his belt.

                                 EDDIE
                        I wanna show you something.

           Anna rips open her blouse. 

                                 ANNA
                        I’m tingling in places I didn’t 
                        know I could tingle! 
                             (beat)
                        You’ve been tested recently, right?

           Eddie kisses her neck. 

                                 EDDIE
                        Of course. 

           Eddie starts to leads her upstairs - 

                                 ANNA
                        Wait! Give me your phone first. 
                             (”sexy” off his confusion)
                        I want to put my number in it in 
                        case you forget to ask for it in 
                        the morning.

           Eddie patiently grabs his phone from his pocket. 
                                 EDDIE
                        Go ahead.

                                 ANNA

                                 EDDIE
                        Got it. 

           Eddie reaches for her hand, when - 

                                 ANNA
                        Really quick call me so I have 
                        yours. Also, what’s your last name?

           Eddie smiles tightly and calls Anna--her phone vibrates. 

                                 EDDIE
                        Charrow. 

           Eddie heads for the stairs. Satisfied, Anna follows.

           INT. EDDIE’S MANSION - UPSTAIRS - “HEAVEN” - SECONDS LATER

           Eddie flips the light on to reveal his white, mirrored, 
           Disneyland-meets-50 SHADES-MIAMI-meets-Liberace style sex 
           playroom complete with every profligate sex toy, prop, 
           fantasy, and costume imaginable including a video camera.

           Anna, in shock and awe, selects a slutty My Little Pony 
           winged unicorn costume.

                                 ANNA
                        Ohmygod! Is this a Princess 
                        Twilight Sparkle costume? I had one 
                        of these when I was a kid! 

                                 EDDIE
                        She’s one of my favorites.

           Anna touches the pearlescent horn, accidently turning the 
           VIBRATOR ON.

                                 ANNA
                             (gets it)
                        Ohhhhh. 
                             (LAUGHS)
                        You’re into this?

           Eddie smiles.
           INT. EDDIE’S MANSION - “HEAVEN” - MOMENTS LATER

           Eddie watches drunken Anna, wearing the pony costume, crawl 
           around on all fours SINGING HER HEART OUT to the original My 
           Little Pony theme song - 

                                 ANNA
                        My Little Pony, My Little Pony, 
                        what will today’s adventure bring? 
                             (winks at excited Eddie)
                        My Little Pony, My Little Pony will 
                        there be exciting sites to see?

           Eddie bends over, assuming the position. 

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        Will there be wonder? Hither and 
                        yonder? Letting your heart be your 
                        guide!

           Anna paws the ground, ready to peg him, but suddenly feels 
           sick.

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        My Little Pony, My Little Pony I’ll 
                        be there right by your side. I’ll 
                        be thereeeee, right by your--

           She grabs her stomach and PUKES ALL OVER HIS DICK.

           Eddie jumps up. 

                                 EDDIE
                        Fucking disgusting!!

           Anna mortified, takes a few steps, and runs out. 

           Eddie darkens as he presses a button on the video camera. 

           His phone immediately BUZZES as he yells to his assistant - 

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        Ray, I got a mess for you.

           RAY PLOVER, 36, a blonde but brooding asthmatic with an 
           inconveniently strong moral compass, labors up the stairs, 
           starts wheezing, whips out his inhaler and sucks on it. 

                                 RAY
                             (despises Eddie)
                        I got it, boss. No problem.
           INT. ANGEL’S APARTMENT - BAD NEIGHBORHOOD, SOUTH MIAMI - SAME

           Angel’s apartment is a claustrophobic, brightly-colored dump.   

           ANGEL OLSEN, 32, our modern day “pretty woman,” sarcastic, 
           resourceful, and, like most Americans, really hates her job, 
           lies prone, in mismatched jammies, on her tired, orange 
           chaise watching Pretty Woman.

                                 VIVIAN
                        Let’s watch old movies all 
                        night...we’ll just veg out in front 
                        of the TV.

                                 EDWARD 
                        Veg out?

                                 VIVIAN
                        Yeah. Be still like vegetables. Lay 
                        like broccoli. 

                                 EDWARD 
                        Look, I’ll tell ya what. I’ll be 
                        back. We’ll do broccoli tomorrow.

           Angel takes a hit from a Hello Kitty bong.

                                 ANGEL
                             (as the smoke billows out)
                        What a load of crap.

           Angel reaches for the remote when her phone RINGS - Piece of 
           Shit calling. 

           A picture of “Piece of Shit,” aka TOMMY, 42, rocking a trendy 
           mohawk, a tarantula face tat, and a blunt, flashes on the 
           screen. 

           Angel GROANS, watches it RING, and RING, and finally - 

                                 ANGEL (CONT’D)
                        Make it quick Tommy, I’m tryin’ to 
                        keep the line clear in case someone 
                        calls to tell me I’ve won the 
                        lottery.

           Angel takes another hit from Hello Kitty. 

                                 ANGEL (CONT’D)
                        ...But, Tommy, my sense of humor’s 
                        all I got... Who?...No way, that 
                        guy’s a prick...Yes, I do realize 
                        I’ve only got a few solid earning 
                        years left... 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ANGEL (CONT’D)
                        Actually, I have put thought into 
                        it...
                             (cracks herself up)
                        I was thinking of running for 
                        political office...Angel Olsen for 
                        City Council has a nice ring to it, 
                        yeah? ...You know what, Tommy, go 
                        fuck yourself! 

           Angel hangs up and glares at her low ceiling wishing she 
           could eject herself into another universe when - 

           Her phone CHIMES with a reminder - Kayla’s birthday’s 
           tomorrow.

           Angel instantly softens as she stares at the only pristine 
           item in her place - 

           CLOSE ON: A FRAMED PICTURE OF A BEAUTIFUL LITTLE GIRL 
           BUILDING A SAND CASTLE. 

           Angel grabs her phone and calls Tommy back.

                                 ANGEL (CONT’D)
                        Alright fuckhead, I’m in. But, I 
                        want five-hundred and tell the 
                        prick I want the money up-front.

           Angel hangs up and walks to the bathroom.  

           She stops in front of the TV - Julia Roberts prances along 
           Rodeo Drive with shopping bags. 

           Angel grabs her makeup bag and faces herself in the mirror. 

                                 ANGEL (CONT’D)
                        Guess you’re more the Kit De Luca 
                        type, huh.

           EXT. EDDIE’S SOUTH BEACH MANSION - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Angel, oozing angry sex appeal, pulls up in a busted red car. 

                                 ANGEL
                        Get in, get your money, get out. Do 
                        not lose your temper.

           INT. EDDIE’S MANSION - “HEAVEN” - MOMENTS LATER

           Eddie, like Simba presiding over all the light touches, leads 
           Angel inside his kingdom as he futzes with his phone--
           uploading something. 
                                 ANGEL
                        Eddie, this time I want the money 
                        first--then you get it in the back. 
                             (gags)
                        Why does it smell like puke in 
                        here?

           Eddie’s phone BUZZES--upload complete. 

                                 EDDIE
                        You get your money if and when I’m 
                        satisfied. 

                                 ANGEL
                        No fuckin’ way. That ain’t fair! 

           Eddie SLAPS ANGEL ACROSS THE FACE.

                                 EDDIE
                        No more small talk.

           Angel touches her searing flesh, SNAPS, and they ERUPT INTO A 
           RIDICULOUS FIGHT using all of the sparkley sex toys to beat 
           the shit out of each other.

                                 ANGEL
                        Eddie, what happened when you were 
                        little that made you so fucked up? 

                                 EDDIE
                        I didn’t have the best relationship 
                        with my mother.

           Angel grabs a string of pink plastic anal beads and CHOKES 
           HIM WITH IT. 

                                 ANGEL
                        Well, I’m a hooker not a therapist. 
                        And I quit.

           INT. BURGER JOINT - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

           Angel devours a burger while holding a cold soda to her 
           cheek. 

           Her phone RINGS - Piece of Shit calling. 

           She immediately starts CHOKING but swallows successfully and 
           silences the phone. 

           Her phone CHIMES - text from Tommy - u r dead.
           Angel SIGHS, realizing she can’t go home as Tommy knows where 
           she lives.

           Her phone CHIMES again. 

                                 ANGEL
                             (irritated)
                        For the love of...

           She stares at the screen - Kayla’s birthday’s today!

           Angel’s heart sinks.

           INT. ANNA’S CONDO - BEDROOM - MORNING

           Anna’s home is the opposite of Angel’s--an extremely clean, 
           but lonely, beachy oasis. 

           Anna wakes up, hungover.   

           She sits up in bed and tries to put the pieces together.

           She gets up, pops some Advil and reaches for her phone--she 
           has hundreds of messages and missed calls. 

                                 ANNA
                        What the...?! 

           CLOSE ON: THE PHONE SCREEN - THERE’S A VIDEO, POSTED ON A 
           REVENGE PORN SITE -  

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                             (as she reads)
                        Watch Anna Rockport, The Dirty Dick 
                        Doctor Horsing Around!

           Anna turns white. 

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        OHMYGOD!! 

           Anna hits play and last night quickly and terrifyingly 
           returns. Her mouth drops as she watches her drunk self - 

                                 ANNA (THE VIDEO) (CONT’D)
                        My Little Pony, My Little Pony, 
                        what will today’s adventure bring? 
                        My Little Pony, My Little Pony will 
                        there be exciting sites to see?--

           Anna quickly shuts it off as every vein in her face pops out -  
                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        Trending??! 

           INT./EXT. ANGEL’S CAR/BURGER JOINT PARKING LOT - SAME

           A groggy Angel wakes up to a CARTMAN-ESQUE KID pressing his 
           face against her window and making lewd gestures. 

           Angel rolls down the window and pours warm soda on his head. 

           He runs off, SCREAMING.

                                 ANGEL
                        That’s what I thought, perv!

           Angel checks her face in the rearview mirror, and touches the 
           spot where Eddie hit her.  

           She checks her phone--twenty-three missed calls and seventeen 
           u r dead texts from Tommy, some of which have dead animal 
           emojis. 

           Angel SIGHS and searches Craigslist for jobs when her phone 
           CHIMES - it’s an e-mail from a daily/best of video website 
           featuring Anna’s video--now with a million views.

           Angel, hoping for a laugh, PLAYS THE VIDEO and scratches her 
           head - 

                                 ANGEL (CONT’D)
                        The fuck is wrong with the world?!

           She calls Kayla. 

                                 KAYLA (O.S.)
                        Hello? 
                             (beat)
                        Mommy, no one’s there again...

                        Hello?
                             (beat)
                        Who are you?

           Angel lingers on the line and nervously hangs up.

           INT./EXT. - ANNA’S PRIUS - EN ROUTE TO WORK - LATER THAT 
           MORNING

           Anna crawls through terrible traffic and frantically calls 
           Eddie. 
                                 EDDIE’S VOICEMAIL

                        still be employed when I get 
                        there... Eddie, I don’t understand 
                        what would possess you to humiliate 
                        me, but I can assure you, even 
                        though my med school loans might 
                        not afford me the best and most 
                        expensive lawyer in Miami, I will 
                        be getting a reasonably priced and 
                        VERY mean one, and she or he, 
                        though it’ll likely be a she as I 
                        currently have severe male trust 
                        issues, will ruin you--

                        I’m sorry, but the mailbox 
                        belonging to: Eddie Charrow is 
                        full. Please hang up and try again.

           Anna STRIKES THE STEERING WHEEL as she flies into her 
           company’s parking structure. 

                                 ANNA
                        NO YOU HANG UP AND TRY AGAIN!

           INT. SOUTH BEACH MEDICAL GROUP - PARKING GARAGE - MOMENTS 
           LATER

           Anna flies from her car and slips into the very CROWDED 
           ELEVATOR. 

           She presses her floor and shields her face. 

           Anna’s phone BUZZES - She reaches for it, hoping it’s Eddie, 
           but it’s an e-mail with a link to the video. 

           Anna, is this you? Love, Mom. 

           Anna throbs with fury. 
           INT. SOUTH BEACH MEDICAL GROUP - WAITING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           South Beach Medical Group is an esteemed, architecturally 
           stunning, private practice with an insane ocean view.

           The elevator doors open and Anna flies past DANI, 22, the hot 
           receptionist, who gleefully watches THE VIDEO ON HER 
           COMPUTER.  

           Anna halts.

                                 ANNA
                        Working woman to working woman--
                        we’re supposed to support each 
                        other.

           Anna restarts the receptionist’s computer and runs - 

           BODY CHECKING, EVAN, 29, the snickering male nurse who 
           carries a tray of urine samples--the cylindrical piss 
           containers go flying.

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                             (fuck you)
                        My bad.

           Anna runs into her boss’ office.

           INT. SOUTH BEACH MEDICAL GROUP - DOCTOR GRAHAME’S OFFICE - 
           SECONDS LATER

           Anna SLAMS THE DOOR BEHIND HER and faces renowned urologist, 
           DOCTOR JASON GRAHAME, 60. Anatomical models and specimens of 
           the male reproductive systems adorn his fancy office.

                                 ANNA
                        Doctor Grahame, there’s something I 
                        have to tell--

           Grahame quickly closes the window on his computer that PLAYS 
           HER VIDEO.

           Anna SIGHS.

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        So, you’ve seen it... Well, please 
                        allow me to explain. As you can 
                        imagine I am beyond mortified--

                                 GRAHAME
                        Anna, have a seat.

           Anna sits, terrified. 
                                 ANNA
                        Before you do anything drastic, you 
                        should know that I would never 
                        knowingly compromise myself or this 
                        practice. 
                             (beat)
                        I had no idea I was being recorded.

           Beat.

                                 GRAHAME
                        I have to let you go. 

                                 ANNA
                        But...But I’m the victim in the 
                        situation! 
                             (beat)
                        How is that not painfully obvious?

           Grahame SIGHS and wheels his chair over to his computer.

                                 GRAHAME
                        Anna, would you trust this woman to 
                        remove one of your testicles?

           He opens the window with her video on his computer.

                                 ANNA
                        Please don’t play it.

           Grahame, meaning to close the window, starts the video again.

                                 GRAHAME
                             (while trying turn it off)
                        Look, I don’t know what happened. 
                        And I’m relieved you’re okay, but I 
                        can’t have my patients thinking 
                        their surgeon’s a sexual deviant.
                             (beat)
                        I’m sorry. 

           Anna’s head spins. 

           After a long moment she stands up, takes a DEEP BREATH, and 
           with as much dignity as she can muster - 

                                 ANNA
                        You should be. I’m a great 
                        urologist and this is BULLSHIT!

                                 MANAGER (PRE-LAP)
                             (power trip)
                        What brings you to Burrito Heaven?
           INT. BURRITO HEAVEN - FAST FOOD PLACE - SAME

           Angel sits in the back-office with the MANAGER, 19, bad acne. 

                                 ANGEL
                        There’s this thing called rent. You 
                        might’ve heard of it...Once a month 
                        you have to pay it...?

                                 MANAGER
                             (disappointed)
                        So, you don’t have a passion for 
                        burrito making?

                                 ANGEL
                             (sarcastic)
                        Yeah, it’s been my life’s ambition 
                        since I was six.

           The manager, offended, rips up her application.

           INT. SOUTH BEACH MEDICAL GROUP - ANNA’S OFFICE - DAY

           Anna, mid-breakdown, violently throws her life’s work into a 
           single box.

           She picks up a framed picture of her father, SIMON ROCKPORT, 
           40s, from her desk and stares at it. 

           CLOSE ON: THE ENGRAVED FRAME - SIMON ROCKPORT 1955 - 1981.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY - 1981

           Anna, 12, a curious tomboy, sits at the feet of her exhausted 
           (post-surgery) father Simon Rockport, 40s, in his hospital 
           bed. A beautiful urologist, DR. JANE HSU, 40, reviews his 
           chart.

                                 ANNA
                        Daddy, what’s a prostrate?

           Silence. Dr. Hsu smiles at Anna’s faux pas.

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        Do I have one?
                        (beat)
                        Will I ever have one?

                                 SIMON
                        No, and you don’t want one.
           Anna’s tiny eyes widen--she looks like a giant beanie baby. 
           Dad gives Dr. Hsu a look. Dr. Hsu kneels next to Anna.

                                 DR. HSU
                        A prostate is a walnut-sized gland
                        located between the bladder and the 
                        penis.

                                 ANNA
                             (scandalized)
                        You said penis!

           Simon LAUGHS at his darling daughter as Anna’s tired MOM, 36, 
           enters with flowers.

                                 MOM
                             (to Dr. Hsu)
                        How’s he doing?

           Beat. 

                                 DR. HSU
                        The radical prostatectomy was
                        successful, but his bone scan 
                        indicates the “c-word” has spread.

           Mom bites her lip. Anna snuggles up next to Dad.

                                 ANNA
                        What’s the “c-word?”

           Simon’s eyes tear up.

           BACK TO PRESENT - 

           Anna’s eyes tear up as she furiously grabs her phone and 
           calls Eddie--Voicemail AGAIN.

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        Hi Eddie, it’s Anna again... So, I 
                        got fired and I’m calling because 
                        I’m wondering if you have any idea 
                        what it takes to become a 
                        urologist?... 
                             (beat)
                        FOUR YEARS of college, FOUR YEARS 
                        of med school, and FIVE YEARS of 
                        residency, whooooo, bye bye 
                        twenties... the point is, Eddie, I 
                        can’t get a new job as long as that 
                        video’s online, if ever, so, before 
                        your phone hangs up on me again, I 
                        want you to know, I HAVE A TEN 
                        BLADE AND I KNOW WHERE YOU LIVE! 
           She hangs up and HURLS A STATUE OF THE MALE REPRODUCTIVE 
           SYSTEM AT THE WALL--parts everywhere--and BURSTS INTO TEARS.

           INT. KID ZONE - LOW RENT DAY CARE CENTER - SAME

           Angel sits on the floor next to MANDY, a 24, mousey senior 
           employee who supervises color time--KIDS EVERYWHERE!

                                 MANDY
                        Do you have any experience working 
                        with children?

           A rambunctious BOY punches Angel in the leg. She resists the 
           urge to hit him back. 

                                 ANGEL
                        Not technically, but I raised 
                        myself and I’m a fast learner.

                        Nobody’ll diddle them on my watch. 

           Mandy looks very uncomfortable.

           EXT. GUN STORE - EARLY AFTERNOON

           Anna, totally out of her element, checks out all sorts of 
           dangerous firearms with a crazy look in her eye. 

           The southern GUN GUY, 45, approaches excitedly. 

                                 GUN GUY
                        Excuse me, ma’am, are you “the dick 
                        doctor?!”

                                 ANNA
                             (hisses)
                        WHAT’S IT TO YOU?!

                                 GUN GUY
                        ...I don’t think I should sell you 
                        a firearm today, but this here’s 
                        our basic starter rifle--

                                 ANNA
                        I want something I can put in my 
                        purse. 

                                 GUN GUY
                        You got a concealed weapon permit?

           Anna grabs a sleek handgun and starts waving it around.
                                 ANNA
                        What if I don’t conceal it?

           The gun guy grabs it back.

                                 GUN GUY
                        There’s a mandatory, three-day 
                        waiting period for all handgun 
                        purchases in the state of Florida.

           Anna bares her teeth like a dog and GROWLS. 

                                 GUN GUY (CONT’D)
                        Please stop growing at me, ma’am.

           INT. DEPRESSING TELEMARKETING CENTER - SAME

           Mark, 25, his tank top reads, The Boss, gives Angel the tour 
           of his operation. 

                                 MARK
                        Did yah bring a resume?

                             (realizes he’s serious)
                        I mean, I could write one, but it’d 
                        just be lies, so, how ‘bout we 
                        discuss my fuckin’ work ethic and 
                        my goddamn skill set?

           Mark frowns condescendingly. 

           EXT. LINCOLN ROAD MALL - ICE-CREAM SHOP - AFTERNOON

           Anna, humiliated and on the phone with mom, walks through the 
           outdoor mall devouring a chocolate banana. 

           People immediately recognize her. 

                                 ANNA
                        No, mom, I don’t wanna talk about 
                        it... Yes, I’m sure I wasn’t trying 
                        to get famous... No, please don’t 
                        tell grandpa!...

                        have intercourse mother!--No, he’s 
                        not my boyfriend...What do you 
                        mean, “Why not”?! 
           INT. FRATTY DIVE BAR - EARLY EVENING

           Angel trails a beachy BARTENDER, 30, as he preps for his 
           shift.

                                 ANGEL
                        Lookit, Helen Keller could pour a 
                        shot, but, me, I get people. 

                                 BARTENDER
                        That’s cool, but I’m gonna hire 
                        someone who’s actually worked at a 
                        bar--doesn’t make me a bad guy.

                                 ANGEL
                        I’ve worked at the bar called life. 
                             (off his non-response)
                        C’mon, please. I’m kinda desperate. 

           The bartender pours her a shot of tequila. 

                                 BARTENDER
                        Wish there was something I could 
                        do. 

           Angel throws back the shot and checks her bank balance on her 
           phone...thirteen dollars. 

           Angel SIGHS and munches on handful of free nuts. 

           Anna walks inside carrying her boxed up office and Angel 
           pounces. 

                                 ANGEL
                        You look familiar...

                                 ANNA
                             (to the bartender)
                        I’ll have one of those tall blue 
                        drinks that tastes like electro-
                        shock therapy. 

                                 BARTENDER
                        Adios motherfucker?

                                 ANNA
                        Yeah, sure. Maybe make it two.

           Angel wiggles very close to Anna. 

                                 ANGEL
                        Don’t wanna drink alone, huh?
                                 ANNA
                             (uncomfortable)
                        Actually, I intend to get 
                        inappropriately inebriated--alone. 

           Angel scoots even closer. 

                                 ANGEL
                        You sure we haven’t met? 

                                 ANNA
                        I don’t mean to be rude, but, I 
                        don’t want to talk to you.

                                 ANGEL
                        Sorry. Jeez. We’re both in a bar 
                        during daylight hours--figured we 
                        could both use a friend...

           The bartender hands Anna two electric blue beverages. 

           Anna, guilty, pushes one over to Angel. 

                                 ANNA
                        I’m sorry. I’ve had a terrible day.

           Angel drains the drink. 

                                 ANGEL
                        I don’t get why women hate each 
                        other so much, you know?

                                 ANNA
                        I think that all the time!--It’s 
                        part of the reason I mostly work 
                        with men.

                                 ANGEL
                        Me too, but I’m turning over a new 
                        leaf.

           Anna smiles.

                                                                CUT TO:

           MANY BLUE DRINKS LATER - 

                                 ANGEL
                        HOLY SHIT! You’re an actual doctor--

                                 ANNA
                        --Surgeon--
                                 ANGEL
                        --With a medical degree?!--

                                 ANNA
                        --Multiple degrees. 

                                 ANGEL
                        --And they just kicked you to the 
                        curb like a--

                                 ANNA
                        I got publicaly slut-shamed and... 
                             (embarrassed)
                        You don’t even wanna know how long 
                        it’s been... 

           Angel rubs Anna’s shoulders.

                                 ANGEL
                        How long? 

           Anna blushes.

                                 ANNA
                        Two years, three months, and a 
                        fortnight.
                             (off Angel’s blanket-of- 
                              safety face)
                        So, um, I never do this, which 
                        might be why I don’t have many--any-
                        -girlfriends, but, do you, maybe, 
                        wanna come over and watch a movie? 
                        I’m too drunk to find a lawyer and 
                        I don’t feel like being alone.

           Angel smiles. 

                                 ANGEL
                        Anything but Pretty Woman.

           INT. ANNA’S CONDO - EVENING

           Anna and Angel burst inside like tipsy besties. 

           Anna signs onto Netflix as Angel marvels at the space.

                                 ANNA
                        I don’t know about you, but I’m in 
                        the mood for a compelling female 
                        protagonist and a bottle of Rosé.
                        What do you like better? Hard Candy 
                        or The Accused?
           Angel scoots closer to Anna.

                                 ANGEL
                        Your place. Your pick. 

                                 ANNA
                        Ooh! What about Thelma and Louise?!

           Angel unzips Anna’s skirt and buries her head between her 
           legs. 

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing?!

                                 ANGEL
                        Don’t sweat it. We all get ingrowns 
                        now and then. 

           Angel yanks Anna’s head up. 

                                 ANNA
                        Wait! I don’t--I’m not a--

                                 ANGEL
                             (sarcastic)
                        Yeah...Neither is Rachel Maddow. 

                                 ANNA
                        I LOVE Rachel Maddow!

           Angel goes to slip a finger inside Anna. 

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        Not like that!

           Anna leaps from the couch and pulls up her skirt. 

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        NOT like that. 

           Angel shrugs. 

                                 ANGEL
                        You owe me five-hundred. 

                                 ANNA
                        Wait, you’re a...prostitute?! Like 
                        a REAL one?!

                                 ANGEL
                        I’m retired now, but--
                                 ANNA
                        I thought you wanted to be my 
                        friend!

           Angel LAUGHS. 

                                 ANGEL
                        Why the fuck would I wanna be your 
                        friend?!

           Anna’s crestfallen.

                                 ANNA
                        Get out. 

                                 ANGEL
                        Not ‘til I get my money. 

                                 ANNA
                        This is ridiculous!

                                 ANGEL
                        No, what’s ridiculous is you doing 
                        butt-fuckin’ nothing to the guy who 
                        wrecked your life! It’s like 
                        someone just walks up to you, blows 
                        his load on your face, and you just 
                        sit there and let it dry! WHO DOES 
                        THAT?!

           Anna gags, repulsed.

                                 ANNA
                        For your information I was going to 
                        go to the police tomorrow. Today 
                        was obviously an emotionally 
                        incapacitating day! 
                             (whispers)
                        I tried to buy a gun!

           Angel LAUGHS. 

                                 ANGEL
                        The police?! Yeah, you can count 
                        the number of fucks the police 
                        don’t give about girls like us on 
                        no hands.

                                 ANNA 
                        Girls like us? Oh, no. We are not 
                        in the same category. 
                                 ANGEL
                        You’re right. I shouldn’t lower 
                        myself to the level of: On all 
                        fours on YouTube...

           Anna LUNGES AT ANGEL, but Angel effortlessly puts Anna in a 
           headlock. 

           Anna SQUEALS and squirms. 

                                 ANGEL (CONT’D)
                        Look, I had a nice time tonight, 
                        so, I’m gonna give you something 
                        better than sex for your money.  

                                 ANNA
                             (sneers)
                        Like what?

           Angel lets Anna go.

                                 ANGEL
                        Revenge against the twerp that got 
                        you fired. 

           Anna rolls her eyes.

                                 ANNA
                        I already called said twerp and 
                        left two strongly worded 
                        voicemails. 

                                 ANGEL
                        Who is this dilwad anyway?

                                 ANNA
                             (gags)
                        He who shall not be named is “Eddie 
                        Charrow.”

                                 ANGEL
                        No way! Eddie Charrow?! 
                             (eyes narrow)
                        I fuckin’ HATE that guy! 

                                 ANNA
                        ...How do you know him... Wait, did 
                        you and Eddie...?--Thank God I 
                        didn’t--
                             (off Angel’s look)
                        I mean, what makes you think he’d 
                        listen to you?

           Angel pulls a switch blade from her bra and winks.
                                 ANGEL
                        I’m a people person. 

           INT./EXT. ANNA’S PRIUS - EDDIE’S NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT

           Anna, driving, wears a black, Lululemon breaking-and-entering  
           ensemble with matching beanie. 

           Angel, in the passenger seat, SMACKS GUM, pumped up. 

           Anna clips a pepper spray necklace around her neck. 

                                 ANNA
                        I have an extra pepper spray 
                        necklace in the glove compartment 
                        if you’d like to borrow it. 

                                 ANGEL
                             (snorts)
                        Oh boy! You got an extra pair of 
                        bougie twat pants too?!

           Anna grimaces, yanks away her camel toe (for now), and turns 
           onto Eddie’s street. 

           Anna drives up the street and parks in front of Eddie’s 
           house, kills the lights, and pouts, offended.

           Angel pulls her switch blade.

                                 ANGEL (CONT’D)
                        We gonna do this or not? 

           EXT. EDDIE’S MANSION - BACKYARD - POOL AREA - SECONDS LATER

           Anna, cradling her pepper spray, and Angel, switch blade 
           drawn, stand in front of a locked sliding glass door. 

                                 ANNA
                             (whispers)
                        Now what?

           Angel, having done this before, uses her knife to pick the 
           lock. She’s almost got it when the door handle FALLS OFF.

           Anna dramatically ducks and covers, expecting the door to 
           shatter.

           Angel shakes her head and slides the broken door open.
           INT. EDDIE’S MANSION - KITCHEN - SECONDS LATER

           Anna and Angel enter the immaculate chef’s kitchen.  

                                 ANNA
                             (loud whisper)
                        I haven’t been this nervous since I 
                        took the Hippocratic Oath!

                                 ANGEL
                        Sssshhh!

           Anna mimes: Zipping her lips and throwing away the key when 
           she accidently backs into the hanging pot-rack--CLANG. 

           Angel glares at Anna. 

           Anna winces: Sorry. 

           Anna’s phone BUZZES - CLOSE ON: PHONE SCREEN - Text from Mom - 
           Grandpa saw the video. 

           Anna turns purple and shows the screen to Angel, who LAUGHS. 

           Anna covers her mouth and the girls silently compose 
           themselves, when, from upstairs - 

                                 EDDIE (O.S.)
                        You’ll get your passports and 
                        phones back when you’ve completed 
                        training. We need to hang onto them 
                        in order to process your work 
                        visas. Any questions?  
                             (off silence)
                        Now, in the modeling world 
                        connections are key. 

           Anna and Angel climb the staircase following his voice.

                                 EDDIE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        You’re all gorgeous girls, but this 
                        is Miami--even the smart girls are 
                        gorgeous. 

           Anna and Angel exchange a confused glance as they approach 
           Eddie’s living room to find - 

           Eddie, standing with his back to Anna and Angel, seemingly 
           talking to Irina, the Ukrainian knockout from earlier, who 
           stands in front of him.
                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        I have connections. All I need to 
                        know is how badly each of you want 
                        your face on the cover of Vogue.

           Anna’s eyes bug out and she starts into the room but Angel 
           stops her. 

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        Irina, show everyone how much you 
                        want it. Show everyone you’ve got 
                        what it takes.  

           Eddie UNZIPS HIS PANTS. 

           Irina stares at Eddie realizing her journey has been for 
           naught - 

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        This will be required from all of 
                        you. So, watch and learn.

           Irina kneels down, takes Eddie in her hands, stares 
           wrathfully into his eyes, and opens her mouth as - 

           Angel mimes the count: One, two, three--

           ANNA AND ANGEL BURST INSIDE, WHAT HAPPENS NEXT IS A SERIES OF 
           LIGHTNING FAST CUTS - 

           Angel puts her blade to Eddie’s throat as Anna trips over her 
           own two feet and falls flat on her face--THUD. 

           Irina, startled, clamps her jaws shut.

                                 ANGEL
                        Surprise, motherfucker!

                                 ANNA
                             (getting up)
                        And not the good kind.

           EDDIE SHRIEKS - 

           IRINA BOLTS UP AND STAGGERS BACKWARDS IN TERROR, HER HAND 
           COVERING HER MOUTH - 

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                             (to Eddie)
                        We’re here to discuss your taking 
                        down my video--!
           ANNA STOPS ABRUPTLY WHEN SURPRISE SHE SEES THE GROUP OF NOW 
           TERRIFIED GIRLS THAT WERE PICKED UP FROM THE AIRPORT AND RAY 
           STANDING GUARD OVER THEM - 

                                 ANGEL
                        What the fuck?

           THE ASPIRING “MODELS” STARE AT ANNA AND ANGEL.

           RAY STARES AT ANGEL FOR A SECOND AND QUICKLY DRAWS HIS GUN - 

           IRINA STARTS CHOKING - 

           EDDIE ROARS, AND REELING IN PAIN CLUTCHES HIS CROTCH AND 
           COLLAPSES - 

                                 ANGEL (CONT’D)
                             (re: Irina)
                        What’s wrong with that bitch?

                                 ANNA
                             (realizes)
                        She’s choking!

           Everyone is frozen, staring in horror as Anna performs the 
           Heimlich on Irina who GAGS AND COUGHS AND - 

           SPITS OUT AN OBJECT THAT FLIES THROUGH THE AIR -

           CLOSE ON: ANGEL CATCHING EDDIE’S SEVERED PENIS WITH ONE HAND.

                                 ANGEL
                        SHE BIT HIS DICK OFF!!

                                 ANNA
                        SHE BIT HIS DICK OFF??!

                                 EDDIE
                        SHE BIT MY DICK OFF!!!

                                 RAY
                        Oh, shit!!!

           EVERYONE SCREAMS - 

           IRINA GASPS FOR AIR - 

                                 ANNA
                        OHMYGOD!

                                 RAY
                        OH, SHIT!!!
           Irina wipes the blood from her mouth as Eddie GROANS and  
           forces himself up. 

                                 EDDIE
                             (to Irina)
                        YOU’RE DEAD. 
                             (beat)
                        YOU’RE ALL FUCKING DEAD.

                                 ANGEL
                        RUN!

           TOTAL CHAOS AS - 

           Irina, terrified, RUNS SCREAMING OUT OF THE ROOM followed by 
           Anna and Angel. 

           RAY CORRALS THE GIRLS, STOPPING THEM FROM FOLLOWING.

                                 EDDIE
                             (to Ray)
                        DON’T LET MY DICK LEAVE THE 
                        PREMISES!

           EXT. EDDIE’S MANSION - MOMENTS LATER

           Irina flees darting up the street and disappearing around the 
           corner. 

           Angel drags Anna to the Prius. 

                                 ANGEL
                        This is where we get the fuck outta 
                        here and you give me my money! 

                                 ANNA
                        Angel, do you not realize what’s 
                        happening?! Eddie’s a sex 
                        trafficker! We have to get the 
                        girls and go to the police! 

                                 ANGEL
                        Listen up white Oprah, this ain’t 
                        fun and games no more. You have no 
                        idea what you’re dealin’ with. 

                                 ANNA
                        You knew??!

                                 ANGEL
                        No!!
                             (off Anna’s look)
                        I knew he was an asshole. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ANGEL (CONT'D)
                        I didn’t know how BIG an asshole--
                        Jesus Christ we gotta go!

                                 ANNA
                        What about all those girls? 

                                 ANGEL
                        What do you care about some girls 
                        you don’t even know?

                                 ANNA
                        Every one of those girls is 
                        somebody’s daughter. 

           Thinking of her own, Angel looks as if she were punched in 
           the stomach.

                                 ANGEL
                        Lookit, I’d love nothin’ more than 
                        to destroy a man who preys on girls 
                        who ain’t got options, but we ain’t 
                        got the resources to do nothin’ 
                        like that!

           Anna takes Angel’s hand. Angel bristles but stays with Anna. 

                                 ANNA
                        I’m going to go ahead and venture 
                        you’ve had a hard life. 
                             (off Angel’s eye roll)
                        But, even if it’s broken, you do 
                        have a heart and an opportunity to 
                        make a difference.

           Angel stares at Anna, inspired but afraid of disappointment.

                                 ANGEL
                        So, what’s your plan? You wanna 
                        make a citizen’s arrest? Hold his 
                        dick hostage until he turns himself 
                        in? Ain’t gonna happen!

                                 ANNA
                        Do you think I’m an idiot? We’re 
                        going straight to the police. 
                             (beat)
                        Do you have the penis?

           Angel gingerly takes Eddie’s penis from her bra and stares at 
           it, mad at the world.
                                 ANGEL
                             (gesticulates with the 
                              penis as she speaks)
                        The police will tell you to go fuck 
                        yourself. And I’m not settin’ foot 
                        in there--they’ll arrest me for 
                        breathin’. 

                                 ANNA
                        You can wait in the car. Now, stop 
                        waving it around, you’ll damage the 
                        tissue and I won’t be able to 
                        reattach it. 

           Angel stares at the penis. She stares at Anna. Reattach it?! 

           INT. EDDIE’S MANSION - BEDROOM - SAME

           Ray squeamishly applies a pillowcase tourniquet to what’s 
           left of Eddie’s dick and looks for a place to wipe his hands.

                                 RAY
                        The girls are in the garage. Eddie, 
                        you need a doctor. 

                                 EDDIE
                        That bitch IS a doctor. Now get her 
                        back here and make her fix me!

                                 RAY
                        She’s not gonna want to help you 
                        considering what she saw.

                                 EDDIE
                        Kill her friend in front of her if 
                        she needs convincing! And bring 
                        Irina back here so I can kill her 
                        myself. 

                                 RAY
                             (ambivalent)
                        But, boss--

                                 EDDIE
                        Just call your brother, you fucking 
                        pussy.

                                 RAY
                        My brother?
                                 EDDIE
                        Yeah, you know, the guy who looks 
                        like you, but isn’t a total 
                        disappointment?!

           Ray stares at the floor shamefully.

           INT. MIAMI BEACH POLICE DEPARTMENT - WASHINGTON AVE - MORNING

           Anna marches up to two cops, TY JORDAN, 26, a sweet-faced 
           African American rookie, and CAL WHEATON, 33, his crooked 
           senior partner.

           Cal, in hysterics, plays Anna’s video on his computer for Ty.

                                 ANNA
                        Excuse me, um, Sirs. 

           They don’t look up. 

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                             (pissed)
                        I said, EXCUSE ME!

           Ty looks up, sees Anna, blushes, and immediately shuts off 
           the monitor and awkwardly tries to hide his GIANT BONER.

           Anna furiously tries not to stare at it.

                                 CAL
                        Well, I’ll be damned! 
                             (looks Anna up and down)
                        How ‘bout an encore of Care Bears 
                        Care for the boys in blue?

           Anna’s jaw drops.

                                 TY
                             (nervous)
                        He didn’t mean that. 

                                 ANNA
                        I’d like to report a mister EDDIE 
                        CHARROW, the man who degraded me, 
                        which you’re clearly familiar with. 
                             (off their blank stares)
                        Right, so, first I’d like to report 
                        him for that, and secondly, and 
                        this is even more nefarious, if you 
                        can believe it, I’d like to report 
                        him for...
                             (expecting a big reaction)
                        Sex trafficking!
           Cal’s stone-faced. 

           Ty’s eyes widen but he immediately apes Cal.

                                 CAL
                        Look, you’re not the first gal in 
                        Miami to get drunk and make a bad 
                        decision.

                                 ANNA
                        Are you implying I deserved this 
                        cause I was drunk? The video wasn’t 
                        my decision--that’s the point!

           Ty’s visibly concerned.

                                 CAL
                        Do you have any proof?

                                 ANNA
                        Well, not on me, no, but if you go 
                        to his house--

                                 CAL
                        I don’t have time for this. Ty, 
                        escort the dick doctor outta here. 

           Ty attempts to shuffle Anna towards the door but she won’t 
           budge.

                                 ANNA
                        This is ridiculous! There’s a REAL 
                        CRIMINAL out there abusing women 
                        and you are THE POLICE! You have to 
                        DO SOMETHING!

           Not one head turns. 

           Ty awkwardly opens the door and ushers Anna out.

                                 TY
                             (whispers/guilty)
                        Sorry, it’s my first week on the 
                        job and you don’t have any proof...

           Anna’s faith in the world SHATTERS.

           ACROSS THE OFFICE - 

           Cal stares at Anna, slinks off, and calls Eddie - 

                                 CAL
                        Eddie, we got a problem.
           WE CUT BACK AND FORTH FROM CAL IN THE OFFICE TO EDDIE IN BED - 

                                 EDDIE 
                        I pay you to get rid of problems. 

                                 CAL
                        That’s why I’m calling.

           Eddie grits his teeth. 

                                 EDDIE
                        Cal, you shouldn’t be calling. You 
                        should be handling.
                             (off Cal’s silence)
                        WHAT’S THE PROBLEM?

                                 CAL
                             (whispers)
                        Are you responsible for the Dirty 
                        Dick Doctor video?

                                 EDDIE
                        I film everyone I hookup with, so 
                        what? Nobody sees the videos but 
                        me. The dick doctor had it coming. 
                        She puked on my--what was once my--
                        goddamnit--she pissed me off!  

           Cal sighs.

                                 CAL
                        Eddie, revenge porn’s a federal 
                        offense. Take the video down, now. 

           Cal hangs up.

           INT./EXT. WES’ TRUCK - EDDIE’S NEIGHBORHOOD - A FEW STREETS 
           OVER FROM ANNA AND ANGEL - SAME

           Ray and older brother, WES PLOVER, 38, a roided-out ex-cage 
           fighter with a coke habit, fly down the wrong side of the 
           street in Wes’ black monster truck (with devil horns and 
           license plate, BEAST) looking for Irina.  

           After a moment they spot her running through a topiary 
           garden.

                                 WES
                        That her?

                                 RAY
                        Yes!
           Wes digs into a baggie of coke with his thumb and SNORTS. 

                                 WES
                        I spotted her so I get first fuck. 

                                 RAY
                             (disgusted)
                        C’mon Wes, don’t be a dick. 

           Wes guns the engine and drives onto the sidewalk, blocking 
           Irina. 

                                 WES
                        Don’t worry little bro, you can 
                        stay in the car and finger yourself 
                        in your VAGINA while big bro takes 
                        care of business. 

           Wes leaps from the truck and captures a SCREAMING IRINA. 

                                 WES (CONT’D)
                        Don’t even think about trying to 
                        piranha my cock.

           Irina spits in his face.

           INT./EXT. WES’ TRUCK - ELSEWHERE IN EDDIE’S NEIGHBORHOOD - 
           SAME

           Wes, driving, snorts some more coke. 

           Irina’s tied up with colorful bungee cord in the back.

           Ray’s phone RINGS - Eddie calling. 

                                 RAY
                        Yeah, boss.

           QUICK CUT TO EDDIE SNARLING AND TAKING THE VIDEO DOWN - 

                                 EDDIE 
                        WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU TWO DOING?! 
                        THE GIRLS ALREADY WENT TO THE 
                        POLICE!

           Wes snatches the phone from his little brother like a six-
           year old in a sandbox.

                                 WES
                        We got the Russian bitch. We’re 
                        picking up the other two next. 
           Irina scowls as Wes makes an abrupt turn--his stupid car 
           almost tips over.

           INT./EXT. ANNA’S PRIUS - MIAMI BEACH POLICE DEPARTMENT - 
           PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

           Angel, in the reclined passenger, is on her phone pinning 
           (and quietly gushing over) fancy wedding gowns from a Style 
           Me Pretty-esque wedding blog when Anna jumps into her car, 
           incensed. 

           Angel quickly pockets her phone.

                                 ANGEL
                             (can’t help herself)
                        I’m “gonna go ‘head and venture” it 
                        didn’t go too good with the cops. 
                             (secretly disappointed)
                        Can I have my money now?

           Anna starts the car. 

                                 ANNA
                        We’re not finished yet. 

                                 ANGEL
                        Anna, it was real cute the first 
                        time, but--

                                 ANNA
                        Angel, part of getting what you 
                        want is not giving up. 

                                 ANGEL
                        You reverse psychologizin’ me so I 
                        stick around to watch you fail?

                                 ANNA
                        I don’t fail. I’m single. I have no 
                        friends. I’m a little OCD. I’m 
                        awkward and dogmatic, but I don’t 
                        fail.

                                 ANGEL
                        ...But, you can’t do this alone.

                                 ANNA
                        Correct. I’ll give you five 
                        thousand dollars for your help. 

           Angel flips the seat up. 
                                 ANGEL
                        Done, but if “reattachment” doesn’t 
                        work I’m the one who gets to flush 
                        it. 

                                 ANNA
                        Great. We’re officially in 
                        business. 

           Anna excitedly turns the car on--it BEEPS and the gas tank 
           flashes: EMPTY. 

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        Soon as we get gas.

           EXT. GAS STATION - MOMENTS LATER 

           Angel’s in the car while Anna gets gas. She locks the pump’s 
           nozzle, stands back, and waits for the tank to fill up when 
           she spots ETHAN, 34, balding but cocky, filling up his red 
           BMW 3-series at the catty-corner pump. 

           Anna cringes and quickly scuttles behind her car and ducks. 

           Ethan sees her, does a double-take, grins, and walks over.

           Anna crab-walks around the vehicle trying to hide as she 
           watches Ethan’s feet get closer and closer. 

           FROM INSIDE ANNA’S CAR - 

           Angel watches Anna, very confused. She cracks the window and 
           listens.

           Ethan walks up behind Anna - 

                                 ETHAN
                        Anna Rockport?! Is that you?

           Anna stands up, pretends at first not to recognize him, and 
           flashes a crazy fake smile - 

                                 ANNA
                        Ethan! Ohmygod! It’s great to see 
                        you! I was, uh, just checking the 
                        air levels er, air pressure or 
                        whatever on my tires.  
                             (off his suspicion)
                        How’ve you been?

                                 ETHAN
                             (smug)
                        Can’t complain. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ETHAN (CONT'D)
                        My practice has had a meteoric rise-
                        -Yelp says I’m South Beach’s eight 
                        best podiatrist. I’m super happily 
                        married, baby numero dos is on the 
                        way, and I’ve taken up snorkeling--
                        I saw a manatee this morning. 
                             (grins)
                        The universe really started saying 
                        YES after you kicked me to the 
                        curb. 

           FROM INSIDE THE CAR - 

           Angel rolls her eyes. 

           BACK TO ANNA - 

                                 ANNA
                        I see the facts have blurred a bit 
                        over the years... I didn’t dump 
                        you. I decided not to pass up an 
                        opportunity I’d worked for my 
                        entire life simply because it 
                        wasn’t offered to you. 

                                 ETHAN
                             (smacks his forehead 
                              “playfully”)
                        Ohhh that’s right. You just ditched 
                        me in residency for the elitist 
                        urology clinic. 

           Anna’s pump CLICKS -- all done. 

                                 ANNA
                        It’s been fun catching up, Ethan, 
                        but I gotta go. 

           Anna opens the driver’s side door when - 

                                 ETHAN
                        My wife and I saw your video. 

           Anna freezes as Ethan twists the knife.

                                 ETHAN (CONT’D)
                        We agreed it was a desperate, 
                        lonely cry for--

           Angel jumps out of the car, struts over to Anna, puts her arm 
           around her, and stares right at Ethan, and kisses Anna on the 
           lips--it’s hot. 
                                 ANGEL
                        Ethan, is it?

           Ethan turns into a giant, speechless boner.

                                 ANGEL (CONT’D)
                        I hope you’re not givin’ my 
                        girlfriend a hard time... I’m the 
                        one who dared her to make the 
                        video. It was a joke, Ethan. Kinda 
                        hilarious it got so much attention 
                        considerin’ all the much more 
                        important stuff the world should be 
                        focused on right now. The economy, 
                        race relations, gender equality...
                             (flirty, to Anna)
                        I’m real sorry I got you in hot 
                        water, babe. But, we had a lotta 
                        fun that night, didn’t we?

                                 ANNA
                        Yeah, babe... So much fun...

                                 ANGEL
                        Now, if you don’t mind, Ethan, 
                        we’re gonna be up real late 
                        tonight, so we’re gotta split. 

           Anna jumps in the car. 

                                 ANNA
                        Bye, Ethan. Say hi to the manatees 
                        for me.

           The girls close the car doors and Anna turns to Angel - 

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        That’s the coolest thing anyone’s 
                        ever done for me. 

           Angel beams purposefully. 

           INT. 24 HOUR CHAIN PHARMACY NEXT TO POLICE STATION - LATER

           Empowered Anna tosses Purell, small plastic bags, cold water, 
           ice, and a sterile, preservative-free saline solution into 
           the cart a newly invigorated Angel pushes. 

                                 ANGEL
                        Alright, doc! What’s the time 
                        window we’re lookin’ at to sew the 
                        little guy back on? Couple hours? 
                                 ANNA
                        Actually...The types of tissues in 
                        the penis make it more durable than 
                        you’re average severed appendage.

           Anna calls Eddie.

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        Eddie, it’s the dick doctor.

           WE CUT BACK AND FORTH from the girls to Eddie in his fancy 
           bloody bedding with a crystal candy bowl full of Vicodin.

                                 EDDIE
                        YOU FUCKING CUNT--

                                 ANNA
                             (supercilious)
                        Eddie, it’s very important that you 
                        stay calm right now.

           Anna grabs a small hot pink cooler and some sealed washcloths 
           and puts them in the cart. 

                                 EDDIE
                        I don’t think you realize who 
                        you’re fucking with.

                                 ANNA
                        The thing is...we do. That’s why 
                        you’re not getting your dick back 
                        unless you confess and turn 
                        yourself in.

                                 EDDIE
                        I took the video down! That’s what 
                        you wanted, right?

                                 ANNA
                        It was... but, unfortunately, the 
                        damage to my livelihood has been 
                        done. This is bigger than me now.

                                 ANGEL
                        And me!

           Angel holds her fist out for the bump.

           Anna jerks backward, but realizes it was a high-five.

                                 EDDIE
                        You’re both dead. 

           Eddie hangs up. 
                                 ANNA
                        Hello? Eddie?
                             (beat)
                        He hung up on me! 

                                 ANGEL
                        Call back. Men really hate that.

           Anna smiles and tries him again.

                                 EDDIE
                        WHAT?!

                                 ANNA
                        I wasn’t finished.... The situation 
                        is: We’re gonna put your penis on 
                        ice while you think about your 
                        options. You have eighteen hours, 
                        give or take, to make a decision. 

                                 ANGEL
                             (yells into the phone)
                        The good news is, you’ve still got 
                        your balls.

           Anna grins and stays on the line. 

                                 ANGEL (CONT’D)
                        Anna, hang up.

           Anna hangs up. 

                                 ANNA
                        I LOVE being in control!

           Angel gives Anna a perturbed look when - BANG BANG BANG.

           SCREAMS ARE HEARD THROUGHOUT THE STORE as bullets fly past 
           the girls’ head.

                           ANNA
                                                          ANGEL
           AHHHHH!
                                                (unflappable)
                                              Shit.

           Wes, with a compensation handgun, and Ray, charge up the 
           aisle towards the girls. 

           Anna looks around frantically.

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        Angel, there’s nowhere to hide!
           CLOSE ON: WES’ COKE-FUELED FACE - SWEAT DRIPS AND TEETH GNASH 
           AS HE RUNS, SHOOTING AT ANGEL AND MISSING EVERY SHOT.

           The girls duck behind the cart.

                                 ANGEL
                        The fuck is my ex doing here?

                                 ANNA
                        You let that inside of you for 
                        free?

                                 ANGEL
                        Never lasted very long.

           Wes reaches Angel and points the gun at her head.

                                 WES
                        Miss me? 

                                 ANGEL
                             (snarky/romantic)
                        ‘Course baby. Every time a client 
                        got hard. What are you doing here?!

                                 WES
                             (proud)
                        We work for Eddie now.

                                 ANGEL
                        Turds of a feather...

           Angel quickly rolls the cart over Wes’ feet, grabs a beach 
           umbrella and stabs him in the throat.

           Ray laughs and gets distracted staring at Angel while Wes 
           grabs his throat, dropping his gun.

           Anna races for it. 

                                 WES
                             (fucked up, throaty voice)
                        Ray! The gun!

           Ray rips his eyes off of Angel and runs for the gun, but Anna 
           gets there first.

           Anna picks up the gun, but hyperventilates and the gun FIRES, 
           hitting nobody. 

                                 ANNA
                             (covering her head)
                        I’M SO SORRY! I DON’T WANT TO HURT 
                        ANYONE!
           Angel grabs the gun.

                                 ANGEL
                        I do.

           Angel SHOOTS AFTER WES but misses and the boys run to the 
           next aisle.

                                 ANNA
                        Now what?!

                                 ANGEL
                             (to Anna, re: the cart)
                        Get in. 

           Anna leaps in the cart and Angel, with a running start, hops 
           on the back of the cart.  

           The girls, like Thelma and Louise, careen down the aisle and  
           through the electric doors which fly open just in time. 

           The girls disappear into the white Miami sun. 

           INT./EXT. WES’ TRUCK - 24 HOUR CHAIN PHARMACY - PARKING LOT - 
           SECONDS LATER 

           Irina, having wrestled out of the bungee cord, notices the 
           keys are in the ignition. 

                                 IRINA
                             (in Ukrainian)
                        Stupid cunts.

           She climbs into the driver’s seat, starts the car, backs up, 
           and HITS THE GAS, WHEN - 

           Angel and Anna, in the cart, ROLL IN FRONT OF THE TRUCK!

           Anna buries her face in her hands.

                                 ANNA
                        NOOOOOOOOO!

                                 ANGEL
                        It’s the girl!

           Irina SLAMS ON THE BREAKS--SCREECH.

           The truck, ever so slightly, TAPS THE CART KNOCKING IT OVER--
           the girls hit the pavement.

                                 ANNA
                        Owwww!
           Irina puts the truck in reverse when Angel jump/climbs onto 
           the hood and points the gun through the windshield in Irina’s 
           face. 

           Irina reluctantly puts her hands up as Wes and Ray come 
           charging out of the pharmacy. 

           Ray sucks on his inhaler as Anna shoves the supplies in the 
           cooler, runs, and flies through the air towards the passenger 
           seat, but Wes rips her off of the vehicle. 

                                 WES
                        Hands off my baby!

           Angel jumps off the hood and pistol whips Wes in the temple. 

                                 ANGEL
                        Hands off my paycheck! 

           Wes drops and Anna scurries out of his grasp.

           Ray, wheezing, walks briskly to Wes--his eyes are closed.

           Angel pulls Anna inside the truck and points the gun at 
           Irina.

                                 ANGEL (CONT’D)
                        Drive. 

           OUTSIDE THE TRUCK - 

           Wes isn’t moving. 

           Ray attempts CPR.

           After a moment Wes gags, spits, and shoves Ray off of him. 

           Wes sits up and punches Ray in the face.

                                 RAY
                        What the fuck?!

                                 WES
                        We would’ve had those bitches and 
                        the dick if you weren’t trying to 
                        tap my sloppy seconds. 

                                 RAY
                        I liked Angel first!

                                 WES
                        But you did nothing about it, cause 
                        you’re a pussy.
           Ray loses his shit and starts kicking Wes when - 

           A hot COLLEGE GIRL in last’s night little black dress, 21, 
           pulls into the parking lot in a white, VW Beetle convertible. 

           Wes shoves Ray off and steps in front of the car.

                                 WES (CONT’D)
                        Sup blondie--

                                 COLLEGE GIRL
                        Not now, I need Plan B.

           Wes throws her out of the car.

                                 WES
                        Next time use a condom.

                                 COLLEGE GIRL
                        OHMYGOD WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

           Ray jumps in the passenger seat.

                                 RAY
                        Sorry, it’s an emergency.

           Wes smacks Ray upside the head and speeds off. 

                                 COLLEGE GIRL
                        I BET YOUR MOM REGRETS NOT HAVING 
                        PLAN B EVERY TIME SHE SEES YOUR 
                        FACE! 

           INT./EXT. WES’ TRUCK - SOUTH BEACH STREETS - MOMENTS LATER

           Angel keeps the gun pointed at Irina. 

                                 ANNA
                             (to Angel)
                        Okay, where is it? 

           Angel whips it out of her bra. 

                                 ANGEL
                             (snarky)
                        Close to my heart.

           Irina sees Eddie’s member and PUKES OUT THE WINDOW. 

                                 ANGEL (CONT’D)
                        Come on, it was way worse when 
                        Eddie was attached to it.
           Anna Purells her hands.

                                 ANNA
                        Washcloth and saline solution 
                        please.

           Angel obliges. 

                                 ANGEL
                        What’s a saline solution?

                                 ANNA
                        Sodium chloride. I’m going to use 
                        it to clean it.

           Angel watches, curious, as Anna prepares the dick-preserving 
           package. 

                                 ANGEL
                        Kinda cool that you know this shit. 
                             (softens)
                        My first boyfriend, Derrick, was 
                        into science. He was always 
                        explainin’ why plants grew and why 
                        some people have blue eyes and how 
                        fish can breathe underwater and 
                        stuff like that. I got a real kick 
                        outta it.

           Anna smiles as she pours the cold water into the cooler, 
           sprinkles a couple handfuls of ice, and wraps the penis in 
           multiple plastic bags. 

                                 ANNA
                        Why’d you let him go? Sounds like a 
                        catch.

                                 ANGEL
                             (quickly)
                        Doesn’t matter. 
                             (beat)
                        Why so much plastic?

                                 ANNA
                        Direct contact with the ice could 
                        cause frostbite and damage the 
                        tissue.

           Irina PUKES AGAIN.

           Angel notices Wes and Ray behind them in the Beetle.

                                 ANGEL
                        Cher and Dionne are back.
           Irina turns too quickly onto Fifth Street--the truck dips. 

                                 ANNA
                             (slow/loud, to Irina)
                        This truck is really large so you 
                        have to make turns SLOOOOWLY or we 
                        are all going to die, okay?

                                 ANGEL
                        She’s Russian, not deaf.

           Irina glares at the word, “Russian.”

           INT./EXT. BEETLE - BEHIND THE GIRLS - SAME

           Wes tries to catch up to the girls but is appalled by the 
           Beetle’s weak(er) engine.

                                 WES
                        I am LITERALLY driving a vagina.

                                 RAY
                        Wes, when was Plan B invented?

                                 WES
                        Fuck off, Ray.

           INT./EXT. WES’ TRUCK - SOUTH BEACH - FIFTH STREET - SAME

           Anna notices the Beetle is gaining on them.

                                 ANNA
                        They’re to catch us! And then 
                        they’re going to rape us! And then 
                        they’re going to kill us! And then 
                        they’re going to rape us again! 
                             (beat)
                        Do something!

                                 ANGEL
                        I’ve got an idea! Wes loves doggie 
                        style.

           Angel STOMPS ON THE BRAKE PEDAL.

           Anna and Irina SHRIEK AS truck STOPS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE 
           STREET. 

           The Beetle skids and CRASHES INTO IT FROM BEHIND. 
           INT./EXT. BEETLE - SOUTH BEACH - FIFTH STREET - SAME

           Wes FLIES THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD. 

                                 RAY
                        Holy shit! Wes! Seatbelt!

           INT./EXT. WES’ TRUCK - SOUTH BEACH - FIFTH STREET - SAME

           The girls’ hearts pound as Ray drags Wes through the street  
           and back to the totaled Beetle nearly getting runover by 
           ONCOMING TRAFFIC. 

                                 IRINA
                        YOU BOTH ARE CRAZY!

           Anna and Angel exchange an excited glance. 

                                 ANGEL
                        The Russian speaks English!

           Irina SPITS and steps on the gas. 

                                 IRINA
                        Fuck Russia! I am from Ukraine!

                                 ANNA
                        Why didn’t you tell us you spoke 
                        English?

                                 IRINA
                        You didn’t ask. You just kidnap me 
                        and wave gun in my face like 
                        gangster. 
                             (beat)
                        Don’t know who is worse--you or 
                        them.

           Irina points to Ray pulling his brother out of the street.

                                 ANNA
                        We’re obviously the good guys. 
                             (realizes/excited)
                        Wait, you thought I was a gangster?

           POLICE SIRENS START SCREAMING. 

           Angel points to the MacArthur Causeway entrance.

                                 ANGEL
                        Turn here. We need to get our ducks 
                        in a row and I want a torta. 
                                 IRINA
                        What is torta?

           INT./EXT. BEETLE - FIFTH STREET - A BIT LATER

           Wes, bloody and enraged, pulls out his baggie of coke and 
           snorts himself back to life.

           Ray tries to start the car when his phone BUZZES - Eddie 
           calling.

                                 RAY
                             (nervous/on the last ring)
                        ...Eddie, how you feeling?

                                 EDDIE (O.S.)
                        Put Wes on.

           Ray, disappointed, hands the phone to Wes.

                                 WES
                        We’re on it.

           Ty, in a patrol car, pulls up behind the Beetle and gets out.

                                 RAY
                        Wes, hang up.

                                 WES
                             (ignores Ray)
                        Don’t worry, I want them dead as 
                        much as--

           Ty raises his eyebrows and KNOCKS on what’s left of the 
           driver side door.

                                 RAY
                             (to Ty, re: Wes)
                        He’s kidding.

                                 TY
                        License and registration.

           Ray rummages around in the glove compartment.

                                 RAY
                        It’s, uh, my girlfriend’s car...

                                 TY
                             (to Wes)
                        Sir, why are you bleeding?

           Wes gestures to Ty, I’m on the phone.
                                 TY (CONT’D)
                        This car was just reported stolen 
                        and you’ve clearly been in an 
                        altercation. 

                                 WES
                        Hang on, Eddie. 

           Wes hands the phone to Ray to hold and PUNCHES TY IN THE 
           FACE. 

                                 RAY
                        Wes, that’s a police officer!

                                 EDDIE (O.S.)
                        What’s going on?!

           Ty reaches for his gun. 

                                 TY
                             (to Wes)
                        You are under arrest!

           Wes KICKS TY IN THE NUTS and wrestles the gun from Ty, puts 
           it to his head, and takes the phone back from Ray.

                                 WES
                        Sorry ‘bout that Eddie. 

           TY FLASHES BACK TO ANNA AT THE POLICE STATION - 

                                 ANNA
                        I’d like to report a mister EDDIE 
                        CHARROW, the man who degraded me...

           BACK TO PRESENT - 

                                 TY
                        ...Eddie? Eddie Charrow?

           Ray freezes.

           Wes instantly hangs up and headbutts Ty, knocking him 
           seemingly out cold. 

                                 WES
                        He’s onto Eddie! We gotta move the 
                        other girls.

           Wes does a bump.

           Ray is staring at a BACHELORETTE PARTY OF HOT GIRLS SPILLING 
           OUT OF A PARTY BUS parked in front of a Mexican restaurant 
           across the street. 
                                 RAY
                        It’s my turn to handle something. 

           Ray grabs Ty’s gun from Wes, sucks on his inhaler, and hops 
           out of the car. 

           From the pavement Ty’s eyes open WIDE.

           INT. CUBAN RESTAURANT - LITTLE HAVANA - DAY

           Anna, Angel and Irina grub on yummy, greasy tortas. 

           *From now on the cooler, maintained by Anna, never leaves her 
           side and the gun remains in Angel’s waistband.

                                 IRINA
                        Torta rocks!

           Anna queasily sops up the grease from her sandwich with a 
           paper napkin.

                                 ANNA
                        Eat up because our next stop is the 
                        police and you’re gonna need to be 
                        energized and focused--

                             (to Irina, sensitive for 
                              once)
                        Life back home must’ve been rough 
                        if Eddie was your best option...
                             (off Irina’s trepidation)
                        I’m sayin’ I get it.

                        Opa-Locka?

                                 ANGEL
                        If the beach had an asshole that 
                        would be it.
                             (beat)
                        I got pregnant young and kept it 
                        cause I thought me and Derrick were 
                        in love, but that asshole peaced 
                        out on me, and then my junkie 
                        single mom peaced out too, if you 
                        know what I mean, so, now I’m a 
                        baby takin’ care of a baby who’s 
                        gotta earn. But honest livings for 
                        high school dropouts ain’t shit...
                                 IRINA
                        Same in Ukraine! What did you do?

                                 ANGEL
                        I got hooked up with Tommy. He sent 
                        me on “dates.” They paid okay, but 
                        I didn’t want my baby girl seein’ 
                        that and followin’ in my footsteps 
                        so I gave her to a couple who 
                        couldn’t get pregnant so she’d have 
                        a fightin’ chance. 
                             (beat)
                        One day she’s gonna meet her mama 
                        but not ‘til she can be proud of 
                        me.

           Anna’s quiet, shaken to the core.

                                 ANNA
                        You have a child?!

                                 ANGEL
                        Today’s her 8th birthday.

                                 ANNA
                        Wow.

                                 IRINA
                        Could be one of my little sisters.

           Irina stares at Anna and Angel, sizes them up, and takes a 
           folded up picture from her pocket and places it on the table. 

           CLOSE ON: THE PICTURE OF IRINA PLAYING WITH HER DARLING BUT 
           IMPOVERISHED SISTERS, SONYA, 6, and ZLATA, 8, IN UKRAINE. 

                                 IRINA (CONT’D)
                             (as she points)
                        Sonya and Zlata. They mean 
                        everything to me. This is why I 
                        come here. To make money and give 
                        them future.

                                 ANNA
                        What about your parents?

           Irina takes a sip of water.  

                                 IRINA
                        I am from Slavyansk. Eight people 
                        in two room apartment--one bed. No 
                        water. No electricity.

                                 IRINA (CONT'D)
                        Each day is hiding with sisters in 
                        bathroom waiting for explosions or 
                        carrying water home from nearby 
                        well. Most days, if lucky, we eat 
                        only borscht. This is not life... 

                                 ANGEL
                        No kiddin’. How’d you get out?

                                 IRINA
                        When possible I go to internet cafe 
                        in Kiev for escape--this is how I 
                        meet Eddie. He send me facebook 
                        message saying he make me model. I 
                        am not stupid only desperate. I 
                        know coming here is risk, but with 
                        risk comes hope.  

           Anna bursts into tears of guilt.

                                 ANNA
                        I...I have no words--only--

           Anna gets out her phone and plays her video for Irina. 

                                 IRINA
                        You go off medication?

           Beat.

                                 ANNA
                             (stammers)
                        Each of us, from our respective 
                        backgrounds, has been uniquely 
                        wronged by Eddie Charrow. It is our 
                        duty to prevent him from further 
                        abusing underserved women, or, 
                        perhaps, a woman who’s spent her 
                        entire life alone, studying, or 
                        coming out of surgery hoping to 
                        meet someone, who, gets stood up 
                        one time too many and takes a risk 
                        for the first time in her otherwise 
                        completely controlled life...

                                 ANGEL
                        Eddie must’ve really charmed you...

           Anna nods, ashamed. 

           Irina carefully folds the picture of her sisters and puts it 
           back in her pocket. 
                                 ANNA
                        Irina, we might have Eddie’s penis 
                        in a cooler, and I’m not sure what 
                        this says about the world, but we 
                        really are the good guys and we 
                        need your help.

           Beat. 

                                 IRINA
                        How I can help?

                                 ANGEL
                        Tell your story.

                                 ANNA
                        They will try their best to 
                        humiliate and discredit you, but 
                        you’ll just have to stay strong 
                        because they can’t ignore hard 
                        evidence.

           After a moment -

                                 IRINA
                        ...Okay, I do it.

           Anna and Angel SQUEAL. 

                                 IRINA (CONT’D)
                        But, I first use bathroom.

           Angel’s unsure.

                                 ANNA
                        Absolutely! Treat yourself to the 
                        best thing America has to offer: 
                        toilet seat covers.

           Irina looks puzzled, then gets up. 

                                 ANGEL
                        Really, one-percent?

                                 ANNA
                        I’m unemployed!

           INT. CUBAN RESTAURANT - BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Irina, sitting on a stack of toilet seat covers, PEES. 
                                 IRINA
                             (in Ukrainian)
                        This is luxurious.

           She reaches around and grabs more of the covers and stuffs 
           them inside her blouse.

           She stares at the bathroom door, wondering if she can trust 
           her new friends, and then stares at the window...

           INT. CUBAN RESTAURANT - A FEW MORE MOMENTS LATER

           Anna, queasy, pops a Tums. 

           Angel’s phone BUZZES - text from Tommy - Ur cunt ass is gonna 
           bleed and not cuz itz ur period.  

                                 ANGEL
                        Ukraine’s in Europe, right?

                                 ANNA
                             (almost not condescending)
                        Yes, Angel.

                                 ANGEL
                        You ever been?

                                 ANNA
                        My mom took me to Paris when I 
                        graduated college. 

                                 ANGEL
                        Was it as special and romantic as 
                        it looks on TV? 

                                 ANNA
                        Yes, but my mother spent the entire 
                        trip pointing out how much more fun 
                        I’d be having if I were visiting 
                        with a boyfriend. 
                             (beat)
                        I almost threw her off the Pont des 
                        Arts Bridge. 

                                 ANGEL
                             (tries to hide her 
                              excitement)
                        That the bridge where couples “lock 
                        their love?” 

                                 ANNA
                        Yep. 
           Angel smiles, closes her eyes, and imagines as Anna checks 
           the time on her phone.

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        Not to be impatient with our 
                        forsaken immigrant friend, but we 
                        kinda have a ticking cock--

           Angel snaps out of her reverie. 

                                 ANGEL
                        Shit!

           Angel jumps up and runs to the bathroom. 

           Anna follows.

           The girls burst inside the now empty bathroom.

                                 ANGEL (CONT’D)
                        I fuckin’ knew it!

           Angel points to the open window--Irina’s gone.

           EXT. EDDIE’S HOUSE - DAY

           The bus is parked in front of the garage obscuring the 
           spectacle of Ray and Wes herding the girls from the garage to 
           the bus as Eddie, holding the Vicodin bowl, watches.

                                 WES
                        C’mon ladies, move those illegal 
                        asses. 

                                 EDDIE
                        Do either of you think life without 
                        your dick is worth living?

                                 RAY
                        Never thought about it... Wes?

           Wes scowls at Ray.

                                 WES
                             (uncomfortable)
                        Eddie, we gotta move the girls 
                        before that cop--

                                 EDDIE
                        I’ll deal with the cops. If you 
                        don’t get my dick back I’m taking 
                        one of yours. 
           The boys sweat.

                                 RAY
                        Tsunami, so you can, uh, experience 
                        the model lifestyle.

           INT./EXT. WES’ TRUCK - LITTLE HAVANA - PARKING LOT - SAME

           Angel hops into the driver’s seat and helps Anna inside.

                                 ANNA
                        I just have to say, you made the 
                        right decision for your daughter 
                        and I admire your courage. 

           The truck snarls out of the parking lot. 

                                 ANGEL
                        Thanks, white privilege. 

           Anna gives Angel a quizzical once-over.

                                 ANGEL (CONT’D)
                        Dad was half Filipino, half white 
                        and mom was half Cuban, half black. 

                                 ANNA
                        ...Which makes you...

           Angel speeds through the colorful, Cuban streets looking for 
           Irina. 

           TOURISTS and SHOP OWNERS jump out of her path. 

                                 ANGEL
                        The future. Now help me find the 
                        Russian.

                                 ANNA
                        Ukrainian.

           EXT. EDDIE’S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Ty walks past the open and empty garage and rings Eddie’s 
           DOORBELL. 
           Eddie, dressed and doped up to hide his pain, opens the door.

                                 EDDIE
                             (faux surprise/charming)
                        Officer, how can I help you?

                                 TY
                        Are you Eddie Charrow?

           Eddie puts his hands above his head playfully.

                                 EDDIE
                        Guilty.

                                 TY
                             (stone cold)
                        I’m following up on a complaint. 
                        Mind if I take a look around?

           Eddie shrugs. 

                                 EDDIE
                        I got nothing to hide. 

           Ty looks Eddie up and down and steps inside.

                                 IRINA (PRE-LAP)
                        Please. I beg you. I am in trouble. 

           INT. MIAMI INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - LUFTHASNA COUNTER - SAME

           Irina stands across from an irritated AIRLINE EMPLOYEE, 40s, 
           taking out cash, and, accidently, toilet seat covers from her 
           clothes. 

                                 LUFTHASNA EMPLOYEE
                        Ma’am, for the third time, I can’t 
                        sell you an international flight if 
                        you don’t. have. a. passport. 

                                 IRINA
                        For third time. I tell you. They 
                        take passport when I come! 

                                 LUFTHASNA EMPLOYEE
                        So get a new one.
                             (beat)
                        NEXT.

           Irina scoops up her savings and from the counter and throws 
           the toilet seat covers at the employee. 
                                 IRINA
                        Take toilet seat cover and fuck 
                        yourself!

           The employee is very, very confused.

           INT./EXT. WES’ TRUCK - LITTLE HAVANA - AFTERNOON

           Anna stares out the window, depressed.

           Angel’s on edge.

                                 ANNA
                        You think Irina will be okay? 
                        Where’s she gonna go? What’s she 
                        gonna do?
                             (hurt)
                        I really thought we had a nice 
                        lunch.

                                 ANGEL
                        Don’t take it personal. A girl like 
                        that can’t trust nobody. Now what 
                        do you wanna do? 

                                 ANNA
                        I wanna go back in time and wear 
                        more pink. And major in 
                        communications. And do a keg-stand 
                        at a dreadful “pimps and hos” party 
                        the pre-meds were never invited to. 
                        And drunkenly laugh really hard at 
                        some avocado-shaped budding tax 
                        attorney’s stupid jokes so I’d be 
                        married with avocado-shaped 
                        children and swilling Chardonnay 
                        right now instead of being on this 
                        completely delusional journey with 
                        you because when it’s over, if I 
                        don’t end up in jail, I’m going to 
                        have nothing to come home to! 

           Anna starts to cry.

                                 ANGEL
                        What did you expect?! You’re a dick 
                        expert. 

                                 ANNA
                        So?!
                                 ANGEL
                        No matter how big your heart, 
                        brain, or tits, at the end of the 
                        day, men ain’t lookin’ for gals 
                        with our qualifications to bring 
                        home to mom.

                                 ANNA
                             (sniffles)
                        So, what do we do?

                                 ANGEL
                        Take down this sex traffickin’ scum 
                        so he can’t hurt nobody else 
                        instead of bitchin’ cause shit is 
                        how it is and sometimes we get 
                        lonely.

                                 ANNA
                             (shocked)
                        You get lonely?

                                 ANGEL
                        Of course I get lonely! All I ever 
                        wanted was a family of my own. 
                             (beat)
                        When Derrick left I gave up. Yeah, 
                        I had a shit start, but I never 
                        believed in myself neither.  I 
                        never believed nothin’ I could ever 
                        do would make any difference... But 
                        now here I am in this car with 
                        you... Believin’ in somethin’!

           Angel takes Anna’s hand the way Anna took Angel’s earlier. 

                                 ANGEL (CONT’D)
                        Don’t disappoint me, Anna. I ain’t 
                        sure I could take it.

           Anna wipes her tears as Angel reaches for the phone.

                                 ANNA
                        I’m sorry, Angel. You’re right. 
                        Give me a minute to get back into 
                        the insurgent headspace.

           Angel stops the truck abruptly. 

                                 ANGEL
                        You got five minutes to work on 
                        your “headspace.” I’m gettin’ a 
                        coco frio. 
           Angel parks and hops out of the truck. 

                                 ANNA
                        Angel! Wait! Come back!

           Angel keeps walking. Anna gets out and follows her.

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        You can’t leave me. I’ll just sit 
                        here agonizing over missing out on 
                        a delicious Cuban treat the whole 
                        time. And speaking of time we’ve 
                        gotta make this quick.

           Angel smiles in spite of herself.

                        or evil spirits are you?

                        The candle’s for good luck on our

           Ty notices nail marks on the doorway to “Heaven.” He tries to 
           open the door, it’s locked.

                        I’m very interested in that type 
                        of, uh, property, but it’s gonna 
                        come down to location and price.

                        The location is Mount Sinai Medical

                                 ANGEL
                        The price is confessing you’re a

                                 EDDIE
                        I am open to discussing those 
                        terms, let me text you the address 
                        to my office. 

           Eddie hangs up and texts Anna the address.

                        Can you open this door?

           Eddie puts his arm around Ty.
                                 EDDIE
                        Officer Jordan, I’ve been more than 
                        accommodating, but I have a meeting 
                        in fifteen minutes and you don’t 
                        have a warrant.

           Ty traces the nail marks with his fingers as his suspicion 
           swells.

           car.
           Ty scurries behind a shelf and watches Eddie as a blood spot 
           appears through his white pants in his groin area. 

           Ty’s confused as Eddie gets into the lambo and tears out of 
           the garage.

           The preppy guy pours Angel a glass of Bordeaux into a plastic

                        Tell me about Ukraine. Is it a nice 
                        place to live? 

                                 IRINA
                        Not so nice right now, but is home.

           Irina grimaces.

                        No. I am not “Girl Gone Wild”. I 
                        try to be model to earn money to 
                        help family.

                        Ramones and Sex Pistols and Pussy 
                        Riot--not that Good Charlotte shit. 
                        I also like crossword puzzles, 
                        computers, and poodles--they are

                        Sure, but I’d prefer to call my 
                        friend from my room... where it’s 
                        private.

           Irina nods, now wary.

           INT. SOUTH BEACH MEDICAL GROUP - LOBBY - GROUND FLOOR - 
           MOMENTS LATER

           In SLOW MOTION to Miami rapper, Stitches’, Brick in Yo Face, 
           Anna, carrying the surgical contraband, struts out of the 
           building with a FUCK YEAH grin.   

           She hops in the truck.

                                 ANNA
                        You should’ve seen me in there! I 
                        was like an episode of Miami Vice!

           From the backseat Tommy slaps the gun from Anna’s hand. 

                                 TOMMY
                        You ain’t no Crockett and Tubbs.

                                 ANGEL
                        Anna, meet Tommy, my, uh, manager. 
                        He’s coming with us and the price 
                        went up to ten g’s.

           Anna’s mouth drops. 
                                 ANNA
                        WHAT?!

                                 TOMMY
                        You wanna fuck with Eddie you’re 
                        gonna need protection.

           Anna’s blood boils with betrayal and she PULLS ANGEL’S HAIR.

                                 ANNA
                             (to Angel)
                        I’m already paying enough! 

           Angel tries to pry Anna off, but she hangs on like a feral 
           monkey.

                                 ANGEL
                        Anna, calm down! 

                                 ANNA
                        I will NOT calm down! This was 
                        obviously premeditated and I won’t 
                        stand for it!

           Anna RIPS OUT ANGEL’S EXTENSIONS.

           Angel SLAPS ANNA ACROSS THE FACE.

                                 ANGEL
                        Fuck you, Anna! The reason we’re a 
                        threesome is CAUSE I GAVE YOU THE 
                        GUN AND COULDN’T PROTECT MYSELF--

           Tommy FIRES A SHOT out the window.

           Anna jumps.

                                 TOMMY
                        Enough!
                             (beat)
                        Damn. You guys fuckin’ or 
                        somethin’?

                        No! 
                             (right to Angel)
                        We’re not even friends.

           Anna grabs the cooler.

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        The deal’s off.

           Anna reaches for the door when Tommy puts a gun to her head.
                                 TOMMY
                             (grins)
                        Say it ain’t so.

           Anna glares at Angel, angry and heartbroken. 

           Angel stares at the floor, feeling genuine guilt.

                                 EDDIE (PRE-LAP)
                        Come closer.

           Eddie, clutching his Vicodin bowl, lies in bed in an entirely 
           white room flanked by his armed ladies in waiting, Wes and 
           Ray.

                                 WES
                        You alright boss?

           Eddie stares straight ahead as if he’s having a vision. 

                                 EDDIE
                        When I was six, my best friend was 
                        a white pony named Buttermilk. She 
                        was smart, tough, and loyal. One 
                        time, Buttermilk was chasing her 
                        pink, jolly ball around my feet and 
                        accidently stepped on my foot--
                        breaking my toe. My dad saw, and 
                        dragged us both over to the stable. 
                        He handed me a revolver and said if 
                        I didn’t shoot Buttermilk, he’d 
                        shoot me. “Hunt or be hunted, son.” 
                             (beat)
                        That was my first life lesson.

                        You killed a pony?

                                 WES
                             (sweats/sotto)
                        Why’s he telling us?

                                 EDDIE
                        Because that’s why I’m in the 
                        penthouse. 
           Eddie points to Tsunami’s glistening saltwater pool stuffed 
           with the previous crop of his GIRLS fluffing drunk, sunburnt 
           men under white cabanas -

                                 EDDIE (O.S.)  (CONT’D) 
                        Each of my girls is Buttermilk with 
                        tits. They could run. They could 
                        fight. But they don’t. They are the 
                        hunted. 

           Eddie grins as we PAN TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WALL - 

           The locked up girls are POUNDING ON THE WALLS. 

           BACK TO EDDIE’S BEDROOM - 

           Wes pounds on the wall to shut them up.

                                 WES
                        KNOCK IT OFF!

           Eddie reaches for another Vicodin. 

                                 RAY
                        Eddie, take it easy on the Vics.

                                 EDDIE
                        Don’t tell me what to do. Now, 
                        what’s the ETA on my cock?

           INT.EXT. WES’ TRUCK - COLLINS AVE - SOUTH BEACH - EVENING

           Anna, Angel, and Tommy are stuck in terrible traffic.

           Anna and Angel do not make eye contact. 

                                 TOMMY
                        Doc, you sure you can handle the 
                        “surgery” when you’re in a beef 
                        with your bitch?

                                 ANNA
                        Surgery is the only time my 
                        overactive brain is ever truly at 
                        ease.

                                 ANGEL
                        She ain’t lyin’. Workin’ with her 
                        is like operatin’ a suicide 
                        hotline. 
                                 ANNA
                        Oh, please. If you worked on a 
                        suicide hotline the human race 
                        would be extinct. 

           The girls glare at each other.

           Tommy lights a cigarette. 

                                 TOMMY
                        ...So, why dick surgeries? 

           Anna reaches around, takes the cigarette, and puts it out in 
           the cup holder.

                                 ANNA
                        I lost my father to prostate cancer 
                        when I was twelve. 
                             (beat)
                        I thought if I became a urologist 
                        maybe I’d save some other little 
                        girl’s dad one day...or something. 

           Angel softens, surprised by how much she feels for Anna. 

                                 ANGEL
                        You didn’t tell me that...

                                 ANNA
                        Well, maybe I didn’t want to talk 
                        about my deceased father with a 
                        conniving, usurious--

                                 ANGEL
                        Anna, FOR REAL, I DIDN’T PLAN ON 
                        THIS BEIN’ A THREESOME! 

           Anna stares out the window, wanting to believe Angel.

                             (grins)
                        So you are fuckin’.

           Tommy lights another cigarette.

                        Hey, doc, can you take a peek at my 
                        junk? It’s been burnin’ when I piss 
                        and I ain’t got health insurance.

           Anna throws her hands up at life. 

                                 ANNA
                        Sure, Tommy. Why the fuck not?!

           Ty, on his computer, stares at Anna’s and Eddie’s personal 
           information/”files” looking for clues/connections. 

           Cal walks over.

           Ty quickly shuts off his monitor.

                        paperwork and I’m there. 

           Cal leaves and texts Eddie - Everything’s under control.

           Ty waits until Cal’s out of sight and turns his monitor back 
           on.

           Irina and Kent watch Pussy Riot’s Putin Lights Up the Fires 
           music video on his laptop. 

           Irina quietly but excitedly SINGS ALONG in Russian. 

                                 KENT

                        Whoa! This is pretty hot. 

           Irina SIGHS. 

                                 IRINA
                        You miss point. 

           Kent smiles and inches closer to Irina.

                                 KENT
                        What are they saying?

                             (playful)
                        They say...

           Irina rocks out - 

                                 IRINA (CONT’D)
                        Putin ignites the fires of

                        He was bored and frightened people 
                        in silence. Whatever punishment he 
                        had - that rotten ash, with no time 
                        in many years - the reason for 
                        pollution.

           Irina’s spirited teenage self starts to emerge as she loses 
           herself dancing around the room throwing punches like the 
           band when Kent closes the laptop, not into it. 

           Irina plops on the bed and catches her breath.

                             (uncomfortable)
                        Girls that look like you don’t 
                        usually have such--

           Irina raises her eyebrows, amused. 

                                 IRINA
                        Strong will? Point of view?

           Kent LAUGHS and hands Irina a glass of champagne.

                                 KENT
                        Irina, I have a confession to 
                        make...

                                 IRINA
                             (exasperated)
                        No friend to help with passport?

           Kent stares at her blankly.

           Irina starts for the door but he pulls her onto the bed.

                                 KENT
                        Don’t go!

           Irina grabs the heavy, glittering glass conch from the night 
           table and CRACKS KENT IN THE HEAD. 

           He staggers and falls. 

                                 IRINA
                             (in Ukrainian)
                        Shit.

           Irina nervously checks his pulse--he’s still alive.
                                 IRINA (CONT’D)
                        You’ll live.

           She picks up the glass conch and runs out of the room.

           INT. TSUNAMI - HOTEL LOBBY - EVENING

           Anna, Angel, and Tommy, ready to rumble, walk to the elevator  
           through the quintessential South Beach hotel experience: 
           gauzy white curtains, tufted white leather furniture framed 
           by white pillar candles, white faux fur pillows and throws 
           placed to look strewn, a hip, poolside DJ wearing white 
           sunglasses and pretty PARTY PEOPLE of all colors.  

           They reach the elevator and the doors open on Irina, carrying 
           the conch, who sees the trio and frantically presses the 
           close-door button.

           Angel jumps in front of the doors, shoving them open. 

           Anna scurries inside the elevator.

                                 ANNA
                             (”tough”, to Irina)
                        I bet one of us wishes elevators 
                        had windows right now...

                                 IRINA
                        Please... I just want to go home.

                                 TOMMY
                             (to Angel)
                        Who’s the Babubshka?

                                 ANGEL
                        She’s Ukrainian, fuckhead.

           Angel and Tommy get in the elevator as the doors close. 

                                 ANNA
                        We just wanted to help you!  

                                 IRINA
                        How I believe? You have penis in 
                        cooler!

                                 ANGEL
                        Anna was so hurt you ran, she 
                        thought you were friends.

           Angel LAUGHS.
                                 ANNA
                        Really, Angel?! Really?

                                 TOMMY
                             (to Irina)
                        They’re fuckin’ huh?

                                 IRINA
                        I think the same when I first meet!

                                 ANNA
                        I would rather fill my vagina with 
                        cement than let her inside of it!

           Angel pokes Anna in the chest.

                                 ANGEL
                        Say the word, bitch. A former 
                        client pours concrete.

           Anna pulls her scalpel as Tommy pulls a gun.

                                 TOMMY
                        NOT! ANOTHER! WORD! 
                             (beat)
                        You are grown ass bitches. 
                             (beat)
                        Now, can we use Anna Kournikova or 
                        not?!

           Beat.

                                 IRINA
                        Please. I need passport. I do 
                        anything.

           Anna’s phone BUZZES - Text from Eddie - Hurry the fuck up!

                                 ANGEL
                             (to Irina, re: the conch)
                        The shell ain’t worth shit. He buys 
                        ‘em in bulk in Little Havana. 

           INT. TSUNAMI - PENTHOUSE - HALLWAY - SECONDS LATER

           The elevator doors open. 

           Anna, Angel, Tommy, and Irina, now carrying the cooler and 
           the conch, step into the hallway. 

                                 ANGEL
                             (to Irina)
                        Wait here. Don’t move.

                                 ANGEL (CONT'D)
                        Eddie’s dick’s our life insurance 
                        and he ain’t gettin’ it ‘til we get 
                        our confession. 
                             (beat)
                        You fuck us and she’ll chop you 
                        into little pieces and bake you 
                        into a pierogi. 

                                 TOMMY
                        --The fuck’s a pierogi?

                                 ANNA
                        A dumpling--

                                 IRINA
                        I understand. 

           Anna’s phone BUZZES - Unknown number. 

                                 ANNA
                             (answers)
                        Hold on, Eddie--

                                 TY (O.S.)
                        Anna, this is Officer Ty Jordan, 
                        Miami PD, we met earlier today--

           Anna throws the phone like a cockroach landed on it.

           Everyone stares at her.

                                 ANNA
                        That was the police! Doctor Grahame 
                        must’ve reported me! 
                             (beat)
                        I’m going to jail! I’m going to--

                                 ANGEL
                        You’re ain’t goin’ to jail. You 
                        didn’t kill nobody! 

           Anna leans against the wall, dizzy.

                                 ANNA
                        I can’t do this. 

           Tommy puts a gun in her face.

                                 TOMMY
                        We get paid either way!

           Anna slides down the wall into panic attack-asana.
                                 ANNA
                        I can’t breathe. I can’t--

                                 TOMMY
                             (to Angel)
                        Do something’! 

           Angel, scrambling, grabs Anna’s phone and plays Anna’s video. 

           Anna, gasping for air, watches the video as she slowly gains 
           control and descends into fury. 

           Anna’s phone BUZZES - Eddie calling.

                                 ANGEL
                        Anna, what’s it gonna be?

           Anna stares at the group.

                                 IRINA
                        Eddie is bad man. He deserve to 
                        rot.

           Anna stares at Irina, nods, takes a deep breath, and KNOCKS 
           ON THE DOOR.

                                 EDDIE (PRE-LAP)
                        Where is it?

           INT. TSUNAMI - PENTHOUSE SUITE - EDDIE’S BEDROOM - SECONDS 
           LATER

           Anna, Angel, and Tommy stare at Eddie, Ray, and Wes. The 
           boys, except Eddie, who’s still high, point guns at each 
           other. 

                                 ANGEL
                        It’s in the building. Soon as you 
                        record your confession, it’s yours. 

                                 ANNA
                        Which is, to be clear, exactly what 
                        we agreed upon. And we should 
                        really hop to it as our success 
                        rate window is closing.

           FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WALL - 

           The models hear Anna and Angel and rush to the wall and POUND 
           ON IT -

           Wes POUNDS THE WALL BACK -

                        SHUT, THE FUCK UP!

                                 ANNA
                        What was that?

                                 RAY
                        Don’t worry about it.

                        It’s the girls from the house!

                                 TOMMY
                        Who?

                                 EDDIE
                        Tommy, what the fuck are you doin’ 
                        here?
                             (to Anna and Angel)
                        We didn’t agree on him being 
                        involved. 

                                 WES
                             (mouths, to Tommy)
                        Traitor. 

                                 TOMMY
                        I know, Eddie. I know. But, I’m in 
                        trouble. I owe my connect some 
                        money--

           Eddie nods.

           BANG BANG BANG - Wes smokes Tommy. 

                                 ANNA
                        OHMYGOD!!!!!!!

           FROM THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WALL THE GIRLS SHRIEK - 

                                 WES
                        SHUT UP!

           Angel lunges for Tommy’s gun, but Ray grabs Angel and puts 
           his gun in her mouth, albeit awkwardly. 

           Anna turns in circles. 
                                 ANNA
                             (points to Tommy)
                        He’s dead! He’s actually dead!

           Eddie smiles, professionally. 

                                 EDDIE
                        In light of these new circumstances 
                        the terms are: No confession. Do 
                        the surgery or... die.

           Anna looks at Angel like a baby seal about to get clubbed by 
           an Eskimo.

                                 ANGEL
                             (to Anna)
                        Go get it!

           Anna stands, frozen. 

           Wes FIRES ANOTHER SHOT. 

                                 WES
                        NOW!

           Anna puts her hands up. 

                                 ANNA
                        Okay! Okay! I’m going!

           Anna opens the door and peers into the hallway...

                                                          QUICK CUT TO:

           IRINA RUNNING FOR DEAR LIFE DOWN THE STAIRS CARRYING THE 
           COOLER AND THE CONCH.

           BACK IN THE PENTHOUSE - 

           Anna stares at the empty hallway, totally fucked. 

                                 ANNA
                        I’ll, um, just be one minute.

           Anna takes off running like a rabid gazelle.

           INT. TSUNAMI - HOTEL - LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER

           Anna, hysterical, shoots out of the elevator.

                                 ANNA
                        IRINA!!!! 
           No Irina. 

           Anna’s heart pounds.  

           She flies to the front desk where the stacked CONCIERGE, 22, 
           takes sexy “work” selfies.  

                                  ANNA (CONT’D)
                        Have you seen a distressed 
                        Ukrainian female carrying a pink 
                        cooler?! 

                                 CONCIERGE
                        What happens at Tsunami stays at 
                        Tsunami.

           Anna reaches across the desk, grabs the letter opener, and 
           grips it like a dagger.

                                 ANNA
                        Tell me! Or I’ll RUPTURE your 
                        bargain boob job and the silicone 
                        will MIGRATE to your LUNGS where 
                        it’s IMPOSSIBLE to remove and 
                        you’ll cough it up for eternity!

           The concierge points to the door. 

                                 CONCIERGE
                             (quivering)
                        She went South on Collins...

           Anna tosses the letter opener, races to the revolving doors, 
           and shoves her way outside.

           EXT. TSUNAMI - COLLINS AVENUE - SOUTH BEACH - SAME

           Irina, with the cooler and carrying the conch like a 
           football, runs down the pulsating street weaving through 
           PEDESTRIANS.  

           She crashes through a group of BROS.

                                 BRO 1
                        Sup caviar tits.

           Irina bashes Bro 1 in the nuts with the conch--BAM.

                                 IRINA
                        Not sorry.

           Irina keeps running.
           INT. TSUNAMI - PENTHOUSE SUITE - SAME

           Nobody’s moved.

                                 EDDIE
                             (to Angel)
                        What’s taking the doctor so long?!

                                 ANGEL
                        Urologist--

                                 EDDIE
                        You don’t think I know that?!

                                 ANGEL
                        What you don’t know is she ain’t 
                        comin’ back. 

                                 EDDIE
                        WHAT?!

                                 ANGEL
                        You fucked up, Eddie. You’re usin’ 
                        me as collateral, but Anna don’t 
                        give a shit about keepin’ me alive. 
                             (guilty/disappointed)
                        We got in a fight--She’s probably 
                        half way to Cuba by now. 

                                 EDDIE
                        WES!!!!

                                 WES
                        On it.

           Wes runs out.

           Ray sulks.

           EXT. COLLINS AVENUE - SOUTH BEACH - SAME

           Anna runs down the street when her phone BUZZES - Eddie 
           calling. 

           Anna grimaces.

                                 ANNA
                             (answers/nervous)
                        Hi Eddie!... No, everything’s 
                        great!
                             (scrambles)
                        I’m in the elevator... 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ANNA (CONT'D)
                        This special needs child accidently 
                        pressed ALL the buttons (he thought 
                        he was catching fireflies)... so, 
                        it’s gonna be a couple minutes... 
                        Sit tight and I’ll be there before 
                        you can say penile reattachment 
                        procedure... 

           Anna hangs up.

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        IRINAAAA!!!

           EXT. COLLINS AVENUE - SECONDS LATER

           Irina runs across the street, STOPPING TRAFFIC and CURSING AT 
           THE CARS IN UKRAINIAN, when -  

           EXT. COLLINS AVENUE - SECONDS LATER

           Anna turns to see why everyone’s HONKING and notices Irina 
           running through the cars like a shooting star.  

                                 ANNA
                        IRINA!! WAIT!!

           Anna starts running when she notices a greasy, multi-pierced 
           BIKER, 18, on a tiny BMX bike. 

           She crazily SHOVES HIM OFF. 

                                 BIKER
                        What the fuck?

                                 ANNA
                        Fun fact: There’s no justice in the 
                        world. 

           The biker stares up at Anna, shocked. 

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        Seriously. Go rob a bank! Start the 
                        revolution!

           Anna snatches his helmet and speeds across the street after 
           Irina, looking both ways of course. 

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        Wheeeeee.

           The biker stands up and yells after her - 
                                 BIKER
                        Wait! What revolution?

           EXT. COLLINS AVENUE - MOMENTS LATER

           Anna pedals after Irina.

                                 ANNA
                        IRINA!!! I NEED THAT PENIS!

           PEDESTRIANS regard Anna strangely.

           Irina looks over her shoulder, terrified and confused to see 
           Anna chasing her on the bike. 

                                 IRINA
                        Where such tiny bike come from?

                                 ANNA
                        I’m asking the questions here. Not 
                        you. And my first question is: Why 
                        did you run again when you PROMISED 
                        to STAY PUT!?

                                 IRINA
                        What choice I have? I hear BANG 
                        BANG! I think you and prostitute 
                        girlfriend dead!

                                 ANNA
                        Tommy’s dead and the rest of your 
                        friends from the house are locked 
                        up in the penthouse--

           Irina’s eyes narrow.

                                 IRINA
                        They have girls?

                                 ANNA
                        Yes! And to be clear, Angel’s a 
                        retired prostitute and Eddie’s 
                        holding her hostage because YOU ran 
                        off with his DICK! 

           Anna swerves in front of Irina, blocking her path. 

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                             (actually scary)
                        Give it back, NOW!
                                 IRINA
                             (panting)
                        Going back to hotel is suicide. 

           Anna jumps off the bike and gets in Irina’s face.

                                 ANNA
                        I can’t abandon Angel! 
                             (beat)
                        We might not be on speaking terms 
                        right now, but this whole thing 
                        with Eddie was my idea and if she 
                        dies I could never forgive myself. 

           Beat.

                                 IRINA
                        I understand. I have special friend 
                        back home.

                                 ANNA
                             (blushes)
                        Oh, Angel’s not my--

                                 IRINA
                        If you go back, you go back alone. 
                        I will not end up locked up with 
                        other girls or dead like face 
                        tattoo.

           Anna snatches the cooler. 

                                 ANNA
                        I hope you find your way back to 
                        Ukraine cause we don’t need any 
                        more cowards in this country.

           Anna hops on the bike, swerves, falls, but gets back up.

                                 IRINA
                        Rather be alive coward than dead 
                        moron.

           Irina contemplates her declaration as Anna pedals off.

           EXT. EDDIE’S MANSION - SAME

           Ty, knowing he shouldn’t be here, nervously presses Eddie’s 
           DOORBELL. 

           No answer. 
           He peers inside the window as the knot in his stomach  
           metastasizes.

           He presses the DOORBELL again. 

           Nothing.

                                 TY
                        Fuck it.

           Ty scales the property until he notices the sliding glass 
           door Angel damaged. 

           He tugs on it carefully and lets himself inside. 

           EXT. COLLINS AVE - SOUTH BEACH - LATER

           Anna, steering the bike with one hand and gripping the cooler 
           with the other, pedals furiously toward Tsunami when - 

           Wes, like a coked up Tarzan, RUSHES HER - 

                                 WES
                        Hey, doc, Cuba’s the other way. 

           Anna keeps pedaling--forcing Wes to trot alongside her like a 
           tiny dog.

                                 ANNA
                        ...Did you just learn how to read 
                        maps? Or is that some kind of 
                        cryptic addict speak?

           Wes grabs her tire--the bike STOPS. 

                                 WES
                             (snarls)
                        It means your escape’s over!

           Anna rolls her eyes. 

                                 ANNA
                        Escape? I’m obviously already en 
                        route to the hotel. You get zero 
                        credit for capturing me.

           Wes GRUNTS.
           EXT. SOUTH BEACH - BEACH PARALLEL TO COLLINS AVE - BACK TO 
           PRESENT - NIGHT

           Irina watches drunken, careless TWENTY-SOMETHINGS play beach 
           volleyball as she contemplates the injustice in the world. 

           She takes out the picture of her sisters and stares at it.

                                 IRINA
                        I am not coward. 

           Irina stands up and the volleyball lands at her feet. 

           She kicks it in the opposite direction, grabs the conch, and 
           runs as the PUSSY RIOT SONG FROM EARLIER SWELLS.

           INT. TSUNAMI - PENTHOUSE SUITE - SAME

           Eddie, in bed, sweats profusely. His skin is grey and his 
           breathing is irregular. 

           Ray keeps the gun on Angel but makes sure she’s comfortable 
           as she’s splayed on the snow leopard sectional.

                                 ANGEL
                             (whispers)
                        Look, Ray. I know you’re gonna have 
                        to kill me, but I need to make a 
                        call before you do it. 

                                 RAY
                             (whispers)
                        Don’t say that. Your friend’s 
                        coming back. Wes’ll find her. 

                                 ANGEL
                             (whispers)
                        Ray, I have a daughter I’ve never, 
                        um, met. 

           Ray’s eyes widen sympathetically. 

                                 ANGEL (CONT’D)
                             (whispers)
                        I just wanna say hi, you know, 
                        introduce myself... Or maybe just 
                        hear her voice one more time...

                                 EDDIE
                             (fading)
                        The kid’s better off not knowing 
                        you.
           Angel bristles. 

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        My mom was a whore. 
                             (beat)
                        I used to tell people she died in a 
                        car accident.

           Angel, like a feral animal, leaps up and lunges towards 
           Eddie.

           Ray struggles to contain her.

                                 ANGEL
                             (to Eddie)
                        Fuck you, you dickless piece of--

                                 EDDIE
                             (to Ray)
                        Shoot her.

           Ray freezes.

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                        SHOOT HER, GODDAMNIT!

           Ray shakes as he reluctantly points his gun at Angel.

                                 ANGEL
                        Ray, don’t do it!

                                 EDDIE
                        DO IT YOU FUCKING CUNT!

           Ray doesn’t.

           Eddie reaches for his gun when BANG - Ray SHOOTS it out of 
           Eddie’s hands. 

                                 RAY
                        Angel, I have to tell you 
                        something... I’ve been waiting for 
                        the right time, but now there might 
                        not be a right time...

           ANNA AND WES BURST INSIDE as Ray realizes what he’s just 
           done. 

                                 ANNA
                             (thinking Angel was shot)
                        Angel!
                                 ANGEL
                             (can’t believe it)
                        Anna!

                                 ANNA
                        You’re alive! We heard a gunshot... 

                                 EDDIE
                             (quietly to Wes)
                        When this is done, we need to talk 
                        about your brother. 

           Wes gives Ray a look. Ray notices and knows what it means.

                                 ANGEL
                        I can’t believe you came back for 
                        me... 

                                 ANNA
                        Of course I did! I care about you. 
                        And you don’t have to say it back, 
                        as I know hearts, flowers, and/or 
                        feelings are not your forte, but, I 
                        know you care about me too.

                                 ANGEL
                        I swear I was tellin’ the truth 
                        about Tommy. 
                             (beat)
                        If we get outta here I’m buyin’ you 
                        the biggest fuckin’ margarita!

                                 ANNA
                        I would LOVE that!

                                 EDDIE
                        Nobody’s getting any margaritas 
                        until I have a dick!

           INT. EDDIE’S MANSION - SOUTH BEACH - NIGHT

           Ty stands in front of the locked door to “Heaven.”

           He tries to unlock it with: 

           A CREDIT CARD - 

           A HANDCUFF KEY -  

           A TASER - 

           Finally, frustrated, he CHARGES THE DOOR--no dice.
           Ty runs outside to his patrol car and starts tearing apart 
           the trunk looking for something...

           INT. TSUNAMI - PENTHOUSE SUITE - MOMENTS LATER

           Anna, completely and officially suited up for surgery--mask, 
           loupes, gloves, etc., sits next to Eddie on the bed. 

           Angel stands next to Anna gripping the cooler a la her 
           medical assistant.

           Eddie’s on his back in bed.

           Coked up Wes and strung out/anxious Ray have their guns on 
           the girls at a non-intrusive distance.

           Everyone takes a deep breath as - 

           Anna peels off Eddie’s bandage -

                                 ANNA
                             (sotto)
                        What a mess.
                             (to Eddie)
                        You ready?

                                 EDDIE
                        Aren’t you gonna numb it or 
                        something?

           Anna cleans the wound.

                                 ANNA
                             (didn’t forget)
                        You know, I was in such a rush I 
                        must’ve forgotten local anesthetic.

           Eddie GROANS. 

           Angel smirks. 

           Wes and Ray tremble. 

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        Angel, the penis. 

           Angel opens the cooler and unwraps the penis--miraculously 
           it’s seemingly intact, actually - 

                                 ANGEL
                        He feels a tad stiff. 
                                 ANNA
                             (shit)
                        Frozen?

                                 ANGEL
                        Should I blow dry it or somethin’?

           FROM THE PENTHOUSE HALLWAY - 

           Irina races through the hall, sees the fire alarm, SMASHES 
           THE GLASS WITH THE CONCH, PULLS THE ALARM, runs to the 
           penthouse door and BANGS ON IT AS THE FIRE ALARM BLARES - 

                                 IRINA
                        FIRE! FIRE!

           BACK INSIDE THE PENTHOUSE - 

           Wes suspiciously opens the door when IRINA SMASHES HIM IN THE 
           FACE WITH THE CONCH--

                                 IRINA (CONT’D)
                        WHERE ARE GIRLS?!!!

           ANNA SCREAMS - 

           THE TRAPPED GIRLS BANG ON THE WALL -

           STARTLED, ANGEL THROWS THE PENIS IN THE AIR -

           IRINA INTERCEPTS THE PENIS, RUNS TO THE BALCONY, AND HOLDS IT 
           OVER THE LEDGE - 

                                 IRINA (CONT’D)
                        FREE GIRLS NOW OR SAY BYE BYE TO 
                        LITTLE FUCKER! 

           WES SPITS OUT HIS TWO FRONT TEETH AND REACHES FOR HIS GUN - 

                                 WES
                        FUCKING, BITCH! 
                             (beat)
                        Don’t worry, Eddie!

                                 ANNA
                        IRINA, DON’T! HE’LL KILL US ALL!

                                 EDDIE
                        LET THEM OUT!

           Beat.

           Wes RUSHES TO THE DOOR AND UNLOCKS IT - 
           THE GIRLS STAMPEDE INTO THE ROOM, TRAMPLING WES AND RAY - 

                                 EDDIE (CONT’D)
                             (to Irina)
                        NOW GIVE IT BACK!

                                 IRINA
                        FUCK YOU!

           IRINA SMILES AND LAUNCHES THE PENIS THROUGH THE AIR LIKE A 
           HAIL-MARY-GAME-WINNING-TOUCHDOWN - 

                                 ANGEL
                        OH.MY.GOD.

           EVERYONE GASPS as Irina leads the girls out of the room--
           TOTAL PANDENOMIUM - 

           WES AND RAY RUN TO THE BALCONY, BUT IT’S IMPOSSIBLE TO SEE 
           ANYTHING AS THE FRENZIED POOL PARTY BELOW RUNS FROM THE 
           “FIRE” - 

           WES RACES BACK INSIDE - 

                                 WES
                        It’s gone.

           Eddie SHAKES VIOLENTLY AND STARTS TURNING BLUE - 

                                 RAY
                        What’s happening?

           Anna picks up the phone  - 

                                 ANNA
                        I need an ambulance at the Tsunami 
                        hotel on Collins STAT! The owner 
                        has gone into hypolovemic shock! 

           INT. EDDIE’S MANSION - MOMENTS LATER, STILL DARK 

           Ty strains to pull the door to “Heaven” with a pry bar -  

           He sweats and GRUNTS and just as he’s about to give up the 
           door pops open - 

                                 TY
                        Booya--WHOA...

           He steps inside and picks up a canister of glittery lube, 
           grimaces, and puts it back when he notices a staircase that 
           leads to the bedroom. 
           He diligently snaps pictures of the scene on his phone as he 
           walks over to the costume rack when, like a rabid teradactyl, 
           the terrified Chinese model flies at Ty from the clothes, 
           latches onto him, and swats him with her twiggy limbs. 

                                 TY (CONT’D)
                        What the hell?! OW! 
                             (tries to pry her off)
                        Stop that!

           Ty finally tears her off of him. 

           She pants and stares at him, scared. 

                                 TY (CONT’D)
                        It’s okay, I’m not gonna hurt you. 

           Ty slowly reaches for his badge and flashes it in her face. 

                                 TY (CONT’D)
                        See? 
                             (re: badge)
                        Police.

           The model’s eyes widen. She relaxes for a second... and jabs 
           him in the face in the exact spot Wes punched him earlier. 

                                 TY (CONT’D)
                        DAMN IT! 
                             (beat)
                        NOT COOL! 

           The model runs for the door, but Ty leaps over the bed and 
           blocks the entrance. 

                                 TY (CONT’D)
                        You’re coming with me. 
                             (off her look)
                        And NO hitting!

           INT. MOUNT SINAI MEDICAL CENTER - SOUTH BEACH - WAITING ROOM - 
           CRACK OF DAWN 

           The hospital bustles with overworked NURSES and adrenaline 
           fueled EMERGENCY CONTACTS. 

           Ray is slumped next to Angel who is slumped next to Anna who  
           is slumped next to Wes--all waiting for Eddie to get out of 
           surgery.

           Wes yawns and reaches for his little baggie of coke--it’s 
           empty. 
           Wes snarls, gets up, fondles his gun-bulge and points it at 
           Anna and Angel. 

                                 WES
                        Don’t go nowhere.

           Anna and Angel glower at Wes as he embarks on a sleepless 
           five-foot sojourn to the coffee cart. 

                                 ANGEL
                        Hey, Ray...

           Ray instantly sits up - 

                                 RAY
                             (”cool”)
                        ...Yeah?

                                 ANGEL
                        What secret were you gonna tell me? 

           Wes, crashing from coke and lack of sleep, comes back 
           chugging black coffee from both hands.

           Ray STUTTERS as everyone notices Wes pass out.

                                 RAY
                        ...It doesn’t matter.

           Anna surreptitiously attempts to detach Wes’ gun from his 
           waistband when he sleep/FARTS in her face. 

                                 ANGEL
                        It does to me. 

           Anna chokes on the smell and drops the gun down his butt 
           crack.

                                 ANGEL (CONT’D)
                        You saved my life.

           Anna, breathing furiously through her mouth, retrieves the 
           gun from Wes’ butt crack, but accidently COCKS IT - Shit! 

                                 RAY
                        Angel, I’ve been in love with you 
                        since the first time I saw you. 
                             (off Angel’s blank look)
                        When Wes felt you up at Broken 
                        Shaker and you knocked him out...

           Anna abandons her mission as she stops and swoons over Ray’s 
           declaration.
                                 RAY (CONT’D)
                        Tell me you could love me back and 
                        I’ll do whatever it takes to earn 
                        an honest living so I can buy you a 
                        fancy dress for you to wear to meet 
                        your daughter.
                             (beat)
                        I can’t believe that little girl 
                        doesn’t know how funny and tough 
                        and gorgeous her mom is. 

                                 ANGEL
                             (touched)
                        You really mean that?

                                 ANNA
                             (whispers)
                        He so totally means it!

           Angel kisses Ray.

           Anna, back to business, UN-COCKS the gun, wriggles it out of 
           Wes’ pants, wipes it neurotically on her sleeve, and slips it 
           into her waistband as -

           Wes’ eyes shoot open.

           A cute NURSE clad in hippopotamus scrubs taps Wes on the 
           shoulder.

                                 NURSE
                        Eddie’s awake. You can see him now. 

           INT. MOUNT SINAI MEDICAL CENTER - EDDIE’S ROOM - MOMENTS 
           LATER

           Angel, Wes, and Ray stare in horror as Anna tilts a mirror so 
           Eddie can see himself--ALL SEWN UP with two balls.

           Eddie is eerily still. 

                                 RAY
                             (timorous)
                        Eddie, say something.

           Eddie solemnly motions for Anna to put away the mirror -

                                 EDDIE
                        We had a deal and now I have a 
                        pussy with a double-chin.
                                 ANNA
                        Eddie, the absence of part of your 
                        male reproductive system doesn’t 
                        equal a female sex organ.

                                 ANGEL
                             (to Anna)
                        So, he’s still a man...but, like...
                             (gestures re: genitals)
                        On airplane mode?

                                 EDDIE
                             (to Wes)
                        Get rid of them. 
                             (points, including Ray)
                        ALL OF THEM. 
                             (beat)
                        And make it hurt.

                                 WES
                             (to Ray)
                        What did you do?!

                                 RAY
                        I quit. 
                             (off Wes’ disbelief)
                        And I told Angel I love her. 

           Wes snarls.

                                 ANGEL
                        And I kissed him and got these 
                        little butterflies in my tummy.

                                 ANNA
                        It was so cute!

                                 WES
                        That’s my ex-girlfriend, bro!

           Wes reaches for his gun when ANNA PULLS IT AND POINTS IT AT 
           WES - 

                                 ANNA
                        Looking for something?

           Everyone is SHOCKED that Anna has the gun.

                                 EDDIE
                        What the fuck?!

                                 ANGEL
                        That’s my bitch!
                                 WES
                             (to Anna)
                        You don’t scare me.

           Wes GRUNTS, and THRASHES THROUGH THE AIR TOWARD ANNA WHEN - 
           BANG.

                                 ANNA
                        I SHOT THE GUN! I SHOT THE GUN!

           Wes drops as blood spills from his chest. 

                                 WES
                             (shocked)
                        You shot me!?

           Eddie slowly climbs out of bed and starts towards the door 
           WHEN ANGEL JUMPS IN FRONT OF HIM AND KICKS HIM IN THE NUTS - 

                                 ANGEL
                        You ain’t goin’ nowhere!

           Eddie HOWLS and collapses in the doorway. 

           NURSES rush into the room--it takes five of them to lift Wes 
           onto a stretcher and whisk him out.

           Anna points the gun at Eddie.

                                 EDDIE
                        Don’t shoot!

                                 ANNA
                        No need! This is a citizen’s 
                        arrest! 

           INT. MOUNT SINAI MEDICAL CENTER - MOMENTS LATER

           Angel wheels Eddie out of the hospital in a wheelchair. 

                                 NURSE
                        Uh, excuse me! Mr. Charrow is not 
                        clear to be released from surgery 
                        yet! 

           Anna points the gun at the nurse. 

                                 ANNA
                        Yes, he is. 

                                 ANGEL
                             (off the nurse’s fear)
                        It’s okay, she’s a doctor.
           Eddie looks grim.

           INT. MIAMI BEACH POLICE DEPARTMENT - LATE MORNING

           The department SWARMS WITH ACTIVITY as Cal furiously stares 
           at the Chinese model. 

                                 CAL 
                             (hisses)
                        You broke into Eddie’s house?!

                                 TY
                        Yeah, I did. And guess what? Anna 
                        Rockport was telling the truth! 
                             (re: the model)
                        She was hiding in Eddie’s closet.

                                 CAL
                        Illegally obtained evidence is 
                        inadmissable.

                                 ANNA (O.S.)
                        Ours isn’t. 

           Cal and Ty and the Chinese model STAGGER IN SHOCK when they 
           see Anna and Angel wheel Eddie inside as - 

           Irina leads the sexiest single-file-evidence-line of all time 
           with Ray as the caboose.

                                 ANGEL
                             (mouths to the cops)
                        Suck it, pigs.

                                 ANNA
                        Eddie here wants to make a 
                        confession.

                                 EDDIE
                        No, I don’t.

           All the BOYS IN THE DEPARTMENT cream their blues as the 
           stately CHIEF OF POLICE, 55, walks over, agitated. 

                                 CHIEF
                             (to Anna)
                        Ma’am who are all these...very 
                        young girls who do not appear to be 
                        lost or selling cookies?

                                 RAY
                        Cal knows who they are. 
           The Chief stares at Cal.

                                 CAL
                        I’ll talk if I can keep my pension!

                                 RAY
                        I’ll talk if you drop the felony 
                        charge that prevents me from 
                        getting a job! 
                             (off Angel’s look)
                        Long story--I took a hit for Wes.

           Eddie puts his head in his hands.

           EXT. TIKI BAR - SOUTH BEACH - AFTERNOON

           Anna, Angel, and Irina sip celebratory craft cocktails. 

           Anna slathers Irina’s face with sunscreen. 

                                 ANNA
                        Irina, the first thing you’re going 
                        to need to assimilate to Miami life 
                        is an oil-free sunscreen with a one-
                        hundred SPF.  

                                 ANGEL
                        Then you’re gonna need an big pair 
                        of shades so you can tune out when 
                        people talk.

           Angel puts on a pair of sunglasses on Irina.

           Irina LAUGHS.

                                 IRINA
                        You girls are too much.
                             (beat, hopeful)
                        Maybe one day my family come here 
                        and meet both of you? 
                             (to Angel)
                        Mom and dad are very accepting. 
                             (to Anna)
                        And sisters are very well behaved.

                           ANGEL
                                                          ANNA
           Sure.
                                              Ohmygod, that would be 
                                              awesome! 

           Suddenly Irina GASPS and points to the TV.
                                 IRINA (CONT’D)
                        Look!

           The girls turn to watch Eddie’s arrest on the NEWS.

                                 REPORTER ON TV
                        A pillar of the South Beach 
                        community was arrested this 
                        afternoon on multiple felony 
                        counts: kidnapping, human 
                        trafficking, murder, and sexual 
                        harassment. And one count of 
                        revenge porn...

           CLOSE ON THE TV: THE POLICE ARREST EDDIE BUT THE GIRLS ARE 
           CROPPED OUT OF EVERY SHOT - 

                                 IRINA
                             (outraged)
                        They leave out real heroes--us!

                                 ANNA
                        Have you ever heard the expression, 
                        Virtue is its own reward?

           Irina shakes her head, no.

                                 ANGEL
                        Speaking of rewards...

           Anna slips Angel a check for five grand.

                                 ANNA
                             (can’t help herself)
                        “I think you got a lotta potential, 
                        Kit DeLuca... Don’t let nobody tell 
                        you different.”

           Angel looks like she might strangle Anna, but instead BURSTS 
           OUT LAUGHING. 

                                 IRINA
                        Who is Kit DeLuca?

           Anna and Angel stare at each other--Seriously?!

                                 ANNA
                        Irina, I’m going to have to write 
                        you a prescription for a slumber 
                        party!

           Angel’s eye roll turns to a genuine smile as we - 

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           FINAL SCENE 

           ANNA, ANGEL, AND IRINA PLAY NEVER HAVE I EVER

           ANNA, ANGEL, AND IRINA WEARING GREEN FACIAL MASKS MAKE 
           UNBELIEVABLE ICE-CREAM SUNDAES 

           ANNA, ANGEL, AND IRINA DO EACH OTHER’S NAILS

           ANNA TAKES HER UROLOGY WORK THINGS (DIPLOMAS, ETC.) OUT OF 
           THE BOX AND SHOWS ANGEL AND IRINA -- THEY’RE IMPRESSED 

           ANNA, ANGEL, AND IRINA FALL INTO ANNA’S BED AND FALL ASLEEP

           CHYRON: ONE YEAR LATER 

           INT. CROWDED YOGA STUDIO - DAY

           Anna, wearing a brightly colored Lululemon ensemble (instead 
           of her usual black) flows through a tough warrior sequence 
           while lusting after the glistening shirtless YOGA BRO, 30s, 
           on her right, when the cute but dorky first timer in front of 
           her, COLLIN, 40, attempts a standing split and KICKS ANNA, 
           who’s successfully holding the pose, IN THE FACE. 

           Anna plugs her bloody nose, runs from the room, quickly 
           closes the door behind her, and SCREAMS.

           A concerned Collin runs after her. 

                                 COLLIN
                        Ohmygod, are you alright?

           Anna tilts her head back and applies pressure to her nose 
           with her hand towel. 

                                 ANNA
                             (snarky to keep from 
                              crying)
                        It’s not broken, but I’ll probably 
                        have to withdraw my Miss America 
                        application...

                                 COLLIN
                        Thank you for making a joke. 
                             (off Anna’s slight 
                              disappointment)
                        I’m really sorry. I’ve never done 
                        yoga before... 
                                 (MORE)
                                 COLLIN (CONT'D)
                        To be honest, I’m only here cause 
                        my buddy said it’s a great place to 
                        meet people...

           Anna notices Collin is contrite... and cute.

                                 ANNA
                        Actually, I’ve heard that too, but 
                        I’ve been a yogi for years--

                                 COLLIN
                        --I can tell, you’re very graceful--

                                 ANNA
                        --And nothing. 
                             (blushes)
                        Oh, thank you. 
                             (beat)
                        I excel at sports without balls or 
                        teammates. 

           They both sort of laugh as a bloody snot gob falls from 
           Anna’s nose onto her clavicle. 

                                 COLLIN
                             (not phased)
                        Oh, you have a bit of mucus--

           He takes Anna’s towel and delicately wipes the snot gob off.

                                 ANNA
                             (impressed)
                        What do you do that you’re so 
                        composed around bodily fluids?

                                 COLLIN
                             (nervous)
                        ...I’m a gynecologist. Which is 
                        probably why I’m single... Though 
                        my partner--the buddy who 
                        recommended yoga--has a new, 
                        scarily hot girlfriend every week, 
                        so, maybe it’s just me...

           Anna’s mouth drops, surprised and elated. 

                                 ANNA
                        Do you have plans tonight, Doctor?

           Beat. 

                                 COLLIN
                        Are you asking me out?
                                 ANNA
                        No, I’m laying the groundwork for 
                        you to ask me out.

           Collin smiles. 

                                 COLLIN
                        I see, well, I’m going to need your 
                        name first so I can do it properly. 

                                 ANNA
                        It’s Anna.

                                 COLLIN
                        Nice to meet you, Anna. I’m Collin.

           INT. MODEST SINGLE FAMILY HOME - CORAL GABLES - LIVING ROOM - 
           MIAMI - DAY

           Angel, in Miami matron-chic and clutching a tastefully 
           wrapped birthday gift, nervously squeezes a desk-job-
           uniformed Ray’s hand as KAYLA’S ADOPTED MOTHER, 45, an 
           earnest woman with mismanaged curls and an incipient fupa, 
           sets tea and biscotti on the coffee table. 

                                 MOM
                        Kayla, come downstairs. There’s 
                        someone here who wants to meet you.

           KAYLA, a pretty pre-teen with Angel’s eyes, prances down the 
           stairs.

           Tears stream down Angel’s face. 

                                 ANGEL
                        You’re so beautiful.

           Beat.

                                 KAYLA
                        Who are you?

           Angel looks at Ray who nods encouragingly. 

                                 RAY
                        You got this.

                                 ANGEL
                        I’m the one who keeps callin’ and 
                        hangin’ up. 
                             (off Kayla’s curiosity)
                        Kayla, I’m... your birth mother. 
           Kayla takes this in as Angel crouches down next to her.

                                 ANGEL (CONT’D)
                        I know I’m real late, and I’m sorry 
                        about that, but I want you to know, 
                        even though I haven’t been with you 
                        all these years, I think about you 
                        every day.
                             (off Kayla’s poker face)
                        Kayla, I’m doin’ good now, and I’d 
                        like to be a part of your life, if 
                        you’ll let me.

           Kayla’s quiet.

                                 MOM
                        Kayla, what do you say? Would you 
                        like to get to know your birth mom?

           Kayla, every bit Angel’s kid, sizes up Angel.

                                 KAYLA
                             (to Angel)
                        Cool, but you’re gonna have to earn  
                        my trust.  

                                 ANGEL/MOM
                        That’s my baby!/That’s my girl!

           Angel and Kayla’s mom stare at each other awkwardly. 

                                 ANGEL
                             (nervous laugh)
                        Oh, I’m, uh, sure she gets her 
                        smarts from you. 

                                 MOM
                        Oh, no, no. They’re genetic, of 
                        course.

           Ray fills the uncomfortable silence by crunching into a 
           biscotti. 

                                 RAY
                        Mmm this cook’s delicious. What’s 
                        in it? Hazelnut?

                                 MOM
                             (polite, to Ray)
                        That’s correct, Ray.
           EXT. UNIVERSITY OF MIAMI - PARENTS’ WEEKEND - DAY

           Irina, wearing a ripped Buzzcocks t-shirt dress that’s 
           cinched at the waist with a hot pink camo print belt and knee-
           length combat boots, escorts her proud MOM and DAD, wearing 
           matching U-Miami sweatshirts, and her excited little sisters, 
           Sonya and Zlata, around the campus. 

                                 MOM
                        Miami is little slice of heaven!

           Irina beams. 

                                 DAD
                        We are proud of you, Irishka, but 
                        you must make most of this 
                        opportunity. Have you picked major? 

                                 IRINA
                        Yes. I am pre-med and minoring in 
                        music, you know, for fun. 

                                 DAD
                             (laughs)
                        Fun? 
                             (shakes head, to mom)
                        She’s American already!

           Irina and Mom exchange a bemused glance. 

                                 MOM
                        Do you have boyfriend yet?

                                 IRINA
                        No. Boys are scared of me, which is 
                        not problem because I spend my time 
                        in library, at work, or rehearsing 
                        with my band. 

                                 ZLATA
                        You’re in a band?!

                                 IRINA
                        Yes, Zlata. I am singer. Cool huh?

                                 SONYA
                        So cool! What is your band called?

                                 IRINA

           INT. ROCKPORT MEDICAL GROUP - ANNA’S NON-PRETENTIOUS PRIVATE 
           PRACTICE - RECEPTION DESK - SUNNY ISLES BEACH - MIAMI - DAY

           Angel, now a drug rep, shows Irina, now Anna’s receptionist, 
           a foamy Rigidex stress ball--it’s shaped like an erect penis. 

           The giant, glass conch is displayed proudly on the reception 
           desk.

                                 ANGEL
                        ...And when you squeeze it the 
                        veins pop out!

           Angel squeezes the toy to illustrate. 

                                 ANGEL (CONT’D)
                        How baller is that? 
                             (beat)
                        My new shit, Rigidex, is the 
                        cocaine of Viagra. 

           Irina turns back to her textbooks. 

                                 IRINA
                        I can’t believe you have a 
                        boyfriend. 

                                 ANGEL
                        I can’t believe you have a green 
                        card. 

           Anna, in a white coat, escorts her HOT MALE PATIENT, 35, to 
           the door. 

                                 ANNA
                        Everything looks great, Ted. Ice 
                        your testicles tonight, take it 
                        easy for the next few days, and 
                        I’ll see you in six weeks to test 
                        your sperm count. 

           Angel and Irina give Ted a quick once-over, scribble on Post-
           its and turn them face down on the desk. 

                                 HOT PATIENT
                        Thanks, Doctor Rockport. 

           Ted leaves. Anna gives Angel and Irina a poker face. 

                                 ANNA
                        Let the games begin.

           Angel holds up her Post-it--3.5 x 5.
                                 ANGEL
                        Three and half by five.

           Irina holds up her Post-it--6 x 3.

                                 IRINA
                        Six by three.

           Anna does a DRUM ROLE on her knees.

                                 ANNA
                             (over the top)
                        Ladies and...ladies, today’s pecker 
                        was seven inches long with a three 
                        inch circumference which makes 
                        Irina our winner.

                                 ANGEL
                        You kiddin’ me? That guy had a 
                        total chode vibe.

                                 IRINA
                             (to Angel)
                        Pay up.

           Angel begrudgingly gives Irina twenty bucks. 

                                 ANNA
                        Irina, your dick-dar is going to 
                        put you through med school.

           The girls LAUGH. 

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        Oh, I almost forgot, I have a date 
                        tonight. 

                                 ANGEL/IRINA
                        Ooooooooh!

                                 ANNA
                        I know! He’s a gynecologist and I’m 
                        ninety percent sure he’s going to 
                        show up.

           INT. CUTE LITTLE ITALIAN PLACE - SOUTH BEACH - EVENING

           Anna and Collin are on their first date--eating the exact 
           same meal.

                                 COLLIN
                        You’re a urologist?
                                 ANNA
                        Guilty. 

                                 COLLIN
                        Why didn’t you tell me?

                                 ANNA
                        I already had a bloody nose. I 
                        didn’t need to make myself less 
                        attractive. Also, I thought maybe 
                        you knew. 
                             (off his confusion)
                        There was this incident last year 
                        that might ring a bell--my likeness 
                        unintentionally broke the 
                        internet... 
                             (thrilled, off his blank 
                              stare)
                        You have no idea what I’m talking 
                        about, do you?

                                 COLLIN
                        I’m not exactly mister social 
                        media. What did I miss?

                                 ANNA
                        Let’s save it for a rainy day. 
                             (quick)
                        Can I ask you something?

                                 COLLIN
                        That’s why I’m here. And to make 
                        sure you’re not a serial killer.

           Anna smiles--totally gets it.

                                 ANNA
                        What’s the hardest part of being a 
                        gynecologist? I’m curious to 
                        compare.

                                 COLLIN
                        Most of us would say being on call. 
                        For me it’s explaining to teenage 
                        girls that condoms don’t protects 
                        against STDs contacted via skin-to-
                        skin contact. It’s like, sorry, 
                        Santa’s not real, but your herpes 
                        is! 

           Collin sighs and Anna nods understandingly. 
                                 ANNA
                        There really is no such thing as 
                        completely safe sex. 

                                 COLLIN
                        Exactly. It should be called safer 
                        sex.

                                 ANNA
                        I like that. I’m going to use it.

                                 COLLIN
                        To be clear, I enjoy sex very much.

                                 ANNA
                             (blushes)
                        Oh. 
                             (why not)
                        Me too.

                                 COLLIN
                        I can get pretty wild once we’ve 
                        dotted the Is and crossed the Ts, 
                        if you know what I mean. 

           Anna giggles. 

                                 ANNA
                        I’m really glad you kicked me in 
                        the face, Collin.

                                 COLLIN
                        Me too.

           A gloved CLEANING WOMAN sweeping up last night’s party/”fire” 
           chaos picks up a highball glass and squints at it. She

                        What the?!

           But it’s snatched from her hand by a hungry SEA GULL. 

           WE FOLLOW THE SEAGULL as he soars across the sand, over the
