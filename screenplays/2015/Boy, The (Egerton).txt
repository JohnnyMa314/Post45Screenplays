           EXT. MEADOW - LATE AFTERNOON

           Upstate Washington. 

           Three girls in scarves and hats walk in a line through a wide 
           meadow toward a large wood. As they walk, the girls sing 
           “Itsy Bitsy Spider” complete with hand motions.

                                 GIRLS
                             (singing)
                        Itsy bitsy spider went up the water 
                        spout. Down came the rain and washed 
                        the spider out...

           REBECCA CLINE (12) tall and thin, confidently walks in the 
           lead. Behind her LILY WILSON (10),a head shorter than 
           Rebecca, follows eagerly. MARINA HESS (12) shyly takes up the 
           rear.

                                 YOUNG LILY
                        It’s colder than I thought. You think 
                        the lake will have ice?

                                 YOUNG REBECCA 
                        It’s not that cold, Lily.

                                 YOUNG LILY
                        Feels like it’s freezing.

           Marina looks up and sees four black birds gliding against the 
           sky.

           EXT. WOODS - LATE AFTERNOON

           The Three walk through the changing trees. The low sun 
           highlights the gold and orange of the autumn leaves. They 
           move casually, running hands along the trees.

           Lily mindlessly knocks a stick against the trees - tap, tap, 
           tap. She hums “Itsy Bitsy Spider.”

                                 YOUNG LILY
                        It’s even colder here.

                                 YOUNG REBECCA
                        We’re out of the sun, that’s all.

           They walk deeper into the woods. 

           --Wading through a drift of fallen leaves, kicking leaves and 
           laughing.
           --Balancing on a downed tree.

                                 YOUNG LILY
                        All the trees are dead.

                                 YOUNG REBECCA
                        They just look that way.

                                 YOUNG LILY
                        This one’s dead.

           --Lily and Rebecca peel the bark from a slender beech tree. 

           EXT. WOODS - BROOK - DUSK

           The three girls come to a shallow brook babbling over stones. 
           Lily and Rebecca toss rocks into the water. 

           Marina holds her palm to a tree, looking up its trunk at the 
           branches silhouetted against the dusky sky. 

                                 YOUNG LILY
                        Think all the animals are 
                        hibernating?

                                 YOUNG REBECCA
                        Sure. Most. Some are gone.

                                 YOUNG LILY
                        How do they know where to come back 
                        to? 

                                 YOUNG REBECCA
                        They listen.

           Rebecca picks up a fist-sized stone.

                                 YOUNG LILY
                        Yeah, but to what? I mean, wha--

           Rebecca slams the stone against the side of Lily’s head. Lily 
           stumbles sideways, into the water. She awkwardly trips to her 
           knees. 

           As Rebecca strides toward her, Lily tries to crawl through 
           the stream. Rebecca easily catches up to her and hits her 
           again with the rock. She grips Lily’s scarf from behind and 
           pulls it tight around her neck. She yanks Lily to her feet.

           Both girls face Marina who stands unmoving some feet away. 
           She holds a small black-handled paring knife in her hand. 

                                 YOUNG REBECCA
                        Do it. 
                                 YOUNG MARINA
                        You didn’t say it was today.

                                 YOUNG REBECCA
                        Do it, now!

                                 YOUNG MARINA
                        But...

           Lily’s hands pull at the scarf, then scratch at Rebecca’s 
           hair and face. Rebecca seems unaffected, though blood runs 
           down her face.

                                 YOUNG REBECCA
                        Do it, Marina. It’s what he wants. 
                        Now.

           Marina breathes. She grips the knife but has not moved.

                                 YOUNG REBECCA (CONT’D)
                        Now!

           ABOVE THE TREES four black birds fly against the sky. From 
           somewhere a child screams.

           EXT. WOODS - LATER

           Rebecca, blood on her hands, drags Lily by the feet, her head 
           bouncing along the path. 

           Marina follows, blank-faced.

           EXT. WOODS - LAKE BOWSMAN - SUNSET

           The sky glows orange and red as Rebecca drags Lily to the 
           water’s edge of the large lake. She looks to Marina with 
           fierce eyes.

                                 YOUNG REBECCA
                             (stern)
                        Touch her.

           Marina kneels by Lily and gently touches her palms to her 
           blood-soaked chest. The chest moves. 

                                 YOUNG MARINA
                        She’s still breathing...

                                 YOUNG REBECCA
                        It won’t be long now.
           Rebecca moves around the shore with businesslike proficiency. 
           From her backpack she pulls a baseball, a small pair of 
           antique wire-rimmed glasses, and an 1900’s-era school book 
           titled Every Boys Reader. She spreads the items on rocks 
           about the shore.  

           Lily is breathing. Her lips move, nearly imperceptibly. 
           Marina leans her ear close to Lily’s mouth. Lily whispers 
           something, but only Marina hears.

                                 REBECCA
                        Wet your hands.

           Rebecca kneels by Marina and pushes her hands firmly on 
           Lily’s chest. Lily releases a dry groan.

                                 REBECCA (CONT’D)
                        Give him blood and you’re his 
                        forever.

           Marina stands. 

                                 REBECCA (CONT’D)
                        The lake. You go.

           Rebecca pulls a pair of gardening hand clippers from her coat 
           and leans over Lily. She turns to Marina who is staring in 
           horror. 

                                 REBECCA (CONT’D)
                        Marina, move!

           Obediently, Marina heads to the lake, wading into the water 
           up to her waist. The quiet murmur of the forest echoes off 
           the water. 

           From the shore, Lily makes a sick cry and falls quiet. Marina 
           turns as Rebecca stands, holding something.  

           Rebecca opens her fist. She’s holding a severed pinky finger. 
           She lowers her open hand under the water. The finger floats 
           from her palm, drifting away like a twig.

                                 REBECCA (CONT’D)
                             (quiet)
                        Give the blood to the lake.

           The Girls put their palms flat down into the water. They 
           stand in the waters for a quiet moment. Nothing seems to 
           move. 

           Rebecca shatters the silence.
                                 REBECCA (CONT’D)
                             (Calling out)
                        You found us. You chose us. We did 
                        this for you. We did this for you.

           Her voice echoes against the water. 

           The sound of gravel shifting comes from the shore behind 
           them. Marina turns and sees Lily pulling herself away from 
           the lake and toward the trees.

                                 MARINA
                             (sotto)
                        Lily.

                                 REBECCA
                        There!

           Rebecca points to the trees on the far side of the lake. 

                                 REBECCA (CONT’D)
                        He’s there.

           Marina turns back, but lowers her head, watching the water.

                                 REBECCA (CONT’D)
                        Look!

                                 MARINA
                        Please, Rebecca.

                                 REBECCA
                        Look!

           Rebecca pulls Marina’s hair back forcing Marina to look. In 
           the shadows of the trees on the far shore of the lake stands 
           THE BOY - small, pale, dressed in an early 1900’s school 
           uniform.  

           Marina screams. 

           TITLE - THE BOY

           INT. JUVENILE DETENTION - DR. WARD’S OFFICE - MORNING

           Through a window we see GIRLS in detention uniforms playing 
           in the courtyard two stories below. We can just hear their 
           muffled high-pitched screams. 

                                 DR. WARD (O.S.)
                        Marina?
           Marina sits in a chair by the window watching the girls play, 
           her expression blank, her eyes dull. She is perhaps a year 
           older. A worn teddy bear hangs from her hand.

                                 DR. WARD (CONT’D)
                        Marina?

           DR. WARD, 30’s, sits halfway across the room, an open folder 
           on her lap. She’s professional and focused, her black hair 
           pulled into a bun. Her demeanor is no-nonsense, but her eyes 
           softened with compassion. She wears a small cross necklace.

           Her office is simple: a few chairs, some soft toys on a round 
           rug, wall painted a calming light green. Her cluttered desk 
           is pushed to a corner. Her Doctor of Psychology degree hangs 
           framed on the wall. 

                                 DR. WARD (CONT’D)
                        Let’s talk about the Boy again.

           Marina doesn’t react.

                                 DR. WARD (CONT’D)
                        You found him--

                                 MARINA
                        He found us. 

                                 DR. WARD
                        You found his picture on the 
                        internet. Did Rebecca find it on her 
                        own or were you there?

                                 MARINA
                        He found us.

           Dr. Ward rubs the bridge of her nose. 

                                 DR. WARD
                        We’ve discussed this--

                                 MARINA
                             (her voice rising)
                        He wrote us letters. Wrote us notes.

           The open folder in Dr. Ward’s lap has a black and white 
           picture of a 1900’s school boy. Dr. Ward thumbs through a few 
           handwritten notes in pencil and crayon: I choose you; Meet me 
           in the woods; I’ll never lie to you.  

                                 DR. WARD
                        Now, Marina.
                                 MARINA
                        His mother didn’t want him. He was 
                        gifted and his mother hated him. She 
                        murdered him. He told us. She wrapped 
                        him in bed sheets. She stuck him like 
                        a pig. She threw him in the lake.

                                 DR. WARD
                        The place you left Lily. The same 
                        lake.

                                 MARINA
                        He told us to. He told us... he 
                        needed blood. He said... He told us 
                        to do it.

                                 DR. WARD
                             (calm)
                        You know that’s not true, Marina. You 
                        know there is no Boy.

                                 MARINA
                        He wrote--

                                 DR. WARD
                        Rebecca wrote the notes. 

           Marina frowns. 

                                 DR. WARD (CONT’D)
                        I think you wrote some, too.

                                 MARINA
                        His mother--

                                 DR. WARD
                        I know. Threw him in Bowsman Lake. 
                        There’s no record of any drowning or 
                        any murder. Nothing. 

           Marina turns back to the window.

                                 DR. WARD (CONT’D)
                        You girls made it up. Just a story.

           Dr. Ward sighs and we understand this conversation has been 
           repeated several times.

                                 DR. WARD (CONT’D)
                        You know this, Marina. Rebecca 
                        confessed, under oath, that she wrote 
                        those letters. She lured you on. 
                        Sometimes the mind believes 
                        something, Marina. Believes it so 
                        much that--
           Marina SCREAMS, a sustained yell of fury. She jumps to her 
           feet, throwing down the teddy bear and slamming the chair to 
           the floor, continuing her scream. 

           Dr. Ward sighs again, unfazed. 

           Marina RUNS up to Dr. Ward, putting her face inches away from 
           her doctor’s. Her voice thunders.  

                                 MARINA
                        I SAW HIM!

           Dr. Ward, two years older, reads aloud from a folder. Marina, 
           now 14, pulls hard at her hair and squirms in her chair, as 
           if the words Dr. Ward reads burns her skin. 

                                 DR. WARD
                        Four entry wounds to the left 
                        shoulder. Two to the abdomen, 
                        puncturing the pancreas. Three more 
                        stabs--

                                 MARINA
                        No. No. No. 

           Dr. Ward reads over Marina’s continuing protests.

                                 DR. WARD
                        Three more stabs wounds were 
                        inflicted on the chest. While 
                        stabbing the chest the blade snapped 
                        inside the victim.

                                 MARINA
                        He told me to do it. The Boy. He 
                        claimed me! I’m his!

           Marina slips from the chair and curls in on herself, covering 
           her ears. Dr. Ward rushes to her, squats down and continues 
           to read. 

                                 DR. WARD
                        The victim's skull was fractured 
                        along the right side. 

           Marina twists her head, frantic like a trapped animal.

                                 MARINA
                             (yelling)
                        I did not do this! I did not do this! 
                        He made me! He will always find me!
                                 DR. WARD
                        Contusions and abrasions were present 
                        about the neck, eyes, and inner 
                        thighs. 

                                 MARINA
                        I don’t remember!

                                 DR. WARD
                        Do you remember her finger?

           Marina is shaking her head, but the words are getting 
           through.

                                 DR. WARD (CONT’D)
                        The pinky finger of the victim’s 
                        right hand was partially cut and 
                        eventually torn from the body.

           Marina is listening now. Listening to every word. Breathing 
           in hard. 

           Dr. Ward takes a glossy photo and shoves it in front of 
           Marina’s face. We can barely see the image of a mutilated 
           hand with a ragged stump at the pinky.

                                 DR. WARD (CONT’D)
                        Look! Look!

           Marina looks away. Dr. Ward grips Marina’s chin and turns her 
           head to the picture. 

                                 DR. WARD (CONT’D)
                        Look!

           Marina studies the photo. Dr. Ward drops it and reveals 
           another. And another. Marina watches each one, her face 
           growing looser, stranger as if only now realizing the scope 
           of her actions. 

           Marina locks eyes with Dr. Ward, her eyes blazing.

                                 MARINA
                             (quiet)
                        I did this? 

           Dr. Ward nods.

                                 MARINA (CONT’D)
                        I did this.
           EXT. JUVENILE DETENTION - YARD - DAY 

           Marina, now 18, walks alone in the crowded yard. Other 
           juvenile PRISONERS gather in groups talking and laughing. But 
           Marina keeps to herself. The other Prisoners hardly glance 
           her way.

           GUARDS stand watch. 

           Marina runs her hands along the fence. She looks up, watching 
           the overcast sky.

           INT. JUVENILE DETENTION - DR. WARD’S OFFICE - DAY

           Dr. Ward sits in her chair. Marina paces the room.

                                 DR. WARD
                        Self hallucination puts you in some 
                        company. William Blake, Hildegard of 
                        Bingen, hell, even Jim Morrison 
                        thought he had a dead shaman take 
                        over his soul. All of them believed 
                        in something enough to actually see 
                        it, feel it. Angels, spirits, demons. 

           Marina has wandered behind Dr. Ward and toward her desk. Dr. 
           Ward continues to face forward.

                                 MARINA
                        Did any of them stab someone?

                                 DR. WARD
                        Joan of Arc did. Hundreds. And they 
                        made her a saint.

                                 MARINA
                        Was that before or after burning her 
                        at the stake?

           Dr. Ward gives a wry smile. 

           Marina picks up a framed picture from Dr. Ward’s desk. A 
           photo of Dr. Ward and a MAN holding a smiling TODDLER. Marina 
           runs a finger along the silver frame.

                                 DR. WARD
                        Do you still see him?

           Marina shakes her head.

                                 MARINA
                        But sometimes I wish I did.
                             (looking up)
                                 (MORE)
                                 MARINA (CONT'D)
                        Is that crazy? I miss... believing in 
                        him.

           Dr. Ward turns in her seat and faces her. She shakes her 
           head.

                                 DR. WARD
                        Not crazy. People want to believe in 
                        something... or someone. Hell, I 
                        believed in Santa Claus till I was...
                             (beat)
                        I still believe in Santa Claus.

           Marina laughs a little.

                                 DR. WARD (CONT’D)
                        We all have faith in something. A 
                        religion, a person, a government, our 
                        own intellect. It’s part of being 
                        human.

           Marina catches sight of the silver cross around Dr. Ward’s 
           neck.

                                 MARINA
                        How do you know?

                                 DR. WARD
                        How do you know what?

                                 MARINA
                        How do you know if what you believe 
                        is real?

           Dr. Ward follows her gaze and touches her cross. 

                                 DR. WARD
                        You don’t.

           Dr. Ward reaches behind her neck and unclasps her necklace.

                                 DR. WARD (CONT’D)
                         You have to choose. 

           She hands places the necklace and silver cross in Marina’s 
           palm. 

           Marina looks from the cross to Dr. Ward. Dr. Ward smiles.

           INT. WASHINGTON STATE PRISON - MORNING

           Marina, now 28, lays in a prison top bunk in the near dark. 
           She dangles the silver cross above her, watching it spin.  
           A hard buzz echoes through the cell. Florescent lights 
           flicker to life filling the small cell with a sickly glow. 

           Marina’s CELL MATE stands, looking tired and mean. She smacks 
           Marina’s head, casual and cruel.  

                                 CELL MATE
                        Morning, freak. 

           INT. JUVENILE DETENTION - DR. WARD’S OFFICE - AFTERNOON

           Marina, wearing the cross, holds the same teddy bear she held 
           in the office 15 years before. It’s worn down, both bead eyes 
           now missing. Marina smiles sadly. 

           An older Dr. Ward leans back against her desk. 

                                 DR. WARD
                        So, how’s the big house? Any 
                        improvement on the food?

                                 MARINA
                             (chuckles)
                        Sure. The lobster bisque is 
                        outstanding. 

                                 DR. WARD
                        Good. Good. Are you getting along 
                        okay with the other women?

           Marina nods halfheartedly. 

                                 DR. WARD (CONT’D)
                        And the panic attacks.

                                 MARINA
                        All gone.

                                 DR. WARD
                        Good, good.

           Marina looks up from the teddy bear. 

                                 MARINA
                        They’re talking about releasing me. 
                             (beat)
                        I don’t think they should. I don’t 
                        deserve to be out. I...

           Marina’s breaks off and shakes her head.
                                 DR. WARD
                        You were a little girl, Marina. A 
                        confused little girl. Manipulated. 
                        Deceived. That’s not who you are now. 

           Marina looks down at the teddy bear. Then looks up.

                                 MARINA
                        I don’t want to go, okay? I’m afraid 
                        to leave. How sick is that, Doc? I’d 
                        rather stay locked up.

                                 DR. WARD
                             (walking toward her)
                        Hell, that’s not sick. It’d be a lot 
                        easier just to stay here. But, 
                        Marina, you stay here and the only 
                        thing you’ll have done with your life 
                        is stab Lily Wilson. That’s all.

           Marina turns to Dr. Ward.

                                 DR. WARD (CONT’D)
                        You have to do more with your life, 
                        Marina. You are meant for more.

                                 MARINA
                        How do you know that?

                                 DR. WARD
                             (smiling)
                        I choose to believe it.

           Marina hugs Dr. Ward.

                                 DR. WARD (CONT’D)
                        Now listen, a change in environment 
                        can sometimes result in a relapse.  

                                 MARINA
                        I know.

                                 DR. WARD
                        You’ll have my number. I want you to 
                        be prepared. Even if you experience 
                        some mild hallucinations. Hearing 
                        voices isn’t crazy...

                                 MARINA
                             (completing the sentence)
                        ... listening to them this. 
                             (smiling)
                        I understand. 

           Dr. Ward smiles.
                                 DR. WARD
                        Do you know who you’ll live with?

           EXT. WASHINGTON CORRECTIONS CENTER FOR WOMEN - DAY

           ALICE HESS smiles and bounces with excitement.

                                 MARINA (O.S.)
                        My sister, I suppose. 

           Alice, 25, has a carefree smile and the energy of an 
           extrovert. She stands smiling in the parking lot of the 
           Center as Marina, now in civilian clothes, exits the 
           building. 

           Marina appears nervous, uncertain. She tries to smile, but 
           looks like she might cry.

                                 MARINA (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        She’s the only family I have left. 
                        She and her son.

           Alice steps forward and embraces her sister in a long hug. 
           Marina looks both afraid of the hug and in desperate need of 
           someone to hold on to. 

           INT. ALICE’S TRUCK - DAY

           Marina watches the passing landscape as Alice’s old pickup 
           truck rolls through the Washington countryside. It’s late 
           autumn and the trees are a quilt of red and orange. Alice 
           chats away.

                                 ALICE
                        So Bryce is eight now. Eight and a 
                        quarter, he’ll insist. He’s a good 
                        kid, but hot damn, I started too 
                        early, you know? Never even hear from 
                        his dad, the asshole. But I’m dating 
                        again. Seeing this guy, Will. You’ll 
                        like him. Do you like chicken? My 
                        God, your first meal out and I didn’t 
                        even ask. Is roast chicken okay?

           Alice’s warmth is contagious and Marina smiles a little.

                                 MARINA
                        Sounds great.
           EXT. BOWSMAN - LATE AFTERNOON

           The car rolls through the small town of Bowsman. The town 
           looks a decade past its best years. The town square consists 
           of a handful of struggling stores, a diner, and a two-screen 
           movie theater all framing the hundred-year-old city hall 
           building.  

           A spire of an old stone church looms just beyond the houses. 
           Marina gazes from the truck’s window.

           INT. ALICE’S TRUCK - CONTINUOUS

           Alice nods out the window at the passing store fronts. Marina 
           blinks, taking it all in.

                                 ALICE
                        Not much has changed here. We had a 
                        Blockbuster. But that closed. I work 
                        at the diner these day. 

                                 MARINA
                        Why didn’t you leave?

                                 ALICE
                        I did a semester at State. But then, 
                        Bryce came along... you know how it 
                        is.
                             (beat)
                        It’s a good town.

           EXT. FARM HOUSE - MINUTES LATER

           Alice’s car pulls up to a large, old farm house on the 
           outskirts of town. The house appears to be in the midst of 
           refurbishing. The outside has some new, unpainted planks and 
           the large front door still has tape covering its frosted 
           glass window. 

                                 ALICE (O.S.)
                        The place was abandoned for years. 
                        Got it for a song. 

           The car comes to a halt under one of the large oaks adorning 
           the yard.

           As Alice and Marina step from the car, a large golden 
           retriever lopes around the corner, happily barking. He comes 
           right up to Marina. Marina kneels and scratches his ears.

                                 MARINA
                        He’s beautiful.
                                 ALICE
                        Followed Bryce home one day and that 
                        was that.

           Marina reads the metal tag on his leather dog collar.

                                 MARINA
                        Rolph.

                                 ALICE
                        Like the Muppet.

                                 MARINA
                             (scratching his head)
                        Hello, Rolph. Hello.

           INT. FOYER - MOMENTS LATER

           The stillness of the house holds for a moment before the door 
           swings open. Alice pushes in carrying Marina’s one bag. 
           Marina steps in slowly, feeling out the new space. 

           To her right is a partially furnished living room and to her 
           left a dining room. The rooms are large and still in the 
           midst of refurbishing. 

                                 ALICE
                        Bryce! Are you here, honey? Aunt 
                        Marina’s here. 
                             (to Marina)
                        He walks home from school. He’s 
                        usually back by now.
                             (calling out)
                        Bryce?

           Marina eyes the long staircase stretching to the second floor 
           landing. The banister is newly installed. Alice follows her 
           gaze.

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        I’ve done most of the work myself. 
                        Lot of trial and error... Mainly 
                        error. I’ve hired a few craftsmen for 
                        the bigger jobs. That’s how I met 
                        Will. Plumber extraordinaire. 
                             (heading to the stairs)
                        I’ll show you your room.

           INT. MARINA’S ROOM - MINUTES LATER

           Alice opens the door and holds it open, presenting the room 
           to Marina.
                                 ALICE
                        Here it is.

           It’s a simple, cozy room with a full-sized bed and a window 
           looking out on a nearby meadow. Marina steps in and moves 
           toward the window. 

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        Plenty of closest space. I put some 
                        of my old stuff in there if you want. 
                        There’s a mall out by the interstate. 
                        You like it? 

           Marina turns from the window and nods. 

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        Well, I’ll let you settle in and I’ll 
                        get the fore-told chicken going.

           Alice starts to back out.

                                 MARINA
                        Alice.
                             (beat)
                        Thanks. For all of this.

           Alice smiles and pulls the door closed after her. 

           Marina turns back to the window. The meadow looks very 
           similar to the one Marina walked across with Lily and Rebecca 
           as children. Could be the exact meadow. 

           Behind Marina the bedroom door opens, slowly and silently. 

           Marina watches the meadow, lost in thought. In the reflection 
           of the glass the hazy image of a child can be seen standing 
           in the open door. 

           Marina catches sight of the image. She spins, gasping. 
           Nothing but the open the door...

           She turns back to the window. Nothing in the reflection. She 
           looks to the side and sees BRYCE standing by the wall, 
           staring. She yelps.

           Bryce is eight years old, a little on the thin side, with 
           dark intelligent eyes. Marina catches her breath.  

                                 MARINA (CONT’D)
                        You startled me. 
                             (smiling)
                        You must be Bryce. I’m your mom’s 
                        sister, Marina. Or, Aunt Marina, I 
                        guess.
                                 BRYCE
                        I like your room.

                                 MARINA
                        Me too.

                                 BRYCE
                        Mom says you were in a special 
                        school. An art school in England. And 
                        it was too expensive to ever visit 
                        before.

           Marina is at a loss of how to respond.

                                 BRYCE (CONT’D)
                        Are you going to live with us?

                                 MARINA
                        Yes. For a little while. Is that all 
                        right with you?

           Bryce thinks. Then nods.

                                 BRYCE
                        I think I can handle that. 

           Marina smiles. 

           INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           Marina, Alice, and Bryce sit around the dining room table. 
           Alice dishes a last scoop of mash potatoes on to Bryce’s 
           plate. 

                                 ALICE
                        I’m relatively certain I broke zero 
                        health code violations. So, dig in.

           Bryce chuckles. He and Alice take their first bites.

                                 MARINA
                             (quietly)
                        Thank you Father for this food and 
                        for the hands that prepared it.

           Bryce and Marina freeze mid bite and share a look.

                                 MARINA (CONT’D)
                        Amen.

                                 ALICE
                        Amen.
                                 BRYCE
                             (with his mouthful)
                        Amen.

           Marina smiles bashfully. Alice laughs.

           INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Marina and Alice stand by the sink washing and drying the 
           night’s dishes. 

           The lights flicker, but remain on. Alice shrugs.

                                 ALICE
                        I got a deal on the wiring. It’s on-
                        again, off-again, like my love life.

           Alice chuckles. Marina smiles awkwardly. 

           A quite beat... Alice looks for a way to ease the tension.

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                             (to Marina)
                        So what’s on the to-do list?

                                 MARINA
                        Find a job, I suppose. Maybe school, 
                        eventually. 

                                 ALICE
                             (chuckling)
                        No, no. I mean, fun stuff. Stuff you 
                        missed.  

                                 MARINA
                        Oh. I don’t know...

                                 ALICE
                        Roller coasters, tequila... 
                             (quieter)
                        A vibrator. 

           Marina blushes, smiling a little. 

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        There’s got to be something you 
                        dreamed of doing.

           Marina smiles.

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        Yeah?
                                 MARINA
                        A bath.

                                 ALICE
                        A bath?

                                 MARINA
                        A bath all alone. Not a shower. A 
                        bath. No one watching. No one telling 
                        you time is up. 

           Marina smiles and returns her eyes to the plate she’s drying. 
           Alice takes the plate from Marina’s hand. 

                                 ALICE
                        We’ve got tank of hot water and claw 
                        foot tub.

           Marina opens her mouth to protest.

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        I got this. Go crazy.  

           Marina smiles.

           INT. BATHROOM - LATER

           --Rushing water from a tap. 

           --Marina dips her fingers to check the temperature of the 
           steaming bath. 

           --Marina lowers herself into the water.

           Marina lays in the water, her eyes closed. The drip of the 
           faucet echoes through the small room. Marina runs her hands 
           through her hair and drops her head back and under the water. 

           When she reemerges, the Boy is standing by the wall behind 
           her. His eyes are focused on her. 

           Marina senses something in the room. She breathes steadily 
           and closes her eyes.

                                 MARINA
                             (sotto)
                        Not real. Not real. I don’t believe 
                        in you.

           She opens her eyes and slowly turns. Nothing is there. 

           She breathes a sigh of relief and turns back to see Lily, as 
           bloody and beaten as she was when Marina last saw her, 
           sitting in the bath with her. Lily smiles.
           --Marina OPENS her eyes, waking from the nightmare. She scans 
           the room, bewildered. 

           KNOCK on the door.

                                 ALICE (O.S.)
                        See you in the morning. Sleep in as 
                        long as you want.

                                 MARINA
                        Yeah. Thanks. 

           INT. MARINA’S BEDROOM - MORNING 

           A gentle knock on the door. Alice cracks the door open 
           holding a tray with a coffee cup and some cream and sugar.

                                 ALICE
                        Good morning. Whoa.

           Marina is fully dressed. Her bed is made perfectly.

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        You could have slept in, you know.

                                 MARINA
                             (slight smile)
                        I tried. Still on prison time.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

           The living room lays just to the right of the foyer. The 
           sparse second hand furniture is cozy if worn. 

           Marina sits on a couch flipping through a large photo album. 
           In the front are a few old pictures of young Marina with her 
           sister and parents. But the rest of the album is filled with 
           pictures of her parents and Alice. Vacations, graduations, 
           anniversary parties - the life Marina missed. 

           She stops on a sweet picture of her parents and a teenage 
           Alice on a forest path. She touches the picture.

                                 ALICE (O.S.)
                        I’m sorry Mom and Dad aren’t around 
                        to see this. 

           Marina looks up to see her sister leaning against the frame 
           between the living room and foyer.

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        They always looked forward to you 
                        coming home.
           Alice smiles warmly. And Marina nods.

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        I wish I’d visit more. Mom and Dad... 
                        they wanted things to be as normal as 
                        they could be for me. As if there was 
                        such a thing as normal. 

                                 MARINA
                        I understand. They were looking out 
                        for you.

           Bryce, chased by a barking Rolph, runs through the foyer 
           behind Alice. He throws open the front door. 

                                 ALICE
                             (calling after him)
                        Zip your coat! It’s freezing out 
                        there.

           Alice closes the door behind him.

                                 MARINA
                        Art school in England, huh?

           Alice cringes, embarrassed. She glances toward the front 
           door, as if to be sure Bryce is out of earshot.  

                                 ALICE
                        I thought that would be... easier. On 
                        everyone. 
                             (beat)
                        I just want to protect him. And you. 
                        So I made up a story. Is that okay?

                                 MARINA
                        Sure. 
                             (smiles)
                        Until he sees me draw. 

           Alice laughs and returns toward the kitchen. 

           Marina’s smile fades, she returns to the photo. In the 
           background of the photo, standing in the trees, is the Boy. 

           Marina looks up to Alice, but she’s already left. She looks 
           down again, and the Boy is no longer in the picture. 

                                 MARINA (CONT’D)
                             (closing her eyes)
                        Not real. I don’t believe in you. I 
                        don’t.
           EXT. FARM HOUSE - BACK YARD - DAY

           Bryce kicks a soccer ball in the backyard. Rolph jumps around 
           the ball, barking.

           INT. KITCHEN - DAY

           A black-handled paring knife chops carrots.

           Alice stands at the counter chopping. 

                                 ALICE
                        So, I don’t know, this Will guy. I 
                        mean, I like him. But that’s usually 
                        a sure sign the guy’s an asshole. 

           RING. Alice fishes her cell from her back pocket.

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        Speak of the devil.

                                 MARINA
                        I’ll take over.

                                 ALICE
                        Oh, thanks.

           Alice hands Marina the knife and answers the phone.

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                             (on the phone)
                        Will?... Yeah... No, we can wait a 
                        bit... Yeah, wine sounds good...

           Marina looks at the knife in her hand. A slight fear lights 
           her face. She shakes it off and begins chopping the carrots.

           INT. FARM HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           Alice and Marina laugh, sitting around the dinner table in 
           the low lit room just off the foyer. They sip wine as they 
           listen to a story from WILL, mid 20’s, broad-shouldered, 
           handsome, and charming.

                                 WILL
                        I told, I told him twice, you have to 
                        pump the thing or your whole house 
                        will smell like that. But this guy, 
                        some big shot lawyer or something, 
                        ain’t gonna take advice from some 
                        hick, right? Fine by me.
                                 ALICE
                             (giggling)
                        Fine by you. Yeah.

           Bryce drinks from a glass of milk and watches the adults with 
           curiosity.

           With the wine and laughter, Marina seems much more relaxed. 
           As she laughs, she affectionately touches her sister’s arm.

                                 WILL
                        Fine by me. I get paid and go. But 
                        two weeks later...

                                 ALICE
                        Oh no.

           Will refills his wine glass as he continues his story.

                                 WILL
                        Just two weeks later and this guy 
                        calls me at three in the morning. ‘Oh 
                        Jesus, oh Jesus! Everything smells 
                        like shit!’ 

           Everyone laughs, including Bryce. Alice unsuccessfully tries 
           to swallow her laugh.

                                 ALICE
                        Hey, Will! Language.

                                 WILL
                        Right. Like, what, poop?

                                 ALICE
                        Better.

                                 WILL
                        Everything smells like a shit-load of 
                        poop. 

           Bryce cackles. Alice nearly spits her out her wine in 
           laughing. Marina does too.  

                                 ALICE
                        Okay, okay. Story time’s over.
                             (to Bryce)
                        And you, sir, are due in bed a half-
                        hour ago.

                                 BRYCE
                        Already? It’s a special day.

                                 WILL
                        No arguing, sport. Up you go.
           Bryce groans as he stands and heads out of the room.

                                 WILL (CONT’D)
                        Whoa, little man. Forgetting 
                        something? Put ‘em up.

           Bryce returns, smiling indulgently, and puts up his fists. He 
           and Will exchange mock blows.

                                 WILL (CONT’D)
                        He goes for the chin, the gut, the 
                        chin. Don’t forget the knees. A kick 
                        in the knee brings the biggest man 
                        down.

                                 ALICE
                        Okay, okay. Enough cage match. 

           Will laughs and puts out a fist to bump with Will. They bump 
           and mime fist explosions.

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        And your aunt?

           Bryce turns to Marina and puts out a fist. Marina looks a 
           little confused, but makes a fist and bangs it. She doesn’t 
           mime the best explosion, but Bryce seems satisfied. He smiles 
           and runs off.

                                 MARINA
                        Good night.

           Alice smiles and follows after him, calling back. 

                                 ALICE
                        There’s another bottle if we need it.

                                 WILL
                             (opening a new bottle)
                        On it.

           Will moves to fill Marina’s wine glass. But Marina puts up a 
           hand.

                                 MARINA
                        No. I better not. This is, you know, 
                        my first drink ever and I’m feeling 
                        pretty dizzy.

           Will fills the glass anyway. 

                                 WILL
                        Come on. Like the kid said, special 
                        day.
           Marina smiles shyly and takes a sip of her wine. Will smiles 
           at her for a beat.

                                 WILL (CONT’D)
                        Must feel pretty good to be out, huh?

                                 MARINA
                        Strange, more than anything. I keep 
                        waiting for someone to tell me what 
                        to do.

                                 WILL
                             (smiling)
                        Ah, give Alice a day or two. She’ll 
                        start ordering you around. She’ll 
                        probably have you sanding the stairs 
                        tomorrow. 

           Marina laughs and sips more of her wine. Will takes a large 
           swig.

                                 WILL (CONT’D)
                        So what’s next for you?

                                 MARINA
                        Not sure. Apply for jobs, I suppose.

                                 WILL
                             (laughing)
                        Well, no one’s going to call your 
                        resume boring. 

           Will notices Marina’s smile disappear.

                                 WILL (CONT’D)
                        Sorry, was that rude?

           Marina looks down.

                                 WILL (CONT’D)
                             (shaking his head)
                        That was rude. Just trying to ease 
                        the tension.
                             (beat)
                        You think about it much?

                                 MARINA
                        I don’t really remember.

                                 WILL
                        Sure. It was a long time ago. But you 
                        remember some of it, right? I mean, 
                        it happened less than a mile from 
                        here. Just over--
                                 MARINA
                        I’d rather not--

                                 WILL
                        Oh, I’m sorry. Of course. It’s 
                        just... I’m kind of a true crime 
                        buff. Just wolf those books down, you 
                        know, the Andrea Yates case, Bundy, 
                        all of it. So talking with you is 
                        like talking to a celebrity. I mean, 
                        I know they kept most of the details 
                        out of the press. There was that long 
                        piece in the Times. Did you read 
                        that?

                                 MARINA
                        I haven’t read anything.

           Marina glances to the stairs, looking for her sister. 

           There’s no malice is Will’s tone. He’s simply oblivious to 
           Marina’s discomfort. He gulps some more wine and refills his 
           glass. 

                                 WILL
                        There was one book. Blood in the 
                        Woods. Pretty trashy. Came out 
                        fifteen years back. Ever read it? 

                                 MARINA
                        Please, I--

                                 WILL
                        It was full of all kinds of rumors 
                        about you being abused and crap like 
                        that. I hope your parents never read 
                        it. Had a good chapter on the Boy. 
                        Something about a manifestation of 
                        repressed homo-erotic desire. Kind of 
                        fun. 

                                 MARINA
                        Please...

                                 WILL
                        Lots of mumbo-jumbo about 
                        menstruation guilt. What was it you 
                        said about him in the trial? 
                             (deeper voice)
                        ‘Give him blood and you’re his 
                        forever.’ 
                             (chuckling)
                        Was that it?  
           Marina grips the table. Will only now notices Marina’s 
           unease.

                                 WILL (CONT’D)
                        Hey, you okay?

                                 ALICE
                        What’s going on?

           Alice is standing in the doorway looking at Marina.

                                 WILL
                        We’re just talking.

                                 ALICE
                        Damn it, Will. I told you not to 
                        bring it up.

           Alice moves to Marina’s side, glaring at Will.

                                 WILL
                        I didn’t... I mean, it just came up. 

                                 MARINA
                             (quiet)
                        I’m okay. I’m just going to go to 
                        bed.

                                 WILL
                        Hey, I’m sorry. I’m a little drunk, I 
                        guess. I’m sorry.

           Marina is already heading for the stairs. 

                                 ALICE
                        Good night. 

           Marina heads to the foyer and the stairs. 

           INT. FARM HOUSE - STAIRS - CONTINUOUS

           As Marina climbs the stairs she hears Alice berate Will.

                                 ALICE
                        Jesus, I can’t believe you...

                                 WILL
                        What? She probably wants to talk 
                        about it. 

           Marina turns at the top of the stairs and sees Bryce in his 
           pajamas standing, listening to the conversations below. He 
           looks at her with frightened eyes. Marina opens her mouth to 
           speak, but Bryce runs to his room and slams the door.
           INT. MARINA’S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Marina closes the door behind her, blocking out the bickering 
           of Alice and Will. The room is still, quiet. Marina sits on 
           the bed and breathes deeply. Her face trembles and she 
           squeezes back tears.

           KNOCK KNOCK.

           Alice cracks the door open.

                                 ALICE
                        You okay?

           Marina nods, wiping her eyes dry. 

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        He can be really annoying I know. But 
                        he’s a good guy. Bryce loves him.

                                 MARINA
                        It’s okay, really. I’m just tired. 

                                 ALICE
                        Okay. Okay. If I’m gone when you 
                        wake, the fridge is stocked. Okay? 

           Alice backs out of the room, closing the door behind her.

           INT. MARINA’S ROOM - LATER

           The room is dark. Marina lays asleep under the sheets. Her 
           eyes POP open. She rolls over to face the door. It is now 
           OPEN. She breathes deeply, watching, watching. 

           She turns away and sits up, placing her feet on the floor. 
           Behind her a small figure RACES passed the door. We hear the 
           patter of feet.

           Marina turns and looks at the open door.

           INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Marina tightens the robe around her as she walks down the 
           shadowy 2nd floor hallway. The old floorboards creak with 
           every step.

           INT. LANDING - MOMENTS LATER

           Low growling.
           Marina moves to the landing and looks down into the foyer. 
           Roplh stands in the glow of the foyer’s one lamp. He points 
           his body into the shadows of the living room, a menacing 
           growl emanating from his clenched jaw. 

                                 MARINA
                             (quietly calling)
                        Rolph?

           The dog looks up at her, whines, and trots off to the back of 
           the house. 

           Marina watches the foyer.

                                 MARINA (CONT’D)
                        Alice?

           Nothing. 

           She continues down the stairs.

           INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Marina doesn’t turn on the light. She quietly walks to the 
           cabinet and retrieves a glass. Then walks to the fridge.

           Marina opens the fridge shedding a slice of light over the 
           dark room. Marina pulls a jug of water out and lets the 
           fridge door swing closed. 

           She fills her glass and reopens the door. The same slice of 
           light now reveals Bryce. He watches as she closes the door. 

           The room is dark.

                                 BRYCE
                             (whisper)
                        Marina?

           Marina SCREAMS and throws the glass to the floor. It 
           shatters.

           Rolph runs into the room and positions himself between Marina 
           and Bryce. He barks at Marina.

           Alice rushes into the kitchen wearing a night shirt and sees 
           Bryce crying, terrified. 

                                 ALICE
                        Jesus!

           She turns on the light and scoops the crying Bryce into her 
           arms.
                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        Rolph, down!

           The dog calms down and trots to Alice’s side. Marina tries 
           regain her composure. 

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        What happened?

           She looks at Marina with questioning eyes, a little 
           accusatory. 

                                 MARINA
                        I was startled. I’m didn’t mean to 
                        yell. I...

           Marina reaches a hand to Bryce, but he pulls away.

                                 ALICE
                        Okay. Let’s just all get some sleep.

                                 MARINA
                        I’ll clean this up.

                                 ALICE
                        No, no. I’ll get it in the morning. 

           Alice hushes Bryce as she carries him from the room. 

           Marina watches them go.

                                 MARINA
                             (quietly)
                        I really am sorry.

           Marina takes a step and winces. She lifts her foot. A small 
           chunk of glass is in the bottom of her foot. 

           INT. BATHROOM - MINUTES LATER

           Marina stands before the mirrored medicine cabinet looking at 
           her reflection. The bathroom is empty behind her.

           She opens it and roots around, finally pulling out a box of 
           band-aids. She closes the medicine cabinet. She sighs at her 
           reflection and turns.

           INT. MARINA’S ROOM - MINUTES LATER

           Marina steps inside her room and closes the door. She leans 
           against the door for a moment breathing in deeply. She turns 
           and walks to her bed.
           On her pillow lays a folded piece of construction paper. 
           Marina stops. She looks around the room. It’s empty.

           She takes a step, slowly. Then quickly snatches up the paper. 
           She waits a moment before opening it. 

           There in childish scrawl are the words:

           I FOUND YOU.

           INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

           Marina sits at the breakfast table sipping coffee while Alice 
           sweeps up the last of the glass. The note lays on the table.

                                 ALICE
                        He must have put it there before he 
                        left. I’m sure he meant it as a joke. 

                                 MARINA
                        It wasn’t there when I went to bed.

                                 ALICE
                        Maybe it was under your pillow or 
                        something. I don’t know. I’ll talk to 
                        him.

                                 MARINA
                             (quiet)
                        It’s his handwriting. 

           Alice dumps the dustpan into the trash and doesn’t hear 
           Marina’s last word. Alice surveys the floor, looking tired. 
           She glances at her sister, who is studying the note again.

                                 ALICE
                        Look, I’m taking Bryce to school. I 
                        tried to take the day off, but the 
                        other waitress had a grandma die or 
                        something. Bryce usually hangs at the 
                        library. I’ll pick him up on my way 
                        home. 

                                 MARINA
                        You’re leaving?

                                 ALICE
                        I’ll be back by six. Six thirty at 
                        the latest.
                             (walking from the room)
                        If you want something to do, the 
                        banister on the stairs needs sanding.
           INT. ALICE’S CAR - MORNING

           Alice drives, glancing at Bryce sitting in the backseat. 

                                 ALICE
                        I can bring home some day-olds, if 
                        you want. Apple pie for dessert?

                                 BRYCE
                        Sure.
                             (beat)
                        Mom. Did Aunt Marina do something 
                        bad?

           Alice looks at Bryce through the mirror, then back at the 
           road. 

                                 ALICE
                        Why do you ask?

                                 BRYCE
                        What did she do?

                                 ALICE
                        Nothing, Bryce.

                                 BRYCE
                        They wouldn’t let her out. 

                                 ALICE
                        I told you. She was in art school. A 
                        very special school far away.

           Bryce thinks.

                                 BRYCE
                        Mom. Who’s the Boy? 

           Alice’s brow bends.

                                 ALICE
                        I don’t know what you’re talking 
                        about.

           Bryce frowns and looks out the window.

           INT. STAIRS - DAY

           Marina runs an electric sander along the farm house banister. 
           She pushes in long strokes, clearly pleased to be losing 
           herself in work. 
           The sander unexpectedly clicks off. Marina glances down the 
           stairs and sees the cord laying unplugged in the foyer next 
           to the old fashioned wall heating grate. The cord has plenty 
           of slack.

           Marina walks down the steps. She looks to the living room and 
           dining room, then kneels and plugs in the cord. The sander 
           buzzes to life. Marina jumps up the stairs and picks it up. 

           Just as she gets started it stops again. The cord is once 
           more laying free of the plug. 

           Marina walks down, kneels and examines the plug. She looks 
           back to the sander, confused. She looks back to the plug.

           Two eyes stare from the wall heating grate - a small, 
           shadowed face.

           Marina jerks away falling. 

           Beside her the front door opens. 

           Will pops his head in. She looks up at him from the floor.

                                 WILL
                        Hey. Whoa.

           She looks back to the vent. Nothing is there. 

           Will follows her gaze and glances at in the grate. He looks 
           back to Marina.

                                 WILL (CONT’D)
                        You okay?

           INT. KITCHEN - DAY

           The kettle whistle whines. 

           Will notices Marina’s shaking hands as she pours hot water 
           into a teapot. 

                                 WILL
                        Sorry again about last night. I was, 
                        let’s see, how did Alice put it? 
                        Inappropriate. 

                                 MARINA
                        Yes.

                                 WILL
                        I just get a little star struck. 

           Marina faces him, her arms crossed. 
                                 WILL (CONT’D)
                        Oh, I, ah, brought you something.

           Will fishes something from his jacket.

                                 WILL (CONT’D)
                        Thought you might be interested.

           Marina turns to see Will drop a worn paperback title of Blood 
           in the Woods on the table. It looks to be an exploitative 
           true-crime book. The cover shows a grainy picture of a young 
           Marina and Rebecca. 

                                 WILL (CONT’D)
                        First edition.

           INT. LIBRARY - DAY

           The small town library has a few clientele wandering the 
           aisles. The librarian, MRS. BELLOWS -- late-twenties, petite, 
           prim, but kind-eyed -- replaces books on the shelves.   

           Against the wall at the end of the aisle, Bryce sits in a 
           beanbag chair. He’s half-reading a book, clearly distracted. 

           Mrs. Bellows notices his lost gaze. She holds up a book with 
           a torn cover.

                                 MRS. BELLOWS
                        It’s a tragedy how people treat 
                        library books.

           Bryce looks up at her.

                                 MRS. BELLOWS (CONT’D)
                        The problem is, we lend them out for 
                        free. People just don’t respect 
                        things unless it costs them 
                        something.

           She smiles warmly and turns to the shelves. 

                                 BRYCE
                        Mrs. Bellows?

           Bryce motions her closer. She kneels beside him. He asks in a 
           quiet voice.

                                 BRYCE (CONT’D)
                        Do you know who the Boy is?

                                 MRS. BELLOWS
                        I know lots of boys.
                                 BRYCE
                        No. The Boy.

           Mrs. Bellows studies his face. 

                                 BRYCE (CONT’D)
                             (whisper)
                        I think he lives in my house. 

                                 MRS. BELLOWS
                             (a little condescending)
                        Oh, I see.
                             (half-smiling)
                        Have kids at school been talking 
                        about the Boy?

           Bryce shrugs. 

                                 MRS. BELLOWS (CONT’D)
                        Pretty scary stuff, huh? I wouldn’t 
                        want him living in my house, that’s 
                        for sure.
                             (standing)
                        Come on.

           Bryce stands. They’re nearly eye-to-eye. She smiles.

                                 MRS. BELLOWS (CONT’D)
                        I want to show you something.

           INT. LIBRARY - COMPUTER - MOMENTS LATER

           Bryce sits at one of the library’s public computers with Mrs. 
           Bellows behind him. 

           She reaches over him and clicks through a few memes, 
           articles, ads featuring the same image of the Boy in an old-
           fashioned school uniform: The Boy says ‘Eat your 
           vegetables.'; The Boy: the podcast. The last is an article 
           with the headline: The Boy and other Fictional Boogie Men.

                                 MRS. BELLOWS
                        See? The Boy is just a story. He’s 
                        like Mickey Mouse or Superman. He 
                        can’t live in your house. He lives...
                             (taps her head)
                        ... in here.

           Someone clears his throat loudly. Mrs. Bellows looks over to 
           see an older man, MR. CROSBY, standing with a huge stack of 
           books at the desk.
                                 MRS. BELLOWS (CONT’D)
                        Looks like Mr. Crosby has picked out 
                        his week’s reading. You okay? 

           Bryce nods, staring at the picture of the Boy featured in the

           Mr. Crosby clears his throat again. 

                                 MRS. BELLOWS (CONT’D)
                        Coming, Mr. Crosby.

           She pats Bryce’s back and heads to the desk.

           Bryce is left alone with the computer. He slowly clicks 
           through more images of the Boy.

           --The Boy in the background of a group of children playing 
           circa 1930.

           --A pencil drawing of the Boy crying blood.

           --A faded photo of a pregnant woman with a pale, ghostly hand 
           resting on her shoulder.

           --The Boy standing in a cemetery.

           The images grow more sinister as Bryce speeds through them. A 
           few phrases pop out to Bryce: 

           He said I’d be rewarded. He promised.

           I couldn’t wipe the blood away.

           Even when I close my eyes, I see him.

           The last image is a crayon drawing of the Boy with black 
           holes for eyes. Scrawled beneath it: 

           The Boy made me do it.  

           Bryce stares at the image. The Boy’s eyes are penetrating, 
           cold, mesmerizing.

           Bryce presses on a link to a video. A grainy color home video 
           showing a child’s birthday party begins. The noise comes 
           through the speakers, but Bryce quickly mutes the computer.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAY

           IN THE VIDEO...
           --CHILDREN in bathing suits swim and play around a pool.

           --Children gather on the porch. A MOTHER brings out a candle-
           lit cake. 

           Far in the background, unnoticed by the children, the mother, 
           or the person filming, a CHILD splashes in the water, 
           drowning.  

           The video slows. The picture crops closer, making the image 
           more pixillated. Standing on the side of the pool, near the 
           drowning child, is the Boy. He stares forward, into the 
           camera. 

           We move closer and closer to the image until we see the 
           nothing but pixels.

                                                           CUT BACK TO:

           INT. LIBRARY - DAY

           A hand grips Bryce’s shoulder. He looks up to see Mrs. 
           Bellows.

                                 MRS. BELLOWS
                        That’s enough screen time for one 
                        day.

           The library door swings open and Alice walks in.

                                 MRS. BELLOWS (CONT’D)
                        Look who’s here. 

           She looks compassionately at Bryce.  

                                 MRS. BELLOWS (CONT’D)
                        See you tomorrow?

           INT. KITCHEN - DAY

           The book lays on the table between Marina and Will. She’s 
           staring at the book.

                                 WILL
                        So this thing’s been out of print for 
                        years. Like I said, it’s crap. You 
                        know, rushed out for a quick buck. 
                        They interviewed Rebecca. And there’s 
                        a chapter about Lily--

                                 MARINA
                        I don’t want to know.
                                 WILL
                        But, surely you heard--

                                 MARINA
                             (firm)
                        I don’t want to know!
                             (quieter)
                        I’ve worked hard to not read anything 
                        about that time. No books, no 
                        articles... I hardly remember. It’s 
                        like it wasn’t even me.

                                 WILL
                             (smiling)
                        But it was you. I mean, you paid your 
                        debt and all that. Now you deserve to 
                        profit a little. This is the perfect 
                        time for a new book. We could 
                        collaborate. Hell, I’d do most of it. 

                                 MARINA
                        I told you, I don’t remember.

                                 WILL
                        I can help with that. 

           Marina lifts her tea and sips it.

                                 WILL (CONT’D)
                        Look, your sister, she’s not making 
                        big money down at the diner. One bad 
                        month, she loses this place. But we 
                        knock out a couple of chapters, we 
                        sell your story. Big money. Enough to 
                        send Bryce to college.

                                 MARINA
                             (standing)
                        I need to get back to sanding.

           Will follows as Marina walks from the kitchen.

           INT. FOYER - CONTINUOUS

           Marina climbs the stairs to the sander and clicks it on.

           Will follows, speaking over the buzz of the sander.

                                 WILL
                        Come on. Just listen to me. I’ll 
                        write the book. You don’t have to do 
                        a thing. Just put your name on it. 
                        That’s it. 
           He touches her shoulder. 

                                 MARINA
                             (yelling)
                        Get away from me!

           She turns quickly. The sander scrapes against Will’s 
           knuckles. He yells and steps back. Marina is horrified at the 
           blood.

           The front door opens and Alice and Bryce walk in. Alice holds 
           a full apple pie. 

                                 ALICE
                        What’s going on?

           Will rushes down the stairs cradling his injured hand. 

                                 WILL
                        You’re goddamn sister just attacked 
                        me. That’s what’s going on.

           He pushes past and out the door. Alice looks to Marina, who 
           shakes her head. Alice glances quickly at Bryce. She turns 
           and follows Will.

           EXT. FARM HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           She runs a few steps down the path,

                                 ALICE
                        Wait, Will, hold up. Come inside and 
                        let’s just talk this out.

                                 WILL
                        To hell with that! I’m not going near 
                        that psycho bitch. 

                                 ALICE
                        Calm down.

                                 WILL
                        I offered to write the whole goddamn 
                        book. She wouldn’t have to do a 
                        goddamn thing.  

                                 ALICE
                        Book?

           Alice looks back to see Bryce and Marina standing in the 
           front door, watching. She looks back to Will.

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        What were you doing here?
           Will opens his mouth, then closes it again. He frowns.

                                 WILL
                        There’s some good money to be made--

                                 ALICE
                        Oh my God.

                                 WILL
                        It was just an idea.

                                 ALICE
                        You are such a dick.

                                 WILL
                        I’m a dick?!
                             (pointing to Marina)
                        She... she’s the one who went all--

                                 ALICE
                        Get off my property. 

                                 WILL
                        What?

                                 ALICE
                        You ever mess with me or my family 
                        again I will personally put your 
                        balls in a blender. Go. 

                                 WILL
                        You’re as crazy as she is.

                                 ALICE
                        GO!

           Will walks to his truck, yelling over his shoulder.

                                 WILL
                        Thanks for the introduction, Alice. 
                        Really great to meet the family. Your 
                        psycho sister, your freak son--

           Alice THROWS the apple pie. Will barely dodges it. It lands 
           with a splatter by his feet.

                                 WILL (CONT’D)
                        Damn it.

           Alice walks back inside.
           INT. FOYER - CONTINUOUS

           Alice slams the door. She’s furious, breathing hard. She 
           looks up to Marina and Bryce staring at her.

                                 BRYCE
                        Mom...
                             (beat)
                        That was awesome.

           Alice gasps - half a sob, half a laugh.

                                 ALICE
                        I don’t think we’ll see him again. 
                        I’m sorry. I know you liked him.

                                 BRYCE
                        He was a douche, Mom.

           Alice and Marina look at one another and bust out laughing. 

           Alice puts a hand to her forehead.

                                 ALICE
                        I’m just sorry I wasted a whole pie 
                        on that jerk.

           INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           Alice, Bryce, and Marina sit around the dining table. A half 
           empty box of takeout pizza lays open before them. All three 
           are laughing as the two sisters tell Bryce stories.

                                 ALICE
                        Oh, I hated baths. Just refused to 
                        take them.

                                 MARINA
                        Oh, more than just refused. Mom and 
                        Dad would get her undressed and she 
                        take off through the house. And Dad 
                        would call --

                           ALICE
                                                         MARINA
           Naked escapee!
                                              Naked escapee!

           All three laugh harder. 

           Alice wipes her hands and stands.

                                 ALICE
                        Okay, so we don’t have pie. But who 
                        wants ice cream.
           Bryce raises a hand. Marina smiles and raises a hand.

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        Three bowls of ice cream on the way. 

           INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Alice opens a cabinet and retrieves three bowls. She turns 
           and sees the Blood in the Woods paperback on the table.

                                 ALICE
                             (sotto)
                        Such a dick.

           She grabs the book, opens up the kitchen side door.

           EXT. FARM HOUSE - SIDE DOOR - CONTINUOUS

           The outdoor light above the door creates a circle of light. 
           Alice drops the book on top of nearly full trash can and 
           replaces the lid. She shivers in the cold. 

           Rolph comes out the door, tail wagging. 

                                 ALICE
                        Rolph, if you see Will you have my 
                        permission to bite him. Go do your 
                        thing, boy.

           Rolph barks happily and trots off. Alice smirks and closes 
           the door.

           INT. FARM HOUSE - DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Bryce and Marina sit across from one another. The laughter 
           has melted to a fragile quiet. Both a little unsure of the 
           other.

                                 BRYCE
                        Mom says you played soccer.

                                 MARINA
                        I did. Not very well.

                                 BRYCE
                        I play goalie.

                                 MARINA
                        Important position. 
                                 BRYCE
                        Mom says it’s perfect for me because 
                        nothing gets past me.

                                 MARINA
                             (smiling)
                        I’m sure that’s true.

           Alice enters with three heaping bowls of ice cream.

                                 ALICE
                        Dessert is served! 

           INT. KITCHEN - LATER

           Alice and Marina stand at the sink washing the night’s 
           dishes. Marina notices Alice’s worn expression.

                                 MARINA
                        I’m sorry about Will.

                                 ALICE
                             (shaking her head)
                        Don’t be. He’s an asshole.

                                 MARINA
                             (smile)
                        He was cute.

                                 ALICE
                             (smile)
                        Yeah, well, he’s available if you’re 
                        interested. 

           Marina laughs. She glances to the dining room. Through the 
           ajar door she sees Bryce coloring at the table. Marina looks 
           back at her sister. 

                                 MARINA
                             (quieter)
                        Listen, maybe I should move out.

           Alice stops and looks at her, surprised.

                                 ALICE
                        Are you kidding? You just got here.

                                 MARINA
                        I know, I know, but you and Will... 
                        Your son is frightened of me.

                                 ALICE
                        He’s not frightened, he’s--
                                 MARINA
                        Alice, I’ve messed up a lot of lives. 
                        Mine included. I don’t want to mess 
                        up yours. 

           Alice thinks a beat, then turns back to the dishes.

                                 ALICE
                        You’re not going. No more discussion.

                                 MARINA
                        Alice, I--

                                 ALICE
                        I don’t want to talk about it.

           Marina looks at her for beat, perplexed. Alice takes the half-
           cleaned plate out of Marina’s hand.

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        I tell you what, I’ll finish the 
                        dishes. They’re almost done anyway.

           Marina nods, giving in.

                                 MARINA
                        Okay.

           INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Marina stands in the shower. She smiles into the hot water 
           with her eyes closed. 

           EXT. FARM HOUSE - SIDE DOOR - CONTINUOUS

           Alice closes the back door and grabs the trash can handles. 
           It’s heavy, but she rolls it down the driveway toward the 
           curb.  

           She hears a noise - a scratching. She turns and looks back at 
           the house.

           INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Marina lathers her hair with shampoo. Though the shower 
           curtain is a frosty translucent, she doesn’t see the door to 
           the bathroom slowly open.
           EXT. FARM HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Leaving the trash can, Alice steps toward the back of the 
           house. Just past the light above the side door, the yard is 
           lost in black shadow. 

                                 ALICE
                        Will?

           INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Marina continues to wash her hair as a small, dark figure 
           enters veiled by the wet shower curtain and the steam.

           EXT. FARM HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Alice creeps past the side door toward the corner leading to 
           the unlit back of the house. She grabs a rake leaning against 
           the house. 

                                 ALICE
                        Will, I’m going to rake your face if 
                        you’re back there.

           A strange whine comes from behind Alice. She turns and looks 
           at the trash can. It moves. She hesitates, confused.

           The can falls on its side, the lid opened and blocking her 
           view of the inside.

           She steps toward it.

           INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Marina hears a CLICK of the door. She turns and looks through 
           the curtain. Nothing. The door is closed.

           She quickly turns off the water and opens the curtain. There 
           on the edge of the sink lays the 1900’s-era school book, 
           Every Boys Reader.

           Marina steps from the shower and slowly picks it up. A piece 
           of folded paper flutters out and lands open on the bathroom 
           floor. 

           It reads: I CHOOSE YOU.

           Alice SCREAMS from outside.
           EXT. FARM HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Alice has a hand covering her mouth as she stares into the 
           fallen trash can. Marina, in a robe, and Bryce rush out the 
           side door. Alice puts out a hand.

                                 ALICE
                             (strained)
                        Stay back, Bryce, okay? You stay 
                        there. 

           Bryce looks to Marina. Marina gives him a reassuring nod. He 
           stays by the door as Marina joins her sister. 

           As she reaches Alice, we see what’s in the trash can. Rolph, 
           a rolled newspaper shoved in his mouth, lies dead. His eyes 
           are open.

                                 MARINA
                        Oh Jesus. 

                                 ALICE
                        That freak. 

           Marina puts an arm around Alice.

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        Just can’t believe... that freak.

                                 MARINA
                        Do you want to call the police?

                                 ALICE
                        I’ll do one better. Can you watch 
                        Bryce?

                                 MARINA
                        You’re going?

                                 ALICE
                        That dick killed my dog. I’m going to 
                        kick his ass.

           Alice runs to her truck and speeds out of the dirt drive. 
           Marina puts an arm around Bryce as the truck’s tail lights 
           fade.

                                 BRYCE
                        What happened? 

                                 MARINA
                        Your mom needs to explain.

                                 BRYCE
                        Did something happen to Rolph? 
                                 MARINA
                             (turning to the door)
                        Let’s get back inside.

           Bryce spots the paperback book on the ground. As his aunt 
           turns, he reaches down and picks it up, hiding it under his 
           pajama top.

           INT. BRYCE’S BEDROOM - LATER

           Bryce sits in bed reading Blood in the Woods under a single 
           bedside lamp. His face is drawn and pale.

           He hears a noise and moves to the window. Below he sees 
           Marina, dressed, wrapping the dead dog in a tarp. 

           EXT. FARM HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           As the first flakes of snow fall, Marina finishes wrapping up 
           the dog, then heaves the load to the side of the house. 

           She’s a little out of breath as she heads back to the side 
           door. She wipes her hands on her pants as she opens the door.

           INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Marina opens the door to see Bryce standing in the kitchen 
           staring at her. He’s eerily quiet. 

                                 MARINA
                        Hi, Bryce.

                                 BRYCE
                        Did the Boy do it?

           The blood drains from Marina’s face. 

                                 MARINA
                        Bryce...

                                 BRYCE
                        Did the Boy kill my dog?

           Marina touches her chest, struggling with how to respond. 

                                 MARINA
                        You know about the Boy?

           Bryce nods almost imperceptibly. 

           Marina frowns. It’s clear she’d rather not revisit the past, 
           but this child needs an answer. She meets his eyes.
                                 MARINA (CONT’D)
                        I could use some hot cocoa. How about 
                        you?

           INT. DINING ROOM - MINUTES LATER

           Marina and Bryce sit across from each other at the large 
           table, each with a bowl of ice cream. For a few beats the 
           only sound is the clank of spoons against the bowls. 

           Finally, Marina puts down her spoon and watches Bryce. He 
           pauses, his spoon hovering above the bowl.

                                 BRYCE
                        You never went to art school, did 
                        you?

           Marina smiles and shakes her head. 

                                 MARINA
                        When I was a little girl, Bryce, I 
                        had a friend. Her name was Rebecca. 

                                 BRYCE
                        Was she your best friend?

                                 MARINA
                        She was. She was very smart. She 
                        would tell me all kinds of stories, 
                        Made up stories.

                                 BRYCE
                        Like Superman?

                                 MARINA
                        Yes. Like that. She told me about 
                        this boy... a boy who had drowned.

                                 BRYCE
                             (excited)
                        His mother stabbed him to death and 
                        washed his body in the lake. He--

                                 MARINA
                        But it wasn’t true. It was a story 
                        Rebecca made up. He said the Boy, his 
                        spirit, wanted to be our friend. She 
                        wrote me notes pretending they were 
                        from him. I wrote notes back. I 
                        believed he was real. I wanted to 
                        believe. 

                                 BRYCE
                        Why?
                                 MARINA
                        I don’t know. I wanted to be loved. I 
                        wanted to be chosen. I think... I 
                        think I was a little sick.

                                 BRYCE
                        Like the flu?

                                 MARINA
                             (smiles slightly)
                        Like the flu, but in my head. That’s 
                        why I was away for so long. I was 
                        getting better.

                                 BRYCE
                        What happened to Rebecca?

                                 MARINA
                        She had to go away, too.

                                 BRYCE
                        Did she get better?

           Marina pauses. 

                                 MARINA
                        I don’t know. I don’t know where she 
                        is.

                                 BRYCE
                        Don’t you want to know?

           She shakes her head.

                                 MARINA
                        No. No, I want all of that to stay in 
                        the past. I don’t even want to 
                        remember it.
                             (beat)
                        Rebecca lied to me. And I believed 
                        that lie. I did things I wish I 
                        hadn’t done. 

                                 BRYCE
                        What did you do?

           She waits a long beat.

                                 MARINA
                        I hurt someone.

                                 BRYCE
                        For the Boy?
                                 MARINA
                        For a lie. Just a lie, Bryce. That 
                        Boy... he is not real.

           Bryce thinks for a quiet beat. He stands and walks over to 
           his Aunt. He takes her hand and gently pulls her. Marina, a 
           little confused, stands and follows. 

           INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Bryce leads Marina to the couch. He sits and she sits beside 
           him. He opens up the laptop sitting on the coffee table. He 
           types in the search engine: THE BOY  

           Thousands of links and images appear on the screen. As Bryce 
           clicks through them, we see Marina’s horror grow. The glow of 
           the laptop illuminates her face as she realizes how much the 
           legend of the Boy has grown.

           Bryce touches her hand and she almost jumps.

                                 BRYCE
                        All these people talking about him. 
                        All these people frightened of him. 
                        How can he not be real?

           EXT. EARL’S ROADHOUSE BAR - NIGHT

           Alice’s truck skids into and isolated bar well outside of 
           town. Close to a dozen automobiles are parked outside. 

           Alice jumps from her truck and slams the door.

           INT. EARL’S ROADHOUSE BAR - CONTINUOUS

           BREAK. Pool balls scatter.

           Will, wearing his ACE PLUMBING HAT, stands with his pool cue 
           and admires his break. Another POOL PLAYER waits his turn. 

           CUSTOMERS line the bar and the few tables and listen to the 
           rock music playing from the bright jukebox.

                                 POOL PLAYER
                        So you and your lady had a falling 
                        out?

                                 WILL
                             (cocky)
                        She’ll come crawling back. Don’t you 
                        worry.
           Alice busts in, slamming the door against the wall. She’s 
           angry as hell and the whole place turns to look.

                                 WILL (CONT’D)
                        Alice!

           She strides toward him, grabbing a free pool cue as she does.

                                 ALICE
                        You goddamn asshole.

           Will backs up, holding his cue in front of him in defense. 

                                 WILL
                        Whoa. Whoa.

           Alice raises her cue to take a swing, but the Pool Player 
           grabs her arms.

                                 ALICE
                        You killed my kid’s dog, you freak. 
                        Killed my kid’s dog.

                                 WILL
                        Killed your... what the hell are you 
                        talking about? 

                                 ALICE
                        Tonight. You were at my house and you-
                        -

                                 WILL
                        I’ve been here since six, right Earl?

           EARL, behind the bar, frowns.

                                 EARL
                        I’m not your goddamn babysitter.

                                 WILL
                        Alice. I didn’t touch your dog.

                                 ALICE
                        Oh really.

                                 WILL
                        Really! Damn it, Alice. You’re 
                        worried about me? Look who’s living 
                        in your house. 

           Alice glares at Will for a long beat. She throws down the 
           cue, shakes loose of the Pool Player’s hold and walks from 
           the bar. 
           The Pool Player turns to Will, who is still holding his cue 
           across his chest.

                                 POOL PLAYER
                        She’s gone. You can relax.

           Frowning, Will lowers the stick.

           INT. ALICE’S TRUCK - LATER

           Alice drives along the highway, still visibly upset. She 
           punches the wheel.

                                 ALICE
                        Damn it!

           INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Marina looks in on Bryce sleeping in his bed. She closes the 
           door, her face troubled.

           EXT. EARL’S ROADHOUSE BAR - LATER

           Only a few cars are parked outside the bar now. A light 
           dusting of snow already covers the ground. Will stumbles out, 
           releasing a moment of the loud music from inside. 

           His truck is parked by the drainage ditch that lies on the 
           far side of the bar. He walks to his truck, weaving a little. 
           By his truck, he fumbles with his keys, dropping them.  

                                 WILL
                        Shit.

           He bends down and hears a child’s laugh. 

           He stands quickly, smacking his head on his truck’s side 
           mirror. Holding his head, he looks around for the source of 
           the sound. 

           Seeing nothing, he shakes it off and tries to work the keys 
           again.

                                 CHILD’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        William.

                                 WILL
                        Who’s there?

           Will looks toward the ditch on the other side of the truck. 
           The voice seemed to come from there. The child’s laughter 
           echoes again.
           Will rounds the truck and slowly approaches the lip of the 
           ditch.

                                 WILL (CONT’D)
                        You’re okay. Steady, Will.

           He reaches the edge of the dirt. He looks down six feet to 
           the bottom. He sees nothing but a trickle of water. 

                                 CHILD’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        William.

           The water runs into a drainage pipe, four feet in diameter. 
           The voice comes from there.

                                 WILL
                        Hello?

                                 CHILD’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Help me, William. Please.

           Will takes a step. He slips and lands on his backside, 
           sliding a bit. He quickly regains his feet and looks to the 
           drainage pipe. It’s black inside. 

                                 CHILD’S VOICE  (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Please, William.

           Will stumbles a little closer to the opening. He’s close now.

                                 WILL
                        Who’s in there?

           Will waits. There’s no answer. Will straightens and swallows.

                                 WILL (CONT’D)
                        Screw this.

           Will turns to go. A small hand holding a paring knife reaches 
           from the blackness of the pipe and slices Will’s Achilles 
           tendon. 

           Will falls with a scream. He hits his head on a rock, 
           knocking him out.

           Two thin arms reach from the pipe and begin pulling Will in. 
           His face drags along the mud. 

           As his shoulders reach the pipe, Will begins to come to. He 
           scrapes at the mud, but is pulled further into the pipe.

           Will yells as he disappears into the darkness. His screams 
           echo from the black for a few seconds. 
           Just as the screams fall silent, TWO MEN exit the bar, 
           laughing and stumbling to their cars.

           EXT. CHURCH - MORNING

           The old stone church stands tall in the bright winter morning 
           light. The singing of hymns can be heard from inside.

                                 CONGREGATION (O.S.)
                             (singing)
                        Be Thou my Vision, O Lord of my 
                        heart; Naught be all else to me, save 
                        that Thou art.

           INT. CHURCH - CONTINUOUS

           The modest CONGREGATION half fills the church, standing and 
           singing. Toward the back, Marina stands alone.

                                 CONGREGATION
                             (singing)
                        Thou my great Father, I Thy true son;
                        Thou in me dwelling, and I with Thee 
                        one.

           LATER

           The PRIEST stands before the congregation reading from the 
           Gospel. 

                                 PRIEST
                        Then he said to Thomas, “Put your 
                        finger here and see my hands, and 
                        bring your hand and put it into my 
                        side, and do not be unbelieving, but 
                        believe.” Thomas answered and said to 
                        him, “My Lord and my God!” 

           Marina listens intently.

                                 PRIEST (CONT’D)
                        Jesus said to him, “Have you come to 
                        believe because you have seen me? 
                        Blessed are those who have not seen 
                        and yet have believed.”
                             (beat)
                        The word of the Lord.

                                 CONGREGATION
                        Thanks be to God.

           LATER
           The Priest, now flanked by two young ACOLYTES, sets up the 
           elements for mass. 

           The Congregation falls quiet as the Priest continues the 
           ceremony. Marina stares at one of the Acolytes. A boy no 
           older than ten.

           The Priest raises a communion wafer and snaps it. 

                                 PRIEST
                        Take this, all of you, and eat of it, 
                        for this is my body, which will be 
                        given up for you.

                                 CONGREGATION
                        Thanks be to God.

           The Priest raises a sliver goblet. Marina’s attention return 
           to the Priest.

                                 PRIEST
                        Take this, all of you, and drink from 
                        it, for this is the chalice of my 
                        blood of the new and eternal 
                        covenant, which will be poured out 
                        for you and for many for the 
                        forgiveness of sins. 

           For Marina, these words are a lifeline. She nods and closes 
           her eyes, smiling slightly with gratitude. She joins the call 
           and response.

                       CONGREGATION
           Thanks be to God. 
                                                         MARINA
                                              Thanks be to God. 

           Marina opens her eyes. An Acolyte is now the Boy and he’s 
           staring directly at Marina. His eyes cold.

           Marina gasps and drops her hymnal. A few members of the 
           Congregation turn and frown. The Acolyte is once again 
           himself. Marina averts her eyes, ashamed.

           She reaches down to retrieve the hymnal from the floor. As 
           she touches the black book, a small hand darts out from under 
           the pew and grabs her wrist. 

           She pulls back, but is yanked to the ground, landing hard. 
           Under the pew in front of her is the face of the Boy. He 
           smiles and pulls her under... 

           She screams.

           The Priest looks from the front of the sanctuary. Faces turn, 
           concerned. One of the faces is Mrs. Bellows. 
           INT. PRIEST’S OFFICE - LATER

           Marina sits in a leather chair in a wood paneled office. Her 
           eyes are wide, terrified. But she sits calmly. 

           The Priest is taking a glass of water from an OLDER WOMAN at 
           the office door. The Woman tries to peek over the Priest to 
           get a look at Marina.

                                 PRIEST
                        Thank you, Doris. This is fine. 

           The Priest closes the office door and hands the glass to 
           Marina. She takes it... her hand shaking as she sips. 

           The Priest lowers himself into his chair behind his desk.

                                 PRIEST (CONT’D)
                        I’ve had plenty of people fall asleep 
                        in my services, but never faint.

           He smiles. Marina doesn’t respond. She touches the silver 
           cross around her neck.

                                 PRIEST (CONT’D)
                        Do you have something you want to 
                        talk about?
                             (beat)
                        How is your faith?

           Marina looks at him. The priest smiles knowingly.

                                 PRIEST (CONT’D)
                        I can sense a Dark Night of the Soul 
                        from a mile a way. 
                             (standing)
                        It can be hard having faith in what 
                        we don’t see. Thomas was invited to 
                        touch the wounds. Lucky, right? But 
                        remember the reading. “Blessed are 
                        those who have not seen and yet have 
                        believed.” 

                                 MARINA
                        I don’t want to believe.

           The Priest sits on the corner of his desk.

                                 PRIEST
                        Ah, hunted by the Hound of Heaven, 
                        are you? I was too. Young man, 
                        engaged, I was studying to be a 
                        lawyer.

           He shivers at the thought.
                                 PRIEST (CONT’D)
                        But sometimes he pursues us with such 
                        passion that we have no choice but to 
                        believe. 

           Marina stares, her face white. The Priest moves to her, 
           squatting beside her.

                                 PRIEST (CONT’D)
                        He has shown himself to you.

           Marina nods.

                                 PRIEST (CONT’D)
                        Do not turn from his love. Do not 
                        deny him. 

                                 MARINA
                        He... he claims me. He wants.

                                 PRIEST
                        Of course he does. He loves. And he 
                        will for all eternity. You are his. 
                        He has redeemed you with blood. 

           The Priest smiles. Marina’s face quivers. 

           EXT. FARM HOUSE - DAY

           Alice cradles a black trash bag holding, it appears, the 
           dog’s corpse. She awkwardly loads it into the back of the 
           truck. It lands with a thud.

           She rubs her hands on her jeans, disturbed by the choir. 

           She looks up at the house. From a second story window, Bryce 
           looks down. He’s smiling gleefully. 

           Alice frowns, but waves. Bryce does not wave back. Just 
           smiles and draws the curtain closed. 

           EXT. FARM HOUSE - NIGHT

           Snow falls on the old house. A few dim lights burn. A front 
           window flickers from a television screen.  

           INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Alice lays asleep on the couch under a small throw blanket. 
           The television runs a late-night infomercial.
           INT. MARINA’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Marina kneels by her bed praying. She whispers her prayers 
           fervently. 

           An old baseball rolls across the floor and gently stops at 
           Marina’s knee. She opens her eyes and stares at. 

           A child’s laughter. 

           She stops. The laughter came from somewhere past her open 
           door.

           INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Marina steps out into the hallway. She hears the whispering, 
           hushed laughter.

                                 MARINA
                        Bryce? Is that you?

           INT. LANDING - CONTINUOUS

           Marina walks up to the landing railing and looks down to the 
           FOYER.

           The front door is cracked open. Bryce stands by the door, 
           whispering to someone just outside.

                                 MARINA
                        Who are you talking to?

           Bryce doesn’t respond, just continues whispering and 
           listening to whoever is outside.

           Marina runs down the stairs.

           INT. FOYER - CONTINUOUS

           She flings open the door. No one is there. 

           Marina turns to Bryce. She squats and checks him over.

                                 MARINA
                        You’re cold. Are you all right?

           She looks into his face. He’s smiling, his eyes bright. 

                                 BRYCE
                             (quietly)
                        I know what you did.

                                 BRYCE (CONT'D)
                             (beat)
                        And I know why.

           Bryce races up the stairs leaving Marina alone.

           INT. MARINA’S BEDROOM - MORNING

           Marina’s eyes open. She’s laying in bed in the quiet of 
           morning. 

           Her brow furrows. She pulls down the blanket and finds the 
           dog’s collar laying on her chest. 

           She yelps, pushing it away and retracting from it.

           She steps out her bed. Keeping her eyes on the collar, she 
           steps backward to the wall by the window.

           Out the window Bryce and a group of CHILDREN play along the 
           snow-covered SIDEWALK. Their laughter is audible in the room. 
           The Boy stands among them, staring up at Marina’s window. 

           Marina, sensing something, turns to the window. She sees the 
           Boy.

           He smiles at her.

                                 MARINA
                        No! No!

           Marina races from the room. 

           INT. FOYER - MOMENTS LATER

           Still in her nightgown, Marina rushes down the stairs and 
           through the front door.

           In the adjacent...

           LIVING ROOM,

           Alice is roused by the sound.

           EXT. FARM HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Marina runs barefoot from the house to the crowd of Children. 

                                 MARINA
                        Where is he? Where is he?

           She grabs each of them by the shoulders, quickly studying 
           them before moving on to the next. The Boy is not there.
           Alice has joined them, pulling Marina back.

                                 ALICE
                        What the hell, Marina? You’re scaring 
                        them.

           The Children stare at the confused Marina standing in the 
           snow in her nightgown. Only Bryce smiles.

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        You kids go... go play somewhere 
                        else.

                                 BRYCE
                        But, Mom.

                                 ALICE
                        Go.

           Alice leads a sedate Marina back to the house.

           INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Alice stomps into the kitchen. Marina, quiet but still 
           confused, follows.

                                 ALICE
                        Jesus, Marina. People here... people 
                        are willing to forget. But not if you 
                        keep reminding them. You’ve got to 
                        pull it together. 

           Alice turns and sees Marina lost in thought.

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        Marina? Marina?

                                 MARINA
                             (looking up)
                        Can I use your phone?

           Alice waits a moment. Then sighs and hands Marina her cell.

           INT. FOYER - MOMENTS LATER

           Marina paces the foyer alone, listening to the ringing 
           through the phone pressed against her ear. She’s agitated, 
           waiting for someone to pick up.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. JUVENILE DETENTION - DR. WARD’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           A phone rings on the desk in the empty, unlit office.

                                                           CUT BACK TO:

           INT. FOYER - CONTINUOUS

           Marina rubs her forehead, listening to the ringing. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. DR. WARD’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           A phone lays on a table near the front door of Dr. Ward’s 
           house. A few framed pictures of her daughter, now a pre-teen, 
           and her husband share the table.

                                                           CUT BACK TO:

           INT. FOYER - CONTINUOUS

           Finally...

                                 DR. WARD (O.S.)
                        You’ve reached the voicemail of Dr. 
                        Shelia Ward. Please leave a message. 

           BEEP.

                                 MARINA
                        Dr. Ward. This is Marina. I’m... I’m 
                        not doing very well. The anxiety... 
                        The...
                             (whispering)
                        ...I’m seeing things... Please. Can 
                        you call me? I need... I need your 
                        help.

           Marina hangs up, but grips the phone like it’s a lifeline.

                                 ALICE
                        Marina.

           Marina spins. Alice is standing just inside the dining room. 
           She clearly heard Marina’s message.

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        Can we go for a walk?
           EXT. ROAD - MORNING

           Marina and Alice, both dressed for the weather, walk along 
           the road passing old houses on wide lots. 

                                 ALICE
                        Bryce is my main concern, always. I 
                        don’t want any of this touching him. 

                                 MARINA
                        He asked me about the Bo-

                                 ALICE
                             (firm)
                        I don’t want him hearing about any of 
                        that. 

                                 MARINA
                        I found another note. I 
                        hear...things. I... 

                                 ALICE
                        It’s not you, Marina. Will has been 
                        messing with your head, for some sick 
                        reason. He’s got, I don’t know, 
                        issues.

                                 MARINA
                        I can’t trust what I’m seeing. I 
                        can’t trust what I’m thinking. I 
                        don’t know who I am, Alice. I’m 
                        scared. I don’t know who I am.

           Alice stops. Marina walks on a few steps.

                                 ALICE
                        I hated you.

           Marina turns and looks at her sister.

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        Did you know that? I hated you.

           Marina shakes her head.

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        I was a kid when it all... happened. 
                        None it made sense. All I knew is you 
                        went away and Mom cried all the time. 

           Marina’s flinches at the words.

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        It wasn’t Mom and Dad who kept me 
                        from visiting you. It was me. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        I didn’t want to see you. Mom and Dad 
                        would go, and I’d refuse. I just 
                        wouldn’t go. I wanted to forget your 
                        face. And I did. I forgot everything 
                        about you. 

           Marina steps closer to Alice.

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        But then Dad, he said I needed to 
                        come. We had this huge fight about 
                        it, but he made me go. It was 
                        Thanksgiving. Do you remember that? I 
                        was thirteen, I guess.

           Marina nods.

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        We sat at that round table in that 
                        cold room, all those other crazy 
                        looking girls. I was scared shitless. 
                        And then... then you came out. 
                        Wearing that hideous red pajama 
                        thing.

            Alice chuckles. Marina half-smiles.

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        And I remembered you - everything 
                        about you. I know who you are. You’re 
                        my sister. That never changed. It 
                        never will. Now, someone is messing 
                        with your head, manipulating you... 

           The words hit Marina, she starts thinking.

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        I’m going to help you through this. 
                        We go to the police. We’ll tell them 
                        Will’s been breaking into the house, 
                        breaking in. We show them what--

                                 MARINA
                             (suddenly sure)
                        It’s not Will. 

           Marina steps to her sister and gives her a hug.

                                 MARINA (CONT’D)
                        I know who’s doing this. And I know 
                        where to find her.

           Marina quickly walks off down a side street. 
                                 ALICE
                             (calling after her)
                        Marina? Find who?

           Marina looks back. 

                                 MARINA
                        Rebecca Cline.

           INT. LIBRARY - DAY

           Bryce sits at one of the computers staring at a charcoal 
           drawing of the Boy on the screen. The image’s eyes are black, 
           endless. Bryce is transfixed.

           A hand touches his shoulder. Mrs. Bellows.

                                 MRS. BELLOWS
                        Would you like to see something, 
                        Bryce?

           INT. LIBRARY - BASEMENT - LATER

           The low ceiling roomed is dank, cramped, and poorly lit. Mrs. 
           Bellows leads Bryce down a long aisle of shelves filed with 
           file boxes. 

                                 MRS. BELLOWS
                        They keep most the public records 
                        down here. The old ones. Before the 
                        world went digital.

           She flashes Bryce a smiles.

                                 MRS. BELLOWS (CONT’D)
                        When the... incident happened sixteen 
                        years ago, they said the Boy was just 
                        a story, just a clever tale made up 
                        by precious little girls. A game they 
                        took too far. They tried to keep it 
                        out of the papers, but stories have 
                        away of making themselves heard. The 
                        Boy went viral. 

           Mrs. Bellows reaches up, pushing to her tip-toes, to grab an 
           aged file box on one of the top shelves.

                                 MRS. BELLOWS (CONT’D)
                        Here it is.

           She places the box down and kneels before it. She looks up at 
           Bryce and gives him and encouraging nod. He kneels too.
                                 MRS. BELLOWS (CONT’D)
                        They never listen to the girls. Why 
                        should they? Never questioned if 
                        there was something to their stories. 
                        But I did.

           She lifts the lid. The box is filled with black and white 
           photos, old newspapers, yellowed forms and documents. She 
           pulls out a few papers.

                                 MRS. BELLOWS (CONT’D)
                        There was a boy born here in Bowsman, 
                        1901. Henry Watkins, born to Mary and 
                        Horace Watkins. We don’t have much on 
                        the family, only that they came from 
                        the east coast. New York, most 
                        likely. And before that, Germany. 
                        Henry attended Bowsman’s first public 
                        school. 

           She hands Bryce a faded photo of a dozen boys. The Boy stares 
           out. 

                                 MRS. BELLOWS (CONT’D)
                        But only for a year. His mother 
                        pulled him out of school. Kept him 
                        home.

                                 BRYCE
                        Why?

                                 MRS. BELLOWS
                        I suppose she had her reasons. 
                             (lifting more papers)
                        They lived on the outskirts of 
                        Bowsman. In the forest, not far from 
                        the lake. Kept to themselves, it 
                        seems. Nothing in records about being 
                        involved in local politics or 
                        business disputes... then there was a 
                        fire.

           She hands Bryce a yellowed newspaper from November 12th, 1911 
           - BOWSMAN GAZETTE. An article headline reads: FIRE DESTROYS 
           HOME. NO SURVIVORS.

                                 BRYCE
                             (looks up from reading)
                        He died?

           Mrs. Bellows shrugs. Bryce returns to the paper. Mrs. Bellows 
           watches him and smiles.
                                 MRS. BELLOWS
                        Have you been to the Bowsman 
                        cemetery? I mean, the old section. I 
                        have. There’s a grave stone for 
                        Horace Watkins. And a grave stone for 
                        Mary. But Henry, the boy, he has no 
                        stone.  

                                 BRYCE
                        Why? What happened?

                                 MRS. BELLOWS
                        No one knows. Maybe he’s buried 
                        somewhere else. Maybe he survived. 
                        Maybe his mother was a witch who 
                        drowned him and no one ever knew. 

           She stares for a beat. Then smiles.

                                 MRS. BELLOWS (CONT’D)
                        This is over a hundred years ago. All 
                        we have is a hole in history where 
                        there once was a boy.

           Bryce picks up a picture - a school picture of just the Boy, 
           staring out and unsmiling.

                                 MRS. BELLOWS (CONT’D)
                        There are two ways to disappear in 
                        this world. One is to hide, to have 
                        no face. The other is to have a 
                        thousand faces. To be everywhere. The 
                        Boy is everywhere. But his real 
                        story... 
                             (tapping the box)
                        ... is hidden.

           EXT. CLINE HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON

           Marina stands before the Cline house, a tidy bungalow in a 
           row of small houses. Marina takes a deep breath. She walks up 
           the steps and knocks on the front door.

           As she waits, she notices the flowers sticking out of the 
           snow and trimming the house are plastic. 

           An older woman, MRS. CLINE, wearing a flowered dress opens 
           the door with a welcoming smile.

                                 MARINA
                        Mrs. Cline?

                                 MRS. CLINE
                        Yes?
                                 MARINA
                        I’m Marina Hess. 

                                 MRS. CLINE
                        Rebecca’s friend? Little Marina? How 
                        have you been?

           Her cheerfulness momentarily throws Marina.

                                 MARINA
                        I’m... I’m all right.
                             (beat)
                        Yes... I... I need to see Rebecca. 

           INT. CLINE HOUSE - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Marina follows Mrs. Cline through the carpeted hall. 
           Crocheted images and oil paintings line the walls. 

           Mrs. Cline continues her cheerful demure, as if Marina were 
           just home from college.

                                 MRS. CLINE
                        Rebecca was the model guest, they 
                        say. Just got along with everybody. 
                        Of course, she always did. So she 
                        came home, oh, a year or so back. How 
                        are your parents?

                                 MARINA
                        They... they passed on some years 
                        ago.

                                 MRS. CLINE
                        Imagine that! Well, I suppose that’s 
                        the way of things. My Henry’s been 
                        gone ten years now.

           INT. CLINE HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           The living room is tidy, quaint. Bric-a-brac stand neatly 
           organized on the shelves. A number of childhood photographs 
           of Rebecca line a shelf above the electric fireplace. 

                                 MRS. CLINE
                        I’m surprised you and Rebecca didn’t 
                        keep in touch? You were such close 
                        friends. Bugs in a rug. How about 
                        Lily? Do you see her?

           Marina is unsure how to answer.
                                 MARINA
                        I... no. I don’t.

                                 MRS. CLINE
                        Pity how friends grow apart.

           She stops and turns to Marina.

                                 MRS. CLINE (CONT’D)
                        Would you like some tea?

                                 REBECCA
                        Is Rebecca here, Mrs. Cline? I really 
                        do need to talk to her.

           Mrs. Cline nods, her smile frozen on her face.

                                 MRS. CLINE
                        Of course, of course.

           INT. CLINE HOUSE - BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Mrs. Cline opens the door for Marina to walk through. The 
           late afternoon sun seeps through the thin curtains into the 
           immaculately tidy bedroom.

           By the window sits a wheelchair. The figure in the chair has 
           a blanket draped over her head.

                                 MRS. CLINE
                             (quiet)
                        The trains, they’re so loud. They 
                        upset her. 

           Marina looks to Mrs. Cline, her eyes full of questions. The 
           corners of Mrs. Cline’s mouth twitch.

                                 MRS. CLINE (CONT’D)
                        Home was hard for her, at first... 
                        She did something rash.

           Mrs. Cline pulls off the blanket. Rebecca’s eyes are open. 
           Her face is blank, aged. Mrs. Cline adjusts the loose strands 
           of her hair.

                                 MRS. CLINE (CONT’D)
                        She took one of Henry’s best ties 
                        and... wrapped it around her neck 
                        and...
                             (shrugs)
                        I cut her down... when I found her.
                             (smiles)
                        Saved her life.
                             (loud, to Rebecca)
                                 (MORE)
                                 MRS. CLINE (CONT’D)
                        Rebecca! Your friend Marina is here 
                        to see you. 

           No reaction. Mrs. Cline touches Rebecca’s unresponsive face.

                                 MRS. CLINE (CONT’D)
                             (quiet)
                        You never stop being a mother, do 
                        you?
                             (facing Marina)
                        I’ll get that tea. Leave you two to 
                        catch up.

           Mrs. Cline shuffles out of the room, leaving Marina alone 
           with Rebecca. 

           Marina lowers herself and looks into Rebecca’s eyes, 
           searching for some sign of comprehension. 

                                 MARINA
                        Rebecca?

           At first there is no reaction, then Rebecca moves her eyes, 
           and only her eyes, to look at Marina. Marina moves closer.

                                 MARINA (CONT’D)
                        Things have been happening again, 
                        Rebecca. Someone is... doing things.

           Marina takes a breath. Calms herself.

                                 MARINA (CONT’D)
                        I need to know. All those stories... 
                        the love notes from... him. That was 
                        you. Yes? It was just you. Just a 
                        game.

           Rebecca just stares, expressionless. 

                                 MARINA (CONT’D)
                             (whispering)
                        I see him. 
                             (beat)
                        Someone is doing this... someone...

           Rebecca turns her face away from Marina.

                                 MARINA (CONT’D)
                        Do you know who it is? Who’s doing 
                        this to me?

           Marina pulls one of the notes from her purse and places it on 
           Rebecca’s lap. It reads:

           I FOUND YOU.
           Rebecca’s eyes slowly twitch down and see the paper.

                                 MARINA (CONT’D)
                        Rebecca I--

           Rebecca SCREAMS. A deep, guttural scream. 

           Marina falls back. Rebecca’s eyes follow her. She continues 
           screaming, growing louder and louder.

           Mrs. Cline rushes back in.

                                 MRS. CLINE
                        Oh dear, oh dear.

           She throws the blanket over Rebecca’s head. Still, the 
           screaming blares.

                                 MRS. CLINE (CONT’D)
                        Hush now, Mamma’s here. Hush.

                                 MARINA
                        I’m sorry. I’m sorry.

           Mrs. Cline doesn’t seem to hear her. Marina backs out of the 
           room. 

           EXT. CLINE HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Marina rushes from the house, down the path to the road. She 
           stops, puts a hand to her mouth and sobs.

           EXT.  FARM HOUSE - DUSK

           Snow falls harder on the farm house.

           INT. KITCHEN - DUSK

           Bryce sits at the kitchen table coloring with a huge box of 
           crayons and colored pencils. He’s humming. Alice bustles 
           around him preparing dinner. 

           She moves past Bryce and catches sight of what he’s drawing -- 
           a simple picture of a boy in the woods. She leans a hand on 
           the table and studies his drawing. 

                                 ALICE
                             (hiding her uneasiness)
                        Who’s that, honey?
                                 BRYCE
                             (not pausing his drawing)
                        A friend.

                                 ALICE
                        From school?

           Bryce doesn’t answer, just keeps drawing.

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        Bryce?

           Bryce stabs his pencil at Alice’s hand. She moves it just in 
           time.

                                 BRYCE
                        LEAVE ME ALONE.

                                 ALICE
                        Bryce!

                                 BRYCE
                        LEAVE. ME. ALONE.

           Alice backs away.

           INT. STAIRWELL - LATER

           Glancing back to make sure she’s not seen, Alice climbs the 
           stairs.

           INT. BRYCE’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Alice quietly pushes the door open and slides inside. It’s 
           nearly dark out, so she clicks on the light. At first glance, 
           everything seems normal in the cluttered room. 

           She moves to his bed. Under the pillow she finds the 
           paperback of Blood in the Woods. 

           She looks around the room and notices the corners of 
           construction paper sticking out from under the wardrobe. She 
           gets on her knees and pulls them out. 

           It’s a series of crayon images of the same boy -- the Boy. 
           One shows him standing in the farmhouse yard.

           Another by a lake. 

           One picture shows what appears to be Bryce, Alice, and Marina 
           sitting around the dining table. The Boy watches them from 
           outside the window. 
           Under the images are notes: 

           I’LL ALWAYS BE YOUR FRIEND.

           I’M WATCHING. 

           DON’T LET THEM LIE TO YOU.

           Alice’s eyes catch something further under the wardrobe. She 
           reaches under and pulls out Will’s bloodied ACE PLUMBING HAT.

           Alice puts a hand to her mouth and drops the construction 
           paper. One notes flutters to the top. In black crayon are the 
           words: 

           I’M OUTSIDE RIGHT NOW.

           RING. Alice’s cell phone rings in her pocket and she jumps. 
           Quickly moving from the room, she pulls out the phone and 
           answers it. 

                                 ALICE
                        Hello?

                                 OFFICER (O.S.)
                             (through the phone)
                        Alice Hess?

                                 ALICE
                        Yes?

           As Alice talks on the phone she makes her way out of the 
           room.

           INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Alice walks down the hallway listening to the phone.

                                 OFFICER (O.S.)
                        This is Office Hamilton of the 
                        Bowsman Police Department. Do you 
                        know a William Drakes?

                                 ALICE
                        Yes. He’s my... well, he was my... we 
                        broke up, recently... 

           INT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

           Alice walks down the stairs looking increasingly disturbed.
                                 OFFICER (O.S.)
                        Ms. Hess, would you be able to come 
                        down to the station and answer some 
                        questions? 

           INT. FOYER - CONTINUOUS

           Alice walks through the unlit foyer and toward the dining 
           room.

                                 ALICE
                        What’s this about?

                                 OFFICER (O.S.)
                        If you could just--

           INT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Alice is looking frightened.

                                 ALICE
                         What’s happened?

           INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Alice steps into the kitchen. Bryce’s crayons and paper are 
           at the table, but he is nowhere to be seen.

                                 OFFICER (O.S.)
                        William Drakes was found dead earlier 
                        today. His body was... mutilated. 
                        Would you be able to come down to the 
                        station and answer a few questions?

           There’s a folded piece of paper on the kitchen table. Alice 
           moves toward it. 

                                 OFFICER (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Ms. Hess? Ms. Hess? 

                                 ALICE
                        Tonight?

                                 OFFICER (O.S.)
                        I can send a squad car if that would 
                        be easier.

           Alice picks up the note.

                                 ALICE
                        No. That’s fine. I’ll come right 
                        away. 
           She clicks off the phone. She holds the paper, afraid to open 
           it. Finally she opens it. In the same childish writing are 
           the words: 

           I’M IN THE HOUSE.

           Someone runs past the kitchen door behind her. Alice spins. 

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        Bryce?

           INT. DINING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Alice rushes through the room searching for her son.

                                 ALICE
                        Bryce? We can’t play right now. 

           The house is now a gloomy dark. Alice clicks on the light, 
           but nothing happens.

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        Damn it.

           A small figure runs across the foyer, giggling. She squints 
           in the dim light.

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        Bryce? 

           INT. FOYER - CONTINUOUS

           Again she sees a shadow. It races along the landing above 
           her. Is is Bryce?

                                 ALICE
                        Bryce, you come down here right now. 
                        I am not kidding. Now.

           No reply. 

           Alice tries to keep her voice firm, but the fear can be 
           heard.

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        If I have to come up there...

           She steadies herself and starts climbing the stairs. She can 
           hear undecipherable whispers and hushed laughter. 

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        Bryce. Is someone with you? Bryce, 
                        can you hear me?
           She continues up the stairs, slowly. 

           INT. LANDING - CONTINUOUS

           Standing at the top of the stairs, Alice squints down the 
           dark hallway. A small figure stands in the shadows staring 
           back.

                                 ALICE
                        Bryce. I need you to come to me. 

           The figure doesn’t move.

                                 ALICE (CONT’D)
                        Right now, Bryce. Please. Come to 
                        Mommy.

           The figure remains still. 

                                 BRYCE (O.S.)
                        Mommy?

           Alice turns and looks down. Standing in the foyer below her 
           is Bryce. 

           She spins around. The small shadow is immediately before her. 
           Two small arms push out and shove Alice. 

           Alice falls backward, down the stairs, landing hard on the 
           floor of the...

           INT. FOYER - CONTINUOUS

           Her eyes blink. She sees Bryce’s legs. She hears giggling 
           from somewhere as everything goes black. 

           EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

           Marina walks along the deserted road. It’s dark and cold. 
           While she is still a good distance away, she see the 
           ambulance lights flashing against the farmhouse. 

           She runs.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - MINUTES LATER

           Marina arrives breathless. An ambulance and police squad fill 
           the drive. A woman POLICE OFFICER talks with Bryce on the 
           porch. As Marina approaches she can just hear the 
           conversation. 
                                 BRYCE
                             (nodding)
                        I guess she slipped or something.

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        Had your mother been drinking at all?

                                 BRYCE
                        I don’t know. Maybe.

           TWO AMBULANCE ATTENDANTS carry Alice on a stretcher from the 
           house. Marina runs to her side. She’s out. Her face is 
           bruised and her neck is braced. 

                                 MARINA
                        Alice?

           Alice’s eyes flutter open. She moves her lips, delirious. 
           Marina leans in close to hear.

                                 ALICE
                             (whisper)
                        Watch out for Bryce. 

                                 MARINA
                        Of course, I’ll take care of him.

           Alice grimaces. 

                                 ALICE
                        No. Watch out for him.

           The Attendants load her into the ambulance. 

           MINUTES LATER

           Marina stands on the porch holding Bryce’s hand as the 
           ambulance drives away.

           Bryce looks up to Marina.

                                 BRYCE
                        She’s going to be okay.

           Marina nods.

           Snow begins to fall again. 

           Bryce walks back inside. Marina waits a moment, watching the 
           snow.

           INT. FOYER - LATER

           Marina walks into the dark foyer. 
                                 MARINA
                        Bryce?

           To her right a match strikes illuminating Bryce in the LIVING 
           ROOM lighting an old oil lamp.

                                 BRYCE
                        The wiring is all jacked up. Mom says 
                        she’ll fix it. I don’t know.

           He lights a second lamp. Carrying one lamp and leaving the 
           other, he walks toward Marina. 

                                 BRYCE (CONT’D)
                        I’m not afraid of the dark. Are you?

                                 MARINA
                        How did your mom fall?

           Bryce shrugs.

                                 MARINA (CONT’D)
                        Was someone else in the house when it 
                        happened?

           Bryce doesn’t answer. The glow of his lamp surrounds the two 
           like a bubble. 

                                 MARINA (CONT’D)
                        Bryce are we alone now?

                                 BRYCE
                        I’m never alone.

           INT. CLINE HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Mrs. Cline spoons another swallow of soup into Rebecca’s 
           mouth. Rebecca sits in her bed, hardly reacting. Mrs. Cline 
           dabs at the soup on her daughter’s chin.

                                 MRS. CLINE
                        Wasn’t that nice to have a visit from 
                        Marina? And she’s all grown up. You 
                        three girls... you were inseparable. 
                        Do you remember.

           Rebecca moves her head toward the window, her eyes incredibly 
           sad. It’s clear she remembers much more than her mother. 

                                 MRS. CLINE (CONT’D)
                        All right, beddy-bed time.

           Mrs. Cline stands and using both arms carefully lowers her 
           daughter in the bed and kisses her forehead.
                                 MRS. CLINE (CONT’D)
                        Would you like to watch the snow? I 
                        know how you like that.

           Mrs. Cline pulls open the curtains. She picks up the tray 
           holding the soup bowl and moves to the door.

                                 MRS. CLINE (CONT’D)
                        Should be clearing up before morning. 
                        Won’t it look pretty. 
                             (clicking off the light)
                        Sleep tight.

           She backs out the door, closing it behind her. 

           Rebecca lays in the dark watching the snow fall outside her 
           window. Her eyes are filled with sadness. Her mouth moves, at 
           first making no noise. Then she quietly speaks one name. 

                                 REBECCA
                        Lily.

           Rebecca hears a creak of a door. She slowly turns her head 
           from the window to the closet. The closet door drifts 
           partially open. 

           Rebecca watches, staring into the blackness of the closet. 

           A noise. A shadow falls on her. Rebecca turns her head back 
           toward the window. Someone is there. We don’t see who. All we 
           see is Rebecca’s face - an expression not of fear, but 
           relief... her eyes wet with gratitude.   

           Rebecca nods slightly. A small hand flashes forward, 
           thrusting the small kitchen knife into Rebecca’s throat. 

           INT. BRYCE’S BEDROOM - LATER

           Marina sits beside the bed with the open book in her hands.

                                 MARINA
                             (reading)
                        You approach the cave and see the 
                        same man-eating tiger blocking the 
                        entrance. You step forward. “No,” 
                        says your guide. “Turn back before 
                        it’s too late!”

           The room glows yellow from the flickering flame of an oil 
           lamp. Bryce lays in bed in his pajamas. 
                                 MARINA (CONT’D)
                             (reading)
                        If you choose to take your guide’s 
                        advice, turn to page forty-three. If 
                        you choose to move forward, turn to 
                        page one hundred and nine.

                                 BRYCE
                        Keep going toward the cave.

                                 MARINA
                        Okay. Page one hundred and nine.

           INT. DR. WARD’S HOUSE - EVENING

           The front door opens and Dr. Ward’s daughter rushes in, 
           laughing. Dr. Ward follows, her arms full of grocery bags.

                                 DR. WARD
                             (smiling)
                        Okay, okay. You get the stove on.

           Dr. Ward sees the cell phone on the table reading: ONE 
           VOICEMAIL 

           Her smiles fades as if she knows what the message will be.

                                 DR. WARD (CONT’D)
                        Damn.

           INT. BRYCE’S BEDROOM - MINUTES LATER

           Marina sits watching Bryce asleep in his bed.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Alice’s cell phone glows and vibrates. 

           INT. BRYCE’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Marina quietly stands and moves to the door.

                                 BRYCE
                        Would you stay?

           Marina stops. 

                                 BRYCE (CONT’D)
                        Just a little bit longer.
                                 MARINA
                        Of course.

           She returns to her beside seat.

           EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

           Scratch - an red flare is lit by a POLICE OFFICER. He adds it 
           to the dozen or so burning flares surrounding a jack-knifed 
           eighteen wheeler laying on its side and blocking the highway. 

           Another 2nd POLICE OFFICER waves cars toward an exit.

           As the snow falls, a long line of slow moving traffic is 
           being diverted from the highway.

           INT. DR. WARD’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Dr. Ward frowns as she slowly follows the other cars. 

                                 DR. WARD
                        Come on.

           EXT.  FARM HOUSE - LATER

           The snow falls about the sleeping house.

           INT. BRYCE’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Marina dozes in the chair. Bryce sleeps in the bed. 

           The house is quiet, still.

           INT. FOYER - CONTINUOUS

           Nothing moves.

           INT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The table is clear. The chairs pushed in.

           INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           The colored pencils lay on the table, unmoving.
           INT. BRYCE’S BEDROOM 

           Bryce lays asleep. Marina still dozes in the chair.

           Bryce’s eyes open. He breathes quickly.

                                 BRYCE
                             (whisper)
                        He’s here.

           Bryce sits up. Marina wakes up and rubs her eyes.

                                 MARINA
                        You okay, Bryce?

                                 BRYCE
                             (frightened)
                        He’s here. 

           He jumps from the bed and runs out of the room. 

                                 MARINA
                        Bryce? Bryce?!

           She quickly shakes off the sleep as she stands, grabs the 
           lamp, and follows him.

           HALLWAY

           The hallway is empty. She lifts the lamp and stares into the 
           darkness. She begins walking to the...

           LANDING.

           Bryce runs from behind her and toward the stairs. 

                                 BRYCE
                             (frightened)
                        He’s here!

                                 MARINA
                             (firm)
                        Bryce!

           Bryce stops, surprised at her stern tone. He turns. 

           She kneels down to his level and locks his eyes.

                                 MARINA (CONT’D)
                             (firm)
                        Listen. Listen to me. There is no 
                        Boy. There is no Boy. 
           Bryce is breathing quickly. His drifts behind her. She 
           watches his face grow more and more terrified, his eyes on 
           something behind her.

           She keeps her eyes on him and shakes her head.

                                 MARINA (CONT’D)
                        There. Is. No. Boy.

           Bryce looks back to her. His breathing slows. His terror 
           recedes. 

           Marina nods. 

           Bryce slowly moves to her, calm.

           He puts up a hand slowly, palm forward. Marina raises her 
           palm too.

           Bryce slowly brings his hand closer, touching his thumb to 
           Marina’s pinky. Then, moving his hand to the words, he softly 
           sings...

                                 BRYCE
                             (singing)
                        Itsy bitsy spider went up the water 
                        spout. Down came the rain and washed 
                        the spider out.

           Marina’s face twists...

                                 MARINA
                        Stop. Stop now.

           Bryce quiets.

                                 MARINA (CONT’D)
                        Something in your head is lying to 
                        you. Look at me. Look at me. The Boy 
                        is not real. He never was.

           Bryce listens... Marina’s words are reaching him. He nods and 
           almost smiles.

                                 CHILD’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Bryce.

           The smiles dies.

           The voice comes from the foyer below. Marina’s face flashes 
           pale.

                                 BRYCE
                        He’s here.
           Bryce throws his arms around Marina’s neck. Marina is too 
           terrified to speak.

                                 BRYCE (CONT’D)
                             (whispering, frantic)
                        I don’t want to go. I don’t want to 
                        see him. Please, Marina. Please.

           Marina squeezes her eyes closed.

                                 MARINA
                        He is not real. I do not believe in 
                        you. I don’t believe.

                                 BRYCE
                        If you don’t believe... nothing will 
                        happen. 

           Marina opens here eyes.

                                 CHILD’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Bryce...

           Bryce looks toward the stairs.

           Marina shakes her head.

           Bryce steps back slowly, pulling himself from Marina’s grip. 
           Marina, still kneeling, topples against the landing wall. She 
           tries to say, “No.” But can’t make the words.

           Bryce moves to the top of the stairs. 

                                 CHILD’S VOICE (CONT’D)
                        It’s time. 

           Bryce turns and looks at Marina. She reaches out, but cannot 
           move from the wall.

           Bryce walks down the stairs.

           EXT. FARM HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           A car pulls up to the dark house. Dr. Ward climbs from the 
           driver’s seat, leaving the headlights on.

           She runs to the front door.

           INT. LANDING/FOYER - CONTINUOUS

           Marina, still frozen in fear, hears the front door open. 
                                 DR. WARD (O.S.)
                        Hello. I’m sorry. I’m Dr. Ward. Are 
                        you alone here?

           The sound of her doctor’s voice helps Marina break through. 
           She crawls toward the landing banister.  

                                 MARINA
                             (quiet, nearly inaudible)
                        Dr. Ward.

                                 BRYCE (O.S.)
                        My Aunt’s here. She’s--

                                 MARINA
                             (loudly)
                        Dr. Ward!

           Marina pulls herself to her feet and looks down into the 
           foyer. Dr. Ward stands alone with Bryce in the middle of the 
           foyer, lit by the headlights streaming through the window. 

           Dr. Ward smiles reassuringly up at Marina. 

                                 DR. WARD
                        It’s all right, Marina. Everything is 
                        fine.

                                 MARINA
                        I heard him. I heard his voice. 

                                 DR. WARD
                        It was a psychological relapse. Just 
                        games your mind is playing games. 
                        Come on down.

           Marina moves to the stairs, gripping the bannister.

                                 DR. WARD (CONT’D)
                        We’re going to get you help. We’ll 
                        get past this.

                                 MARINA
                        But...

                                 DR. WARD
                        You’re safe, Marina.

           Marina takes the first step down. She stops. The heater grate 
           on the wall is off. Her mouth opens.

                                 DR. WARD (CONT’D)
                         Marina, nothing can--
           A tiny pale hand reaches from behind Dr. Ward and slices her 
           throat.

           Marina falls to her knees on the stairs. She grabs for the 
           railing, but slides forward.

           MARINA’S POV - the foyer is a moving blur. Someone stands 
           above Dr. Ward writhing on the floor. Marina sees the 
           figure’s shoes - worn, brown leather. The figure takes 
           Bryce’s hand and leads him out the door.

           Marina struggles to her feet and runs down to Dr. Ward.

           Dr. Ward, her eyes wide, stares into Marina’s. She tries to 
           speak, her hands pushing against her slashed neck. 

                                 DR. WARD (CONT’D)
                        Go! Go help...

           With one hand Marina holds Dr. Ward’s head. With the other 
           she grips her silver cross.

                                 DR. WARD (CONT’D)
                        Go help him.

           Marina shakes her head, gripping the cross.

                                 MARINA
                        God will protect us. God will protect 
                        us.

           Dr. Ward reaches up and grabs the hand holding the cross. She 
           yanks. The necklace snaps off of Marina’s neck.

                                 DR. WARD
                        Go!

           She stops moving. Her eyes are still open. 

           Marina stands, leaving the cross on Dr. Ward’s chest.

           She looks to the door. The fear is still there, but with 
           something new. An anger. A determination. 

           She opens the front door completely. Two sets of small 
           footsteps lead away from the house and toward the nearby 
           wood. 

           EXT. MEADOW - NIGHT

           The moon lights the snowy landscape. Marina follows the 
           footprints. In a shot that parallels the opening shots of the 
           film, we watch her move toward the woods.
           As she approaches the first line of trees she can hear the 
           faint echo of “Itsy Bitsy Spider” she and the girls sang so 
           many years before. Her memories are returning.

           She hesitates for a moment before the trees then steps on.

           EXT. WOODS - CONTINUOUS

           The woods are shadow and light - bare trees casting black 
           shadows on the new, moonlit snow, moving as she walks. 

           She can hear the echo of Rebecca, Lily and herself.

                                 YOUNG LILY (O.C.)
                        It’s colder than I thought. 

                                 YOUNG REBECCA (O.C.)
                        It’s not that cold, Lily.

           Marina looks through the trees and sees Lily walking just as 
           she was sixteen years before.

                                 YOUNG LILY 
                        Feels like it’s freezing.

           Marina closes her eyes and reopens them. There’s nothing but 
           trees and snow.

           She keeps her focus on the footsteps in the snow. They are 
           more difficult to follow in the woods.

           She walks on, growing more and more confused. 

           She sees Rebecca and Lily. Lily runs her hands along a birch 
           tree. 

                                 YOUNG LILY (CONT’D)
                        It’s even colder here.

                                 YOUNG REBECCA
                        We’re out of the sun, that’s all.

                                 MARINA
                             (whispering)
                        No.

           Lily and Rebecca disappear into the night like mist.

           DEEPER IN THE WOODS...

           Marina stumbles on, disoriented. She runs into a row of 
           trees.
           Marina can hear the tapping of Lily’s stick against these 
           same trees. Lily, small and pale, walks in front of her. 

                                 YOUNG LILY
                        All the trees are dead.

           Marina shakes her head, trying to shake off the memories. 

           Lily screams from somewhere, everywhere.

                                 YOUNG LILY (O.C.) (CONT’D)
                        Please! Wait! Please!

           Marina walks forward, struggling.

                                 MARINA
                             (sotto)
                        No. I don’t want to remember. 

                                 YOUNG REBECCA (O.C.)
                        Do it, Marina. Do it!

                                 MARINA
                        No. Please.

           Lily’s cries and struggle seem to fill the woods all around 
           Marina. 

           Marina sees Lily’s unmoving, small, bleeding body lying in 
           the snow.

                                 MARINA (CONT’D)
                        Oh, God. Lily!

           Marina rushes to her and tries to block the bleeding. The 
           body disappears as she touches it. Marina’s hands sink into 
           the icy brook. 

                                 YOUNG LILY (O.C.)
                             (choked whisper)
                        Marina! Marina!

           Marina closes her eyes.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. WOODS - BROOK - 16 YEARS BEFORE - DUSK 

           IN THE MEMORY, Marina faces Rebecca holding Lily before her. 
           She holds a small black-handled kitchen knife in her hand. 

                                 YOUNG REBECCA
                        Do it now. Marina. It’s what he 
                        wants. Now.
           Marina breathes. She grips the knife but has not moved.

                                 YOUNG REBECCA (CONT’D)
                        Now!

           Marina shakes her head.

                                 YOUNG MARINA
                        No.

           Rebecca looks furious. She shoves Lily down into the water. 
           Lily limply crawls in the water.

           Rebecca stomps to Marina, putting her face an inch from 
           Marina’s face. Rebecca’s face softens for just a moment.

                                 YOUNG REBECCA
                             (whisper)
                        It’s okay. 

           Rebecca smiles and kisses young Marina’s cheek. 

                                 YOUNG REBECCA (CONT’D)
                        He always loved me most.

           Rebecca snatches the knife from Marina’s hand. She turns, 
           raises the knife, and pounces on Lily.

           Marina screams. 

                                                           CUT BACK TO:

           EXT. WOODS - BROOK - PRESENT - NIGHT

           BACK IN THE PRESENT, Marina opens her eyes.

           Standing before her is her younger self. Young Marina reaches 
           out a hand to Marina. Marina takes it. 

           Young Marina leads her through the woods. 

                                 YOUNG MARINA
                        He’s this way.

           The young girl stops and points through the trees. Marina 
           stares down at the girl, unsure, unbelieving. 

                                 BRYCE (O.S.)
                        Help! 

           Marina leaves the ghostly figure and rushes through the 
           brush, branches snagging on her clothes and hair. 
           She pushes through a wall of brush. She hears Bryce’s frantic 
           breathing nearby. She falls forward through the branches and 
           lands on the ground of a clearing. 

           From the ground, Marina looks forward and sees the worn 
           leather shoes standing beside Bryce’s sneakers. She looks 
           up...

           In the center of the clearing, Bryce stands, the point of the 
           paring knife pressing against his throat. Beside him, in the 
           worn shoes, stands a petite woman... Mrs. Bellows. 

                                 MRS. BELLOWS
                        Hello, Marina.

           Marina stops, staring. She squints at Mrs. Bellows. Her left 
           hand, which holds Bryce’s chest, is missing the pinky finger. 

                                 MARINA
                        Lily?

           Mrs. Bellows - Lily as an adult - smiles, a little sad, a 
           little insecure.

                                 LILY BELLOWS
                        It’s been a long time. I wasn’t sure 
                        you’d remember. 

                                 MARINA
                             (standing)
                        Please. Please don’t hurt him. 

                                 LILY BELLOWS
                        You were the weak one. Rebecca, she 
                        was strong. A natural leader. And me, 
                        I was the boldest. But you... you 
                        just followed. 

                                 MARINA
                        I’m so sorry, Lily. I am so sorry for 
                        what we did to--

                                 LILY BELLOWS
                             (angry)
                        We agreed! We agreed! I would be the 
                        sacrifice! Me! He chose me. But 
                        you... you couldn’t even raise the 
                        knife, couldn’t even finish the job. 

                                 MARINA
                        Lily...

                                 LILY BELLOWS
                        You failed him. You failed me. I 
                        trusted you. I trusted you.
                                 MARINA
                        Please, Lily.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. WOODS - LAKE BOWSMAN - 16 YEARS AGO - EARLY EVENING

           IN THE MEMORY, Young Marina is kneeling by the bloody body of 
           young Lily. Lily’s lips are moving and Marina lowers her ear 
           to Lily’s mouth.

                                 LILY
                        I want to see him. I want to see him.

                                                           CUT BACK TO:

           EXT. WOODS - LAKE BOWSMAN - PRESENT - NIGHT

           Marina shakes her head. Lily points her knife, her voice 
           breaking with emotion.

                                 LILY BELLOWS
                        You left me bleeding here all alone. 
                        I asked him to take me. I begged him. 
                        Till the moment they found me, I 
                        begged him. 

                                 MARINA
                        He’s not real, Lily.

           Lily shakes her head. She looks sad for Marina.

                                 LILY BELLOWS
                        Oh, Marina, you just don’t 
                        understand. The moment the knife cut 
                        my skin, he was real.

           As she speaks she presses the point of the knife more firmly 
           against Bryce’s neck. A thin line of blood trickles from the 
           point where the knife meets the neck.

                                 LILY BELLOWS (CONT’D)
                        The most real thing in the world.

           Marina steps forward. 

                                 MARINA
                        Please. Let him go, Lily. You can do 
                        whatever you want to me. Just let him 
                        go.
                                 LILY BELLOWS
                        I had to lure you back. Had to break 
                        in to your house, leave you notes, 
                        do... things... had to make you 
                        remember, Marina. You are not your 
                        own. He claims you. I had to help you 
                        see with the eyes of faith again so 
                        you could see him...  

           Marina looks to Bryce.

                                 LILY BELLOWS (CONT’D)
                        But he doesn’t want you anymore, 
                        Marina. He wants this boy. I’m going 
                        to do what you couldn’t do! What you 
                        wouldn’t do! I’m going to do as he 
                        asks.

           Bryce kicks back into Lily’s knee and tears free. She turns 
           to pursue Bryce.

                                 LILY BELLOWS (CONT’D)
                        Come here, Bryce. Come back.

           Bryce stands, confused.

                                 MARINA
                        Run, Bryce!

           Bryce darts away. Lily moves after him, but Marina runs and 
           tackles Lily.  

           Lily pushes her off and gets to her feet, brandishing the 
           knife. Marina stands, ready to fight. 

           Lily slashes with the knife, cutting through Marina’s jacket 
           to her arm. Marina swings her arms, her fist slamming against 
           the side of Lily’s head. Lily staggers sideways, but recovers 
           herself. 

           Lily runs at Marina and thrusts the knife into Marina’s 
           belly. 

           Marina falls back onto the snow. Lily straddles her, 
           stabbing. Marina lifts her hand, her palm absorbing some of 
           the stabs. But many hit Marina in the chest.

           Lily stops, staring at the bloody, still-breathing Marina 
           beneath her. Lily leans in close to Marina’s ear. 

                                 LILY BELLOWS
                             (whispering)
                        I’m going to leave you like you left 
                        me. Alone. Hurting. Dying. And I’m 
                        going to cut your nephew’s throat.
           Lily stands. Marina tries, but can’t move from the ground.

                                 MARINA
                        Don’t.

                                 LILY BELLOWS
                        You never had the faith, Marina. 
                        Never had the eyes to see.

           Marina watches helplessly as Lily walks in the direction 
           Bryce ran.

           EXT. WOODS - LAKE BOWSMAN - NIGHT

           Bryce runs through the woods, frantic and unthinking.

           He bursts from the brush to Lake Bowsman, the frozen surface 
           gleaming like silver in the moonlight. 

           Positioned on rocks along the shore he sees a series of 
           objects: a baseball, a small pair of antique wire-rimmed 
           glasses, and the school book Every Boy’s Reader.

           He turns back to the woods, listening for any pursuing 
           footsteps. His breathing is the only sound. He waits, 
           expecting something. But no one comes. He turns and comes 
           face to face with Lily. She brings a finger to her lips. 

                                 LILY BELLOWS
                        Shhhh.

           Lily grabs Bryce by the neck of his sweater. He loses his 
           feet as she walks out onto the lake. She drags him by the 
           sweater collar, his struggling body sliding along the ice. 

           Lily wipes some tears from her eyes.

                                 LILY BELLOWS (CONT’D)
                        Bryce... we’re going to see him. 
                        We’ll see him, you and me. What a 
                        beautiful night. 

           The ice cracks beneath her feet, but Lily doesn’t seem to 
           care. She doesn’t slow her stride.

                                 LILY BELLOWS (CONT’D)
                        Years. I’ve been faithful for years. 
                        What a beautiful night. We’ll him 
                        blood. We’ll be his forever.

                                 BRYCE
                        Let me go! Let me go!
                                 LILY BELLOWS
                        I struggled too. It’s just instinct, 
                        I think.

           Lily pauses and looks up at the clear winter sky.

                                 LILY BELLOWS (CONT’D)
                        That moon is wonderful, isn’t it?  

           She pulls out a pair of hand clippers and looks down at 
           Bryce. She lifts her four-fingered hand.

                                 LILY BELLOWS (CONT’D)
                        People just don’t respect things 
                        unless it costs them something.

           Bryce cowers as Lily bends toward him.

                                 MARINA (O.S.)
                        Lily.

           Lily looks to see Marina standing near holding a large 
           branch. She swings it, connecting with Lily’s head. Lily 
           lands on the ice with a loud smack, the ice cracking out in 
           every direction.

           Marina helps Bryce to his feet.

                                 MARINA (CONT’D)
                        I’ve got you. I’ve got you, Bryce. 

           She falls to one knee, holding her wounds.

           Bryce helps her stand and the two stagger back toward the 
           shore. Marina limps, leaning on Bryce.

           Behind them, Lily slowly stands and stares.

                                 LILY BELLOWS
                        Please, Marina. 

                                 MARINA
                             (to Bryce)
                        Keep walking.

                                 LILY BELLOWS
                        Please.

                                 MARINA
                        Don’t listen.

           The two are near the shore now.

                                 LILY BELLOWS
                        Don’t fail him again.
           Crack. Lily falls, disappearing through the ice.

           Marina and Bryce turn. Lily splashes in the freezing water.

           Marina locks eyes with Bryce.

                                 MARINA
                        Get to the shore. I have to help her.

                                 BRYCE
                             (shaking his head)
                        No.

                                 MARINA
                        I have to.

           Marina turns back to Lily, moving as fast as she can on the 
           ice.  

           Bryce backs off the ice on to the shore. 

           Marina moves slowly as the ice cracks more under her feet. 
           She gets to her belly, crawling out to the hole, leaving a 
           long smear of blood on the ice.

           Lily flails in the water.

                                 MARINA (CONT’D)
                        Hold on, Lily! Hold on.

           Marina reaches out to the thrashing woman. She manges to grab 
           a sleeve of her coat and pull her. 

                                 LILY BELLOWS
                             (yelling)
                        No!

           Lily’s eyes are wild and open.

                                 LILY BELLOWS (CONT’D)
                        Let him take me. 

           Marina tries to pull Lily from the water. 

                                 LILY BELLOWS (CONT’D)
                        Let him have me.

           Lily meets Marina’s eyes, both are still for a moment.

           From out of the ice water two small hands emerge and clasp on 
           to Lily’s shoulders. Marina can make out a face just under 
           the surface - the Boy. 

           Feeling the hands, Lily SCREAMS. Her eyes never leave 
           Marina’s. The hands tighten their grip and yank her under.  
           Marina lays by the hole, gasping in breaths of air. She 
           stares into the water as it grows still. 

           She rolls over on her back, gazing at the sky above her. 
           Three black birds fly by.

                                 BRYCE 
                             (calling out)
                        Aunt Marina!

           Marina sits up, seeing Bryce standing on the shore.

           She struggles to her feet. Stepping forward, she takes a deep 
           breath and smiles toward Bryce.  

           She looks back at the hole. The water is still, quiet.

           She turns back to Bryce. Just behind him stands the Boy.

                                 MARINA
                        Bryc--

           Two arms reach from the ice, grab her ankles. She falls 
           forward, still on the ice for half a second, then is pulled 
           back and into the hole.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

                               THE END
