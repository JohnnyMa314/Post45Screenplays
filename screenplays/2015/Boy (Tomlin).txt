                        Today marks the three year 
                        anniversary of the death of Danny 
                        Drake.

           Blurry hand held camera phone footage struggles to focus. A 
           crowd of fifty circle a telephone pole. 

           The BODY of DANNY DRAKE (Caucasian, 16) is hoisted limply 
           into the air by his neck. The disturbing image quickly cuts 
           to a FEMALE NEWSCASTER.

                                 NEWS CASTER (CONT’D)
                        This iconic footage was taken by an 
                        amateur photographer in Pulaski, 
                        Tennessee when the sixteen-year-old 
                        was publicly lynched after 
                        displaying what locals then called 
                        “an unnatural disposition.”

           Pulling out- the report is unfolding on a TELEVISION anchored 
           in a high corner within the walls of:

           INT. FIRST NATIONAL BANK - DAY

           MARLA MADNICK (45) eyes the television surreptitiously from 
           behind the teller counter. A CUSTOMER approaches her and she 
           begins to make their deposit. Her eyes continue to dart up to 
           the television.

                                 NEWS CASTER
                        His murder sparked protests, 
                        debates, and endless cries for 
                        proof of the existence of what 
                        could be a new race of people, what 
                        some are coming to call- Ander-
                        Humans.

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY

           MIKE MADNICK (African American, 16) sits in a classroom, 
           bored. MR. SELTZER (30) stands in front of Mike and two dozen 
           teenagers. The chalkboard behind him has the words RACE CLASS 
           GENDER GENETICS on it.

                                 SELTZER
                        Race, genetic superiority... Guys, 
                        these aren’t new ideas. This is 
                        what most wars have been about. 
                        This is what Danny Drake was really 
                        about.
           Mike’s phone buzzes. He looks down to his lap. On the screen- 
           ANDREA: Hey :) 

           Mike looks over his shoulder to meet the gaze of ANDREA 
           (heart-achingly pretty 16) smiling at him.

                                 SELTZER (CONT’D)
                        Mike.

                                 MIKE
                        Huh?

                                 SELTZER
                        Phone. Seriously. Mrs. Evans can 
                        hear that thing vibrating in the 
                        lab downstairs. 

                                 MIKE
                        Sorry.

           The class murmurs with delight at Seltzer’s catch. Mike tucks 
           the phone away. 

                                 SELTZER
                        But this triple helix. The Z-
                        Chromosome. We can’t racially 
                        profile this. It’s more than skin 
                        deep. It’s not class, it’s not... 
                        Race per se, and yet there is 
                        already a well developed elitism. 
                        Born completely out of fear.

           A folded up triangle of paper hits Mike’s shoe. Mike waits 
           for Seltzer to turn away and quickly picks it up, unfolds it. 

           Are you going to Ross’s party tnt? :) 

           Mike writes below it. Probably not. Mike refolds the football 
           carefully. 

           Seltzer turns his back. Mike flicks the note with his thumb. 
           The paper football sails over his head and lands perfectly on 
           Andrea’s desk.

                                 SELTZER (CONT’D)
                        Genetic purity, versus genetic 
                        superiority... I mean this was 
                        Hitler’s doctorate, only now 
                        there’s a science behind it.

           A student raises her hand.

                                 SELTZER (CONT’D)
                        Yeah.
           The football-note hits Mike’s shoe again. He grabs for it, 
           opens it.

                                 STUDENT
                        How is it a superiority?

                                 SELTZER
                        Well, for all we know it’s a 
                        deformity. For all we know it’s 
                        what makes some people like 
                        chocolate and others like vanilla. 
                        But there has yet to be a society 
                        that doesn’t create sides... Except 
                        Switzerland.

           Mom + Dad don’t have to know... Mike smiles to himself. He 
           pockets the note. 

           EXT. BANK PARKING LOT - DAY

           Marla walks out of the bank and towards her car. Across the 
           busy street, a large BILLBOARD is being erected by two 
           workers. 

           Marla gets into her car, eyeing the billowing advertisement. 
           She can make out - “GET TESTED - and the word FUTURE on the 
           other end. She drives off.

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY

           Mike trades books from his bag to his locker in the swarming 
           hallway. 

           A kid walks by with a bright yellow Remember Danny Drake t-
           shirt on. Mike takes notice of it.

           Andrea hops out of the sea of students, leaning on the locker 
           next to his.

                                 ANDREA
                        So....

                                 MIKE
                        I’ll try.

                                 ANDREA
                        You’re not going to make me go to a 
                        party full of boys alone, are you?

                                 MIKE
                        Alright, alright, alright. Yeah.
                                 ANDREA
                        Yes?

                                 MIKE
                        Yeah.

           Andrea wraps her arms around him.

                                 ANDREA
                        I’ve gotta go to practice.

                                 MIKE
                        I’ll see you there.

           She smiles and disappears into the swarming hallway.

           EXT. FOOTBALL FIELD - DAY

           FOOTBALL PLAYERS slam into each other aggressively on the 
           field. They holler back and forth.

           Backpack slung over his shoulder, Mike stares out at football 
           and cheer practice taking place on opposite sides of the 
           field.

           He watches the Varsity team practice balefully.

           Amongst the cheerleaders, Andrea notices him. She waves. He 
           waves back.

           A hairy HAND slaps him on his shoulder.

                                 COACH REZNICK
                        Mr. Madnick.

           COACH REZNICK (50s and suave for a coach) comes up behind 
           Mike.

                                 MIKE
                        Hey, Coach.

                                 COACH REZNICK
                        You keep coming out here like this, 
                        you’re gonna give me hope that you 
                        might actually join this team one 
                        day.

                                 MIKE
                        Yeah... Maybe.

                                 COACH REZNICK
                        Talk to your folks yet?
                                 MIKE
                        Uh... Nope. Didn’t get around to it 
                        yet.

           Coach nods. He’s seen this before.

                                 COACH REZNICK
                        You think it might help if I gave 
                        them a call? I’ve been known to 
                        deal with squirrely parents before.

           Mike smiles at this idea.

                                 MIKE
                        I wouldn’t want to put you through 
                        my dad’s speeches. You know uh... 
                        Old football accident in the 
                        family. His Uncle’s cousin’s 
                        brother. Something like that. He 
                        can get pretty passionate.

           Coach nods. Waits for another lead... Nothing.

                                 COACH REZNICK
                        Well. There’s always a place here 
                        for you, if you can talk your folks 
                        into it. I think you’d make a hell 
                        of a team player.

           Reznick passes Mike and walks towards the field. Mike watches 
           him go. Reznick blows his whistle and the team begins to form 
           a line.

           Mike nods, resigned. 

                                 MIKE
                        Yeah...

           INT. MOVING CAR - DUSK

           SCOTT MADNICK (45) drives in his Subaru down the highway. NPR 
           plays on the radio.

                                 LAWRENCE DRAKE (V.O.)
                        I just... He was just a boy. And he 
                        was so special. And we killed him. 
                        That’s what we did. As a society we 
                        failed him.
                                 NPR WOMAN (V.O.)
                        That’s the voice of Lawrence Drake, 
                        Danny’s father, shortly after Shawn 
                        Miller, Paul Doyle and Andrea 
                        Frears were acquitted of the murder 
                        of his son. 

           Scott looks extremely troubled as he listens.

                                 RIVER (V.O.)
                        I was in total shock. Total shock. 
                        The fact that we’re not treating 
                        these people as humans- I mean, 
                        this is the beginning of the fourth 
                        reich.

                                 NPR WOMAN (V.O.)
                        River Dolan isn’t alone in the 
                        sentiment. Since August 2016, 
                        protests and riots have been 
                        regularly staged around the world 
                        in demand for the rights of these 
                        individuals. Despite the public 
                        outcries, or possibly because of 
                        it, those with the z-chromosome 
                        remain few and far between.

           INT. MADNICK HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           Mike, Marla, and Scott eat at the dinner table together. 

                                 SCOTT
                        I was thinking this weekend we 
                        could go to Providence. Do the 
                        Fudge Festival.

                                 MARLA
                        We haven’t done that for a few 
                        years.

                                 SCOTT
                        What do you think?

                                 MIKE
                        Uh... Have to check the ol’ 
                        schedule, but I think I can make 
                        it.

                                 SCOTT
                        Look at this guy.

                                 MARLA
                        Junior in High School.
                                 MIKE
                        Yeah. You know, Coach Reznick asked 
                        me to try out for football again.

                          MARLA
                                                      SCOTT
           No.
                                           No.

           Everyone looks surprised at the synchronicity. 

                                 MARLA
                        I think... That... Is a lot of 
                        contact. And that’s not-

                                 SCOTT
                        He’s not letting up, huh? Do you 
                        want me to give him a call?

           Mike shrugs. Marla eyes him.

                                 MARLA
                        Or is he not letting up because 
                        you’re giving him a reason to keep 
                        asking?

                                 MIKE
                        It’d be nice to be on a team. 
                        Normal even-

                                 SCOTT
                        It’s too-

                                 MIKE
                        I know. 

           Marla smiles supportively.

                                 MARLA
                        There are other teams you could 
                        join... Chess?

           Mike shoots her a look.

                                 MIKE
                        What about track?

           Marla and Scott exchange glances.

                                 SCOTT
                        You like running?

           Mike shrugs- not really.

                                 MARLA
                        We can talk about that...
           Scott nods, seriously considering the new thought.

                                 SCOTT
                        Yeah. We’ll talk about it.

           INT. MADNICK HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Marla does dishes in the kitchen. A mini television sits on 
           the corner of the counter, playing the news. Marla watches it 
           carefully.

           On the TV: 

           An open palm print, fingers spread. Three animated ribbons, 
           red, yellow and blue snake their way around the fingers, 
           meeting mid-palm and forming a triangular helix that spirals 
           down the wrist..

                        The future has always rested on the 
                        shoulders of our children. Today we 
                        are entering a wondrous new age.

           A monarch butterfly crawls out of a chrysalis.

           An adolescent ASIAN GIRL smiles before a white background. 
           She holds a butterfly in her open hands.

                                 COMMERCIAL (V.O.)

           A SMILING MOTHER spins with the little girl. 

           Marla snaps the television off- her reflection can be seen in 
           the dimmed screen. She’s not happy.

           In the other room adjacent to the kitchen, Marla listens to 
           the sound of Scott and Mike laughing together.

                                 SCOTT (O.S.)
                        There’s no comparison between them. 
                        Two different lives. 

                                 MIKE (O.S.)
                        Ray Charles is the king!

                                 SCOTT (O.S.)
                        Ray Charles had a solid 40 years on 
                        him. Sam Cooke died when he was 33 
                        It’s just not a fair comparison. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 SCOTT (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        I’m not arguing with you, I’m 
                        saying it’s not fair. Put that 
                        thing on.

           Marla smiles, listening to them.

           INT. MADNICK HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - SAME MOMENTS

           Mike is kneeling by a record player. Scott is lying on his 
           back on the floor with a laptop open next to him.

           Mike places a record on the turntable and Sam Cooke’s Another 
           Saturday Night begins.

                                 MIKE
                        Then who’s the king of soul?

                                 SCOTT
                        Jerry Wexler.

           Mike and Scott start cracking up.

           The laptop spits out a CD. Sharpie cap in his mouth, Scott 
           writes on the CD and tosses it to Mike.

                                 SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        Go ahead and learn something, huh? 
                        Just because Sam Cooke hasn’t had a 
                        movie made about him doesn’t mean 
                        you shouldn’t know him.

           Mike catches the CD. It read’s RAD-DAD-TUNES. He reaches over 
           to a portable YELLOW CD PLAYER. He places Rad-Dad-Tunes on 
           the mount and closes the port.

           INT. MADNICK HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           The lights are off. The house is quiet. Photos rest on the 
           wall. Happy Family. 

           INT. MADNICK HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           The dishwasher finishes its last cycle, silently clicking 
           itself off. 

           INT. MADNICK HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           The upstairs hallway is quiet. All of the doors are closed.
           INT. MADNICK HOUSE - MARLA’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Marla and Scott are asleep in bed together. Marla bolts 
           upright, shocked out of a nightmare. 

           She breathes, calming herself. She looks to the clock. It 
           reads 11:17. She looks to the hallway door, shaking herself 
           back to reality. 

           INT. MADNICK HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Marla walks down the hallway. She reaches Mike’s door. She 
           pushes it open. 

           INT. MADNICK HOUSE - MARLA’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           The light clicks on. Marla shakes Scott awake.

                                 MARLA
                        Scott. Scott. Scott.

           Scott stirs.

                                 SCOTT
                        What?

                                 MARLA
                        He’s gone.

                                 SCOTT
                            (groggy)
                        God... Damn it. 

           INT. MADNICK HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Scott crouches in front of the freezer. He removes a small 
           black pouch. He unzips it. 

           He holds a vial that reads METHOHEXITAL. He injects a syringe 
           into the top, withdrawing the plunger. He caps the syringe 
           and preps another one.

           INT. MADNICK HOUSE - MIKE’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Marla dumps out the contents of Mike’s backpack on his bed. 
           She quickly sifts through them.

                                 MARLA
                        Where are you...
           She turns to the pile of clothes on the floor. She dives 
           through the pockets in his pants before getting to his 
           sweatshirt. She reaches into the pocket and removes a note 
           folded like a football. 

           She unwraps it.

           EXT. MADNICK HOUSE - NIGHT

           Pulling their jackets on, Scott and Marla get into their 
           Subaru. 

           INT. SUBARU - NIGHT

           Scott’s in the drivers seat. He reaches within his jacket and 
           pulls out a capped syringe, handing it over to Marla.

                                 MARLA
                        We don’t need that.

                                 SCOTT
                        It’s just in case.

           Marla regards him gravely as he starts the car.

           EXT. TOWN STREETS - NIGHT

           The car meanders through quiet suburbia. All is quiet. Calm.

           INT. SUBARU - NIGHT

           Marla keeps her eyes out the passenger window. 

                                 MARLA
                        Let me go in on my own.

                                 SCOTT
                        We’re going in together.

                                 MARLA
                        It’ll be less embarrassing for him.

           Marla looks over to him.

                                 MARLA (CONT’D)
                        He’s sixteen, Scott.

                                 SCOTT
                        FUCK.
           Scott bangs his hand on the steering wheel.

                                 SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        This is not the time to make 
                        excuses and rationalize for him. It 
                        just takes one slip up, Marla!

                                 MARLA
                        I know! Just calm down.

           Scott grimaces, squeezing the wheel. 

                                 MARLA (CONT’D)
                        If you want him to be normal, you 
                        have to just let him be normal. 

           Scott shakes his head, sitting on his frustration.

                                 SCOTT
                        Normal.

           EXT. ROSS’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           A wide yard surrounds a newly built lit up McMansion.

           High school kids swarm around a house that is vibrating with 
           the bass of house music. 

           The Madnick’s drive down the street slowly, passing smoking 
           kids on the sidewalk.

           They park and exit the car, heading directly to the house.

           The music from within envelops them. The party comes with an 
           electric fervor- an imminent explosion. 

           At the open front door, a small group of teenagers stand in 
           the way. They look at the pair, unimpressed. Marla returns 
           their looks with a no-nonsense glare. 

           They make a path for her.

           INT. ROSS’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           The house is dark, crowded with kids, hazed with smoke. 
           Yells, whoops, cheers and the sound of shattering bottles 
           barely penetrate the overwhelming beat of music. 

           Marla cuts through the crowd with Scott close behind her.
           They gaze over the sea of kids, looking for Mike. A group of 
           guys are doing body shots off girls with open shirts on a 
           large dining room table. Mike isn’t among them.

           Marla looks up. 

           INT. ROSS’S HOUSE - TOP FLOOR - NIGHT

           On the second floor, Marla and Scott go down a narrow dark 
           hallway, crisscrossing with kids. 

           She peeks her head into a slightly open doorway.

           On the other side of the room in a wicker chair bowl, Mike 
           and Andrea are making out- his hands cruise smoothly inside 
           her shirt over her back.

           Marla steps into the room.

           INT. ROSS’S HOUSE - PARTY ROOM - NIGHT

           There’s a group of kids between them sitting in a circle 
           smoking pot. Laughing, oblivious.

                                 MARLA
                        Mike.

           The music is too loud.

                                 MARLA (CONT’D)
                        Michael!

           He can’t hear her. One of the kids in the room taps Mike. He 
           breaks from kissing Andrea and catches Marla’s eye over her 
           shoulder.

                                 MIKE
                        What the fuck?

           Andrea turns- stumbling off of Mike in surprise. Mike stays 
           glued to the chair. 

           Scott takes a step from the hallway into the doorway. Mike 
           catches his angry eyes.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing here?

           Mike looks around. The whole room is staring at him. Marla 
           takes a step forward, offering her hand.
                                 MARLA
                        Come on, Michael-

           Mike slaps her hand away and shoots out of his chair. His CD 
           player falls onto the floor.

                                 MIKE
                        This is so fucked up!

           Marla grabs onto him, wrapping her arms around his neck in a 
           hug- bringing her face to his ear. She whispers loudly to 
           him:

                                 MARLA
                        Don’t do this. Don’t. Don’t. 

           Photos propped up on a nearby bookshelf are vibrating- it’s 
           hard to tell if it’s from the bass or something else.

           Mike stops struggling. They linger like that for a moment. 
           Marla breaks away from him. Mike has hate in his eyes, 
           holding back tears of embarrassment.

                                 MARLA (CONT’D)
                        It’s okay.

           She takes a step backwards. Mike hesitates for a moment. He 
           looks back over to Andrea, who stands in the corner, 
           mortified, holding the CD player.

           INT. ROSS’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Scott leads the way down the stairs. Mike follows with Marla 
           taking up the rear. The music still plays, but the attention 
           is overwhelmingly on them.

           Mike keeps his eyes to the ground as they go down the stairs. 

           He passes by ROSS ELROY (18) and a group of FOOTBALL JOCKS 
           who laugh among themselves. 

                                 ROSS
                        Run home, Forrest!

           They start to mockingly cheer and applaud Mike.

           The Madnick’s reach the front door and walk out. It closes 
           behind Marla with a SLAM:
           INT. MADNICK HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           The front door SLAMS behind Scott as the last one into the 
           house.

           It’s quiet. The clock on the wall tick. Tick. Ticks. 

           Marla sits on the arm of a couch. Mike sits in the middle of 
           the couch, holding a couch pillow. Scott stands, crossing his 
           arms.

                                 SCOTT
                        I was thinking about what I was 
                        going to say to you when your 
                        mother first told me you were 
                        gone... And then I thought about it 
                        on the way over to your little 
                        party, and then all the way back... 
                        And I still don’t know what to say 
                        to you right now.

                                 MIKE
                        I get it.

                                 SCOTT
                        No, I don’t think you do. Someone 
                        who gets it wouldn’t be sneaking 
                        out in the middle of the night like 
                        this. Someone who gets it would 
                        show some fucking responsibility my 
                        friend.

                                 MARLA
                        Scott-

                                 MIKE
                        Okay. I’m sorry. It won’t happen 
                        again. Just give me a break.

                                 SCOTT
                        A break. Sure. A break. I can just 
                        give you a break for sneaking out 
                        of the house, going to a party, 
                        doing drugs? Are you INSANE? 

                                 MIKE
                        I had it under control!

                                 SCOTT
                        I AM SURE! Pot and alcohol have 
                        done wonders for your self control 
                        Michael! Abso-fucking-lutely! That 
                        must be the key your mother and I 
                        have been missing all these years!
           Mike stands abruptly.

                                 MARLA
                        HEY-

                                 MIKE
                        Everyone goes to parties! It’s 
                        normal! Everyone gets to go out, 
                        and gets to have girlfriends and 
                        drink and try out for the football 
                        team! I just want to be NORMAL! For 
                        five fucking minutes!

           Scott gets is Mike’s space, grabbing his face with his hands, 
           holding his head. Marla goes to them, trying to pull them 
           apart.

                                 MARLA
                        Scott- guys, let’s just step back-

                                 SCOTT
                        GET THIS THROUGH YOUR HEAD. YOU ARE 
                        NOT. NORMAL. YOU DO NOT GET FIVE 
                        MINUTES OF PRETEND BECAUSE THAT’S 
                        WHEN YOU’RE GOING TO SLIP UP FOR 
                        REAL AND THEY’RE GOING TO HANG YOU 
                        IN THE STREET OR CUT YOU OPEN IN A 
                        LAB! UNTIL YOU ARE DEAD!

           Mike pushes Scott: hard. 

                                 MARLA
                        MIKE!

                                 MIKE
                        STOP IT! SHUT UP! SHUT UP!

           Scott stumbles backwards as if he’s been shot. The color 
           drains out of his face and his eyes go black.

           He struggles to breathe- the skin on his face seems to be 
           peeling off of him as he vomits on his shoes. His knees 
           buckle, but he remains standing, as if hung from an invisible 
           noose.

           A gut-wrenching crunch. Scott’s teeth break out of his head. 
           He collapses- his teeth remain suspended in the air above him 
           for a moment, before falling on his body.

           Marla is frozen fucking tension. She stares at Scott’s body. 

           The lamp next to her begins to rattle. The pictures on the 
           walls begin to shake. The whole house is vibrating.
           Mike has tears streaming down his face. The veins in his 
           forehead are dark. He looks fucking petrified.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        Mom?

           The lamp next to Marla explodes. The light bulbs in the room 
           begin to shatter. Marla reaches into her back pocket and 
           removes the syringe. She sticks it directly into Mike’s neck. 

           His eyes roll back in his head and he collapses next to 
           Scott.

           BLACK. 

           INT. MADNICK HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - SECONDS LATER

           The lights are out. Shattered glass everywhere. Marla drops 
           to her knees, bent over Scott, shaking. Crying.

           Marla looks over to Mike, limp on the ground.

           INT. MADNICK HOUSE - MARLA’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Marla opens the closet door. She bangs her fist on a wooden 
           panel on the wall. It budges. She pushes it- a secret 
           cabinet. 

           She takes out a small wrapped washcloth. She unfolds the 
           washcloth, revealing a gun. 

           She looks into the chamber. It’s loaded. She closes the 
           chamber. 

           INT. MADNICK HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Marla walks on broken glass from shattered family pictures. 

           She stops at Mike’s body. 

           The only sound is the tick. Tick. Tick. Of the clock lying on 
           its side on the floor. 

           She pulls the hammer back, pointing the gun directly at 
           Mike’s head. Her arm shakes. She stands, frozen. 

           An eternity goes by.

           She watches Mike breathe. 

           Tick. Tick. Tick. The sound of the clock grows louder. 
           The gun quivers in her hand. The hollow chime of the hour 
           change begins to ring. She lowers the gun and collapses in 
           place. 

           Silence.

           INT. GARAGE - NIGHT

           Marla hoists open the garage door, flashlight in hand. She 
           goes to the near wall and grabs a shovel.

           EXT. BACK YARD - NIGHT

           The shovel breaks earth. Marla digs.

           She strips down to a tank top. Keeps digging. 

           INT. MADNICK HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Mike remains collapsed on the floor. Scott’s body has been 
           moved.

           Marla is on the other side of the room, dragging him with 
           great difficulty.

           EXT. BACK YARD - NIGHT

           Marla rolls Scott into the hole in the yard. He lies face up. 
           One of his eyes remains open.

           Marla reaches down and closes his eye. 

                                 MARLA
                        I’m not going to lose him. 

           She kisses her fingers and places them on his forehead. She 
           silently cries. 

           EXT. BACK YARD - DAWN

           The ground is flat and packed where the hole was. Marla is 
           haggard and covered in dirt. She sits on the ground and has a 
           lit cigarette between her lips, an inch of ash hangs off of 
           it.

           She puts the cigarette out and goes into the house.
           INT. MADNICK HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MORNING

           Mike opens his eyes. He is lying on the couch, a blanket 
           covers him. 

           The record player is playing Drown in My Own Tears by Ray 
           Charles lightly.

           The carpet is gone. The room has been swept clean.

           He sits up. Footsteps come from the kitchen. Mike leans over. 
           Marla is dressed for work. She walks into the doorway, seeing 
           Mike is awake.

                                 MARLA
                        Hey.

           Mike nods slightly, dazed as reality comes back to him.

                                 MARLA (CONT’D)
                        This wasn’t your fault.

                                 MIKE
                        Whose was it then?

                                 MARLA
                        Can I come over there?

           Mike nods. Marla goes to him. She sits.

                                 MARLA (CONT’D)
                        When you were five we saw the first 
                        signs of this... Part of you. 
                        And... God it scared the fuck out 
                        of us. Me especially. It really 
                        did. You think you can kind of 
                        handle anything, but then your kid 
                        is so much stronger than you... I 
                        didn’t know what to do. But your 
                        father did.

           Mike is starting to lose it. Marla wraps her arm around him, 
           shushing him gently.

                                 MARLA (CONT’D)
                        We did our best. He did his best. 
                        He was so scared for you. All the 
                        time. Michael, we’ve tried to give 
                        you that normal life. This was our 
                        best shot. And now it’s over. You 
                        know that, right?

                                 MIKE
                        Yeah.
                                 MARLA
                        You and I are going to have to be a 
                        team if you want to survive.

           Mike falls into her. For a moment, a reprieve from the 
           conversation. Marla softly sings along to Drown In My Own 
           Tears. She leans down and kisses Mike’s head.

                                 MARLA (CONT’D)
                        I have to take care of something at 
                        work. I’m going to call in sick for 
                        you and your father. If we leave 
                        this afternoon we’ll have the whole 
                        weekend as a head start before 
                        anyone notices that we’re gone.

           Marla stands up and begins to leave.

                                 MIKE
                        What did you do with Dad?

                                 MARLA
                        Try not to think about it. Keep the 
                        music on, okay?

           He nods.

                                 MARLA (CONT’D)
                        There are two duffle bags in the 
                        upstairs hall. Get packed when 
                        you’re ready.

           Marla steps towards the door.

                                 MARLA (CONT’D)
                        I love you.

           She leaves.

           The clock remains shattered on its side on the floor. It 
           tick. Tick. Ticks to 8:30.

           EXT. MADNICK HOUSE - MORNING

           Mike stands at the foot of a conspicuous patch of dirt in the 
           back yard. He looks up to the sky, tears flooding out of his 
           eyes.

           He sinks to his knees and runs his fingers through the dirt.

                                 MIKE
                        I’m sorry. I’m sorry. I’m fucking 
                        sorry.
           He says it over and over, babbling incoherently. He catches 
           his breath. It’s quiet. 

           The wind blows the trees above him. A sharp DING rings out. 
           He takes another deep breath. He reaches into his pocket and 
           takes out his phone.

           On the screen- Andrea: You okay? :(

           Mike stares at the screen. He types. no.

           Andrea: Where are you?

           INT. FIRST NATIONAL BANK - DAY

           The television displays a butterfly leaving a chrysalis. 

           Marla sits at a computer. 

           On the screen, she looks at the bank accounts for SCOTT 
           MADNICK. $21,900. She pulls out a withdrawal slip from her 
           desk.

           Marla begins to write herself a check for $9,999.

           The mute television screen mounted on the wall outside the 
           vault flashes to a title card that reads BREAKING NEWS.

           A shot of people running frantically into a parking lot. A 
           small SWAT team ushers the runners towards them.

           A REPORTER stands in front of a large glass and brick 
           building speaking emphatically to the camera. 

           Marla looks up to the television. The color drains out of her 
           face. She stands up

           A co-worker comes out behind her, eyes glued to the 
           television.

           A title bar comes up on the bottom of the screen: Unknown 
           Attacker at Athena High School.

                                 CO-WORKER
                        Doesn’t your kid go there?

           EXT. BANK PARKING LOT - DAY

           Marla scrambles across the parking lot holding a canvas 
           shopping bag. One of her heels breaks. She ditches both of 
           her shoes and keeps running, removing her suit jacket as she 
           gets into the car.
           She drops the bag into the seat next to her- it’s got small 
           stacks of new bills in it- $9,999 worth in $20s and $50s.

           She peels out of the parking lot, passing the glimmering Luna 
           billboard.

           EXT. STREETS - DAY

           Marla cuts across lanes, honking her horn. A light shifts to 
           yellow. She hits the gas, speeding through the light as it 
           changes to red.

           Marla has her cell phone wedged against her ear with her 
           shoulder. It goes to Mike’s voice mail.

                                 MARLA
                        God damn it!

           She takes a hard left against the oncoming traffic and speeds 
           through another intersection.

           EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           A line of police cars and vans are blocking off the road. 
           Several news vans have set up camp with the high school on 
           the hill in the background. 

           A small army of parents and teachers have already assembled. 

           Marla pulls over at the edge of the cacophony. She steps out 
           of the car. 

                                 COP
                        Miss- you can’t park here.

                                 MARLA
                        My son goes here!

                                 COP
                        Please move your car. 

           Marla looks past the cop. A parent has his arms around a girl 
           covered in blood.

           A group of students are huddled around each other, crying. 

           A father holds his son’s bloody hand as he’s loaded into the 
           back of an ambulance.

           The voices of the crowd envelop her, all saying different 
           things: shooter, a bomb, an explosion- there was glass 
           everywhere. 
           Marla gets back into her car, speeding back the way she came.

           INT. MADNICK HOUSE - DAY

           Marla bursts through the front door.

                                 MARLA
                        Michael?

           Nothing. 

           Marla runs up stairs.

           INT. MADNICK HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY

           She passes Mike’s room. It’s empty. The duffle bags on the 
           floor have been packed.

           Marla goes to her room.

           INT. MADNICK HOUSE - MARLA’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Marla strips off her work clothes and changes into a black 
           tank top and jeans. She pulls on a jacket.

           Marla unzips her duffle bag on the floor- verifying the gun 
           is inside it. She closes it up.

           INT. MADNICK HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           The clock ticks on the floor. 

           Marla stands at the foot of the stairs leading to the front 
           door, four duffle bags strapped to her. She looks around the 
           house in a moment of quiet.

           She steps out of the house, closing the door behind her.

           EXT. STREETS - DAY

           Marla drives the Subaru down a heavily wooded street. She 
           begins to slow down.

                                 MARLA
                        Please be here...

           She pulls over.
           EXT. ABANDONED GAS STATION - DAY

           An abandoned gas station sits in the sunlight. Its boarded-up 
           windows have been vandalized over the years. A full layer of 
           ivy has grown over the garage doors.  

           Marla steps out of the car. 

                                 MARLA
                        I’m here! Michael!

           Birds chirp. Silence.

           Then- Mike steps out of the nearby woods. His eyes are 
           bleary, swollen, his face is caked in blood. He has his 
           headphones on. He pulls them down around his neck. 

           Marla lets out an involuntary sigh of relief. She leans 
           against the car. Mike goes to her. He hugs her.

                                 MIKE
                        I’m sorry. 

                                 MARLA
                        What happened?

                                 MIKE
                        -so fucking stupid-

           He’s holding something in his hands. Marla grabs his wrists- 
           it’s his Yellow CD player. The lid pops open, revealing a 
           spinning disc. The disc slows to a stop revealing the words- 
           Rad-Dad-Tunes. Mike closes the lid again.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        He gave it to me.

                                 MARLA
                        Were you seen?

           Mike nods. Marla snaps into focus.

                                 MARLA (CONT’D)
                        Look at me. We’ve lost our head 
                        start. They’re going to come for us 
                        now. And fast. It’s time. Okay?

           Mike is shaken from his tears, seeing her severity. He nods 
           and breaks away from her. He gets into the passenger’s seat.

           Marla gets into the car. Their doors slam in sync. The Subaru 
           hits the road, kicking up dust as it goes, leaving the 
           presence of the Gas station.
           FADE OUT.

                                 COACH REZNICK (O.S.)
                        I was down in the cafeteria, on the 
                        mezzanine for lunch duty, it was 
                        second lunch, so mostly juniors and 
                        seniors.

           FADE IN.

           INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY

           CAMERA POV. COACH REZNICK speaks to an OFF-CAMERA 
           INTERVIEWER. The interview has a Ken Burns documentary feel 
           to it. He is uncomfortable on camera.

                                 COACH REZNICK
                        The mez links up with two hallways 
                        that go into the belly of the 
                        school, and it was from that East 
                        hallway I started to hear ‘em 
                        shouting, and... They were shouting 
                        ‘fight’.

                                 INTERVIEWER (O.S.)
                        Fight?

                                 COACH REZNICK
                        Yes sir, just over and over you 
                        know, uh... Fight fight fight like 
                        kids do.

                                 INTERVIEWER (O.S.)
                        And what then?

           EXT. STREET - DAY

           A car tire runs over a cell phone.

           INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY

           Coach Reznick has been replaced with a MALE STUDENT (15) with 
           blonde hair, a little chubby.

                                 STUDENT
                        -Probably like twenty kids in 
                        there, and they were all crowding 
                        around in a circle like. 

                                 INTERVIEWER (O.S.)
                        Did you see who was fighting?
                                 STUDENT
                        It was a lot of people. Like five 
                        or six. 

                                 INTERVIEWER (O.S.)
                        Can you name any of the people you 
                        saw fighting?

                                 STUDENT
                        Joe Curly was in there.... And... I 
                        don’t know if I should say. Are 
                        they gonna get in trouble?

           EXT. STREETS - DAY

           Mike is lying down in the back seat. Marla drives slowly, 
           watching her speed. A cop cruiser passes them. 

           INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY

           A BIOLOGY TEACHER sits in the hot seat. His arm is in a sling 
           and he has a black eye- the eyeball itself is bloodshot red.

                                 BIO TEACHER
                        -What any teacher would do- what we 
                        have to do. You break up the fight. 
                        So I start tugging kids away from 
                        each other, and I’m blowing this 
                        whistle. And that’s when... The 
                        walls start to shake. 

                                 INTERVIEWER (O.S.)
                        Shake.

                                 BIO TEACHER
                        Oh yeah. Like an earthquake. Whole 
                        hallway was just buckling in on 
                        itself.

           INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY

           Mr. Seltzer sits in the seat. He has no bruises or marks on 
           him

                                 SELTZER
                        He was a smart kid. Normal kid. Did 
                        his work, I mean... Averagely. He’s 
                        sixteen years old. Obviously he’s 
                        going to act out a little... But I 
                        don’t. No. I don’t know. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 SELTZER (CONT'D)
                        I don’t see him planning something 
                        like this.

           EXT. GAS STATION - DUSK

           The subaru is parked on the far edge of a remote gas station. 
           Marla is carefully unscrewing the license plates off of the 
           car parked next to them.

           INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY

           A male STUDENT speaks towards the camera.

                                 STUDENT
                        He didn’t really hang out. But he 
                        got along with people fine.

                                 INTERVIEWER (O.S.)
                        Why didn’t he hang out?

                                 STUDENT
                        Just didn’t. I don’t know. I didn’t 
                        hang out with him.

           INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY

           An African American PRINCIPAL speaks to the interviewer.

                                 PRINCIPAL
                        I know that his parents were 
                        very... Protective. 

                                 INTERVIEWER (O.S.)
                        Did you ever meet them?

                                 PRINCIPAL
                        A few times. Nice people, but there 
                        was something... Reserved about 
                        them.

                                 INTERVIEWER (O.S.)
                        You know they’re missing?

                                 PRINCIPAL
                        Yes. I do know that.

                                 INTERVIEWER (O.S.)
                        Do you think Michael did something 
                        to them?
                                 PRINCIPAL
                        I have no way of knowing that.

                                 INTERVIEWER (O.S.)
                        But what does your gut say?

                                 PRINCIPAL
                        ... My gut tells me... That they 
                        were wound really tight about 
                        something. That’s all I feel 
                        comfortable saying, I really didn’t 
                        know them, I’m sorry.

           INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY

           A Female STUDENT (18) sits at the chair. She wears a neck 
           brace. She is crying.

                                 STUDENT
                        -Ross was just hitting him, over, 
                        and over, and Andrea tried to pull 
                        him off. She was screaming... And 
                        Mike stood up everything started 
                        shaking... We just ran. We just 
                        ran.

                                 INTERVIEWER (O.S.)
                        To the Mezzanine.

           She nods, wiping her tears.

                                 STUDENT
                        It’s got a glass roof. The glass 
                        just started falling on us. It was 
                        like raining knives.

           INT. MOVING CAR - NIGHT

           Mike and Marla drive along the highway. Mike wears 
           headphones, staring out the window somberly. Marla looks at 
           him out of the corner of her eye. Her eyes go down to the CD 
           player in hands. He’s white-knuckle clutching it.

           EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

           The red tail lights of the car disappear on the highway, like 
           little blinking red eyes. 

           They’re gone.
           INT. BACK ROOM - DAY

           The INTERVIEWER remains hidden. In his hands he holds an 
           iphone, a video is queued up to it. He presses play.

           A crowd of students in a hallway fight. Chants of FIGHT FIGHT 
           FIGHT are peaking the phone’s speakers.

           A distinct metal creaking noise rings out. Lockers begin to 
           fly open. People start screaming.

           The crowd begins to disperse. The person holding the camera 
           begins to run, the camera catches their feet making long 
           strides. 

           The light opens up as the recordist reaches the mezzanine. 
           There’s a sudden BANG followed by the sound of glass 
           shattering. More screams. The camera looks up. Glass is 
           raining down.

           The video ends.

           The INTERVIEWER puts the phone down on the table, his face 
           still hidden. A CREEPY AGENT dressed in GREY (Mister Grey) 
           takes the phone and puts it in an evidence bag. Another Agent 
           sits at a desk.

                                 INTERVIEWER
                        This didn’t get uploaded to youtube 
                        or anything did it?

                                 AGENT
                        No.

                                 INTERVIEWER
                        Good. Who’s next?

           Past the interviewer, through one-way glass, ANDREA is being 
           led into the interview room.

                                 AGENT
                        Girlfriend.

                                 INTERVIEWER
                        Okay. 

           The Interviewer exits the Back Room, passing Mister Grey.

           INT. INTERVIEW ROOM - DAY

           Andrea sits in the chair. One of her eyes is swollen shut. 
           She has bandages around her neck and shoulder. Her one good 
           eye has tears coming out of it.
           The Interviewer - DAVID KLYCE (40) enters the room. He wears 
           an FBI badge around his neck. His hair is slicked back, 
           buzzed on the sides. His sleeves and collar are all the way 
           buttoned, covering tattoo sleeves. 

           He’s friendly, casual, relaxed.

                                 KLYCE
                        Andrea? My name is David Klyce. I’m 
                        going to ask you a few questions if 
                        that’s okay with you.

                                 ANDREA
                        Yeah.

                                 KLYCE
                        Okay... Let’s see here... How long 
                        have you known Michael Madnick?

                                 ANDREA
                        Since fifth grade.

                                 KLYCE
                        That’s what, six years?

           She nods.

                                 KLYCE (CONT’D)
                        And you two were dating?

                                 ANDREA
                        I guess.

                                 KLYCE
                        Just kinda seeing each other on the 
                        side kinda thing? Or was it a 
                        little more serious?

                                 ANDREA
                        We wanted it to be.

                                 KLYCE
                        What got in the way?

                                 ANDREA
                        His parents.

                                 KLYCE
                        You know em?

                                 ANDREA
                        Not really. They weren’t so into 
                        the idea of him dating.
                                 KLYCE
                        Yeah? Why? What are they scared of?

                                 ANDREA
                        I don’t know.... Uh... Just...

                                 KLYCE
                        It’s okay. Just take a deep breath. 
                        You know you’re not in any trouble 
                        right? They told you that?

                                 ANDREA
                        Yeah.

                                 KLYCE
                        Okay. You’re doing great... You 
                        know, I had a sister... Miranda. 
                        Two years younger than me. And I’d 
                        be out, drinking and driving, not 
                        come home... No problem. But Her? 
                        Total lock down. I think that’s 
                        pretty normal. To watch out for 
                        your daughters, let your sons run 
                        wild... Right? So why was Mike 
                        different?

           Andrea’s eyes shift for a moment.

                                 ANDREA
                        ...No just... I don’t think they 
                        wanted him to have a girlfriend.

                                 KLYCE
                        Ohhh. Too young to be dating. That 
                        whole thing. Right? Yeah. I heard 
                        that one.

           She nods. Klyce nods too.

                                 KLYCE (CONT’D)
                        Were you and Mike intimate?

           Andrea shifts uncomfortably.

                                 KLYCE (CONT’D)
                        Do you know his parents are 
                        missing?

           She nods.

                                 KLYCE (CONT’D)
                        And you know he’s on the run now?

           She nods.
                                 KLYCE (CONT’D)
                        So answer the question.

                                 ANDREA
                        Yeah. Sometimes.

                                 KLYCE
                        Okay. Cool. I’ve talked to some 
                        other people. And I heard about the 
                        party last night. Sounds like mom 
                        and dad were a little psycho, 
                        right?

                                 ANDREA
                        They didn’t have to embarrass him 
                        like that.

                                 KLYCE
                        Might have pushed him over the 
                        edge? If someone treated me like 
                        that, it would push me over the 
                        edge.

                                 ANDREA
                        I don’t know. 

                                 KLYCE
                        Tell me about this morning.

                                 ANDREA
                        He wasn’t in history in the 
                        morning. I texted him and he was 
                        just freaking out, he wasn’t even 
                        making sense.

                                 KLYCE
                        And then he showed up at the 
                        school. Why do that?

                                 ANDREA
                        I had his CD player.

                                 KLYCE
                        CD player... What do you make of 
                        that?

           Andrea doesn’t know what to say.

                                 ANDREA
                        I don’t know.

           Klyce smiles at this. He closes the folder of questions in 
           front of him.
                                 KLYCE
                        Part of my job is to ask questions. 
                        The other part of is to figure when 
                        people are lying. That’s a big 
                        part. 

                                 ANDREA
                        I’m not lying.

                                 KLYCE
                        I don’t think you are. But I also 
                        don’t think you’re telling me the 
                        whole story. That’s called lying by 
                        omission.

           Klyce stands. Andrea jumps at the sound of his metal chair 
           scraping the floor. Klyce walks behind her, leans over to 
           whisper in her ear.

                                 ANDREA
                        I want a lawyer.

                                 KLYCE
                        No, no, no. You’re confused about 
                        where you are. This isn’t Law and 
                        Order, and I’m not talking to you 
                        in between trips to the donut shop. 
                        You think you know who I am because 
                        you’ve seen TV. You don’t have a 
                        fucking clue. I’m the real deal, 
                        girl. I think you know that Michael 
                        Madnick wasn’t like us. And I know 
                        you think you’re protecting him. 
                        Doing him some good... But you’re 
                        not. If you don’t start giving me 
                        something here... I’ll make sure 
                        you never see the sun again.

           Andrea has tears streaming down her face, shaking, trying to 
           keep herself calm.

           INT. HALLWAY - DAY

           The door slams on Andrea, crying in her seat. Klyce stands in 
           the empty hallway, removing a phone from his pocket. He puts 
           it to his ear.

                                 KLYCE
                        I’m sure now.
           EXT. MADNICK HOUSE - NIGHT

           Work lights surround the entire house. Black SUVs and trucks 
           line the street. 

           INT. MADNICK HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           The entire house is crawling with people. Three forensics 
           agents are walking around the living room with UV lights, 
           marking blood spatter patterns.

           Behind them, more agents are taking the photographs off the 
           walls.

           INT. MADNICK HOUSE - MARLA’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           More agents are photographing the rooms carefully before 
           disassembling the dresser drawers.

           INT. MADNICK HOUSE - MIKE’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Two agents carefully check Mike’s bed and clothes with a 
           Geiger counter that clicks intermittently. 

           EXT. MADNICK HOUSE - BACK YARD - NIGHT

           Klyce paces back and fourth, lighting a cigarette. 

           A forensics team is carefully shoveling scoops of dirt to the 
           side, gentle like archeologists.

                                 FORENSICS
                        We got one!

           Klyce goes to them.

           The forensics agents use dusters to wipe away dirt off the 
           face of dead Scott Madnick.

           Klyce stares at the body.

                                 KLYCE
                        Keep digging.

           The forensic continue dusting off Scott’s body.

                                 KLYCE (CONT’D)
                        See if the Mom’s in there with him.
           INT. MEDICAL EXAMINATION ROOM - NIGHT

           Klyce is sitting on the edge of the room on a metal bench, 
           mostly in the dark. His sleeves are now rolled up, revealing 
           ornate Japanese-style tattoo sleeves fully covering both of 
           his arms. 

           Across the room, two Medical Examiners are preparing an 
           autopsy on Scott Madnick.

           Klyce lights a cigarette.

                                 EXAMINER
                        You can’t smoke in here.

                                 KLYCE
                        Oh, right. Sorry.

           Klyce chuckles, taking a deep drag from his cigarette. He 
           watches as the examiners start an electric saw and drive it 
           into Scott’s bare chest.

                                 KLYCE (CONT’D)
                        CD player...

           INT. MEDICAL EXAMINATION ROOM - LATER

           Scott lies dead on the examination table. 

                                 EXAMINER
                        What ultimately killed him was 
                        internal hemorrhaging. 

           Klyce is standing over the body next to the two Medical 
           Examiners.

                                 KLYCE
                        Bleeding.

                                 EXAMINER
                        Dysbarism. 

                                 KLYCE
                        I don’t know what the hell that is.

                                 EXAMINER
                        There was an extreme change in 
                        ambient pressure. The whole body 
                        went through Barotrauma. That’s why 
                        his teeth are gone.

                                 KLYCE
                        What causes that?
                                 EXAMINER
                        I mean... Diving. If you’re a scuba 
                        diver, it’s like ten steps up from 
                        the bends.

                                 KLYCE
                        He wasn’t in the water though.

                                 EXAMINER
                        Barotrauma comes through shock 
                        waves too.

                                 KLYCE
                        Shock waves.

           A phone rings. Klyce reaches into his pocket and picks up.

                                 KLYCE (CONT’D)
                        Uh-huh. 

           His eyes widen.

                                 KLYCE (CONT’D)
                        You’re kidding.

           INT. POLCE STATION - NIGHT

           Klyce is led down a hallway by a POLICE OFFICER. 

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        She said she saw the commercials.

                                 KLYCE
                        Is there a father?

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        No. To be honest, I wouldn’t be 
                        surprised if this wasn’t even the 
                        real mother.

           They stop in front of a one-way observation window. Sitting 
           at a table with a cup of coffee in front of her is BETH (48) 
           looking haggard, wired and showing rotted meth-teeth. 

                                 KLYCE
                        She have any I.D?

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        Yup. And a rap sheet a mile long. 
                        Beth Elmas.

                                 KLYCE
                        Drugs.
                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        And some hooking, and a little bit 
                        of disturbing the peace.

                                 KLYCE
                        I’ll bet. You mind?

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        We called you.

                                 KLYCE
                        Thanks for that.

           Klyce goes in.

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT

           Beth chews on her nails distractedly. Klyce walks in, tucking 
           his badge in his back pocket. He is salesman friendly.

                                 KLYCE
                        Mrs. Elmas, may I call you Beth?
                        I’m Henry Addison, I’m with the 
                        Luna Corporation. I hear you saw 
                        our Ad.

                                 BETH
                        Yes, I did. I... I believe my 
                        little girl has that three chrone-
                        zone thingy they talk about on the 
                        television.

                                 KLYCE
                        Have you had her tested?

                                 BETH
                        That shit costs money.

                                 KLYCE
                        So what makes you think she’s Z-
                        positive?

                                 BETH
                        I heard there was a reward.

                                 KLYCE
                        ... There might be. If your 
                        daughter had the right combination 
                        of genetic elements.

                                 BETH
                        How much is the reward?
           Klyce over his shoulder, then leans close to her.

                                 KLYCE
                        Ten million dollars.

           Beth’s eyes grow wide, a big shit-eating grin on her face.

                                 KLYCE (CONT’D)
                        Shh-shh-sh.. We don’t want that 
                        getting out you know. If people 
                        knew we’d have everyone coming in 
                        claiming they’d struck gold, right?

                                 BETH
                        Right, right, I hear you honey.

                                 KLYCE
                        So what makes you think your girl 
                        is our girl?

                                 BETH
                        ... She sees things. She’ll look 
                        into your soul and pull it right 
                        out you. Show you visions. And she 
                        talks to spiders and the like.

           Beth nods emphatically. Klyce nods back.

                                 KLYCE
                        I can’t wait to meet her.

           INT. POLCE STATION - NIGHT

           Klyce steps out of the interrogation room. The hallway is 
           abandoned, save for Mister Grey.

           Klyce nods towards the interrogation room. Mister Grey gives 
           him a nod back and slinks towards the room.

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT

           Dirty little bare feet dangle off of a chair, swinging 
           happily. 

           Klyce enters another interrogation room. Sitting with a juice 
           box in hand is ESME (8) dirty blonde matted hair and wearing 
           pajamas. She hasn’t been bathed in weeks. She sips her juice 
           intently. 

                                 KLYCE
                        Hi. My name is Henry. What’s your 
                        name?
           Esme looks him over.

                                 ESME
                        Your name is David. 

           Klyce smiles at her, genuine warmth. He likes her. He sits.

                                 KLYCE
                        That’s right, it is.

                                 ESME
                        And your mommy is Carol, and your 
                        daddy is John, and you don’t like 
                        talking about him. 

                                 KLYCE
                        ... That’s right too.

                                 ESME
                        I know lots of things.

                                 KLYCE
                        Do you know why you’re here?

                                 ESME
                        Beth brought me here to get money. 
                        But you’re not going to give her 
                        any...

           Esme considers.

                                 ESME (CONT’D)
                        I don’t think you’re going to help 
                        her at all.

                                 KLYCE
                        You’re... A very smart little girl. 
                        What’s your name?

                                 ESME
                        Esme. 

                                 KLYCE
                        It’s very nice to meet you, Esme. 
                        I’ve really been looking forward to 
                        meeting someone like you. I think 
                        you can help me-

           Klyce stops. A little orange spider crawls out of his sleeve 
           and onto the table. He and Esme look at it. 

           Klyce slams his palm on top of it. He raises his palm. The 
           spider is gone.
                                 ESME
                        Are you a bad man?

           Esme looks at him, level headed. Klyce returns the gaze.

                                 KLYCE
                        Why do you ask?

                                 ESME
                        You stuck a gun in the man’s mouth 
                        and he was crying, and he said he 
                        didn’t know where Miranda was. And 
                        you think he was telling the truth. 
                        But you shot him anyway.

                                 KLYCE
                        ... That’s right.

                                 ESME
                        Bad men kill people.

                                 KLYCE
                        Do you think I’m a bad man?

           Esme looks him up and down.

           Three little orange spiders crawl out of Klyce’s sleeve. 
           Klyce looks at them, unfazed. 

                                 ESME
                        I think you do some bad things.

                                 KLYCE
                        I do a lot of bad things, Esme. But 
                        I do it to make the world a better 
                        place. For girls and boys like you. 
                        Am I lying?

                                 ESME
                        ... No.

           Klyce opens up his palm. The three little spiders go to him. 

                                 KLYCE
                        I can tell that you’re a very 
                        special girl. I want to take care 
                        of you. Give you a better life. I 
                        was thinking you could come with 
                        me. 

           The spiders crawl back into Klyce’s sleeve. He smiles at her, 
           genuinely friendly.
                                 KLYCE (CONT’D)
                        I think we could make a really good 
                        team. 

           INT. FARMER’S MARKET - DAY

           A television hangs suspended from the ceiling in an upscale 
           farmers market. 

           On the TV: Protestors picket outside of a courthouse. 

                                 NEWS REPORTER
                        Last week a dramatic showdown took 
                        place outside of a Maryland 
                        courthouse as the District Court 
                        began deliberations on if people 
                        with a Z-chromosome are to be 
                        recognized as human beings under 
                        the Constitution.

           Police in Riot Gear stand behind plastic shields on the 
           courthouse steps. Across from them, protestors hold signs and 
           march in a circle. They’re organized- non violent.

           One of the protestors, LUKE (40s, African American) stands 
           with a bullhorn speaking to the protestors.

                                 LUKE 
                        Racial oppression is rampant in 
                        this country and genetic oppression 
                        is close behind. We’re not talking 
                        about it and I want to talk about 
                        it. Deny people their rights as 
                        human beings because of their 
                        genetic differences, is a dramatic 
                        step backwards, and it is coming. 

           The news report continues on the TV.

           LUKE stands underneath the TV, chewing solemnly on an apple, 
           watching himself speak. 

           A ten-year-old BOY stands close to him, looking up at the 
           television. Luke glances over at him. The Boy stares at him 
           in wonder. Luke gives him half a smile. The Boy smiles back.

           The Boy’s mother notices her son’s interaction with the 
           stranger and tugs him along, giving Luke a dirty look. Luke 
           bites on his apple.
           INT. MOVING VAN - DAY

           Rain drizzles. Luke drives down the road. RIVER (25) sits in 
           the passengers seat next to him, singing along with the 
           radio. She has a cut up yellow shirt that says Remember Danny 
           Drake on it.

           EXT. LUKE’S HOUSE - DAY

           The banged up MINIVAN pulls up in front of a small house. 
           Luke and River get out.

           The van has an assortment of bumper stickers on it- We’re All 
           Humans, Green Peace, and Coexist, and REMEMBER DANNY DRAKE.

           Luke and River go to the trunk of the van and retrieve 
           grocery bags.

           INT. LUKE’S HOUSE - DAY

           River hums an anthemic tune as she puts away the groceries. 
           Luke puts down his grocery bags on the counter. 

           He stops. Pauses. Something is strange. 

           On the counter sits an electric kettle. There’s a light, 
           simmered steam coming out of the spout. Luke touches the side 
           of it. As soon as he does - a SCREAM.

           He turns.

           River has her hands over her mouth. In the hallway leading to 
           the belly of the house stands Marla, holding a cup of 
           steaming tea in her hand.

                                 RIVER
                        What the fuck!

           Luke is wide-eyed. 

                                 MARLA
                        Hi Luke.

                                 RIVER
                        Did you fucking BREAK INTO THIS 
                        HOUSE? GET OUT!

                                 LUKE
                        Shut up.

           River is surprised. Luke stares at Marla in a daze.
                                 LUKE (CONT’D)
                        ... Hi Marla. 

                                 RIVER
                        You know this chick?

                                 LUKE
                        Yeah. I do. Actually.

                                 MARLA
                        It’s been a while.

                                 LUKE
                        Some time.

                                 MARLA
                            (off River)
                        They’re getting younger, aren’t 
                        they?

                                 LUKE
                        I’m just getting older.

                                 RIVER
                        I’m right here, lady.

                                 LUKE
                        It’s okay. River. This is Marla. 
                        She’s... Someone I used to know.

                                 MARLA
                        Pleasure.

                                 LUKE
                        Why are you here?

                                 MARLA
                        I need your help.

                                 RIVER
                        You could have called first. We 
                        have a phone.

           Luke and Marla completely tune out River.

                                 LUKE
                        You need my help.

                                 MARLA
                        That’s right.

           A beat.
                                 LUKE
                        I haven’t seen you in two 
                        decades... And you’re breaking into 
                        my house asking for help?

                                 MARLA
                        Beggars can’t be choosers.

           Marla looks back into the dark hallway. She nods towards it. 
           Luke braces himself as he hears footsteps.

           Mike pokes his head from around the corner.

                                 MARLA (CONT’D)
                        This is Michael. This is my son.

           Luke is shell-shocked. He looks from Mike to Marla and back 
           to Mike.

                                 MIKE
                        Hey.

                                 LUKE
                        ... He’s... He’s not... Mine? 

           Marla laughs.

                                 MARLA
                        He’s sixteen and adopted. I think 
                        you’re safe.

                                 LUKE
                        Okay... What is it you need my help 
                        with?

           Marla puts a hand on Mike’s shoulder.

           Behind Luke, the fruit and vegetables begin floating out of 
           the grocery bags. Oranges begin to circle Luke’s head. River 
           lets out a yelp.

           The oranges drop to the floor.

                                 MARLA
                        We’re in a little bit of trouble.

           INT. LUKE’S HOUSE - HALLWAY - LATER

           Mike stands in the dark hallway by himself. 

           He listens to the voices of Luke and Marla talking behind the 
           nearest closed door.
           At the other end of the hallway, River peeks her head around 
           the corner, smiling at him.

                                 RIVER
                        So you can push stuff around with 
                        your mind, right?

                                 MIKE
                        Yeah.

                                 RIVER
                        I bet the girls love that.

                                 MIKE
                        What?

           River raises her eyebrows with delight.

                                 RIVER
                        Oooh, never mind.

           She disappears back into the other room, giggling to herself.

           INT. LUKE’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM- SAME

           The room is a mess. Covered in piles of papers, documents, 
           stacks of boxes. Luke lives like he’s a PhD student, the 
           messy kind.

                                 MARLA
                        We first noticed when he was five. 
                        It was just little stuff, you know 
                        doors closing on their own, fragile 
                        things would break when he cried. 
                        We actually thought the fucking 
                        house was haunted for a while. And 
                        then the science and the news 
                        caught up. And then people got 
                        scared.

                                 LUKE
                        They have a way of doing that.

                                 MARLA
                        I saw you a couple of times. That 
                        March in Indiana.

                                 LUKE
                        Yeah, that was a lot of grief. 
                        You’d think we were advocating for 
                        the civil rights of lobsters.
                                 MARLA
                        Always the revolutionary. 

                                 LUKE
                        You haven’t told anyone?

                                 MARLA
                            (gravely)
                        No. Not after Danny Drake. 

           Luke nods. Understandable. 

                                 MARLA (CONT’D)
                        He was thirteen when that happened. 
                        It wasn’t anything like it is now. 
                        What I saw this week...

           Marla shakes her head.

                                 MARLA (CONT’D)
                        ...I’ve never seen anything like 
                        that.

                                 LUKE
                        Marla. No one’s seen anything like 
                        that. Danny Drake was a... A mind 
                        reader at best. Michael’s...

                                 MARLA
                        He killed his father.

                                 LUKE
                        What?

           Marla has tears in her eyes.

                                 MARLA
                        It was over as soon as it started. 
                        He didn’t mean to. I keep trying 
                        not to think about it but I can’t 
                        not think about it.

           She looks to Luke.

                                 MARLA (CONT’D)
                        It’s fucking terrifying Luke. I’m 
                        not sure I know how to help him.

           Luke nods, understanding the gravity. His mind clearly 
           churning. He goes to her. He puts his arms around her.

                                 LUKE
                        I’ll help you. I’ll help you both.
           EXT. MADNICK HOUSE - AFERNOON

           The door to an SUV opens. Klyce reaches into the back seat 
           and returns with Esme sitting on his hip. 

           She looks to the door. Mister Grey is standing in the doorway 
           to the Madnick house. 

                                 ESME
                        He has to go. 

           Klyce looks to her. Esme looks at him petulantly.

                                 ESME (CONT’D)
                        He won’t stop screaming. I can’t 
                        hear anything else.

           Mister Grey looks at them stoically. Klyce indicates with his 
           head. Mister Grey puts on a pair of sunglasses and clears the 
           doorway as Klyce carries Esme towards the house.

           INT. MADNICK HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON

           The Living room is covered in tape, markings, plastic bags 
           covering the furniture. It’s been wrapped up in a giant 
           forensic analysis.

           Klyce kneels against the wall, carefully watching Esme as she 
           walks around the room.

           ON ESME: Echoes of voices. An indistinguishable mix, tones of 
           Mike, Marla and Scott’s voices. 

           Esme walks over to record player sitting on the floor. She 
           puts her hand on it.

           She turns. Over her shoulder: 

           Mike and Scott sit on the floor of the living room together, 
           the record player between them. They’re singing along to Try 
           A Little Tenderness by Otis Redding, laughing as they have a 
           hard time matching his pitch.

           Esme watches them in wonder. 

           Scott has a deck of cards in his hand. He flips them around.

                                 SCOTT
                        Don’t worry about the weight- 
                        there’s no weight to these things. 
                        Just stop thinking for a second. 
                        Listen to Otis, baby.
           Eyes closed, Mike is deeply in tune with the beat. 

                                 SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        It makes it eeeeeeasier to bare!

           A card from the top of the deck begins to float in the air. 
           Scott watches it with pride. He keeps singing along to Otis 
           as more cards begin to float in the air.

           Esme takes her fingers off the record player. She looks to 
           Klyce.

                                 ESME
                        The boy’s daddy tried to help him. 
                        He didn’t have any idea what he was 
                        doing. So he kind of did okay.

           Esme gets up. Walks out of the room. Klyce follows her.

           INT. MADNICK HOUSE - MARLA’S BEDROOM - AFTERNOON

           Marla lies in her bed, tears pouring. 

           Esme watches from the doorway, entranced, trying to 
           understand. She goes to Marla.

           Esme puts her hand on Marla’s face.

                                 ESME
                        She’s a good mommy. 

                                 KLYCE
                        What?

           Klyce stands in the doorway. Esme turns to him.

                                 ESME
                        She has a secret upstairs. She’s 
                        thinking about it.

           Klyce looks to the ceiling.

                                 KLYCE
                        Show me.

           INT. MADNICK HOUSE - ATTIC - AFTERNOON

           The attic is dark and dusty. There are piles of boxes being 
           catalogued. 

           Esme goes to a stack of photos laid out on the floor. Her toe 
           is touching a college photo of Marla and Luke.
                                 ESME
                        Luke will help me.

                                 KLYCE
                        What?

                                 ESME
                        She says that. Over and over and 
                        over. 

           She looks up at Klyce.

                                 ESME (CONT’D)
                        That’s Luke.

                                 KLYCE
                        That’s Luke?

           Klyce bends down and picks up the photograph. He stares at 
           young Marla and Luke in it.

                                 KLYCE (CONT’D)
                        Hi Luke.

           He beams at Esme.

           EXT. LUKE’S HOUSE - DUSK 

           The sun dips below the horizon as the cover of night begins 
           to fall.

           INT. LUKE’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - SAME MOMENTS

           Mike, Marla, River and Luke sit around a coffee table. River 
           carefully rolls a large joint. Music plays in the background.

                                 LUKE
                        Have you heard of the underground 
                        railroad?

                                 MIKE
                        Sure.

                                 LUKE
                        Alright, smart guy. What is it?

                                 RIVER
                        Here we go.

                                 MIKE
                        It was bunch of people helping 
                        slaves escape slavery.
                                 LUKE
                        It was an extremely complex network 
                        of agents managing routes and safe 
                        houses to facilitate slaves escape 
                        to free states, and it is one of 
                        the only major examples of a 
                        successful, nonviolent underground 
                        resistance in our nation’s history.

                                 MIKE
                        Right.

                                 LUKE
                        Now. The Norwegians. Took this idea 
                        and created their own underground 
                        network to help the Jews escape the 
                        Holocaust and added a vast network 
                        of resistant groups all along the 
                        Norwegian coast. Farmers, 
                        shepherds, fisherman: all freedom 
                        fighters.

           River takes a puff of the newly rolled blunt and hands it to 
           Luke, who starts smoking it.

                                 LUKE (CONT’D)
                        Fast forward 80 years to today. We 
                        have the beginnings- more- than the 
                        beginnings of a police state. 

                                 RIVER
                        God damn right.

                                 LUKE
                        Corporations are treated as people, 
                        people are treated as 
                        inconveniences... And people like 
                        you... Aren’t even thought of as 
                        human. I believe, and I’m not alone 
                        in this, that there’s going to be a 
                        time, and it’s not far from now... 
                        Where the legislators of this 
                        country are going to turn their 
                        backs on you, and say you are not  
                        a human being, and therefore not 
                        protected by our Constitution, and 
                        therefore a threat to them. To us. 
                        To their... “Freedom.” And then 
                        they will hunt you down and cut you 
                        up and make money off of you, and 
                        if they can’t make money off of 
                        you, they will erase you. And that 
                        will be the story of you.
           Luke exhales. He sees he’s freaking Mike out a little. He 
           passes him the joint.

                                 LUKE (CONT’D)
                        Heavy, right? Have some medicine. 

                                 MARLA
                        He’s not smoking that.

                                 LUKE
                        Mom! It’s not like he hasn’t done 
                        it before.

                                 MIKE
                        It’s fine. 

                                 MARLA
                        I’m not watching my sixteen year 
                        old smoke pot.

                                 LUKE
                        This is my house.

                                 MARLA
                        This is my son.

                                 LUKE
                        Okay, okay, we’re all very old and 
                        very responsible and let’s all 
                        continue talking about how awful 
                        the world is turning out and not 
                        have any fun. You’re right. Mom.

           Luke withdraws the joint and hands it back to River.

                                 MARLA
                        So what’s your point?

                                 LUKE
                        What?

                                 MARLA
                        About the Underground Railroad.

                                 LUKE
                        Right-right-right. The point is. 
                        Here we are on the precipice of 
                        your impending political doom and 
                        we have foresight. One of the rare 
                        occasions in history where we can 
                        be ahead of the curve! 
                                 MIKE
                        There’s another Underground 
                        Railroad.

           Luke points at him, beaming.

                                 LUKE
                        Sharp! You bought yourself a sharp 
                        kid. 

                                 MARLA
                        Who?

                                 LUKE
                        What do you mean?

                                 MARLA
                        Who runs it?

                                 LUKE
                        It’s an Underground Railroad. It’s 
                        people like me that run it.

                                 MARLA
                        Stoners.

                                 RIVER
                        Cashiers, bankers, hairstylist. 
                        Protestors, freedom fighters. 
                        Anyone who believes in a better 
                        tomorrow.

                                 LUKE
                        Couldn’t have said it better.

                                 MIKE
                        Where does it go?

           Luke smiles.

                                 LUKE
                        It will take you far from here 
                        Michael. A place where you can be 
                        safe. And maybe. Eventually. Join 
                        your people. 

           The idea really hits Mike. His people.

                                 MARLA
                        I am his people.

           Luke smiles apathetically.
                                 LUKE
                        Lift oranges with your mind often, 
                        do you?

                                 MARLA
                        No.

                                 LUKE
                        Well. There are others. Like you. 
                        Probably. And one day you’ll find 
                        each other. Everyone needs a 
                        promised land.

                                 MARLA
                        How does the system work?

                                 LUKE
                        I make a phone call and a van picks 
                        us up. We go to the first safe 
                        house. They chart out a plan. And 
                        we go... 

           Luke regards Marla.

                                 MARLA
                        Sounds a little simple.

                                 LUKE
                        ... well. Not really. I can’t say 
                        anyone has ever done it. I 
                        certainly haven’t. I just have a 
                        number and I call it, and we see 
                        what happens.

           Marla doesn’t look satisfied.

                                 LUKE (CONT’D)
                        I know the people at the other end 
                        of this number. We can go there, 
                        see if there’s any organization to 
                        it at all, and if you don’t like it 
                        we can figure something else out. 
                        Okay?

                                 MIKE
                        Mom.

           Marla looks to Mike.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        I think we should do it.
                                 LUKE
                        And you. If I can spot you from 
                        twenty years ago, you should do 
                        something with that hair.

           River is high, giggling. Mike looks to Marla, unsure.

           INT. LUKE’S HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Marla wipes steam off the mirror. Her hair is cut short, 
           bleached blonde. She looks strikingly different.

           On the counter are her folded clothes and gun. She sets the 
           gun aside and begins to dress herself.

           INT. LUKE’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Marla comes down the stairs and into the kitchen. Mike and 
           Luke are laughing together, looking over a book.

                                 MARLA
                        What is going on down here?

                                 LUKE
                        Look at you, blondie!

                                 MIKE
                        You had dread locks?

                                 MARLA
                        OHHHH-boy.

           Marla steps over to them. In Luke’s lap is an old photo book. 
           He shows it to Marla. A photo of Luke with his arm slung over 
           Marla’s shoulder, both of them covered in mud. Marla has 
           ratty dread locks.

                                 MIKE
                        It looks like there’s a dead rat on 
                        your head.

                                 MARLA
                        It was the 90s.

                                 MIKE
                        White folks and dread locks.

                                 LUKE
                        Can you believe how young we look? 
                        We’re babies! Look at this one-
           Luke flips the page. He reveals a photo of Marla in her 
           underwear chained to a large tree.

                                 MIKE
                        What the hell?

                                 LUKE
                        I was doing a save the rainforest 
                        project and we took all of these 
                        pictures of hot girls tied up in 
                        their underwear to get people to 
                        come to the protest.

                                 MIKE
                        “Hot girls”

                                 LUKE
                        Shit boy, hadn’t you heard? Your 
                        mom was a fox.

           Marla smirks at this. The phone rings.

                                 LUKE (CONT’D)
                        Hang on.

           He puts the photo book in Mike’s lap and goes to the phone. 
           Marla sits next to him, paging through it.

                                 LUKE (CONT’D)
                        Thanks

           Luke hangs up. 

                                 LUKE (CONT’D)
                        Nine.

           Marla looks over at the clock hanging over the door. It reads 
           7:30.

           INT. LUKE’S HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - MUCH LATER

           It’s dark. All of the house lights are off. Luke stands by 
           the front door. River is standing next to him. He kisses her. 
           Looks her in the eyes. He whispers.

                                 LUKE
                        Two days. Maybe three. 

                                 RIVER
                        Call me?

                                 LUKE
                        Probably not.
           River eyes Marla in the other room.

                                 RIVER
                        I don’t really like her.

                                 LUKE
                        That’s because you’re jealous. 

           Headlights shine onto Luke and River for a moment. Luke looks 
           out the window.

                                 LUKE (CONT’D)
                        It’s time.

           Marla sits up. Mike is asleep on the couch next to her. His 
           headphones are on. The CD player spins Rad-Dad’s Tunes. She 
           touches Mike and he sits up. They’re dressed, packed, ready 
           to go. 

           Luke opens the door. They exit. River closes the door behind 
           them.

           EXT. LUKE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           A black windowless van idles in front of the house, the 
           headlights turned off. The side door slides open. A shadowy 
           MAN (SIMON) waits for them in the back.

                                 MAN  (SIMON)
                        Get in.

                                 LUKE
                        It’s okay.

           They hesitate. Luke brushes past them and gets in. Mike 
           follows. Marla hesitates one more moment, then gets in.

           INT. MOVING VAN - NIGHT

           The van is pitch black. There’s a metal grate separating the 
           front two seats and the rest of the van. Little lights from 
           the dashboard and the headlights give little clues as to who 
           is in the van with them. 

           No one speaks. 

                                 MARLA
                        Where are we going?

                                 MAN (SIMON)
                        Better you don’t know.
                                 MARLA
                        Better for who?

                                 MAN (SIMON)
                        For us. 

           Marla takes Mike’s hand. She whispers in his ear.

           INT. MOVING VAN - NIGHT - LATER

           The van bounces down a muddy dirt road. 

           EXT. MOVING VAN - NIGHT

           The van bounces up and down the dirt road, splashing mud. It 
           goes up a slight incline in a field. 

           Up ahead, buildings sit on the horizon. A silo and a 
           farmhouse. 

           The van pulls up to the edge of the farmhouse and stops. The 
           driver gets out of the car.

           INT. VAN - NIGHT

           Marla opens her eyes. She watches as the driver goes to a 
           metal gate and unlocks it. The DRIVER (PAUL) swings the metal 
           gate open, then gets back into the van. Continues driving.

           EXT. FARM - NIGHT

           The van pulls up into the center of the Farm complex. Simon 
           opens the door.

                                 MAN (SIMON)
                        We’re here.

           Marla, Mike, and Luke follow.

           The Farm is eerily quiet. There are no signs of animals. 
           Nearby, the Farmhouse emits a glowing yellow light.

           INT. FARM HOUSE - NIGHT

           Simon leads the four into the Farm House, Paul takes up the 
           rear. They enter a large room with a long wood table which 
           could easily seat twenty.

           Simon holds up a walkie talkie to his mouth.
                                 MAN (SIMON)
                        We’re here.

           He turns to Marla.

                                 MAN (CONT’D)
                        I know you’re packing a gun. I’m 
                        gonna need it. 

                                 LUKE
                        She doesn’t have a gun, why-

                                 MAN (SIMON)
                        Gun.

                                 LUKE
                        Hey-

           Marla stares him down.

                                 MARLA
                        Why?

                                 MAN (SIMON)
                        Give it to me.

           The air turns unfriendly. Marla takes a step backwards, 
           guarding Mike.

           Simon grabs at Marla, pushing her up against the wall and 
           spinning her around. Luke shouts- Paul pulls out a pistol and 
           points it at him.

                                 LUKE
                        Marla!

           The gun in Paul’s hand goes off- a loud BANG. He screams, 
           dropping the gun. The fingers on his hand have been blown 
           off. Simon turns-

           -Mike is pointing his index and middle finger directly at 
           him. The kitchen is shaking.

                                 MIKE
                        GET AWAY FROM HER!

           Simon steps away. The room is vibrating worse. Wood is 
           splintering.

           Marla rushes to Mike and takes the headphones from his neck 
           and puts them over his ears. She reaches for his player and 
           hits play.
           Little Ol’ Me by Otis Redding starts. Marla wraps her arms 
           around Mike, clutching him, rocking him back and fourth, her 
           eyes squeezed shut.

           Luke has taken cover underneath the long table. He stares up 
           at them.

           The vibration goes from a constant into a pulse. It lingers 
           there for another moment, then stops altogether. 

           The room is silent. Marla breaks away from Mike. His eyes are 
           red, full of tears. 

           She smiles, breaking into laughter of relief, putting her 
           hands on his face. They hug.

           A slow clap starts.

           Marla and Mike turn.

           At the other end of the long table is a group of six people. 
           Leading the group is HARRIET (50) and GARRETT (55) both salt-
           and-pepper hippies. Harriet is clapping.

                                 HARRIET
                        Amazing. Just. Amazing. 

                                 LUKE
                        Jesus Christ, Harriet. 

           Luke goes towards the group. Harriet calls over to Simon and 
           Paul

                                 HARRIET
                        Simon? Is he okay?

           Simon is on the ground, cupping Paul’s bleeding hand.

                                 SIMON
                        No he’s not okay! He’s blown off 
                        his hand!

                                 HARRIET
                        Well that serves him right, we 
                        didn’t bring these people here to 
                        shoot them, did we. Can you guys 
                        take care of him please? Thank you.

           Several of Harriet’s posse go to Simon and Paul’s aid, 
           picking him and his fingers up. Harriet and Garrett speak 
           with Luke in low mumbles. 

                                 MARLA
                        Hello! You’re in charge here?
           Harriet approaches Marla, trying to get hold of the 
           situation.

                                 HARRIET
                        That was extremely unnecessary, we 
                        have a strict no guns policy for 
                        visitors. 

                                 MARLA
                        I can see that.

                                 GARRETT
                        Why don’t we start over, if we can 
                        try to. I am Garrett. This is 
                        Harriet. You’re in our home and we 
                        welcome you.

                                 LUKE
                        This is Marla and Michael Madnick.

                                 HARRIET
                        Michael. It’s very nice to meet 
                        you. We’ve been waiting for a very 
                        long time.

           Harriet extends her hand to Michael only. Michael shakes it.

                                 HARRIET (CONT’D)
                        You’ll have to forgive the cloak 
                        and dagger of it all. But we’ve 
                        never met a genuine Ander-Human as 
                        far as we know. We’re all a little 
                        nervous. I’m afraid we will have to 
                        insist about the gun.

           Marla isn’t happy about it.

                                 MARLA
                        Are you worried about your safety?

                                 HARRIET
                        We’re worried about everyone’s 
                        safety.

                                 LUKE
                        It’s alright.

           Marla produces the gun. Garrett takes it and walks off with 
           it.

                                 HARRIET
                        We’re so glad you’re finally here.
           INT. FARM HOUSE - WAR ROOM - NIGHT

           Marla and Mike sit on a couch in a living room. The walls are 
           coated with tattered political posters, newspaper clippings, 
           magazine covers, all related to the politics around the third 
           helix. Harriet, Garrett and several others make a crowd in 
           the relatively cramped room.

           There are photos of children and teenagers pinned around a 
           map, different colored sharpie lines and pins connecting 
           them.

                                 HARRIET
                        It’s wasn’t a stretch of the 
                        imagination that Danny Drake wasn’t 
                        the only Ander-Human out there. 
                        There’s probably hundreds more. But 
                        they’re either too scared to come 
                        out, rightfully so- or they don’t 
                        know what they are yet.

                                 GARRETT
                        You’ve seen the ads? The Luna 
                        Corporation ads? ‘Our Children are 
                        the Future’ right?

                                 MIKE
                        Yeah, they’re everywhere now.

                                 GARRETT
                        It’s an angle to get you to 
                        identify yourself. Create parental 
                        concern, convince mommy to test her 
                        kids out of concern. Or personal 
                        gain. It’s the red scare all over 
                        again.

                                 HARRIET
                        There have been others. Suspected. 
                        Not many. A lot of it falls under 
                        urban legends, but the internet 
                        helps substantiate some of it. We 
                        want to help them, but we can’t 
                        exactly put out a commercial like 
                        Luna does. 

                                 MARLA
                        You know that Michael was involved 
                        in an accident at his high school?
                                 HARRIET
                        Law enforcement is looking for you, 
                        but as best as we can tell, they 
                        don’t have a read on where you’re 
                        headed. We’d like to keep it that 
                        way.

           Harriet puts a map down on the coffee table in front of them. 
           She points to it and speaks almost exclusively to Mike.

                                 HARRIET (CONT’D)
                        Things are better for you in 
                        Canada. For one, they don’t lynch 
                        their citizens. But we’ve been 
                        setting a pretty low bar in this 
                        country.

                                 MARLA
                        Canada.

                                 HARRIET
                        There’s a network of people like us 
                        out there. We’ll help you get 
                        there. We’ll start off by getting 
                        you out of the state. From there, 
                        we’ll stop in the White Mountains 
                        then cut East. Someone else will 
                        take you across to New Brunswick. 
                        That’s the easiest place to do it.

                                 MARLA
                        You’ve done this before?

           Silence. Nothing.

                                 MARLA (CONT’D)
                        You guys don’t really expect us to 
                        risk ourselves on a theory, do you?

                                 GARRETT
                        You’re right. A lot of it is 
                        theory. We have... Contacts that we 
                        trust. Like Luke trusts us, and so 
                        on, and so on. It’s not a perfect 
                        system. But it’s something. For 
                        your boy, it’s something to fight 
                        what’s otherwise inevitable.

                                 HARRIET
                        Others have done it.

                                 MIKE
                        How many?
                                 HARRIET
                        We couldn’t say. I’m sorry. We’ve 
                        heard of a few. Maybe ten. It’s not 
                        exactly something we’re inclined to 
                        keep records on. 

                                 MIKE
                        What happens if we get to Canada?

                                 HARRIET
                        You start over.

                                 MARLA
                        Just like that, huh?

           Marla and Harriet lock eyes. 

                                 HARRIET
                        I know you’re looking out for 
                        yourself and it’s totally normal to 
                        be skeptical. But we’re in this 
                        just as much as you.

                                 MARLA
                        I’m not so sure I agree.

           Silence. Garrett breaks the moment-

                                 GARRETT
                        We have to make some arrangements. 
                        It should only take us a day. If 
                        things go smoothly, we’ll be able 
                        to get going in two nights. You’ll 
                        stay here in the meantime.

           Marla and Harriet are still locked in eye contact.

                                 GARRETT (CONT’D)
                        ...Is that okay?

                                 MARLA
                        Yeah. That’s just fine.

           INT. FARM HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Marla and Mike are in a small room with two twin beds 
           separated by a night stand. They sit on their respective 
           beds, backs to each other as they change.

                                 MARLA
                        What do you think?
                                 MIKE
                        About these people?

                                 MARLA
                        Uh-huh.

                                 MIKE
                        I think they’re weird.

           Marla nods. 

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        But I think they want to help us.

                                 MARLA
                        You don’t go anywhere without me, 
                        okay.

                                 MIKE
                        I know.

                                 MARLA
                        I mean it.

                                 MIKE
                        Mom. I won’t.

                                 MARLA
                        Okay.

           A knock at the door. Luke pokes his head in.

                                 LUKE
                        Everything alright?

                                 MARLA
                        Fine. Thanks. Good night.

           Luke hesitates.

                                 LUKE
                        Can I talk to you for a second?

           Marla gets up, goes to the door.

                                 MARLA
                        Be right back.

           INT. FARM HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Luke and Marla stand outside the door.
                                 LUKE
                        Look just... I’m your friend. Try 
                        to keep it together, alright?

                                 MARLA
                        What?

                                 LUKE
                        The thing with the gun, the 
                        attitude... You haven’t been 
                        putting on a friendly face.

                                 MARLA
                        Should I be?

                                 LUKE
                        These guys are the real deal. 
                        They’re here to fight for your son. 
                        Marla. They will die for him. You 
                        understand?

                                 MARLA
                        Alright.

                                 LUKE
                        Okay?

                                 MARLA
                        Yeah. Alright.

                                 LUKE
                        I’m sorry. I know you’ve been 
                        through a lot. I’m just trying to 
                        look out for you.

           Marla softens at this.

                                 MARLA
                        Okay. Thank you. Good night.

           She backs into her room, leaving Luke in the hall.

           Luke looks down the hall, which ends at a stair case. Peaking 
           up, just visible from the stairs is Harriet, staring at him.

           INT. FARM HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Marla lies down in bed. She turns off the light. She twists 
           her wedding ring on her finger. She closes her eyes.
           INT. FARM HOUSE - BEDROOM - MORNING

           Marla opens her eyes. Surprised- it’s as if no time has 
           passed. She sits up. Mike is gone, the bed is unmade. She 
           springs up and exits the bedroom in her bare feet.

           INT. FARM HOUSE - MORNING

           Back in the room with the large table, Paul, Simon and 
           another man are eating breakfast. Marla looks down to Paul’s 
           hand. It’s wrapped up in bloody dark brown gauze. He gives 
           Marla a dirty look. 

                                 SIMON
                        Your boy’s outside.

           Marla goes out the front door.

           EXT. FARM HOUSE - MORNING

           The door slams behind Marla as she heads towards the silo. 
           Music is echoing across the farm - Joe Tex’s The Love You 
           Save (May Be Your Own) blares loudly and openly. It’s oddly 
           unsettling. 

           A small crowd has amassed on the outside of the open silo, 
           about twelve people. 

           Garrett sits by a set of speakers playing the music. Harriet 
           is in the front of the group that is gathered around Mike.

                                 MARLA
                        Michael!

           She stops. 

           Mike is floating. About a foot off of the ground. He’s got 
           happy tears flowing down his face. It’s shocking- he actually 
           looks at peace for once.

           He opens his eyes and his feet touch down on the ground 
           gently. The crowd is full of excited energy, chattering 
           amongst themselves. Harriet goes to Michael and puts her 
           hands on his face, kissing him on the cheek.

                                 HARRIET
                        Music is a lubricator! It cuts 
                        through your defenses and gets to 
                        your emotional truth. Did that feel 
                        good?
                                 MIKE
                        I hadn’t done it like that before.

                                 HARRIET
                        You’re going to get much better.

                                 MIKE
                        I feel tired now.

                                 HARRIET
                        You need to rest, child!

           Harriet looks at Marla, beaming.

                                 HARRIET (CONT’D)
                        Had you seen that??

           Marla is less impressed.

                                 MARLA
                        No. 

                                 HARRIET
                        You are a miracle.

           She hugs him. Mike smiles. The crowd is moving in further. 
           Hands are touching Mike.

           Mike wipes the tears from his eyes, still smiling.

           Marla is outside of the crowd. Garrett stands next to her.

                                 GARRETT
                        We’ve never seen anything like him.

                                 MARLA
                        No one’s seen anything like him.

           Quiet as the crowd continues to touch Mike. Mike rises a foot 
           or two higher once again. 

                                 MARLA (CONT’D)
                        Where’s Luke?

                                 GARRETT
                        He had to leave before dawn.

           Marla wasn’t expecting that.

                                 MARLA
                        He didn’t say anything to me.

           Garrett keeps his eyes on Mike and Harriet, never looking 
           towards Marla.
                                 GARRETT
                        It wasn’t an expected departure. We 
                        didn’t need him here.

           He steps forward towards the crowd. 

           Marla stands on the outside of the group, alone. She can’t 
           help but smile at Mike’s expression, floating in the sky.

           INT. FARM HOUSE - WAR ROOM - DAY

           The Farm House is empty. Music still echoes outside through 
           the open windows.

           Marla steps into the War Room. She goes to the board with the 
           faces of children and teenagers. At the top of the board is 
           Danny Drake.

           Below him are a dozen other faces of various ages and races. 
           They each have a newspaper article or two pinned under them, 
           headlines like CHILD FALLS FROM FIFTH STORY WINDOW, UNSCATHED 
           and SOURCE OF EXPLOSION UNKNOWN.

           A map of the United States has pins and circles in a dozen 
           cities scattered all over.

                                 HARRIET (O.S.)
                        Danny Drake will always be their 
                        martyr. 

           Marla jumps. Harriet is staring at her.

                                 HARRIET (CONT’D)
                        That was his gift to them.

                                 MARLA
                        Some gift.

                                 HARRIET
                        He may not have been as willing as 
                        Christ supposedly was. But that 
                        doesn’t mean the result will be any 
                        different. He was that first spark. 
                        Something people could rally 
                        behind. 

                                 MARLA
                        You people seem to have a real 
                        interest in this.

                                 HARRIET
                        Oh... Marla. It’s the future. They 
                        are Gods among men.
           Marla chuckles. Harriet isn’t laughing. 

                                 MARLA
                        You’re serious!

                                 HARRIET
                        I think you underestimate him.

                                 MARLA
                        No. I know exactly what my son can 
                        do. But I keep in mind he’s a 
                        sixteen year old boy.

                                 HARRIET
                        He’s well spoken. He’s handsome. 
                        And with a little more work, he 
                        could be very important.

                                 MARLA
                        To who?

                                 HARRIET
                        There’s a movement coming. Things 
                        are going to start happening that 
                        you can’t protect Michael from, and 
                        he’s going to have to stand up for 
                        himself. And... If you wanted, you 
                        could stay here. We could give 
                        Michael and of course you shelter 
                        as we prepare. 

                                 MARLA
                        I know you guys are tied up in a 
                        whole whirlwind of politics, but 
                        this is a child, this is my child. 
                        And I just want to get him to 
                        safety. Luke said you would help 
                        us.

                                 HARRIET
                        We’ll do everything we can. For 
                        him.

           Harriet puts a hand on Marla’s shoulder comfortingly and 
           walks out. 

           EXT. LUKE’S HOUSE - AFTERNOON

           A knock at the door. River opens it. Klyce stands in the 
           doorway. He wears a T-shirt with a stencil of Danny Drake, 
           shredded jeans. His tattoos are showing- he looks like a 
           different person.
                                 RIVER
                        Hey.

                                 KLYCE
                        Hey! Uh... 

           Klyce looks around, confused.

                                 KLYCE (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry, maybe I have the wrong 
                        house, I was looking for Luke?

                                 RIVER
                        No, you’re right, this is Luke’s 
                        house.

                                 KLYCE
                        Oh, you’re his uh, wife?

           River laughs. She turns on the flirt to the handsome guy with 
           the tattoos.

                                 RIVER
                        I’m River.

                                 KLYCE
                        Oh, you’re River, of course you 
                        are.

                                 RIVER
                        Who are you stranger?

                                 KLYCE
                        I’m Chris. 

                                 RIVER
                        Chris?

                                 KLYCE
                        Luke and I went to college 
                        together. Got in a whole mess of 
                        trouble back in the day. He ever 
                        mention me?

                                 RIVER
                        He’s kept you a secret.

                                 KLYCE
                        Is that right?

                                 RIVER
                        That’s right.

           Klyce gives her a devilish smile.
                                 KLYCE
                        Luke around? 

           River fakes a pout, shaking her head.

                                 RIVER
                        Nope. Not around.

                                 KLYCE
                        Uh-huh. And what are you doing now?

                                 RIVER
                        I don’t know.

                                 KLYCE
                        You don’t know? Well, I was 
                        wondering maybe I could come in for 
                        a second, just leave Luke a little 
                        note for when he gets in?

           River looks Klyce up and down.

                                 RIVER
                        Chris, right?

                                 KLYCE
                        Yeah, that’s right.

                                 RIVER
                        You really know Luke?

           He gives her a big toothy grin.

                                 KLYCE
                        Why would I lie?

           INT. FARM HOUSE - NIGHT

           A group of fifteen sits around the long table. Marla sits at 
           the table between a few women. Mike sits a few seats down 
           from her, laughing at something Garrett is whispering as he 
           points across the table with his spoon.

           Marla glares over to Harriet. Harriet catches the look. Marla 
           eases the tension in her face and gives Harriet a polite 
           smile. Harriet returns it.

           She returns to eating. Her eyes glance over to Mike. She 
           waits a moment. They make eye contact. She shifts her eyes to 
           the opposite end of the room for a moment and raises two 
           fingers slightly.

           She gets up and goes around the corner.
           The laughter in the other room continues. She waits. She 
           waits.

           Mike rounds the corner after her.

                                 MIKE
                        What?

                                 MARLA
                        I don’t like what I’m feeling.

                                 MIKE
                        What?

                                 MARLA
                        This doesn’t feel right.

                                 MIKE
                        They’re just weird.

           Marla’s eyes dart around the corner. Harriet is looking at 
           them, still smiling.

                                 MARLA
                        Are you okay?

                                 MIKE
                        I’m okay.

                                 MARLA
                        You’re sure.

                                 MIKE
                        Mom!

                                 MARLA
                        Okay.

           Mike hesitates, seeing she’s really upset.

                                 MIKE
                        Look... We’ll be moving again 
                        tomorrow. They just want to take 
                        care of us. It’s okay.

           He hugs her.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        Okay?

                                 MARLA
                        You sound like your father.
           She stops. Mike is frozen, upset- the feeling is caught in 
           his throat. 

                                 MARLA (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry-

           Mike shakes his head.

                                 MIKE
                        No. That’s good. I like that.

           She hugs him again.

                                 HARRIET (O.S.)
                        Everything alright?

                                 MIKE
                        Yeah!

           Mike breaks away from her and goes back around the corner to 
           the dining room. 

           INT. FARM HOUSE - NIGHT

           Marla sits back down at the table, this time next to Mike. 
           Simon comes around with a bottle. He begins pouring the 
           bottle into the cups around. The air around the table is 
           light, jovial, extremely conversational. Marla tries smiling, 
           starting to lighten up.

           Simon runs out of liquid in the bottle just short of Mike and 
           Marla’s cups. 

                                 SIMON
                        Hang on.

           He shuffles off for a moment and returns with a second 
           bottle. He begins pouring.

           Mike takes a drink. He downs the whole thing. 

           Marla sips it. She pushes the cup away from her, crinkling 
           her nose.

           Laughter erupts. 

           INT. FARM HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Mike is passed out on the bed. Marla is on her bed, watching 
           him. She closes her eyes. They open again. She closes them 
           again.
           The door to the bedroom opens.

           A set of hands grab her. She opens her eyes, instantly begins 
           to fight. A body is on top of her, mounting her. A gloved 
           hand covers her mouth, the other hand starts slapping her on 
           her forehead.

                                 SIMON 
                        Shh! Stop. You make a sound I’ll 
                        slit that kid’s throat. You hear?

           Marla nods. Another figure comes around. It’s Paul his right 
           hand is taped up. He holds his gun with his left hand.

                                 PAUL
                        She’s supposed to be unconscious.

                                 SIMON
                        I know.

                                 PAUL
                        Did you give it to her?

                                 SIMON
                        Just shut up.

                                 PAUL
                        She isn’t supposed to fucking be 
                        awake.

                                 SIMON
                        On three we’re getting up and going 
                        outside, you understand?

           Marla nods

                                 SIMON (CONT’D)
                        One... Two...

           He gets off her silently. Marla rises. Two guns are on her. 
           Marla looks over her shoulder. Mike is fast asleep, snoring.

           They lead her to the hallway.

           INT. FARM HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Simon is in front of her, facing her walking backwards. Paul 
           is behind her. Marla walks slowly, her hands out to her 
           sides, palms up.

                                 MARLA
                        What are we doing?
                                 SIMON
                        SHHH! SHUT. UP.

           They are heading towards the stairs. 

                                 MARLA
                        He’s not going to do a god damn 
                        thing for you if he thinks you hurt 
                        me.

                                 SIMON
                        SHUT IT.

           Simon takes one step down the stairs, backwards.

           Marla slams her foot directly into Simon’s face. He falls 
           backwards down the stairs. His gun goes off- shooting Paul in 
           the chest.

           Shouts comes from the other end of the farmhouse.

           Marla falls down the stairs on top of Simon. She goes for his 
           gun. He grabs at her.

           They wrestle, Marla has the upper angle and the leverage. She 
           twists the gun down. It goes off, blowing a hole in Simon’s 
           shoe.

           He howls like a wolf.

           Marla is up. Running up the stairs, over Paul’s body and back 
           down the hallway. Yelling in the distance. Someone is ringing 
           a dinner bell.

           INT. FARM HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Marla hops into the bedroom and pushes her bed against the 
           door, blocking it. She runs to Michael.

                                 MARLA
                        Michael! 

           She shakes his whole body, violently.

                                 MARLA (CONT’D)
                        Mike! Wake up!

           She slaps him across the face. He does not wake. There are 
           people outside the bedroom. Pushing on the door. Bumping the 
           bed.

           She grabs a glass of water from the middle table. She pours 
           it on his face.
           Mike sits up with a start- Marla goes flying back into the 
           wall across the room. Mike pants in terror, coming out of his 
           drugged sleep.

                                 MARLA (CONT’D)
                        WE HAVE TO GO.

           Mike gasps, looking to the shaking door. 

                                 MIKE
                        Okay-

           Marla goes to the window. She opens it.

                                 MARLA
                        Come on!

           Mike grabs his CD player off the night stand. Marla ushers 
           him out the window first. As the door begins to splinter 
           open, Marla hops out.

           EXT. FARM HOUSE - NIGHT

           They fall out the second story window. It’s not an easy fall. 
           Mike makes it graceful. Marla hops up with a limp. 

           By the barn are three vehicles. A Jeep, the Van, and a 
           Toyota. 

                                 MARLA
                        Check them for keys!

           Marla goes to the Toyota. It doesn’t even unlock. Mike tries 
           the Jeep.

                                 MIKE
                        Keys!

           From within the farmhouse, lights are turning on. A few 
           people step outside. Marla points a gun at the door.

                                 MARLA
                        GET THE FUCK BACK INSIDE!

           She shoots over them, hitting the side of the farm house. She 
           points the gun down to the Toyota and shoots one of the 
           tires. She does the same with the van.

           Mike is at the wheel of the Jeep. Marla hops in the 
           passengers side. 

           They begin to drive.
           Garrett, Harriet, and a gaggle of others step out. Garret 
           gets into the van. It starts. He begins driving after them.

           Mike drives down the Farm House road. Ahead of them is the 
           metal gate.

                                 MARLA (CONT’D)
                        Watch out!

           Before the Jeep has a chance to make an impact, the gate 
           splits apart. Marla looks behind them. The Van is struggling 
           on the dirt road with one flat tire.

           They veer off the road and onto another one. The headlights 
           of the van growing distant.

           Marla gasps for air. She’s covered in Simon’s blood. She 
           reaches over to Mike and begins touching him.

                                 MARLA (CONT’D)
                        Are you hurt? ARE YOU HURT?

                                 MIKE
                        No!

           The Jeep is so open. They’re sitting ducks, covered in bloody 
           pajamas. 

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        Where are we going?

           Marla closes her eyes, calming her nerves.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        Mom!

                                 MARLA
                        Uh- I- Uh... Just keep driving. 
                        Don’t stop.

           The wind blows her blonde hair.

                                 MARLA (CONT’D)
                        Just don’t fucking stop.

           She takes a deep breath. She begins to cry. She covers her 
           face.

           EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT

           The Jeep cruises down the highway.
           EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAWN

           The sun is rising. The Jeep is parked on the side of a 
           forested road.

           Marla is kneeling by a creek at the side of the road. She 
           splashes water on her arms, on her chest, washing off the 
           blood.

           She goes to the drivers seat of the Jeep.

                                 MARLA
                        Move over.

           Mike complies. He looks exhausted.

                                 MARLA (CONT’D)
                        How’s your head? Are you okay?

           She grabs his face. He shakes his head away.

                                 MIKE
                        Fine. I’m fine...

           Mike is pissed.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        ... I feel foggy.

                                 MARLA
                        They drugged you.

                                 MIKE
                        Yeah.

                                 MARLA

           She studies him.

                                 MARLA (CONT’D)
                        What is it?

           Mike laughs in spite of himself. He shakes his head in 
           disappointment.

                                 MIKE
                        I just really wanted that to work. 
                        You know? I just wanted something 
                        that wasn’t... Fucked up.

           He closes his eyes, fighting back tears.
                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        It’s starting to feel like we 
                        should give up.

           Marla slaps him across the face. His eyes open. Shocked.

                                 MARLA
                        Stop it.

           She points an angry index finger at him, holding back a 
           sudden rage.

                                 MARLA (CONT’D)
                        You stop it... You don’t need Luke. 
                        And you sure as shit don’t need the 
                        fucking Manson family or any 
                        Underground Railroad or anything 
                        else. Because you have me. 
                        Michael... I don’t have the 
                        answers. All I know is that if 
                        anyone touches you I will fucking 
                        cut them in half.

           Silence. Marla lets out an exhausted breath.

                                 MARLA (CONT’D)
                        That’s the best I got, kid.

           Mike nods, sobered.

                                 MIKE
                        I love you.

           Marla softens. She puts her hand on his face, wiping the 
           tears off his skin. A sad smile.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        Where are we going?

                                 MARLA
                        ... Home, baby.

           She puts the Jeep into drive.

                                 MARLA (CONT’D)
                        We’re going home.

           EXT. FARM - MORNING

           The silo is on fire. Harriet, Garrett and half a dozen others 
           are on their knees in a row their hands behind their heads. 
           Mister Grey stands over a dead body at the end of the line.
           The farm is teaming with government agents, guns drawn. 
           Lockdown. 

           Klyce walks confidently towards the farm house with Esme in 
           his arms.

           Harriet watches Esme as she and Klyce pass. They lock eyes 
           for a moment. 

           INT. FARM HOUSE - WAR ROOM - MORNING

           Klyce puts Esme on the ground as he approaches the board of 
           data in the war room. Esme looks around.

                                 ESME
                        They’re gone already.

                                 KLYCE
                        How long?

                                 ESME
                        This morning.

           Klyce rips a photograph of a kid off the wall, looking at it 
           carefully. 

           INT. GOODWILL - DAY

           Marla walks into the Goodwill. Outside, Mike sits in the 
           Jeep. The television in the corner plays the news. 

           She goes to the back and she grabs two T-shirts. A third for 
           good measure. She grabs a pair of jeans. A pair of shorts. 

           She walks back out towards the door. 

                                 CASHIER
                        Excuse me!

           She bolts. Marla hops into the Jeep. It peels out onto the 
           road. 

           EXT. GAS STATION - DAY

           Dressed in their new Good-Will clothes, Marla stands by the 
           gas pump. 

           She looks to Mike, who studies the pump carefully. He opens 
           his hand.
           The hose jerks momentarily. Gas begins to flow. She smiles at 
           him.

           EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY

           The Jeep weaves through traffic. Marla changes the station, 
           listening to the radio.

           EXT. HIGHWAY - LATER

           The Jeep crosses state lines into Vermont.

           EXT. BACK WOODS ROAD - NIGHT

           The Jeep drives down an old road, hitting every pothole along 
           the way.

           The Jeep passes a rusted mailbox that reads MA_NIC_.

           INT. MOVING JEEP - NIGHT

           Mike sleeps in the back seat. Marla pulls the Jeep to a stop. 
           She looks out the windshield.

           An old wooden house sits in the woods. The paint is peeling 
           and the siding is coming down. 

           Marla looks back to Mike then gets out of the Jeep.

           EXT. SUMMER HOUSE - NIGHT

           Marla walks up rotted stairs and onto the front porch of the 
           house. She looks under a mossy door mat. A small key sits on 
           the ground.

           She picks it up and opens the door.

           INT. SUMMER HOUSE - NIGHT

           The door creeks eerily. Marla steps into the house. Shadows 
           and moonlight criss-cross. Her eyes track across the room. 
           She stops.

           Most of the furniture is covered in white sheets. A sole 
           armchair sits uncovered, the white sheet sits on the floor 
           next to it.
                                 BRUCE (O.S.)
                        Are you out of your fuckin’ mind?

           Marla jumps.

           A FIGURE stands in the adjacent doorway. The Figure moves and  
           hits a nearby light switch. A small lamp turns on, revealing 
           BRUCE HALL (77, denim, flannel and a military buzz cut.)

                                 BRUCE (CONT’D)
                        Oh you look surprised. Well. Keep 
                        that up! You should be surprised 
                        that the Feds aren’t putting a 
                        couple of holes in your tits.

                                 MARLA
                        What are you doing here, Dad?

           Bruce scowls. 

                                 BRUCE
                        Me? This is my god damn house!

                                 MARLA
                        No. You live in Revere.

                                 BRUCE
                        I’ve had cops, feds, and news 
                        reporters knocking on my god damn 
                        door for the past 48 hours because 
                        of you, what do you think I’m doing 
                        here? I’m hiding! How do you know 
                        you weren’t followed?

                                 MARLA
                        I wasn’t followed here.

                                 BRUCE
                        How sure are you of that?

                                 MARLA
                        I’m SURE, Dad. Okay! I’m sorry I’m 
                        such a fucking inconvenience, I 
                        didn’t think you would be here!

                                 BRUCE
                        You didn’t think period! Going to 
                        your summer house? That’s the first 
                        place I’d look!
                                 MARLA
                        I don’t have anywhere else to go! 
                        You wanna kick me out, kick me out, 
                        but I’m taking what I came here 
                        for!

           He considers. Nods.

                                 BRUCE
                        You look like you need a drink.

           INT. SUMMER HOUSE - NIGHT

           The house is spare, extremely kept. Black and white photos 
           hang on the wall. A deer head is mounted with fishing hats 
           hanging from the antlers.

           Bruce pours Marla a glass of whiskey.

                                 BRUCE
                        You see the news?

                                 MARLA
                        I’ve been a little busy.

           He chuckles.

                                 BRUCE
                        Yeah. Well. They figured it out.

                                 MARLA
                        What?

                                 BRUCE
                        That it’s the two of you. For a 
                        while they just thought it was just 
                        your little niglet.

           Marla glares at him.

                                 MARLA
                        Your grandson’s name is Michael.

           Bruce nods.

                                 BRUCE
                        I thought you said he’d never be my 
                        grandson. 

                                 MARLA
                        Yeah, well. You didn’t exactly 
                        welcome him with open arms, now did 
                        you.
                                 BRUCE
                        Uh-huh... So what’s the plan here, 
                        dandelion?

                                 MARLA
                        The plan?

           Marla sighs. Then she laughs, shaking her head.

                                 MARLA (CONT’D)
                        Ah, yeah. The plan. The plan has 
                        gone to hell a couple of times, 
                        Daddy. I don’t know. The plan is to 
                        disappear.

                                 BRUCE
                        This isn’t exactly 1975. It’s a 
                        little harder to do that nowadays.

                                 MARLA
                        I had just under ten grand in cash. 
                        I had a gun. I had a head start. I 
                        had the tactical advantage. I lost 
                        it. And I’ve been playing catch up 
                        ever since.

           Bruce nods.

                                 BRUCE
                        So you need money.

           Marla shrugs, tears welling in her eyes.

                                 MARLA
                        Can you pretend for five god damn 
                        seconds that I’m your daughter and 
                        you love me?

           She shakes her head at him.

                                 MARLA (CONT’D)
                        I will die before they take my kid. 
                        I will die before they take my kid. 

           She locks eyes with him.

                                 MARLA (CONT’D)
                        I will die before they take my kid.

                                 MIKE (O.S.)
                        Mom-

           They look to the front door. Mike is letting himself in. 
                                 MARLA
                        Come here. 

           He does.

                                 MARLA (CONT’D)
                        Michael Madnick, meet my father, 
                        Bruce Hall.

           Bruce eyes Mike uncertainly. Mike does the same.

                                 MIKE
                        Hey.

                                 BRUCE
                        Boy, that’s how you say hello to 
                        your grandfather?

                                 MIKE
                        Boy?

           He looks to Marla.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        Ma, You didn’t tell me grandpa was 
                        in the Klan.

           Bruce laughs with appreciation. 

                                 BRUCE
                        You might be my grandson after all. 
                        Alright then. Alright.

           Bruce extends his hand. Mike shakes it.

                                 BRUCE (CONT’D)
                        Michael.

           INT. SUMMER HOUSE - BACK ROOM - NIGHT

           Marla stands in the guest bedroom. At the foot of the bed is 
           a wooden chest. She opens it up, revealing a pile of linens. 

           She removes the layer of linens, uncovering a rifle and a 
           shotgun.

           She sits on the bed with the shotgun. On the night stand is a 
           faded wedding photo of her parents- Bruce wears a Marine’s 
           uniform. 
           INT. SUMMER HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Mike peels through a stack of records stacked on a shelf. 
           Bruce watches him carefully.

                                 BRUCE
                        You like music?

                                 MIKE
                        Old stuff. Sam Cooke. The 
                        Pretenders. Joe Tex.

                                 BRUCE
                        You sound like your dad.

                                 MIKE
                        Doesn’t sound like a compliment.

           Bruce chuckles.

                                 BRUCE
                        No. I guess not. Always found him 
                        to be a little peculiar. What’s he 
                        been doing while you and your 
                        mother have been carving your place 
                        in the ten most wanted?

                                 MIKE
                        He’s dead. 

           Mike takes a record out of its sleeve. He places it on the 
           player.

                                 BRUCE
                        I didn’t know that.

           The music starts playing. Johnny Cash’s The Man Comes Around. 
           Mike closes his eyes, letting himself slip into the music. 

                                 MIKE
                        It was my fault. I lost control.

           Gracefully, as if underwater, dozens of small items begin to 
           float into the air. Pens, extra pairs of glasses, loose 
           change, a pack of cigarettes- they all engage in an aerial 
           ballet. 

           Bruce watches in amazement. The pack of cigarettes opens, the 
           cigarettes all spill out. The paper and tobacco split apart 
           from each other, and the papers snake around each other.

           They form a perfect paper sphere, which floats in front of 
           Bruce. He opens his hand and the paper sphere rests gently in 
           his palm.
                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        But I’m working on that.

           The Johnny Cash song comes to an end. All of the floating 
           items hit the ground with a crash. 

           Silence. Bruce clears his throat.

                                 BRUCE
                        You gonna fix my cigarettes?

           EXT. SUMMER HOUSE - NIGHT

           Marla sits on the back porch, looking out into the woods. She 
           cleans the shotgun and rifle like it’s second nature. She 
           finishes and goes inside.

           INT. SUMMER HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Mike is asleep on the couch. Bruce sits at the table, 
           carefully rolling cigarettes. 

                                 BRUCE
                        That’s some kid you got there.

                                 MARLA
                        Yeah. God he’s so tired.

                                 BRUCE
                        Being an outlaw will do that.

                                 MARLA
                        Mm. 

                                 BRUCE
                        When are you going to head out?

                                 MARLA
                        I was thinking tonight. I don’t 
                        want to give you any more trouble.

                                 BRUCE
                        Probably smart.

                                 MARLA
                        Yeah.

                                 BRUCE
                        You expecting to use that shotgun?
                                 MARLA
                        I was expecting to be in a cell 
                        getting water boarded by now.

                                 BRUCE
                        No, you’ll give em a good run 
                        before it gets to that.

                                 MARLA
                        Doing my best.

           Silence. 

                                 BRUCE
                        Think you actually have a shot?

                                 MARLA
                        I don’t have a choice.

           INT. SUMMER HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - SAME MOMENTS

           Mike lies on the sofa asleep- the conversation inaudible, 
           instead replaced with low echoes of far off voices swirling 
           around.

           Mike’s eyes open. He sits up- turns to Marla.

                                 MIKE
                        Mom.

                                 MARLA
                        We have to go.

           She turns to Bruce, panicked. 

                                 MARLA (CONT’D)
                        I can’t move my legs.

           INT. MOVING SUV - NIGHT

           ESME opens her eyes. Klyce sits next to her in the back seat. 

                                 ESME
                        Take Michael and run.

           INT. SUMMER HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - SAME MOMENTS

           Mike sits up.

                                 MIKE
                        What about you?
                                 MARLA
                        I’ll be fine-

           INT. MOVING SUV - NIGHT - SAME MOMENTS

                                 ESME
                        - Just go.

           Klyce speaks into a walkie-talkie.

                                 KLYCE
                        They’re moving. 

           INT. SUMMER HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Mike puts Marla’s arm around his shoulder. He pushes to lift 
           her up. 

           Marla lets out a scream. The chair rises with her. 

           Mike’s eyes go to the window. Headlights can be seen coming 
           through the woods.

           INT. MOVING SUV - NIGHT

           Esme stares straight ahead-

           INT. SUMMER HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - SAME MOMENTS

           Mike stares straight ahead - as if they’ve locked eyes. He 
           grits his teeth.

           INT. MOVING SUV - NIGHT

           VIOLENT FLASHES OF RED WHITE AND BLACK, A CACOPHONY OF 
           ELECTRIC FEEDBACK. An atom bomb goes off in Esme’s head.

           She squeezes her head in pain at the sensory shock.

           INT. SUMMER HOUSE - LIVING ROOM

           Marla’s legs are free, she stumbles over Mike. She grabs the 
           duffle bag and shotgun with one hand and Mike with the other.

           Bruce goes to the front door. Opens it. A blinding white spot 
           light shines on him. Bruce raises his hand in front of his 
           eyes. The spotlight turns off.
           Bruce looks down to his chest. It’s covered in moving red 
           dots. 

           EXT. BRUCE’S HOUSE - BACK - NIGHT

           Marla and Mike bolt out the back door. Mike stops.

                                 MARLA
                        Come on!

                                 MIKE
                        I can stop them.

                                 MARLA
                        Michael! 

           He speaks deliberately but peacefully.

                                 MIKE
                        We’re not going to get away.

           He turns back to the house. Focused. He throws his arm 
           skyward.

           A single panel of wood rips itself off the side of the house 
           and flies into the sky- as if gravity were reversed.

           EXT. SUMMER HOUSE - NIGHT

           Klyce and two dozen AGENTS stand out front, assault rifles 
           pointed at the front of the house.

                                 AGENT
                        Put your hands on your head and 
                        turn around.

           Bruce complies.

                                 BRUCE
                        There’s no problem.

           It’s alarmingly quiet. Klyce stands shielded by the open door 
           of an SUV. 

           Out of the darkness, a jagged piece of wood flies through the 
           sky and crashes into the SUV windshield, lodging itself 
           halfway through it.

           Another piece of wood comes flying through the sky. 

           The agents look around at each other. Klyce looks into the 
           back seat of the SUV where Esme still sits strapped in.
           Klyce looks to the sky. Hundreds of jagged pieces of wood are 
           coming towards them like arrows. Klyce dives head first under 
           the SUV as they begin to land.

           The agents all scatter- guns fire - several get hit by the 
           hailing boards- a plank drives itself straight through an 
           Agent’s thigh.

           Klyce crawls up towards the open SUV door. Esme is gone.

           He turns, another board narrowly missing him.

                                 KLYCE
                        Esme!

           He stands. Planks continue hailing down around him.

                                 KLYCE (CONT’D)
                        ESME!

           EXT. SUMMER HOUSE - BACK - NIGHT

           Mike continues his focus- the precision is gone. Boards crash 
           into each other. Others fly a few feet into the sky only to 
           come crashing back down onto the ground without launching 
           over the house.

           Marla watches the veins in Mike’s forehead throb.

                                 MARLA
                        We have to go!

                                 MIKE
                        I can do it-

                                 MARLA
                        Michael!

           She grabs his shoulder and yanks him. The boards in mid-air 
           take a sudden left turn into the woods. 

           EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

           Marla and Mike run. Marla hears a singsong voice humming. She 
           stops.

                                 MARLA
                        Can you hear that?

                                 MIKE
                        What?
           A low rumble builds. 

           The ground between Mike and Marla SPLITS open. Marla jumps 
           backwards away from it. 

           All over the ground splits apart- Mike gets lost in the 
           rubble. Large chunks of earth begin to float in the air while 
           others fall into the abyss- carving out a singular path for 
           Marla to follow.

                                 MARLA
                        No! No-no-no!

           She runs along it as the forest around her falls away, 
           panicked as the environment around her collapses. She begins 
           to fall into one of the earthquake chasms. 

           -It’s all gone-

           Marla is on all fours, low to the undisturbed ground. No 
           earthquake chasms, no floating rocks. 

           Behind her, gunfire. In front of her- a little girl with 
           piercing blue eyes.

           Marla sits up, looking towards the gunfire.

                                 ESME (V.O.)
                        They won’t hurt him.

           Marla jumps at the voice in her head.

                                 ESME (V.O.)
                        They need him. But they don’t need 
                        you. If you try to save him now, 
                        you’ll be a dead mommy.

           Marla looks past the treeline, trying to get a clear view of 
           what’s happening- she can’t make it out. People are shouting 
           in the distance. There’s a large metallic groan and a crash.

           She takes a step towards it.

                                 ESME (V.O.)
                        If you come with me, I can help 
                        you.

                                 MARLA
                        Then help me now!

                                 ESME (V.O.)
                        Dead Mommy, Live Mommy. 
           The sounds from the treeline have died down. Marla stares 
           towards the lights, pained. 

                                 ESME 
                        We have to go now. 

           Beams of light are shining their way- the Agents are closing 
           in.

           Marla walks in the opposite direction, back towards Esme. 
           Esme holds her arms in the sky.

                                 ESME (CONT’D)
                        Pick me up?

           Marla takes this in- then does. Esme wraps her arms around 
           Marla’s neck. 

                                 ESME (CONT’D)
                        Wait.

           Marla stops. 

           Several AGENTS with flashlights come into view. They are 
           accompanied by Mister Grey. They point their flashlights 
           directly onto Marla, scanning the surroundings.

                                 ESME (CONT’D)
                        Wait.

           AGENTS POV: They shine their lights onto empty woods. They go 
           deeper in, passing empty space.

           Back to MARLA: Mr. Grey walks right up next to her, inches 
           away, oblivious to her presence. Esme clutches onto Marla, 
           visibly threatened by his presence.

           INT. SUMMER HOUSE - NIGHT

           Klyce steps through the house. Bruce lies on the ground, 
           floundering, clutching his shot stomach in pain. Klyce walks 
           around him on his way to the back yard.

           EXT. SUMMER HOUSE - BACK - NIGHT

           Mike looks drained - sickly. He flails his arms back and 
           forth. The few strips of wood on the side of the house fly of 
           lamely, lacking the same drive of the initial attack.

           Agents are beginning to close in on him- dozens of red dots 
           dance on his chest and head. 
           Mike throws out his arm sending an invisible force towards 
           one of the Agents, sending him to the ground.

           Mike flails. 

           From behind him, an Agent tags him with a taser. Two 
           electrified lines shoot into his side. Mike buckles, vomits, 
           and collapses on the ground.

           Instantly, he’s surrounded.

           Medical Technicians wire him with IVs hooked to colored bags. 

           Klyce wanders through the back yard, surveying the damage.

           Pieces of siding are lodged into the yard. A shattered toilet 
           lays on its side. The back of the house has been completely 
           stripped of its siding.

           Klyce looks over Mike. Then up to the woods.  He walks to the  
           treeline, looking into the darkness.

                                 KLYCE
                        ESME!

           He waits. Nothing.

                                 KLYCE (CONT’D)
                        Marla Madnick!

           Nothing. An Agent approaches him.

                                 AGENT
                        We’ve got a squad starting a sweep. 
                        They’re not far.

                                 KLYCE
                        We’re not going to find her out 
                        here.

           He looks back over to Mike.

                                 KLYCE (CONT’D)
                        She’ll have to come to us.

           Mike’s eyes flutter under the sedatives.

           BLACK.

           FADE IN. 

           MIKE struggles to open his eyes. Voices swirl around him, 
           phrases he picks up out of the darkness. When he wakes - talk 
           about - replication - scan him again - unlike anything we’ve - 
           Mike fades back into the darkness.

           INT. UNDERGROUND BUNKER - DAY

           Mike opens his eyes. Or- he would, if he could see. A metal 
           visor covers the top of his face and wraps around his skull 
           like a helmet. 

           He takes deep, shocked breaths.

           He’s strapped at a 80 degree angle on a metal table- metal 
           covers most of his body, as if he has been built into a 
           suit/table. The parts of him that are exposed are hooked up 
           to heart monitors, IVs and electric wiring.

           Mike pushes against his constraints. They don’t budge. 

                                 MIKE
                        Help! HELP! HEEEEELP!

           Mike does his best to move. He can’t. The metal groans. 
           There’s zero budge. The tubes hooked up to him fly out of 
           their sockets.

           He screams over, and over, and over and over.

           INT. UNDERGROUND BUNKER - LATER

           Mike is in the same position. His lips are cracked. He talks 
           to himself incoherently. 

                                 SPEAKER 
                        Calm.

           Mike licks his lips. 

                                 SPEAKER (CONT’D)
                        Calm.

                                 MIKE
                        Yeah. Calm.

           The metal visor splits in half and retracts into the helmet.

           WHITE LIGHT pierces Mike’s eyes. He squints, trying to 
           adjust. His eyes focus.

           A Robotic arm is in front of him. It’s tri-pronged. The 
           central prong has a camera lens. The other two prongs have 
           large needles sticking out of them, pointed directly at Mike. 
                                 SPEAKER
                        Michael.

           The speaker voice echoes in the concrete box.

                                 MIKE
                        Yes?

                                 SPEAKER
                        In the eyes of the United States 
                        Government, you are a criminal. You 
                        are a terrorist. And you are a 
                        genetic abomination... But you and 
                        I know better. Don’t we?

                                 MIKE
                        Where’s my mom?

           The camera lens shifts. 

           EXT. IHOP - DAY

           An IHOP sits in the corner of a run down parking lot. Half a 
           dozen cars are parked in front of it. A woman with three 
           screaming children exits the front door.

           INT. IHOP - DAY

           A waitress walks through the restaurant with two menus. She 
           approaches two ANCIENT LADIES sitting across from each other. 

                                 WAITRESS
                        Can I get you two ladies anything?

           One of the ladies looks particularly suspicious. She Looks to 
           the other lady, then back to the waitress.

                                 OLD LADY 1
                        Coffee. 

                                 WAITRESS
                        Okay. And you, sweetie?

                                 OLD LADY 2
                        Orange juice please!

                                 WAITRESS
                        One coffee, and one orange juice. 
                        I’ll be back in a minute to take 
                        your orders.
           The waitress steps away from MARLA and ESME, sitting across 
           from each other. Marla’s shot gun rests propped up against 
           the window next to her. 

           Esme stares at her happily. 

           The waitress returns, placing the coffee in front of Marla 
           and the orange juice in front of Esme. 

                                 WAITRESS (CONT’D)
                        Did you decide on what you’d like 
                        to order?

                                 ESME
                        I’d like some pancakes please.

                                 WAITRESS
                        Do you want our double stack? It 
                        comes with a side of eggs.

                                 ESME
                        Ummm.. Yes. Yes, I’d like that very 
                        much.

                                 WAITRESS
                        Okay. And for you, honey?

                                 MARLA
                        Um... I’ll have the same.

                                 WAITRESS
                        Sure.

           Marla looks back to Esme, still beaming at her. She takes a 
           sip of her coffee.

                                 MARLA
                        Where are your parents?

                                 ESME
                        My mommy gave me away to Mr. David 
                        because she thought she’d get 
                        money.

                                 MARLA
                        Who is Mr. David?

                                 ESME
                        He’s the man who has Michael. I 
                        don’t think he’s a very good man.

                                 MARLA
                        Where is Michael?
                                 ESME
                        I don’t know.

                                 MARLA
                        But you could find him.

                                 ESME
                        I could.

                                 MARLA
                        Will you.

                                 ESME
                        Mmmm. Depends.

                                 MARLA
                        On what?

           Esme shifts around, a little embarrassed.

                                 ESME
                        Onnnnn... If you’ll be my mother.

                                 MARLA
                        What do you mean?

                                 ESME
                        You’re a good Mommy and that’s why 
                        you want Michael back. But now I 
                        don’t have a Mommy, and I thought 
                        you could be my new one.

                                 MARLA
                        But I’m not your mommy.

                                 ESME
                        You’re not Michael’s mommy either, 
                        but you still feel like you are. 
                        Right?

           Marla nods.

                                 MARLA
                        Yeah. That’s right.

                                 ESME
                        Can you feel like you’re mine too?

           Marla looks at her. Piercingly earnest blue eyes stare back, 
           hopeful, excited. 

           BLACK.
           INT. UNDERGROUND BUNKER - DAY

           The metal body cage opens. Mike collapses onto the ground.

           The overhead lights go out, leaving Mike in momentary total 
           darkness. 

           He struggles to stand. In front of him is a metal door with 
           no knob or window. He goes to it. He presses his hands 
           against it. He begins to push.

           The metal groans and flexes. It does not give.

           He takes a step back. He holds up his hand. The metal begins 
           to grown in rapid percussion, like machine gun fire. Mike 
           let’s out a scream. The door does not budge.

           The lights go out again.

           A bright, blinding image of a CNN interview between two 
           commentators pops on screen. The two commentators are in a 
           heated argument.

                                 CNN MAN
                        -You’re avoiding the question. Are 
                        people with a triple helix,  what 
                        we’re calling ander-humans, 
                        protected under the Constitution-

                                 CNN WOMAN
                        To be protected by the Constitution 
                        you have to be human, and right 
                        now, the term ‘human’ is... In 
                        flux. 

           The screen flickers. A BYSTANDER on the street is being 
           interviewed.

                                 BYSTANDER
                        I mean this is science fiction shit 
                        is what it really is. You’d think 
                        it was like cool, but it’s... I 
                        mean, people are getting killed. 
                        Real people.

           Another flicker, another BYSTANDER.

                                 BYSTANDER 2
                        You vaccinate your kids against 
                        measles, you check for genetic 
                        anomalies. If your kid has the 
                        measles, don’t send them to school 
                        with my kid. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 BYSTANDER 2 (CONT'D)
                        If your kid has whacked out 
                        genetics- I mean, it’s not rocket 
                        science, guys.

           Another flicker. It’s the face of MR. SELTZER, the high 
           school sociology teacher. The footage has switched from news 
           footage to Klyce’s interview tapes.

                                 SELTZER
                        When I heard about what happened to 
                        his father... I mean, I was in the 
                        room with him every other day for a 
                        year. To be that close to that kind 
                        of evil-

           COACH REZNICK has replaced him.

                                 COACH REZNICK
                        He was a quiet kid, one of those 
                        loner types. I really felt I did 
                        what I could to try to bring him 
                        out of shell. You see kids like 
                        that all the time. Feel bad for em 
                        really. Never know what kind of 
                        demons they’re hiding-

           Another flicker. Mike stands up with difficulty. ROSS is on 
           screen, pulling his best good student routine.

                                 ROSS
                        I was shocked, honestly. You know, 
                        you try to be someone’s friend 
                        invite them to parties... But he 
                        hurt a lot of people, and I think 
                        he deserves whatever happens to him 
                        next-

           An elderly woman on screen.

                                 WOMAN
                        -Always knew he was up to no good-

           Another. The Principal.

                                 PRINCIPAL
                        -I really got the sense that his 
                        mother was pulling his strings-

           The images are flickering faster, cycling through the cast of 
           characters from Mike’s previous life in high school, 
           accompanied by momentary sound bites of disparaging 
           negativity.
           -Andrea’s face appears, flushed with color and crying, she 
           speaks.

                                 ANDREA
                        -He was a great guy. I thought he 
                        was a great guy... But he killed 
                        his dad. And now all of this... It 
                        makes me wish I had never met him. 
                        Now I’ll always be the girl who 
                        dated Michael Madnick. And that’s 
                        going to ruin my life.

           The projection ends. The lights flick back on. 

           Mike stands solemnly, shaken. Behind him, on the far side of 
           the room, Klyce stands with his hands in his pockets.

                                 KLYCE
                        This is how the world sees you.

           Mike whips around, startled.

                                 KLYCE (CONT’D)
                        Not just the world. Your teachers. 
                        Your family. Your friends... People 
                        who loved you. They see you as a 
                        monster.

           Klyce holds up his hands - I mean you no harm.

                                 KLYCE (CONT’D)
                        And every time you go out into the 
                        world and make a scene you tell the 
                        whole world that they are right. 
                        Mind if I take a seat?

           Mike looks around. There are no chairs in this white bunker. 
           He makes no gestures. Klyce waits a moment, then ambles down 
           to the floor. He sits cross-legged in front of Mike.

                                 KLYCE (CONT’D)
                        You think when the first Homo 
                        Habilis stood up the 
                        Australophithecus weren’t a little 
                        freaked out?

           A beat. Klyce smiles.

                                 KLYCE (CONT’D)
                        I was reading about evolution a few 
                        minutes ago, I didn’t just have 
                        Australaphithecus on the tip of my 
                        tongue. Had to practice that one. 
                        Please. Take a seat.
           Mike hesitates, then sits across from Klyce on the floor.

                                 KLYCE (CONT’D)
                        There’s no manual on how to handle 
                        when this happens with a species. 
                        We fantasize about it. We make 
                        movies and comic books about 
                        becoming Gods. But when you’re in 
                        the real world?

           He whistles.

                                 KLYCE (CONT’D)
                        It’s just going to get messy. I’m 
                        not the boogie man. I’m not the 
                        government bad guy and there is no 
                        conspiracy to kill you. The truth 
                        of the matter is you are a walking 
                        bomb. It’s not your fault, but it’s 
                        true. You are dangerous to yourself 
                        and others. You got a raw deal. You 
                        don’t deserve any of what has 
                        happened to you or your family. But 
                        that’s what it is. Michael? Meet me 
                        halfway here.

                                 MIKE
                        What do you want?

                                 KLYCE
                        I want you to see the situation 
                        clearly. I’m the only person who 
                        can truly protect you. And I mean 
                        that openly, honestly, and with an 
                        entire world of love and respect. 
                        I’m the guy. 

           INT. MOTEL - DAY

           Esme lies face down on a motel bed, carefully coloring in a 
           coloring book. She colors a cartoon tarantula bright orange. 
           On the bed next to Marla is a brand new RED CD PLAYER, still 
           in its package. Marla carefully cleans the shotgun.

                                 ESME
                        You won’t need that.

                                 MARLA
                        Why not?

                                 ESME
                        The bad people will be too busy 
                        shooting at the creepy crawlies.
                                 MARLA
                        ... I think I’ll take them just in 
                        case.

           Esme continues coloring, unperturbed by Marla’s conclusion. 
           Marla watches the funny little girl. 

           INT. UNDERGROUND BUNKER - DUSK

           Klyce approaches Mike with a bag. 

                                 KLYCE
                        We had some of your things... 

           He reaches in. He pulls out the CD player. He hands it to 
           Mike. Mike takes it carefully. Klyce hangs onto the 
           headphones.

                                 KLYCE (CONT’D)
                        There’s some good music on that.

                                 MIKE
                        Yeah.

                                 KLYCE
                        I know what happened to your 
                        father.

           Mike is quiet. 

                                 KLYCE (CONT’D)
                        You’ve gone through a terrible 
                        thing. No one should have to go 
                        through what you’ve gone through.

                                 MIKE
                        Okay. 

                                 KLYCE
                        What?

                                 MIKE
                        You don’t have to sell me. 

           Mike makes eye contact with Klyce. He grips the CD player 
           tightly.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        I want to get better.

           Klyce hands Mike the headphones.
                                 KLYCE
                        Okay. Let’s see what we can do for 
                        you.

           EXT. FACILITY - NIGHT

           The facility looks like a corporate headquarters. A long 
           driveway is guarded by a security booth before a tall gate. A 
           black SUV pulls up to it.

           The Guard in the booth looks into the SUV. 

           KLYCE and another Agent are in the SUV. Klyce smiles at the 
           Guard, extremely friendly.

                                 KLYCE
                        Hello!

           The Guard nods.

                                 KLYCE (CONT’D)
                        We’re going into our office. 

           The Agent in the drivers seat gives Klyce a sideways look.

                                 KLYCE (CONT’D)
                        In that building.

           The Agent hands the Guard a piece of paper. It’s a folded up 
           piece of paper colored with crayon that says “OFFISHAL”. The 
           Guard looks at it, hands it back to the Agent with a nod.

                                 KLYCE (CONT’D)
                        Thanks!

           The gate opens.

           Marla and Esme drive through the gate in the run down Jeep. 
           Marla takes a deep breath. Esme is in the passengers seat, a 
           pleasant smile on her face. She’s having a great time.

           INT. UNDERGROUND BUNKER - NIGHT

           Several medical technicians surround Mike, who sits 
           complacently on a metal bench.

           A technician slips a needle into Mike’s arm. He winces. 

           Klyce watches as Mike’s blood begins to flow down a long 
           white tube, turning it red. 
           INT. FACILITY - LOBBY - NIGHT

           Klyce and the Agent walk towards the elevators in the lobby, 
           passing another guard. 

           The Agent presses the elevator button. Nothing happens. Agent 
           taps it again. 

           Klyce looks at it. 

                                 KLYCE
                        Hey!

                                 AGENT
                        Shh!

                                 KLYCE
                        Excuse me!

           The Security Guard looks up.

                                 GUARD
                        Yes?

                                 KLYCE
                        This elevator isn’t working.

                                 GUARD
                        You need to swipe your card.

           The Agent and Klyce look back to the elevator. Sure enough, a 
           swipe lock is by the buttons. Klyce holds up a card in his 
           hand, flabbergasted.

                                 KLYCE
                        I guess it’s not working!

           Klyce takes a step towards the Guard. 

           Marla watches, shotgun in hand, sweating, as Esme toddles 
           over to the Guard.

                                 ESME
                        Can I borrow this?

           The Guard hands her the card.

           Klyce takes it from the Guard, smiling appreciatively.

                                 KLYCE
                        Thank you!

           Klyce walks back to the elevator.
           Esme swipes the card. The elevator opens with a polite ding.

           Marla and Esme walk in. The doors close.

           INT. FACILITY HALLWAYS - NIGHT

           The elevator doors open. In front of Marla and Esme is a long 
           white hallway, seemingly endless.

           Another agent crosses the hallway at one of its 
           intersections. He’s followed by several people wearing 
           scrubs. 

           Esme takes Marla’s hand.

                                 ESME
                        He’s close to here.

           They walk down the hallway together.

           The hallway intersects with many other halls. It’s a maze of 
           white walled connections.

           They pass several more people who take no notice of them.

           INT. SECURITY ROOM - NIGHT

           A bald SECURITY GUARD stares at two dozen monitors. He blinks 
           behind his glasses. He leans forward.

           On one of the screen, a Woman with a gun and a little girl 
           are walking down a hallway.

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        Hey, are you seeing this?

           A FAT SECURITY GUARD looks up. The Security Guard points at 
           the screen.

                                 SECURITY GUARD (CONT’D)
                        Look. 

                                 FAT SECURITY GUARD
                        Holy shit.

           INT. FACILITY HALLWAYS - NIGHT

           A piercing BEEP! Rings out, like an exclamation point. The 
           Beep continues, every ten seconds. Marla looks around.
                                 MARLA
                        They found us.

           Radio squawking can be heard. Marla turns. She lowers her 
           shotgun to hip level. She points it straight down the 
           hallway.

                                 ESME
                        Wait...

           Esme focuses ahead of the gun barrel. Two Government Agents 
           round the corner. They run straight for Marla and Esme and 
           pass them.

           Marla watches them run down the hallway.

           INT. SECURITY ROOM

           The Bald Security Guard is screaming into a microphone.

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        SHE’S RIGHT BEHIND YOU!

           On the monitor, the two Agents stop. They turn-

           INT. FACILITY HALLWAYS - SAME MOMENTS

           -Marla raises her shotgun. The Agents look back at Klyce and 
           The Agent.

           Esme holds up her hands.

           The Hallway starts to rumble. 

           The two Agents turn, looking behind them. Around the corner 
           at the opposite end of the hallway, a twelve foot tall Neon 
           Orange Tarantula scurries towards them.

           The Neon Orange Tarantula’s legs bumps the walls, shattering 
           the concrete, it’s elbows hit the ceiling, punching holes and 
           taking out overhead lights. 

           The Agents shoot at it, unloading their clips. The Neon 
           Orange Tarantula keeps coming. 

           Panicking, Marla picks up Esme and begins to run away from 
           the monster.

           They pass half a dozen Agents rounding the corner and coming 
           face to face with the monster. 
           The Agents all begin shooting, mostly hitting each other. 
           Blood spatters across the hallway walls. The Neon Orange 
           Tarantula hisses and spins in the narrow hallway- 

           -the Agents are alone in the hallway, shrieking and shooting 
           at each other, ducking under giant spider legs that aren’t 
           there.

           INT. UNDERGROUND BUNKER - NIGHT

           A door opens. Mr Grey is at the door. Klyce looks over his 
           shoulder to him. Mister Grey approaches. He whispers in 
           Klyce’s ear. Half a dozen Agents enter the room behind him 
           and line up on the wall.

           Klyce looks back to Mike. There are three full packets of 
           blood on the medical table next to him, being carefully 
           packed into a metal refrigeration unit labeled MADNICK.

           The Medic sticks another needle in Mike’s arm.

                                 MIKE
                        What’s that?

                                 KLYCE
                        Just another test. We want to do a 
                        CAT scan. See how your body works. 
                        It’s okay.

           Yellow fluid begins to go IN to Mike’s other arm. He watches 
           it, then looks up at Klyce.

           Mister Grey presses his finger to his ear. He steps out of 
           the bunker. 

           INT. FACILITY HALLWAYS - NIGHT

           Marla and Esme round a corner.

           Mister Grey rounds the opposite corner.

           He comes face to face with Klyce and... Himself. They stand, 
           frozen.

           Mister Grey draws his gun.

           BANG.

           Marla falls to the floor. Esme screams.

           Marla grabs at her bleeding shoulder.
           Mister Grey stops. The hallway is vibrating behind him. He 
           turns. The Neon Orange Tarantula cannonballs down the hallway 
           towards him.

           Mister Grey turns his back on the Neon Orange Tarantula. He 
           aims his gun back towards Esme’s projections of himself and 
           Klyce - who lies bleeding on the floor-

           He takes aim at the Esme-Mister Grey.

           Marla grabs her shotgun and pulls the trigger- sending Mister 
           Grey flying on his back.

           The hallway is quiet now.

           Esme stands in the bloody hallway, hiccuping tears. Marla 
           sits up. She puts her arm around Esme, turning her away from 
           Mister Grey’s body.

                                 MARLA
                        Look at me, baby. Look at me.

           Esme does.

                                 MARLA (CONT’D)
                        Where is Michael?

           Esme points. 

                                 ESME
                        He’s with Mr. David now. He’s mixed 
                        up.

                                 MARLA
                        Mixed up?

                                 ESME
                        He thinks he’ll be safer here.

           Esme looks at Marla gravely.

                                 ESME (CONT’D)
                        I don’t know if it’s true.

           Marla uses the shotgun as a cane to push herself to her feet.

                                 MARLA
                        Let’s see if we can sort him out 
                        then.
           INT. UNDERGROUND BUNKER - NIGHT

           Mike is lying on his back. He struggles to keep his eyes 
           open. They close. They open again.

           Klyce is standing over Mike. Behind him, the door opens. His 
           eyes rise in time with the ch-chick of the shotgun gauge 
           being pumped.

           Marla stands behind him, sweating, bleeding, full of rage. 
           Shotgun leveled directly at him.

                                 MARLA
                        Back the fuck away from him. 

           Klyce turns towards Marla, obliging her. He sees Esme hanging 
           by the door, peeking her head out at him. 

                                 KLYCE
                        Hi.

           She hides from him.

                                 MARLA
                        Don’t.

                                 KLYCE
                        She and I are friends. You’re not 
                        going to come in between friends 
                        are you?

           Marla keeps her eyes trained on Klyce. There are six agents 
           pointing their guns at her. 

                                 KLYCE (CONT’D)
                        So. Dramatic. 

                                 MARLA
                        Unplug that shit. Michael! Get up!

           Mike opens his eyes. He looks up.

                                 MIKE
                        Mom?

                                 MARLA
                        We’ve gotta go, baby. I know you’re 
                        tired, but you’ve gotta get up.

           The Agents take a step closer in. Marla turns one of the guns 
           towards them. 
                                 KLYCE
                        Wait, wait, wait. Let’s just cool 
                        down for a moment. 

           Klyce sits down next to Mike and helps him sit up. He keeps 
           his eyes on Marla.

                                 KLYCE (CONT’D)
                        This is the part where we shoot 
                        each other up and there’s a big 
                        mess and no one walks away happy. 
                        But Mike and I have been talking. 
                        And... He’s decided he wants to 
                        stay here. Isn’t that right, Mike?

                                 MIKE
                        ... Yes.

                                 MARLA
                        Michael, get up.

                                 KLYCE
                        This is the woman who kept you 
                        safe. And she did the best she 
                        could. And it wasn’t good enough.

           Klyce leans into Mike.

                                 KLYCE (CONT’D)
                        You murdered your father, Michael. 
                        You practically blew up your 
                        school. And this woman’s master 
                        plan was to take to Canada?

           Klyce let’s out a hearty laugh.

                                 KLYCE (CONT’D)
                        Forgive the United States 
                        Government if we don’t feel like 
                        you are the solution. But hey.

           Klyce stands up, hands up. 

                                 KLYCE (CONT’D)
                        Boys, put the guns away.

           The Agents trade glances.

                                 KLYCE (CONT’D)
                        Seriously. Put them away.

           They lower their guns.
                                 KLYCE (CONT’D)
                        If you want to go back out there 
                        and blow up another girlfriend, or 
                        a baby, or your mother, go RIGHT 
                        AHEAD!!

           His voice echoes loudly. A deafening silence follows.

                                 KLYCE (CONT’D)
                        Or. Stay here and get professional 
                        help.

                                 MARLA
                        Your father and I were both ready 
                        to die to keep you safe. I’m not 
                        leaving unless we walk out of this 
                        place together.

                                 KLYCE
                        But that’s the POINT. Here he is 
                        safe. Out there, they’ll string him 
                        up like Danny Drake after he blows 
                        up a bus of children. You know I’m 
                        right about that.

           Mike looks up to Marla. Eye contact for the first time. He 
           stands up, dizzy, drained. He goes to her. He wraps her arms 
           around her.

                                 MIKE
                        I’m staying here.

           He backs away from her. Defeated, Marla drops the shotgun. 
           She buckles to her knees, exhausted. She lets out a cry.  

           She reaches into her pocket. She pulls out her red CD player, 
           wired to a mini portable speaker.

                                 MARLA
                        It brings a tear-

           Silence. Marla is crying- hard to understand what she’s 
           saying.

                                 MARLA (CONT’D)
                        Into my eyes-

           She extends the words, she’s hawing the words.

                                 MARLA (CONT’D)
                        When I begin to realize,

           Klyce looks from Mike to Marla.
                                 KLYCE
                        Enough.

           The Agents grab Marla. They begin to take her down.

                                 MARLA
                        I’ve cried so much! Since you’ve 
                        been gone!

           Marla hits the player. The speakers burst into the middle of 
           Ray Charles’s Drown In My Own Tears-

           Mike shakes at the sound of the music. 

           In the corner of the room, Esme’s eyes narrow with anger. 

           A tiny orange spider comes out from one of the Agent’s 
           sleeves. He shakes at it. Another cone crawls up from under 
           his neck line. He swats at it.

           In an instant, little orange spiders are crawling all over 
           the agents. They begin to swat at themselves, tearing at 
           their clothing, peeling it away.

           Nails go into their faces, their chests, drawing blood. Klyce 
           included. They’re all on the floor, writhing in fear and 
           agony. 

           Mike limps towards Marla. He helps her get up. Together they 
           struggle to get towards the door.

           Covered in spiders, Klyce sits up, forcing himself through 
           the sensations. He watches as Mike and Marla head towards the 
           door.

                                 KLYCE
                        No-

           Beet-red, groaning through the pain, Klyce grabs at a gun on 
           the floor. 

           Esme screams.

           Marla turns.

           It happens so fast.

           She pushes Mike, stepping in front of him. The bullet goes 
           straight into her. She rocks back into Mike.

           Mike looks up. He raises his hand. Klyce’s skin begins to 
           peel. The song only gets louder.
           The gun in Klyce’s hand begins to disassemble in the air. The 
           parts scatter in ten different directions. The skin on his 
           hand fillets itself off- his fingers all the way down to the 
           bones.

           Mike screams, a deafening scream. Klyce is losing skin, 
           rapidly. 

           The sound of Mike’s scream dissipates. Only Ray Charles now.

           Mike closes his eyes. His outstretched hand becomes a fist. 

           Klyce collapses on the other side of the room. He’s red, 
           swollen, half of his skin is missing- like a burn victim. He 
           sputters and coughs.

           The Agents continue tearing at themselves. 

           Mike is holding Marla in his arms. The music sounds hollow 
           and tinny to him now. Marla’s cold eyes look past him. 

           Esme comes up to him, bleary eyed.

                                 ESME
                        She didn’t have time to say 
                        anything. She had so many thoughts 
                        for you.

           Mike nods at this. He squeezes Marla tight.

           Esme wraps her arms around Mike’s neck.

                                 ESME (CONT’D)
                        We should go now. 

           Mike nods. He picks Esme up. Holding her to his chest. They 
           begin to walk.

           INT. FACILITY HALLWAYS - NIGHT

           A SWAT TEAM, armed with riot gear, gas masks, night sticks 
           and assault rifles storms down the hallway, past a pile of 
           dead bodies. 

           They turn the corner to the bunker. 

           The room is empty, save for half a dozen government agents 
           with their clothes torn to shreds, a sniveling man covered in 
           tattered burned skin and bloody tattoos, and the body of a 
           dead woman.

           Klyce stares at the silver refrigerator box, MADNICK scrawled 
           on the outside. 
           EXT. PIER - DAY

           A FERRY is docked in a foggy pier. It honks loudly.

           INT. FERRY - DAY

           A television sits in the corner by the ceiling in the 
           cafeteria of the ferry. On the TV: A Newscaster speaks 
           emphatically.

                                 NEWS REPORTER
                        New York, Virginia, and Tennessee

                        decree that those testing positive

                                 OLD MAN
                        It’s not that they don’t have 
                        rights, I just don’t think they 
                        should have our rights-

                                 NEWS REPORTER
                        The sentiment isn’t shared by all. 
                        Daniel Drake’s mother had this to 
                        say-

           MRS. DRAKE (40s) appears on the screen surrounded by family.

                                 MRS. DRAKE
                        Ignorance killed my son. But today 
                        the lawmakers are doing worse to 
                        his memory and who he was than 
                        anything anyone did to his body.

                                 NEWS REPORTER
                        The issue is expected to go to the 
                        supreme court within the next year. 
                        And yet, evidence of these ander-
                        humans is becoming increasingly 
                        rare, which begs the question- have 
                        they all gone into hiding, or are 
                        there simply none left?

           An old couple sits at a table, side by side. An elderly white 
           lady and an old African American man. The Old Man has 
           headphones around his neck. They stare up at the television 
           with tired eyes.
           The Old Man stands up. He goes out to the Ferry Deck.

           On the Ferry Deck:

           Esme walks up to Mike, who looks over the railing. In the 
           distance, the shore is getting further away. The intercom 
           makes an announcement about the trip to Halifax.

           Esme reaches down into her backpack. She returns with a 
           headphone splitter.  She sticks her hand into his pocket, 
           pulling out his CD player and plugging in the splitter.

                                 MIKE
                        Hey. I won’t let anything happen to 
                        us.

           She smiles at him.

                                 ESME
