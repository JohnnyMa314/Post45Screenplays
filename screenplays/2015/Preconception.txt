           A BEAUTIFUL BABY

           Six-months. Cooing. Giggling. Big, brown eyes.

           EMMA (early 30’s, intelligent, driven, organized) leans in 
           and INHALES.

                                 EMMA
                        God, I love baby-smell. 

           She hands the baby to her husband, BEN (early 30’s, self-
           effacing, charming, nebbish). 

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        Ben, I need you to whiff this.

           He brings the baby to his face and BREATHES DEEPLY. His eyes 
           glaze over like he's high.

                                 BEN
                        He does smell fresh... 

           Ben HUFFS again.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Like Subway bread.

           Ben goes in for one final SNIFF -- he RECOILS in disgust- 

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Ugh!

           The baby SLIPS out of his grasp...

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Shit!

           He catches it before it drops.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        I got him. He’s okay.

           As the baby BAWLS... 

           REVEAL Ben and Emma are in a FERTILITY CLINIC WAITING ROOM. A 
           WASPY-looking couple next to them looks on, UTTERLY APPALLED.

                                 WASP-Y WIFE
                        Can we please have our baby back?!

           Ben holds the wailing baby out at arm’s length. 
                                 BEN
                        Here, take him. 

                                 EMMA
                        I think someone needs a nap.

                                 BEN
                        And a diaper change. 

                                 WASP-Y HUSBAND
                       (sarcastic)
                        Yeah, you guys are ready.

                                 NURSE (O.S.)
                        Ben and Emma Kaplan?

           Ben and Emma turn toward a NURSE. 

                                 EMMA
                        That’s us. 

                                 BEN
                       (deep breath)
                        Why do I feel so nervous?

                                 EMMA
                        Relax. We got this.

           INT. FERTILITY CLINIC - SPERM TESTING - DAY

           Ben walks up to a DESK where a GROUP OF NURSES loudly 
           converse. He awkwardly clears his throat, interrupting.

                                 BEN
                        Hi. I’m here to get my, uh... stuff 
                        tested? Baby stuff? 

           She hands Ben a cup.

                                 NURSE
                        Return the deposit here after you 
                        finish. Use the hallway bathroom.

           Ben turns down the hallway, takes TWO STEPS-

           And reaches the MEN’S ROOM. He looks back -- he’s literally 
           THREE FEET from the Nurse’s Desk.

                                 BEN
                        This bathroom right here?

                                 NURSE
                        Correct. The hallway bathroom.
           He walks in...

           INT. HALLWAY BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Ben closes the door. He can still CLEARLY HEAR the nurses 
           CHATTING LOUDLY. He swallows hard and unzips his pants.

           INT. EXAM ROOM - DAY

           Emma lies back, talking on her cell phone.

                                 EMMA
                        Mom, they want to screw us-

           She involuntarily GASPS. Once she relaxes:

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        Why do you think I’ve been working 
                        sixteen-hour days? Our company is 
                        my total focus- 

           Her breath catches again.

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        What? No, I’m just in traffic. 
                        Someone swerved in front of me.

           PAN OUT to reveal a DOCTOR swabbing between Emma’s propped-up 
           legs, taking a Pap smear.

           She puts her hand over her phone, whispering:

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        Really sorry about this, Doc. 
                        You’re doing great.  
                       (into her phone)
                        Of course I’m here, mom. 

           The Doctor dives back in. Emma gasps sharply. 

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        Sorry, this guy’s a crazy driver.

           INT. HALLWAY BATHROOM - DAY

           Ben tugs away, biting his lip, sweating like crazy. Asian 
           porno plays on the TV. The water faucet runs at full blast. 

                                 BEN
                        Come on... 
           He hears the Nurses LAUGHING. He stops and stares at himself 
           in the mirror.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        You can do this.

           A Nurse calls from off screen.

                                 NURSE (O.S.)
                        Everything all right in there?

           Ben FUMBLES the TV remote, JACKING up the volume -- wait, no, 
           that's worse -- before turning it down. 

                                 BEN
                        Yes! I’m fine!

                                 NURSE (O.S.)
                        You find the visual aids?

                                 BEN
                        Yep. All set. 

           Ben begins again. Much more quietly. 

           INT. FERTILITY CLINIC - EXAM ROOM - DAY

           Emma zips up her pants. Ben walks in, sweaty and exhausted.

                                 EMMA
                        Are you all right?

           He furiously pumps hand sanitizer.

                                 BEN
                        Great.

           The DOCTOR enters, holding a clipboard.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Ben. Emma. I have the results of 
                        your tests-

                                 EMMA
                        Are we looking good? We feel 
                        fertile. Right, Ben? 

                                 BEN
                        Let’s not get ahead of ourselves. 

           The Doctor takes a seat on the stool.
                                 DOCTOR
                        Emma, your eggs are viable. Ben, 
                        your sperm look fantastic.

                                 BEN
                        Really? Fantastic?

                                 DOCTOR
                        Motility, shape, volume: 
                        remarkable. 

                                 BEN
                        Well, I've never ridden a bicycle.

           The Doctor checks information on his clipboard.

                                 DOCTOR
                        You mentioned you were hoping to 
                        wait to have a child?

                                 EMMA
                        At some point, we do want a baby.

                                 BEN
                        We married late for the same 
                        reason, to make sure we had that 
                        rock-solid foundation.

                                 EMMA
                        But my career isn't quite where I 
                        need it to be.

                                 BEN
                        We’re here for some preliminary 
                        intel. Really see what we're 
                        dealing with, equipment-wise. 

                                 DOCTOR
                        So you want a baby in...

                                 EMMA
                        Two, three years? 

                                 BEN
                        Maybe four? 

                                 EMMA
                        Or five is nice and round.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Here's the thing. You’re turning 
                        thirty-five soon. Your window...

           The Doctor forms a vagina with his hands and CLAPS them shut-
                                 DOCTOR (CONT’D)
                        ...is closing.

                                 EMMA
                        I hear you on my “window”, but work 
                        is pretty crazy right now.

                                 DOCTOR
                        There are options. IVF. Egg 
                        freezing.

                                 BEN
                        We can't afford that. 

                                 DOCTOR
                        Then your options are limited. If 
                        you want a baby, stop waiting.

                                                  CUT TO:

           CLOSE UP: A STACK OF CONTRACEPTIVES IN A TRASH BIN

           Mounds and mounds of regular condoms, flavored condoms, 
           ribbed condoms...

           INT. BATHROOM - DAY

           Emma and Ben survey the stack of contraceptives in the bin.

                                 BEN
                        Maybe we should donate these? For 
                        the write-off? 

                                 EMMA
                        Ben. Goodwill wouldn’t even take 
                        our couch. 

           She unearths an old MAGNUM condom and unfurls it.

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        Whoa. This thing’s a tube sock.

                                 BEN
                        That was a gag gift from David.

                                 EMMA
                        Maybe we can use it for groceries.

                                 BEN
                        Gimme that!

           She slips away from him, into the...
           INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Emma slides the condom onto her arm like a glove.

                                 EMMA
                        Look, I’m Audrey Hepburn!

           Ben tackles her onto the bed, yanking the condom off. He 
           slips it onto himself, and looks down. 

                                 BEN
                        Wow. I actually got it all the way 
                        over my balls.

                                 EMMA
                       (suggestively)
                        Maybe you should... take it off?

                                 BEN
                        Maybe I should.

           He WRIGGLES it off, and crawls on top of Emma.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Can’t remember the last time I went 
                        in raw. 

                                 EMMA
                        Wait.

           She squirms out from under him. Puts a finger to his lips.

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        I’ll be right back.

           Emma disappears into the bathroom. After a moment:

                                 BEN
                        What are you doing in there?

                                 EMMA
                        Just a minute!

                                 BEN
                        We’re gonna be late-

                                 EMMA
                        Hold on for one second!

           Ben hops out of bed and opens the door to find...
           INT. BATHROOM - DAY - CONTINUOUS

           Emma sitting on the toilet, a thermometer sticking out from 
           between her legs.

                                 BEN
                        Jesus! Are you sick? 

                                 EMMA
                        No. I have to check my temperature 
                        to make sure I’m at peak fertility.

                                 BEN
                        So this is our new foreplay.

           BEEP-BEEP -- she removes it, examining the side.

                                 EMMA
                        It’s a little chilly right now. Can 
                        we try again after the bris?

                                 BEN
                        Can we do some sex now? 

                                 EMMA
                        We need to be practical, Ben. We 
                        can’t waste the sperm.

                                 BEN
                        But I have so much to give.

           She gets up, pulls him into a sexy embrace.

                                 EMMA
                        Don’t worry, we’ll have fun later.

           She leaves the bathroom. Ben looks down at his protruding 
           ERECTION and sighs. 

           INT. SYNAGOGUE - DAY

           As the ceremony begins, Ben and Emma shuffle down the front 
           row to their seats, whispering. 

                                 BEN
                        What if there’s splash-back?

                                 EMMA
                        It’s a bris, not a Gallagher show.

           Ben and Emma take their seats in between their couple-
           friends: LYDIA & MATTHEW (uptight) and JEN & DAVID (free 
           spirits). Jen breastfeeds her BABY under a Hooter-Hider. 
                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        Hey, Lydia. Where are the kids?

                                 LYDIA
                       (whispers)
                        Junior congregation. They have that 
                        great young rabbi who snipped 
                        Walter’s penis.

           Matthew leans over.

                                 MATTHEW
                        If you keep telling everyone about 
                        our son’s penis, you'll traumatize 
                        him forever.

                                 BEN
                       (chiming in)
                        Parenting 101, am I right?

           The others look at him with blank stares...

           Jen GASPS sharply, looking at the baby on her breast.

                                 JEN
                        This child’s wrecking my nipples.

                                 LYDIA
                        I had the same thing.

                                 DAVID
                        Clamping phase?

                                 MATTHEW
                        Nightmare.

                                 JEN / DAVID 
                        Oh, my god! / Totally!

                                 EMMA
                       (interrupting)
                        I’ve heard pumping works?

                                 LYDIA
                        That made me feel like a dairy cow.

                                 BEN
                        Must be better than those rock-hard 
                        gums? Right? 

                                 LYDIA
                        Sorry, but you gotta experience it 
                        to get it.
           The conversation continues, MUTED, leaving Ben and Emma to 
           watch the conversation like tennis-match spectators. 
           Desperate to be included, Ben blurts out-

                                 BEN
                        We’re trying to get pregnant.

                                 EMMA
                        Ben!

           The others stare at Ben, stunned. SNIP -- a baby BAWLS as the 
           whole crowd yells, “MAZEL TOV!”

           Emma gives Ben a bemused look -- he shrugs, with an 
           infectious half-smile. They hold hands, excited.

           INT. RECEPTION HALL - DAY

           Emma, Jen and Lydia stand in a line to greet the PARENTS of 
           the newborn baby.

                                 JEN
                        I cannot believe it.

                                 LYDIA
                        We never thought it would happen 
                        for you guys.

                                 EMMA
                        Why, do I look barren or something?

                                 LYDIA
                        It’s not that.

                                 JEN
                        We didn’t think you’d want to give 
                        up your career.

                                 EMMA
                        I’m not planning to.

                                 JEN
                        ...Oh.

                                 EMMA
                        You think I’ll have to quit work?

                                 LYDIA / JEN
                        No, no... / Of course not! 

                                 JEN
                        You can just take a few months off, 
                        then hire a nanny.
                                 LYDIA
                        For, what, five hundred a day?

                                 EMMA
                        Five hundred?!

                                 LYDIA
                        Don’t cheap out. You’ll end up with 
                        a pervert. That's why Jen and I 
                        went the stay-home route.

                                 JEN
                        That, and wanting to spend every 
                        precious second with the baby.

                                 LYDIA
                        It goes by so fast... it just feels 
                        like an eternity.

                                 JEN
                        But it's totally worth it. 

           Emma nods, not convinced.

                                 LYDIA
                        I barely even NEED sleep anymore.

           ON BEN AND THE HUSBANDS

           Sipping whiskey next to a mound of bagels and cured fish.

                                 BEN
                        That’s insane.

                                 DAVID
                        No, sleep is for the weak.

                                 MATTHEW
                        I feel like I’ve evolved to 
                        function without it. 

                                 BEN
                        This sounds very unhealthy.

                                 MATTHEW
                        It’s the best thing that’s ever 
                        happened to us, dude. 

                                 DAVID
                        I mean, it is a change.

                                 MATTHEW
                        And the first six months are... 
                        rough. 
                                 DAVID
                        The kid’s screaming all the time, 
                        you fall out of contact with your 
                        friends, your wife constantly calls 
                        you a worthless piece of shit.

                                 BEN
                        How is this the best thing that 
                        ever happened to you?

                                 DAVID
                        When you hold this thing you made-

           He chokes up, can’t finish. Matthew comforts him.

                                 MATTHEW
                        You learn not to need the stuff you 
                        thought you needed.

                                 BEN
                        How?

                                 MATTHEW
                        You know your brain’s Pleasure 
                        Center? Power it down. 

           Ben looks over at Emma, talking with the ladies.

                                 BEN
                        ...what about sex?

           ON EMMA

           With her friends, standing in the buffet line.

                                 LYDIA
                        What about sex?

                                 EMMA
                        You guys still do it regularly?

                                 LYDIA
                        New Year's, birthdays, anniversary, 
                        Valentine's. 

                                 JEN
                        It’s not easy to get your juices 
                        flowing after baby paws your tits 
                        for two hours.

                                 LYDIA
                        But honestly, it’s worth it.
                                 JEN
                        Totally!

                                 EMMA
                        Hm. So, no regrets? 

           EXT. SYNAGOGUE - BACK ALLEY - DAY

           Ben watches Matthew and David take huge rips from a joint.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Ummmm... I miss vacations.

                                 DAVID
                        Aw, shit yeah! And vacation sex?

                                 MATTHEW
                        Yes. Check in, bags down, sixty-
                        nine.  

                                 DAVID
                        SO much sixty-nine. That was before 
                        baby. Now I avoid travel at all 
                        costs. 

                                 MATTHEW
                        The amount of luggage these kids 
                        require is astonishing.

                                 DAVID
                        Like preparing for a lunar launch.

                                 MATTHEW
                        And forget about a road trip. 
                        Twelve hours of the soundtrack to 
                        FROZEN.

           Beat. Ben swallows a rising tide of nausea. 

                                 DAVID
                        But dude. It’s totally worth it.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Totally.

           Matthew RIPS the joint extra-hard.  

           EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY

           Emma and Ben cheek-kiss their couple-friends goodbye.
                                 LYDIA
                        So happy for you.

                                 BEN
                        Thanks, Lydia.

                                 LYDIA
                        It’s totally worth it.

                                 JEN
                        Totally.

           Ben's smile drops. That phrase again.

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Ben flips through his Facebook feed -- lots of babies. He 
           lands on a picture of Matthew with his kids at Disneyland. 
           Ben ZOOMS IN on Matthew's eyes, which SCREAM in silent PANIC.

           Emma slinks into bed. She sends a last EMAIL.

                                 EMMA
                        Was that weird today? With our 
                        friends?

                                 BEN
                        No way. Why, was it weird for you?

                                 EMMA
                        No. C'mon, we're nothing like them 
                        as a couple, we'll be nothing like 
                        them as parents.

           She moves in close, still all business-

                                 BEN
                        Have you checked your temperature?

                                 EMMA
                        Mm-hm. We’re good.

                                 BEN
                        Cool... cool. Hey, those lox were 
                        fresh today, right?

           Emma puts a finger to his lips.

                                 EMMA
                        Let's get to work.

           She grabs a tube of lube and squeezes a dollop on his crotch.
                                 BEN
                        What’s that, KY?

                                 EMMA
                        Better. It helps with fertility. 
                        It’s called “Pre-Seed”.

                                 BEN
                        So graphic.

                                 EMMA
                        Focus on the mission.

           She hops on top and pulls him into her.

                                 BEN
                        It’s so slippery. I can’t get any 
                        traction.

           Emma clamps a hand over his mouth as she swivels her hips.

                                 EMMA
                        There you go. Fill me to the brim.

           Ben stops moving, pulling her hand off.

                                 BEN
                        Okay, this is weird.

                                 EMMA
                        Why?

                                 BEN
                        I’ve spent my whole life trying not 
                        to finish inside. It’s like telling 
                        a dog to take a piss on the carpet.

                                 EMMA
                        You’re over-thinking this.

                                 BEN
                        Maybe if we switch it up?

                                 EMMA
                        Fine.

           She flips around and backs into him.

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        Just get in there and come.

                                 BEN
                        Okay. Here we go.
           He moves back in, finding a rhythm with Emma.

                                 EMMA
                        Mmmm... good....

                                 BEN
                        I’m feeling it... I’m feeling it...

                                 EMMA
                        You gonna come?

                                 BEN
                        I think I’m gonna...

                                 EMMA
                        Do it, Daddy!

                                 BEN
                        What?

                                 EMMA
                        Shit. I dunno why I just said that.

           A BABY cries next door. Ben panics.

                                 BEN
                        Whose baby is that?!

                                 EMMA
                        Next door, just ignore it-

                                 BEN
                        I’m gonna pull out.

                                 EMMA
                        No! Stay in!

                                 BEN
                        I can’t! I can’t!

           She grabs back and forces him to stay in.

                                 EMMA
                        Don’t you waste it!

                                 BEN
                        Oh, god --  I -- CAN'T!

           Ben YANKS out, flying backwards off the bed and BLOWING his 
           load INTO THE AIR...

           THWACK! It splashes down ON HIS FACE. He jumps up, eyes 
           BASTED SHUT.
                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        My eyes! I came in my eyes!

                                 EMMA
                        Wash it out.

           Ben blindly stumbles into the bathroom.

                                 BEN (O.S.)
                        It burns so bad.

           Emma shakes her head.

           INT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Emma stands behind Ben, who dabs his BLOODSHOT eyes.

                                 EMMA
                        Do you even want to have a baby?

                                 BEN
                        Of course!

                                 EMMA
                        Then why won't you ejaculate in me?

                                 BEN
                        Gross.

                                 EMMA
                        Ben!

                                 BEN
                        You know I want the family -- the 
                        swim lessons, the car trips, Chuck 
                        E. Cheese...

                                 EMMA
                        ...But?

                                 BEN
                        Our parent friends are so 
                        miserable. They don’t sleep, they 
                        don’t vacation, they never, ever 
                        have sex. They probably don't even 
                        have genitals anymore.

                                 EMMA
                        You think I haven’t noticed all of 
                        this? According to them, I’m 
                        committing to a half-decade of 
                        joblessness and chafing nipples.
                                 BEN
                        Why did they wait until now to tell 
                        us this?

                                 EMMA
                        It doesn’t matter. We'll be 
                        different. We’ll be fun. 

                                 BEN
                        You’re right. We’re fun people.
                       (beat)
                        Remember my birthday last year?

                                 EMMA
                       (skeptical)
                        ...At Benihana?

                                 BEN
                        I wore that crazy paper hat? 

           Emma buries her face in her hands. 

                                 EMMA
                        Benihana can’t be our pre-baby  
                        life’s great adventure. 
                       (beat)
                        Let's go out. Right now.

                                 BEN
                        On a work night?

                                 EMMA
                        We need to be more spontaneous. 
                        Before... 

           She claps her hands shut like a vagina.

                                 BEN
                        Fine. You’re right. Let’s just get 
                        in the car and find some fun. 

                                 EMMA
                        Yes! Spontaneous fun.

                                 BEN
                        Okay! Lemme just grab a sweater.

           INT. BEN’S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT

           Ben drives; Emma gazes out the window, yawning.
                                 BEN
                       (pointing)
                        How about that?

                                 EMMA
                        A fondue place? Come on.  

                                 BEN
                        We’ve been driving for an hour. I 
                        don't know this area at all. 

                                 EMMA
                        I’m not giving up. 
                        (beat)
                        There!

           She points off the side of the road at a neon sign for a 
           skeezy looking nightclub called DIGNITY. 

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        Let’s go get drinks. 

           Ben nods, worried.

           EXT. DIGNITY CLUB - NIGHT

           Ben and Emma stroll to the entrance of the club. A huge 
           DOORMAN stop them.

                                 DOORMAN
                        Cover’s twenty bucks for men, free 
                        for women. 

           Ben takes out his wallet. 

                                 BEN
                        Must be ladies' night. 

           Emma shrugs. They open the door, walking obliviously past the 
           silhouette of HUGGING WOMEN painted into the building facade. 
           Cue “A Milli” by Li’l Wayne...

           INT. DIGNITY CLUB - CONTINUOUS

           In SLO-MO, Ben and Emma make their entrance: they bob with 
           the music, feeling the vibe... until they’re pulled out of 
           slo-mo by Emma GRIMACING. 

                                 EMMA
                        Smells a little musty in here. 

           Ben notices the all-male crowd leering at Emma. 
                                 BEN
                        Lotta dudes for a Ladies' Night...

                                 DJ (O.S.)
                       (over PA)
                        Allllright, coming up next on the 
                        main stage, give it up for Jasmine. 

                                 BEN
                        Oh, shit. 

           A busted-looking STRIPPER in six-inch heels shuffles onstage.

                                 EMMA
                        This is definitely a strip club. 

                                 BEN
                        You wanna go? We can go.   

           Emma notices a PARTY-GIRL PATRON taking shots with her MALE 
           BUDDIES. They laugh, having fun. 

                                 EMMA
                        I don’t want to be us tonight, Ben. 
                        I want to be them. 

           Ben nods as the onstage Stripper bounces her naked ass.

                                 BEN 
                        I did already pay the cover... 

           AT THE BAR

           Ben protectively ushers Emma up. He waves over the BARTENDER, 
           who slides up with a cocktail menu.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Barkeep, what do you recommend -- 
                        the Blow Job or the Pussy Fart?

                                 BARTENDER
                        They're all really good.

                                 EMMA
                        One of each, please.

           Emma winks at Ben. 

           QUICK CUTS: the Bartender brings over cocktail after 
           cocktail; Ben and Emma toast and drink; Emma rowdily sings 
           along with the ass-shakin' music.

           Ben delicately places bills on the stage as a dancer 
           acrobatically scales a pole. 
           Emma walks up to him, smiling, with two STRIPPERS on her 
           arms: MERCEDES (busty) and HONDA (busted).

                                 BEN
                        Oh, hello. 

                                 EMMA
                        Ben, exciting news. Mercedes and 
                        Honda have invited us to the 
                        champagne room. 

                                 BEN
                        Um, I think we’re fine here. 

                                 MERCEDES
                        Come on, you'll love it. 

           Mercedes licks and nibbles sexily on her lips.

                                 HONDA
                        You’ll be VIPs.

           Honda licks her teeth; Ben cringes at her MISSING INCISOR.

                                 EMMA
                        VIPs, Ben! Come on.

           The strippers escort Ben and Emma to the entrance of... 

           INT. DIGNITY STRIP CLUB - PRIVATE AREA - CONTINUOUS

           The strippers lead Ben and Emma through the dank corridor of 
           private rooms.

           Ben and Emma notice a door slightly ajar, with FIVE YOUNG 
           CHILDREN playing with blocks and coloring books. 

                                 EMMA
                        That’s a day-care?

                                 BEN
                        Is it for dancers or patrons?

                                 MERCEDES
                        Don’t worry about that, baby. 

           They pull Ben and Emma into a...

           PRIVATE ROOM

           One Stripper mounts Ben; the other straddles Emma. 
                                 HONDA
                        I'm'a work that dick, daddy.

           Ben looks at Emma awkwardly.

                                 BEN
                        My wife usually handles all of my 
                        dick work.

                                 MERCEDES
                        She don’t mind. She’s busy.

                                 EMMA
                        I’m busy, Ben!

           Mercedes leans over and stuffs boobs in Emma’s face. Ben nods 
           his consent, awkwardly crossing his arms. 

                                 HONDA
                        You need to relax, baby. 

                                 BEN
                        I’m trying, Honda. We have a lot on 
                        our minds.

                                 HONDA
                        What y’all worried about?

           Emma pops her head out from under Mercedes, now full-on 
           "drunk honest". 

                                 EMMA
                        What if I have a baby and I’m never 
                        sexy again?

                                 MERCEDES
                        Girl, that’s crazy! I got two kids, 
                        I can still turn it up.

                                 EMMA
                        Really? You're a mom?

                                 MERCEDES
                        Honda got five kids, she fine as 
                        hell.

                                 HONDA
                       (whisper-licking Ben's 
                       ear)
                        Actually got six. 

                                 MERCEDES
                        Hey, mommies gotta fuck, too. 
                                 BEN
                        That is a refreshing attitude.  

           Emma sits up, now curious and attentive. 

                                 EMMA
                        How is your work-life balance?

                                 MERCEDES
                        Shhhh...

           She leans Emma against the wall as Honda moves in on Ben. 

                                 HONDA
                        Mama gonna show you this pussy- 

           Suddenly, the lights turn up, jarringly bright. Ben blinks 
           hard, adjusting. Emma doesn't stir. Two kids run down the 
           hall laughing. 

                                 MERCEDES
                        Damn kids fuckin' with the lights 
                        again.

                                 HONDA
                        They’ll fix it. Let’s keep goin'.

           Teaming up, Mercedes and Honda move in on Ben. He blinks, 
           rubs his eyes.

           BEN’S POV: focused on the strippers' STRETCH MARKS, NIPPLES 
           pocked by BABY-TEETH BITE MARKS, C-SECTION SCARS and 
           EPISIOTOMY SCARS...

                                 BEN
                        Good god.

                                 HONDA
                        Put your face there, baby. 

           Honda twerks her scarred nether region towards BEN'S HEAD. He 
           scoots back, grimacing. 

                                 HONDA (CONT’D)
                        Taste it, baby. 

           Honda THRUSTS back, and Ben RECOILS, hitting his head. 
           Blinded with pain, he FLIES BACKWARDS into Honda and 
           Mercedes, all three tumbling into a pile on the floor. 

           MOANING with pain, Ben shoves off the strippers, accidentally 
           putting a stabilizing hand on Honda's crotch-
           Just as a HUGE BOUNCER runs in to see Ben writhing on top of 
           the ladies. 

                                 BOUNCER
                        Hey! Ain't no fuckin’ in here, bro.

           The noise rouses Emma, who jumps up drunkenly. 

                                 EMMA
                        Who’s trying to fuck my man?

           Both Emma and the Bouncer jump into the fray, pulling Ben and 
           the strippers apart. The group of KIDS run into the room, 
           cheering the fight.

                                 KID #1
                        Go, Mommy, go!

           EXT. DIGNITY STRIP CLUB - BACK ALLEY - NIGHT

           Ben and Emma are thrown out of the club. The door slams. Emma 
           helps up a COUGHING Ben.

                                 EMMA
                        You okay? 

                                 BEN
                        Yeah, I have something-

           Ben COUGHS hard and pulls a CURLY PUBIC HAIR from his mouth.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Oh, god.

           Emma LAUGHS.  

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        I probably have mouth-herpes!

           She laughs HARDER. Ben can’t help but smile. He pulls her 
           into an embrace. 

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        It’s been a long time since you 
                        laughed like that. 

                                 EMMA
                        I think we needed to get some of 
                        the crazy out of our systems. 

                                 BEN
                        For the sake of the baby. 
           Emma nods, the spell broken. 

                                 EMMA
                        It’s late. We should head home. 

           INT. EMMA’S OFFICE - DAY

           Emma sits at her desk surrounded by mementos of her FATHER 
           and his business. 

           She scrolls through her CALENDAR, trying to find a place for 
           a new entry titled "BABY?"... But her days are too filled 
           with WORK PROJECTS and MEETINGS.  

           She sighs.

           She opens a webpage and Googles, “Crazy things to do”, 
           pulling up results with titles like "1,001 Things to See 
           Before You Die", and "What to Do Before You Kick the Bucket".

                                 CINDY (O.S.)
                        Are you dying?

           Emma's looks up to see her mom, CINDY FRIEDMAN-WAGNER (50’s, 
           intense) dropping off files and peering at the screen. 

                                 EMMA
                        No, mom.

           Cindy eyes Emma suspiciously.

                                 CINDY
                        Because we’re in the middle of our 
                        biggest account negotiation-

                                 EMMA
                        I’m not dying!

                                 CINDY
                        Okay. 
                        (Beat) 
                        You’re doing great. 

                                 EMMA
                        Am I? 

                                 CINDY
                        I wish at your age I had half your 
                        dedication. 

                                 EMMA
                        What do you mean? You gave up 
                        everything for your career. 
                                 CINDY
                        Most everything. There were 
                        compromises. 

           Cindy tucks Emma’s hair behind her ear. 

                                 CINDY (CONT’D)
                        Never make sacrifices for anyone, 
                        sweetheart.  

           Cindy gives Emma a thumbs-up as she leaves. 

           Emma glances back at her computer screen, at the search 
           results... Her eyes go wide. A lightbulb moment. 

           INT. KITCHEN - DAY

           Ben, wearing a custom ink t-shirt for his tutoring company, 
           walks an undersized 10-year old (MIKEY) to the door. 

                                 BEN
                        Keep drilling that vocab, Mikey. 
                        SAT’s are only six years away. 

                                 MIKEY
                        I will. 

           Mikey stops. 

                                 MIKEY (CONT’D)
                        Um... can I ask you a question? 

                                 BEN
                        That’s what I’m here for. 

                                 MIKEY
                        I heard my mom and dad fighting 
                        last night. And she said he was a 
                        "closet monster who has to bang 
                        tranny hookers to come." What does 
                        that mean?

                                 BEN
                        Whoa, time’s up! Vocab. Bye!

                                 MIKEY
                        But-

           Ben slams the door on him. He rubs his temples. 

                                 EMMA (O.S.)
                        Hun?!
           Emma runs in from the backdoor, throwing down her bags. 

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        We need to talk.    

                                 BEN
                        What’s the best age to tell a child 
                        his father’s gay?  

                                 EMMA
                        Thirty? How great was last night?

                                 BEN
                        Gave Benihana a run for its money. 

                                 EMMA
                        You know what I'm thinking? Let’s 
                        keep the crazy going. 

                                 BEN
                        Yesterday, you were on fire about a 
                        baby. Now, you want more strip 
                        clubs?  

                                 EMMA
                        I want BOTH, Ben. We can do this 
                        FOR the baby! We’ll make a pre-baby 
                        Bucket List.  

           She takes out her laptop, showing him the "1,001 Crazy Things 
           to Do Before You Die" website. 

                                 BEN
                        You’re comparing having a baby to 
                        dying of cancer?  

                                 EMMA
                        You heard our friends yesterday.

                                 BEN
                        I thought you couldn’t wait.

                                 EMMA
                        We’ll give ourselves a time limit. 
                        One month to get the crazy out of 
                        our systems. 

           A beat as Ben considers.

                                 BEN
                        What if it were eight months?

                                 EMMA
                        Two months.
                                 BEN
                        Four months.

                                 EMMA
                        Deal. Three months.

                                 BEN
                        Fine. So, we make this list, we do 
                        everything on it, and then we march 
                        into parenthood with no regrets?

                                 EMMA
                        We’ll beat the system, baby. We’ll 
                        actually be happy parents. 

                                 BEN
                        Okay. Where do we start?

                                 EMMA
                        We gather list ideas.

           INT. GYM LOCKER ROOM - DAY

           Emma takes notes while Jen changes out of her yoga outfit, 
           her baby in the car seat at her feet. 

                                 JEN
                        My honest opinion? Look.

           Jen yanks open her pants so that she and Emma can both look 
           down at her crotch. Emma GASPS-

                                 JEN (CONT’D)
                        That’s an episiotomy scar. They cut 
                        me open during the birth, vagina to 
                        butthole.

                                 EMMA
                        Oh, my god...

           Jen lets her pants snap back into place. 

                                 JEN
                        God can’t help you. Give your 
                        husband one last face-time before 
                        babies turn your goods into 
                        Frankenstein.

           INT. ICE SKATING RINK - DAY

           In hockey gear, Ben awkwardly skates around the crowded rink 
           side-by-side with his more agile dad, ALAN KAPLAN (late 50's, 
           fit, strapping).

                                 ALAN
                        I know what I WISH I'd'a done.

                                 BEN
                        Besides abort me and pursue your 
                        career in the NHL? 

                                 ALAN
                        Stop with that. No, I had tickets 
                        to Woodstock. Didn’t go.

                                 BEN
                        Really? Why not?

                                 ALAN
                        I got sick. Back then, we called it 
                        "the clap". 

                                 BEN
                        Okay, I think I’m good.

                                 ALAN
                        It felt like peeing fire.

                                 BEN
                        Jesus, dad.

                                 ALAN
                        I always regret not going to 
                        Woodstock. I was really looking 
                        forward to dropping acid. Can’t do 
                        that with kids in the picture.

                                 BEN
                        Good point, I guess.

           A PRINTER delivers THE LIST into Ben and Emma’s eager hands.

           MOMENTS LATER

           They peruse the list, sipping wine on the couch. 
                                 BEN
                        So what order do we go in? 
                        Chronologically? Geographically?  

                                 EMMA
                        What does the order matter?

                                 BEN
                        We can’t just move randomly through 
                        a list. The whole thing will feel 
                        arbitrary and redundant.

                                 EMMA
                        Ben. You’re being anal. Don’t 
                        overthink it. This will be fun, so 
                        let's have a good time with it. 

                                 BEN
                        Okay. Well-argued. You pick first.

           A modest airplane hanger in a tiny airfield. 

                                 MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        (Australian accent)
                        If ya don't mind, we'll go over 
                        some brief safety instructions.

           INT. OUTBACK JACK & SONS' SKYDIVING - CLASSROOM - SAME

           Emma and Ben stand wearing head to toe SKYDIVING outfits -- 
           goggles, bodysuits, and helmets with go-cameras on top.

           Ben nervously bounces his leg as he and Emma are addressed by 
           OUTBACK JACK, JR., a tanned Australian.

                                 OUTBACK JACK, JR.
                        Once we get up to jump altitude, 
                        there's no time to muck about. 

           A biplane screams overhead. Ben ducks. His glasses fog with 
           sweat. He leans over to Emma, whispering.

                                 BEN
                        This isn’t safe. You hear that 
                        accent? 

                                 EMMA
                        It’s perfectly safe-
                                 BEN
                        His ancestors were convicts!

           Outback Jack, Jr. stops in front of them.

                                 OUTBACK JACK, JR.
                        Everything all right, folks?

                                 BEN
                        We’re thinking we’ll save this for 
                        another day.

                                 EMMA
                        We don’t HAVE another day. 

                                 OUTBACK JACK, JR.
                        Crikey, another cancer patient? 

                                 EMMA
                        No, we’re discussing pregnancy.

                                 OUTBACK JACK, JR.
                        All the more reason to do this. You 
                        should embrace life’s challenges as 
                        a family! My late father always 
                        used to say, "Wallabee’s stay joey 
                        if you hold ‘em in the sack." 

                                 BEN
                        Late father? He didn’t die 
                        skydiving, did he?

                                 OUTBACK JACK, JR.
                        No, no; snake bite...

                                 EMMA
                        See? Totally unrelated-

                                 OUTBACK JACK, JR.
                        ...after his chute failed.

                                 EMMA
                        Oy.

                                 OUTBACK JACK, JR.
                        He hits the ground, WHAM, his 
                        spinal cord, T-3 through T-9, it's 
                        jelly. So when the rattler set upon 
                        his paralyzed body, Dad couldn't 
                        defend himself. You never see these 
                        things coming. 

           He points at Ben.
                                 OUTBACK JACK, JR. (CONT’D)
                        Actually, you’re wearing his old 
                        rig. Cleaned up, of course. 

                                 BEN
                        Yep, we’re leaving.

           Ben jumps up, trying to unbuckle his suit. Unbeknownst to 
           him, he hits the "Record" button on his camera. Jack grabs 
           Ben in an embrace.

                                 OUTBACK JACK, JR.
                        Relax, mate. This is a tandem jump. 
                        We’ll do this together. 

           Jack lets Ben go and embraces Emma from behind. 

                                 OUTBACK JACK, JR. (CONT’D)
                        Of course, for size reasons, I’ll 
                        be strapped to the lass. 

           He pulls her in close, tightening the straps. Emma giggles.

                                 EMMA
                        That’s so tight.

                                 BEN
                        What about me? I’m not going solo.

                                 OUTBACK JACK, JR.
                        Never! You’ll be with my little 
                        brother, Caliban. 

           A large figure slides from underneath their airplane. This is 
           CALIBAN -- a physically massive man-child with a big grin and 
           a dead-eyed stare. Like "Hodor" with a tan. 

                                 BEN
                        You two are related?  

                                 OUTBACK JACK, JR.
                        After Dad passed, Mom hit the meth  
                        pretty hard. Say "hi," Caliban. 

           Ben reaches out to shake his hand. Caliban slaps it away, 
           swinging his arms wildly.

                                 OUTBACK JACK, JR. (CONT’D)
                        Easy, Caliban. Easy.

                                 BEN
                        What’d I do?
                                 OUTBACK JACK, JR.
                        It’s all right. He doesn’t like 
                        sudden movements. 

                                 BEN
                        Isn't ALL of skydiving a sudden 
                        movement?

                                 OUTBACK JACK, JR.
                        He’s first-rate trained, Ben. I 
                        certified him myself. 

           As Caliban calms down, Emma’s pulled in tighter by Jack.

                                 EMMA
                        Oh, my god, what is that?

           Jack looks down.

                                 OUTBACK JACK, JR.
                        That's a boner. Once the 
                        adrenaline’s going, it’s perfectly 
                        normal to crack a fat. 

                                 EMMA
                        But we're on the ground.

           Outback Jack covertly sniffs Emma’s hair and smiles.

                                 OUTBACK JACK, JR.
                        Sense memory. Your turn, Benny-boy.

           Caliban LIFTS Ben with both hands and straps him to his 
           front. Ben’s feet dangle from the harness.

                                 EMMA
                        Look, hun. You can see everything 
                        daddy sees.

                                 OUTBACK JACK, JR.
                        He does look like a baby!

           They both laugh. Caliban joins in, grinning wide.

                                 BEN
                        Oh, God, I think he's cracking a 
                        fat. Unhook me, unhook me!

                                 OUTBACK JACK, JR.
                        It's perfectly normal.

                                 EMMA
                        Just relax, babe...
                                 BEN
                        I can feel it! It's awful!

           Ben writhes, desperately trying to escape. 

                                 OUTBACK JACK, JR.
                        No sudden movements, Ben!

                                 BEN
                        I! Can’t! Take! This!

           Caliban SCREAMS, going BERSERK. 

                                 OUTBACK JACK, JR.
                        Caliban, no!

           Outback Jack DIVES clear as Caliban runs around the hanger, 
           slapping himself in the face, SMASHING Ben into walls.

           INT. EEMMA'S OFFICE - AFTERNOON

           Emma video-chats with Lydia, sharing the footage -- the POV 
           CAM SLAMS into a garage door, then cuts to black.

                                 EMMA
                        That’s where we lost him. 

                                 LYDIA
                        What were you doing the whole time?

                        Dry humping an Aussie. More or 
                        less. 

           Emma looks up -- Cindy stands in the doorway, arms crossed.

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        Shit. We'll chat later, okay?

           Emma disconnects the chat.

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        Mom! Hey. Just doing some thinking 
                        on the business. 
                                 CINDY
                        Did you make progress?

                                 EMMA
                        Yep. Tons-

           Emma bumps the mouse, restarting the headcam video.

                                 VIDEO (O.S.)
                        "Oh, my god, what is that?!"
                        "That's a boner!"

           Emma quickly closes the video, too late.

                                 CINDY
                        This company meant everything to 
                        your father. 

                                 EMMA
                        It means a lot to me, too.

                                 CINDY
                        Then get it together.

           Cindy walks off. Emma sighs... a BUZZ alerts her to a text 
           from Ben -- "Wine tour tomorrow!" She smiles, comforted.

                                 EMMA
                        It’s all you can drink, right?

                        All you can drink!

           She grabs Ben’s hand as they bound onto the bus. 

           INT. WINE TOUR BUS - CONTINUOUS

           Ben and Emma stop short -- all of the other passengers are 
           OLDER RETIRED COUPLES.

                       (whispering)
                        They look like our parents.

           A couple in matching TOMMY BAHAMA shirts pushes past.

           INT. WINE TASTING ROOM - DAY

           CLOSE ON the SMALLEST POUR OF WINE IMAGINABLE in a glass, 
           being SLURPED by Ben.

                        How the hell did this make the cut?

                                 BEN
                        We can’t go day-drinking when we 
                        have kids. 

                                 EMMA
                        Those people have kids with them.

           She gestures to a family in the corner tasting, the kids 
           BORED out of their minds. 

                                 BEN
                        I’m sure that’s illegal. 

           Emma notices a COUPLE that looks disturbingly like her and 
           Ben, thirty years from now. She slams a shot of wine. 

           The TOMMY BAHAMA COUPLE walks over to the counter.

                                 TOMMY BAHAMA HUSBAND
                        You know, it works better if you 
                        savor it? 

                                 EMMA
                        Yeah... but sometimes you just 
                        wanna get drunk.

                                 TOMMY BAHAMA WIFE
                        That sounds like something our kids 
                        would say.

                                 BEN
                        Are they alcoholics, too?

                        Twenty years of parenthood. We’re 
                        reclaiming our lives. 

           The older couple toasts.

                        We sometimes get jealous of you non-
                        birthers. Free as birds.

                                 BEN
                        Oh, no. We actually are birthers. 

                                 EMMA
                        Well, not yet.

                        We’re pre-birthers.

                        Ah. See you in two decades. 

                                 TOMMY BAHAMA WIFE
                        Here, have some wine, on us.

                                    We’d love some.

           A DESPERATE HOUSEWIFE leans in, glass raised. 

                                 DESPERATE HOUSEWIFE
                        I’ll drink to that.

           Her RED-FACED DESPERATE HUSBAND stumbles over.

           Ben and Emma SIP as the others SLUG.

                        Whooo! 

           She pulls out an old SALT PACKET from her purse and SPRINKLES 
           it on her chest.

           “Margaritaville” by Jimmy Buffet cues up over the...

           “OLD PEOPLE DRINKING” MONTAGE:

           -- At WINERY after WINERY, Ben and Emma watch in shocked 
           admiration as all the OLDER FOLKS get shit-faced. 

           -- The DESPERATE HOUSEWIFE pushes the bottom of Ben’s glass 
           up, forcing him to keep chugging as the crowd cheers. 

           -- Emma dances on the bar like she’s Coyote Ugly. A FAT MOM 
           joins her, lumbering awkwardly onto the bar.

           -- EMPTY-NESTERS twerk and soul-train; a blackout-drunk FAT 
           DAD stuffs cheese cubes into his mouth; Ben and Emma play 
           another COUPLE in Wine-Pong with glassware and golfballs; a 
           HOUSEWIFE flirts with the BARTENDER, licking a couple of 
           olives like they’re testicles.

           Ben stumbles over to Emma. 

                                 BEN
                        Can you believe this?

                        It’s like they all just got 
                        released from prison.

                        Heyyy, buddy-

           Ben and Emma turn to see the TOMMY BAHAMA COUPLE drunk-
           Facetiming their college-age SON.
                                 TOMMY BAHAMA WIFE
                        It’s Mommy and Pop-Pop.

                       (to Ben)
                        Are they drunk-dialing? 

           On the Couple, holding up two hands. 

                                 TOMMY BAHAMA HUSBAND
                        Mommy had seven wines! 

                                 TOMMY BAHAMA WIFE
                        I had nine!

           Yep.
                                    Yep.

           The Tommy Bahama couple makes kissy-faces at the camera. 

                                 TOMMY BAHAMA COUPLE
                        WE MISS YOU SO MUCH!

           Emma and Ben look around the winery -- all of the older folks 
           are drunk-dialing, -texting and -Facetiming their children. 

                                 BEN
                        I’m doing it, too. 

           Ben takes out his phone. Dials... Matthew picks up on 
           Facetime.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Heyyyyyy!

                        Why are you face-timing me, dude?

                        We’re drinkiiiing.

           Lydia pops on the screen, frantic. 

                                 LYDIA
                        Yeah? Well, I’m dealing with a 
                        fuckin’ diaper blowout. It’s a 
                        goddamn warzone! 

           The call disconnects.  

                                 EMMA
                        She used to be fun.
           Ben looks around the Tasting Room at all the fulfilled, 
           emotionally invested parents.

                                 BEN
                        Maybe these people have it all 
                        figured out.

                                 EMMA
                        Hey! Focus. We’re listing. Right?

                        Right.

           EXT. EMMA'S CAR - NIGHT

           Cue Frank Sinatra's "Come Fly with Me" as Emma pulls up in 
           SLO-MO to the glitzy lighting of a CASINO. They emerge from 
           the car like high-rollers dressed to the nines. 

           Emma tosses the keys O.S. to the VALET -- they clatter to the 
           ground, uncaught. REVEAL that this is not Vegas but rather...

           EXT. INDIAN CASINO - SAME

           The life-hating VALET grabs the keys off the pavement, and 
           hands Emma a ticket. 

                                 VALET
                        Parking's a buck an hour, ten bucks

           Ben and Emma walk up to the CASHIER, arm in arm, glitzy-cool, 
           all smiles. Ben slides over some cash.

                                 BEN
                        Five hundred, please.

           Emma chimes in, sliding over her own cash.

                                 EMMA
                        Make that a thousand.

           Ben hovers over Emma's shoulder as she takes the dice.

                        I got the gist of this when my 
                        sorority co-hosted a casino night. 
                        Keep it simple, work the pass line, 
                        blow.

           Ben dutifully blows on the dice in Emma's hand. She rolls-

                                 CROUPIER
                        Lucky seven, winner!

           The table cheers. 

                                 BEN
                        Okay, let’s cash out.

                                 EMMA
                        Yeah, right. Let it ride.

           Emma rolls. More cheers!

                        This is making me nervous. I gotta 
                        pee. 

           She rakes up a MASSIVE stack of chips.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        You okay here by yourself?

                        I dunno, let’s see.

           She blows her own dice and rolls. More cheers! She slaps him 
           on the ass as he walks off. She throws down more chips...

           INT. CASINO HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Looking for a bathroom, Ben passes a HIGH ROLLER’S ONLY ROOM, 
           dripping with opulent luxury. He casually glances around, and 
           makes his way towards a GILDED MEN’S ROOM DOOR. 

           INT. LUXURY BATHROOM STALL - NIGHT

           He takes in the luxury, noticing the exotic JAPANESE TOILET 
           with heated seats. He lays down seat covers and sits. To pee.

           While he tinkles, he channel surfs on the TV screen built 
           into the stall door.

                                 BEN
                        This is incredible. 

           He finishes, zips, and opens the stall door smack into a HUGE 
           bathroom attendant -- JEFFREY STRONGBOW on his name-tag.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)

                        Are you a member of the High 
                        Roller’s club?  

           Ben immediately sweats.

                        I... don’t...

                        I’m sorry, Jeffrey... Mr. 
                        Strongbow. I’m in a delicate place 
                        right now.

                        Are you crying?

           Ben sniffles, stifling tears.

                                 BEN
                        Have you ever seen a guy try to 
                        change a diaper in a public 
                        restroom? Or escort his daughter 
                        into a men’s room so he can keep an 
                        eye on her while taking a piss? 
                        Praying she doesn’t see grown-up 
                        dicks and ask tough questions? 
           Strongbow nods. 

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        That’s on my horizon, Jeff. I know 
                        I’m not a member of this fancy-
                        bathroom club. But dammit, I just 
                        wanted a taste. Before it's too 
                        late? 

           A tear rolls down Jeffrey’s cheek. He grabs Ben’s hands.

           Jeffrey guides Ben's hands under the water, vigorously 
           scrubbing and drying.

           Jeffrey combs Ben's hair, using scissors to snip off an 
           errant piece. Then he gets to work on the neck massage.

           Ben walks up -- Emma places action all over the table.

                                 EMMA
                        Give me twenty on six the hard way, 
                        and ten to lay against the four.

                                 BEN
                        What are you doing?

                                 EMMA
                        We hit a bit of a rough patch. 

                                 BEN
                        How rough?

                                 EMMA
                        I lost the grand.

                                 BEN
                        ...Okay. That stings a little, but 
                        we'll be fine. 

                                 EMMA
                        And... I kinda took out more money 
                        from the wedding gifts account.

                                 BEN
                        Yeah, but not all of it.

                                 EMMA
                        Yeah.

                                 BEN
                        THERE WAS TWENTY-FIVE THOUSAND 
                        DOLLARS IN THAT ACCOUNT!
           She breaks down in tears.

                                 EMMA
                        I was feeling so confident, and I 
                        didn’t know where you were... did 
                        you get a haircut? 

                                 BEN
                        No! It’s a fresh part.

           She holds up a $100 chip.

                                 EMMA
                        I still have this. One more roll, 
                        we double it up and-

           Ben snatches her arm and pulls her away from the table.

                                 BEN
                        You gambled away our kid's tuition. 
                        Do you have any idea what happens 
                        to a Jewish kid at a public school? 
                        He'll end up getting shoved in a 
                        locker every day. Or dealing weed.

                                 EMMA
                        It’s not that bad.

                                 BEN
                        Oh, it is. It is definitely that-

           Ben stops in his tracks, distracted by the CLICK-CLACK-SLAP 
           of TILES on table coming from O.S.

                                 EMMA
                        We can figure something out... Ben?

           She follows his gaze to the far corner of the casino, where 
           CHINESE GANGSTERS and DRAGON LADIES are gathered around a 
           fast-paced, high-stakes game of MAHJONG.

           Like a man possessed, Ben stares, wide-eyed, as a mahjong 
           tile SLAMS onto the table in SLO-MO -- ZOOM in on Ben, 
           entering a...

           FLASHBACK

           YOUNG BEN (8) returns home from school, the sound of tiles 
           drawing him to the KITCHEN where-

           He watches curiously as his GRANDMA and her FRIENDS play 
           mahjong; the women LAUGH and GOSSIP and DRINK WHITE WINE and 
           call their plays -- "Two bam," "Three crack," "Dragons!"
           The sights and sounds blend together, forming connections in 
           Ben's brain, a la BEAUTIFUL MIND, as he studies the game.

           BACK TO PRESENT

           Emma looks at Ben, worried.

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        Are you okay? Are you freaking out?

                                 BEN
                        You have that last chip?

           She hands it to him. He pushes through the crowd. 

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Follow my lead. These guys are 
                        probably Triad.

                                 EMMA
                        They look like dentists. 

           Heads turn as Ben slides into the chair, tossing the chip 
           onto the table.

                                 BEN
                        Deal me in?

           The CHINESE DEALER hesitates.

                                 CHINESE DEALER
                        This a private table-

           WONG, a CHINESE GANGSTER, looks up from the brim of a fedora. 

                                 WONG
                        White boy wants to lose his money, 
                        we'll let him.

           The Dealer nods and hands out tiles. 

           Wong smiles as he coolly picks his teeth with a COKE NAIL. 
           Ben pulls out Purell, sanitizing.

           Wong opens play with...

                                 WONG (CONT’D)
                        Six dot.

                                 PLAYER 2
                        Two crack.

                                 PLAYER 3
                        Five bam.
           Ben hesitates, measuring his move, drawing eye-rolls...

                                 BEN
                        Mahjong.

           He drops his tiles on the table. The other players emit a 
           stream of Chinese curses.

                                 WONG
                        Beginner luck.

                                 EMMA
                        You just won? 

           Ben gathers up his earnings.

                                 BEN
                        Be a doll and grab me a glass of 
                        Zin'. Bubelleh’s about to run this 
                        shit.

           MAHJONG MONTAGE: 

           -- Ben slaps down tiles, calling out his plays with gusto. 
           His pile of chips grows.

           -- Ben gulps down white wine, gossiping to his neighbors.

           -- Emma and the Chinese ON-LOOKERS follow Ben's moves, 
           impressed; he's winning them over.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        I think it's time to send you home, 
                        Wong.

                                 WONG
                        I think it's time to send you home.

           He pushes the rest of his chips in. The crowd gasps.

                                 EMMA
                        How much is that?

                                 BEN
                        Twenty grand. We barely have half 
                        of that.

                                 WONG
                        Maybe you be more comfortable at 
                        Bingo auditorium?

                                 EMMA
                        You’re sure you can win, baby?
                                 BEN
                        I watched my grandma destroy Mimi 
                        Greenberg with this very hand. 

           Emma looks over at Wong, coyly seductive.

                                 EMMA
                        Maybe we can match the bet with... 
                        something other than money.

           She puts her hotel room key on top of Ben's stack of chips, 
           sliding it all in.

                                 WONG
                        You making Indecent Proposal?

                                 EMMA
                        I am.  

                                 WONG
                        I accept.

                                 BEN
                        Jesus Christ, Emma, what if I lose?

                                 EMMA
                        It’ll make a great story at our son 
                        Chong’s Bar Mitzvah.

           Ben swallows, nodding at the Dealer -- he's ready.

           The tiles are dealt -- the play begins, rapid fire; Wong 
           smiles confidently, taking the lead.

           Sweat beads on Ben's face.

                                 WONG
                       (pleased with himself)
                        Oops.

                                 BEN
                        Nice play...

           The on-lookers murmur -- is this it? Ben lays down a tile-

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        ...But mine's better.

           Wong curses as the spectators erupt! Pandemonium! Ben has 
           done it! Ben scoops up his chips. 

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Let’s get the fuck outta here.
           INT. CASINO BUFFET - DAY

           Emma dives into a plate piled with Crab Legs. Ben eats 
           chicken, lost in his thoughts. 

                                 EMMA
                        We should hit Vegas next.

                                 BEN
                        Emma, we’re supposed to be building 
                        a solid foundation for a family. 
                        Not gambling with our privates.

                                 EMMA
                        Ben. RELAX. 
                       (holding up a crab leg)
                        Enjoy the good life.

                                 BEN
                        I don’t eat crab leg.

           She waves the leg in his face.

                                 EMMA
                        Come onnnnn. These are delicious.

                                 BEN
                        Please! Get that out of my face.

                                 EMMA
                        What’s your problem with crab legs?

                                 BEN
                        You want to know my problem? 
                        They're PACKED with bacteria. Do 
                        you WANT diarrhea?

                                 EMMA
                        So, what, I’m supposed to never eat 
                        crab legs? Stick to chicken?

                                 BEN
                        Chicken is delicious! And safe!

                                 EMMA
                        Chicken is boring! You’re going to 
                        miss out on what could be the most 
                        incredible food in the whole world 
                        because you’re afraid to get sick?

                                 BEN
                        It’s not worth it! And it’s not on 
                        the list!
           Emma pulls the list and a pen out of her purse and scrawls 
           "CRAB LEGS" in big letters. She shows it to him. 

                                 EMMA
                        Don’t be afraid of crab legs. 

           Ben looks down at his plain, old chicken. He reaches for a 
           crab leg, but Emma pulls it back. 

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        I don’t want to force you-

                                 BEN
                        Just gimme the damn crab leg.

           He snatches it. Cracks it open. Takes a bite. Chews slowly.

                                 EMMA
                        So? 

           His eyes close as he savors it.  

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        The world’s our buffet, Ben. 

           PRE-BABY BUCKET LIST MONTAGE: 

           -- INSERT: THE PRE-BABY BUCKET LIST, “9. Run a Half-Marathon”

           -- An energized Emma crosses the finish line, arms raised 
           victoriously! From behind, a pale-faced Ben hobbles slowly, 
           blood stains on his shirt from his chafing nipples.

           -- INSERT: THE PRE-BABY BUCKET LIST, “21. Bottle Service”

           -- At a trendy NIGHTCLUB, Emma dances hard while Ben pours 
           from an embarrassingly huge bottle of champagne. A PACK of 
           anorexic CLUB WHORES joins them. Emma snatches a drink from 
           their hands and shoos them away.

           -- INSERT: THE PRE-BABY BUCKET LIST, “38. Binge Watch TV"

           -- Emma and Ben watch "Game of Thrones". Inspired, Emma 
           reaches for Ben’s crotch. He SLAPS her hand away, gesturing 
           at the TV -- “I’m watching!”

           -- INSERT: THE PRE-BABY BUCKET LIST, “57. Simply Ballroom”

           -- The DANCE INSTRUCTOR corrects Emma and Ben’s positioning. 
           Ben reaches to grab Emma’s ass, but she SLAPS his hand away -- 
           "I’m dancing!" 

           -- INSERT: THE PRE-BABY BUCKET LIST, “20. Streaking”
           -- In a crowded IKEA, Ben and Emma disrobe. They SPRINT 
           exuberantly through various departments... but then slow 
           down, looking around, lost. Cupping his weiner, Ben asks an 
           EMPLOYEE for directions, while Emma hides under a display 
           bed, laughing.

           -- Emma shows Ben the marked-off bucket list; they're nearly 
           finished!

           -- INSERT: THE PRE-BABY BUCKET LIST, “43. Drive a Dream Car”

           -- Behind the wheel of a FERRARI, top down, Ben slides on his 
           shades. He smiles at Emma... and herky-jerkily pulls out of 
           the CAR RENTAL lot, grinding gears. The car stalls. 

           -- Emma now sits behind the wheel, Ben sitting shotgun. She 
           cranks up the music and TEARS out of the lot, ripping down 
           the HIGHWAY. She reaches over and caresses his thigh. 

                                 BEN
                        Mmm, that’s kinda turning me on. 

                                 EMMA
                        Yeah?

           She gently guides his head down into her crotch. 

                                 BEN
                       (fake gasp)
                        While you’re driving? 

                                 EMMA
                        That’s why they call it "road 
                        head".

           Ben dives in.

                                 BEN
                       (muffled)
                        These pants are so tight.

           Emma reaches down with one hand, makes an adjustment.

                                 EMMA
                        Better?

                                 BEN
                       (muffled)
                        Mmm-hmm...

           STAY ON Emma as she drives, the back of Ben’s head bobbing 
           into frame. Emma moans. 
                                 EMMA
                        ...ohhhh... where did you learn 
                        that, baby?

           Ben's head pops up.

                                 BEN 
                        "Game of Thrones".

                                 EMMA
                        Keep going.

           She shoves him back down. 

           Ben gets into a rhythm, and Emma's breathing quickens -- 
           she’s getting close. She takes one hand off the wheel, 
           grabbing her headrest.

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        Don't stop! Don't stop!

           As she CLIMAXES, Emma looks to her left -- a SCHOOL BUS FULL 
           OF BUG-EYED CHILDREN passes! 

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        OH, FUCK!

           She snaps her legs shut on Ben's head! He jerks up and 
           SMASHES his head on the steering wheel.

                                 BEN
                        OW!

           Ben drops, PINNING Emma's foot down onto the gas pedal.

                                 EMMA
                        Okay, get up! Get up!

                                 BEN
                        I’m stuck! Why’d you make me do 
                        that?

                                 EMMA
                        I thought you liked it! 

                                 BEN
                        Get me outta here!

           They veer toward a ravine.

                                 EMMA
                        Shit! Brace yourself!
           Ben shoves his head deeper into her crotch as they FLY OFF 
           THE ROAD and SMASH down onto the ground. 

                                                  CUT TO:

           EXT. ROAD - AFTERNOON

           Ben and Emma watch as a tow truck hoists up the wrecked 
           Ferrari. Emma holds an icepack to her inner thigh.

                                 BEN
                        That’s a $150,000 car.

                                 EMMA
                        Are we too reckless for kids?

           He reaches into his pocket and pulls out some documents.

                                 BEN
                        I don’t think so.

                                 EMMA
                        What is this?

                                 BEN
                        Insurance. The premium package.

                                 EMMA
                        What? When did you buy this?

                                 BEN
                        After the casino incident, I got 
                        tired of gambling. 

           She hugs him tight.

                                 EMMA
                        That’s Dad-level planning.

           He smiles. 

                                 BEN
                        Good. So we’re ready to call this?

                                 EMMA
                        Ben! We can’t quit now. We have one 
                        last list item. 

                                 BEN
                        This list is going to kill us!
                       (sighs)
                        All right. One more?
                                 EMMA
                        Then a baby.

           She smiles as she walks away texting. 

           -- INSERT: THE PRE-BABY BUCKET LIST, “92. Hard Drugs”

           INT. EMMA'S CAR - MOVING - DAY

           Ben and Emma speed through the empty desert. Emma refreshes 
           her Email to no avail while Ben drives, focused.  

                                 BEN
                        Yeesh, where are we?

                                 EMMA
                        No reception out here. 

           He grabs her phone and throws it in the backseat.

                                 BEN
                        No work allowed. This weekend’s 
                        about love, art, and music.  

           They pass a group of MAD MAX-LOOKING HIPPIES driving a SPACE 
           BUGGY flashing peace signs. 

                                 EMMA
                        And drugs. 

                                 BEN
                        And drugs. 

           They drive through a gated entrance. A massive neon sign 
           blinks -- "BURNING MAN". 

           EXT. CALIFORNIA DESERT - DAY

           CHAOS. EDM-punks dancing; stilt-walkers, fire-jugglers; naked 
           women in body-paint. And...

           Emma and Ben. Emma in a sundress and cardigan, Ben in head-to-
           toe R.E.I. DESERT GEAR and a garish fanny pack. 

           Emma flags down a WHITE RASTA puffing a huge spliff. 

                                 EMMA
                        Pardon me. Do you happen to know 
                        where we could buy drugs?

                                 WHITE RASTA
                        Buy?
           Ben reaches in his fanny pack and pulls out his wallet.

                                 BEN
                        Yeah, like, a hundred bucks worth? 

                                 EMMA
                       (aside to Ben)
                        Are you factoring in a tip?

                                 WHITE RASTA
                        This is a bartering community. Nice 
                        try, you fuckin’ narcs!

                                 EMMA
                        Whaaat? Us? No. No way. Man. 

                                 BEN
                        We’re just two festival-goers 
                        looking to score drugs. 

                                 EMMA
                        Hard drugs. 

                                 BEN
                        Not too hard. Like medium, medium-
                        soft? 

                                 WHITE RASTA
                        NARCS! NARCS! NARCS!

           Heads turn as the crowd notices, joining in the chant -- 
           "NARCS! NARCS! NARCS!"

           The crowd departs, leaving Ben and Emma alone.

                                 BEN
                        I’m feeling very judged.  

                                 EMMA
                        Gimme your fanny pack.

           Emma rummages through the pack and pulls out a Ziplock full 
           of baby carrots. 

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        In this family, we are NOT 
                        quitters. 

           She storms over to a PSYCHEDELIC SCHOOL BUS and pounds the 
           door. A hippie, JETHRO (40's), opens up. 

                                 JETHRO
                        Greetings...? 
                                 EMMA
                        I have carrots. You have drugs. 
                        Let’s barter. 

           Jethro smiles. 

                                 JETHRO
                        Enter.

           INT. PSYCHEDELIC SCHOOL BUS - CONTINUOUS

           Jethro munches on carrots as he leads Ben and Emma into the 
           dilapidated bus, where they’re greeted by a topless hippie, 
           TELLULAH (40's), with two TODDLERS suckling her breasts.

                                 JETHRO
                        Name’s Jethro. This is my life 
                        partner, Tellulah, and our 
                        offpring, Prana and Nug.

                                 TELLULAH
                        Namaste, friends. 

           Ben desperately avoids eye-to-tits contact. 

                                 BEN
                        Hello. 

                                 TELLULAH
                        Say hi to our blessed guests, boys. 

           PRANA and NUG mumble through mouthfuls of boob.

                                 JETHRO
                        Feedin’ time. You want a dribble?

                                 EMMA
                        No, thanks. I’m full. 

                                 JETHRO
                        Maybe later. Hun, let’s prepare 
                        some tea for our guests.

           Tellulah bends over a small stove. 

                                 EMMA
                        So, Jethro. We noticed you brought 
                        your children to a drug-fest? 

                                 BEN
                        Art and drug fest. 
                                 JETHRO
                        Yeah, they LOVE Burning Man!

                                 BEN
                        Is it safe to expose them to this?

                                 TELLULAH
                        When Jethro and I bore our child-
                        fruit, we vowed to share our lives 
                        with them. Our passions, our 
                        beliefs, our bed. 

                                 JETHRO
                        We didn’t want to change for them. 
                        You dig? 

                                 EMMA
                        I actually do dig. Family and wild 
                        fun, together.

                                 BEN
                        Seems like two things best enjoyed 
                        separately. Like Kim and Kanye.   

                                 JETHRO
                        Maybe you just need a change in 
                        perception. 

           He hand Ben and Emma cups of a THICK BREW.

                                 EMMA
                        What is this? 

                                 BEN 
                        It smells like a foot. Were your 
                        feet in this?

                                 JETHRO
                        It’s ayahuasca. All natural.

           Ben and Emma shrug and pound it. 

                                 TELLULAH
                        A decade of psychotherapy in a cup. 
                        Native Americans used it to purge 
                        negativity. 

                                 JETHRO
                        And trip balls.

                                 BEN
                        Is it safe? For a woman soon to be 
                        with child?  
                                 TELLULAH
                        Our boys came out just fine. 

                                 JETHRO
                        They were both anal births.

           Ben raises his head, his eyes now half-lidded and red.

                                 BEN
                        They... they came from your butt?

                                 EMMA
                        Ben... you sound like you’re 
                        high... high... high...

           Her voice ECHOES in her own head. Tears begin rolling down 
           Ben's cheek. 

                                 BEN
                        So many feelings... purging...

           BLLAAARRGGH! Ben VOMITS all over the floor. 

                                 EMMA
                        I’m... feeling them too...

           BLLAAARRGGH! She barfs. Jethro smiles. 

                                 JETHRO
                        It has begun.

           EXT. BURNING MAN - AFTERNOON

           Ben and Emma stumble into the festival, tripping balls. A 
           SKRILLEX-style EDM DJ takes the stage.

                                 BEN
                        So many humans.

           Emma sticks out her tongue.

                                 EMMA
                        I can taste the music... 

           Ben wags his tongue in the air, unknowingly licking a FAT 
           SWEATY DUDE’S BACK. 

                                 BEN
                        Me, too... Like onions.

           Emma turns her head and DOUBLE TAKES as a BABY IN DIAPERS 
           jumps onto the stage. 
                                 EMMA
                        Ben!

                                 BEN
                        Yessssss.....

                                 EMMA
                        Someone put a baby on the stage... 
                        We gotta help it!

                                 BEN
                        Emma... Look...

           ANOTHER BABY walks through the crowds, nodding “sup?” and 
           toasting with his beer can.

           A BABY DJ takes the stage... and DROPS THE BEAT!

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        They’re... everywhere...

           Ben and Emma stumble through CROWDS OF BABIES:

           -- BABIES in a circle passing a joint. 

           -- BABIES stage diving into a BABY MOSH PIT. 

           -- BABIES making out. 

           Ben tackles a pack of babies, play-wrestling with them like 
           they’re a litter of puppies. 

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Emma! They’re so cuddly! 

           The music turns DARK as Emma is suddenly OVERWHELMED. 

           Babies CRAWL up her legs, SWARMING HER, TACKLING her to the 
           ground. An EVIL BABY gives Emma a TITTY TWISTER. 

                                 EMMA
                        OW! Leave them alone.

           The EVIL BABIES swarm onto Emma...

                                 EVIL BABIES
                        CHANGE US! CHANGE US! CHANGE US!

                                 EMMA
                        No! NO! NO!!!!

           INT. BEN AND EMMA'S HOME - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Emma bolts up, grabbing her breasts in pain. Ben leans over.

                                 BEN
                        Emma! Are you okay? 

                                 EMMA
                        Ugh... I had a baby nightmare... 

                                 BEN
                        That wasn’t a nightmare... look at 
                        your stomach! 

           Emma looks down at her swollen belly. 

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        You ARE pregnant! 

           She notices Ben’s BELLY is FULL-TERM SWOLLEN.  

                                 EMMA
                        Oh, my god, Ben! You are, too!

                                 BEN
                        I’m dilating... it’s time.  

                                 EMMA
                       (moaning)
                        I think for me, too. 

                                 BEN
                        Okay, baby. You gotta push.

                                 EMMA
                        I’m not ready yet.

                                 BEN
                        Yes, you are. Push like me.

           Ben GRUNTS AND MOANS as he flexes and pushes.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Now you, baby!

           Emma SCREAMS as she SQUEEZES.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        There it is! It’s crowning!

                                 EMMA
                        It’s tearing me apart!
                                 BEN
                        One more big one!

           A CROWD OF BURNING MAN FESTIVAL-GOERS

           Recoiling in horror as they watch Ben and Emma rolling on the 
           ground, SHITTING THEIR PANTS. 

                                 BEN
                        Pushhhhh!

                                 EMMA
                        I ammmm....

           Tellulah and Jethro push through and see Ben and Emma. 

                                 JETHRO
                        They purged. Gross.

           Jethro shakes his head and takes a drink of milk. 

                                             CUT TO BLACK.

           EXT. CAMPSITE - MORNING

           Ben and Emma dump huge bottles of water on each other. 

                                 EMMA
                        Am I clean?

                                 BEN
                        You have a.... corn in your hair. 

           Emma gags as she DUMPS more water. 

           As Ben scrubs her, he sees Jethro in the distance, holding 
           his sons up to see the sunrise. Ben smiles. 
           INT. BEN AND EMMA'S HOME - KITCHEN - MORNING

           Ben walks in to see Emma cooking pancakes. 

                                 BEN
                        Don’t you have work?

                                 EMMA
                        I’ll get to the office eventually.

           Ben smiles big and embraces Emma from behind. 

                                 BEN
                        Wow.  Maybe the trip did affect us. 

           Emma looks out the window and sees a neighborhood Mom cursing 
           as she wrestles her kids into a minivan. 

                                 EMMA
                        I think you’re right. 

           EXT. EMMA AND BEN'S HOUSE - DAY

           Emma stands by Ben’s car in the driveway.

                                 BEN
                       (seductive)
                        Baby-making tonight...

                                 EMMA
                        I’ll be ready!

           Ben pulls out, waving. Emma waves back. Once he’s gone...

           She runs inside and throws off her robe, revealing a SLUTTY-
           ASS outfit. She ain’t going to no work; she going out. 

           “Wild Emma” Montage:

           -- Emma takes pen to paper, crafting a NEW LIST.

           -- INSERT: PRE-BABY BUCKET LIST, #179. Sake Bombs

           -- A headband wearing Emma yells “Ich, ni, san” and drops a 
           sake bomb. Pounding it, she raises her hands and howls 
           victoriously. REVEAL the UPSCALE PATRONS looking annoyed.

           -- INSERT: PRE-BABY BUCKET LIST, #104. Get a Tattoo

           -- A Hispanic TATTOO ARTIST draws a butterfly on Emma’s 
           exposed butt cheek. Emma winces, takes a swig of malt liquor. 
           -- Meanwhile... A CAR SALESMAN demonstrates to Ben how a 
           third row of seats fold up in a minivan. Ben smiles. 

           -- INSERT: PRE-BABY BUCKET LIST, #111. Petty Larceny

           -- A buzzed-Emma lowers a ski mask and runs into an 
           Anthropologie store. A moment later, she SPRINTS OUT, arms 
           full of dishware, a fat SECURITY GUARD in hot pursuit.

           -- At EMMA’S OFFICE, Ben drops by with take-out. Emma’s 
           nowhere to be found. He shrugs. 

           -- Emma HOWLS with laughter as she watches an R-rated comedy 
           at a theater. It’s like a scene from CAPE FEAR.

           -- In his KITCHEN, Ben sits at the table; he stares out at 
           the minivan in the driveway.

           INT. EMMA AND BEN’S HOME - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Emma sneaks in through the side door, finding Ben sitting at 
           the table, waiting up for her.

                                 EMMA
                        Ben, some asshole parked their 
                        shitty van in our driveway.

                                 BEN
                        That’s my new car. Traded in the 
                        old Volvo for it, straight up.

                                 EMMA
                        What?

           He pulls her in, sniffing her neck. 

                                 BEN
                        You taste like malt liquor.

                                 EMMA
                        New perfume.

                                 BEN
                        Mmmm... I like it.

           He touches her newly-tattooed ass. She yelps.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        What was that?

                                 EMMA
                        Nothing. We’re just... I don’t want 
                        to rush.

                        I don’t know if my temperature is 
                        right. Let's go out to eat first. 

                                 BEN
                        Okay. Maybe that fondue place?

                                 EMMA
                        Two minutes.

           She limps away. 

           INT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           As Emma puts on makeup, she gets an email. Titled "SECRET 
           PARTY -- TONIGHT". She opens it, pulling up an address. 

           INT. EMMA'S CAR / EXT. SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT

           Emma leads Ben to the front door of a gorgeous suburban 
           house. Kids’ stuff (bikes, balls) strewn across the lawn. Ben 
           tugs on his tie. 

                                 BEN
                        I thought we were going to fondue? 

                                 EMMA
                        I wanted our last big outing to be 
                        extra adventurous.  

           She rings the doorbell. 

                                 BEN
                       (to himself)
                        Fondue is adventurous. 

           ZACK and ELLIE answer the door.

                                 ZACK
                        Are you here for the get-together?

                                 BEN
                        I honestly don’t know. 

                                 EMMA
                        We’re the Kaplans. We RSVP’d...

                                 ELLIE
                        Of course! You look so different 
                        from your photos. Better, I mean.

                                 ZACK
                        Much more muscular.
           Zack winks at Ben. 

                                 ELLIE
                        Come on in, you two.

                                 BEN
                       (whispering)
                        Are we joining a cult?

                                 EMMA
                       (whispering)
                        No! This is a group of like-minded 
                        people I found online-... WHOA!

           They see a COUPLE in masquerade masks FURIOUSLY FUCKING in 
           the corner. 

                                 BEN
                        What the shit is this shit?!

                                 ELLIE
                        Oh, don’t mind the Greenbergs.
                       (loudly teasing)
                        Somebody can't help starting early.

           LATER

           Zack and Ellie show an intrigued Emma and horrified Ben 
           around. Zack points out-

                                 ZACK 
                        Over there's Maria and Chuck. 

           A LATINA MOM gets ORAL from a BALDING DAD. Her BACK TATTOO of 
           a BABY GIRL and the words "MI AMORE" undulates. 

                                 ELLIE
                        Chuck has an endless appetite for 
                        eating you-know-what. Right, Chuck?

           Face down, Chuck waves. Emma and Ben meekly wave back. 

                                 ZACK
                        Wait a darn second. No wonder you 
                        look shocked. We haven't offer hors 
                        d'oeuvres yet!

                                 ELLIE
                        Awful. Can you imagine what my mom 
                        would say if she knew?  

           Ellie points at an URN on a side-table with a picture of an 
           OLD WOMAN. It ROCKS as a couple FUCKS on the couch. With Zack 
           and Ellie distracted, Ben pulls Emma aside.
                                 BEN
                       (whispering)
                        This is an orgy!

                                 EMMA
                       (whispering)
                        It’s not quite what I expected.

                                 BEN
                       (whispering)
                        I expected fondue, Emma. Fondue!

           Zack returns with glasses of wine. Ellie holds a tray of 
           cheeses shaped like little dicks.

                                 ELLIE
                        Who wants cheese? 

                                 EMMA
                        Ben? 

                                 ELLIE
                        Allow me.

           Ellie rubs a penis-cheese along Ben's lips.

                                 BEN
                        Really, I’m good-

           Ellie SHOVES the dick down Ben’s throat. He GAGS. 

                                 ELLIE
                        Oopsy. Too much.

                                 BEN
                        Need some water...

           Ben stumbles down the hallway lined with FRAMED PHOTOS of 
           Ellie and Zack with their KIDS. He stumbles into a DARK 
           BEDROOM and SLAMS the DOOR shut.

           Emma walks over, knocks on the door, trying the handle.

                                 EMMA
                        Ben, what are you doing?

           Ben opens the door, letting her in.

                                 BEN
                        This is just-... I just-... I got 
                        mouth-sexed by cheese.
                                 EMMA
                        Why are you so shocked? We agreed 
                        to this item on the list.  

                                 BEN
                        We were wrong. This is wrong. 

                                 EMMA
                        How are you going to be a dad if 
                        you’re more neurotic than ever? 

                                 BEN
                        Is this your passive-aggressive way 
                        of telling me we’re done?

                                 EMMA
                        I'm doing this for the baby! 

                                 BEN
                        What a fun bedtime story. "Son, 
                        your mom was once fellatioed by a 
                        contractor named Chuck."

                                 EMMA
                        You haven’t had one goddamn 
                        experience in life. What are you 
                        going to teach our kid? 

                                 BEN
                        At least I would BE there. You love 
                        your work more than anything, 
                        except maybe this stupid list. 

                                 EMMA
                        You’re wrong. And I’m not having 
                        this kid until you learn to LIVE. 

                                 BEN
                        You’re never going to be ready. 

                                 EMMA
                        I don’t think you will either. 

           A loaded beat. They’ve grown so far apart. 

           A LITTLE GIRL (5) sits up in the bed, wiping away the sleep.

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        Mommy, is that you?

                                 BEN
                        Okay, I'm done with this.

           Ben storms down the hallway. Runs into Zack.
                                 ZACK
                        There you are! Everyone wants to 
                        see what you're packing down there, 
                        Tiger.

           Ben pushes past Zack but TRIPS over Ellie getting EATEN by 
           CHUCK on a giant Twister mat. 

                                 ELLIE
                        Okay, Ben -- right hand, my 
                        asshole!

                                 BEN
                        Ahhhh!

           Ben leaps up, slipping on a puddle of lube. He runs out of 
           the house, disappearing down the street. 

                                 EMMA
                        Wait! Ben! ...Dammit. 

           EXT. CONVENIENCE STORE PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           Shivering, Ben sits outside a 7-11, dipping pre-cut apples 
           into nacho cheese and drinking from a six-pack. 

           A MINIVAN pulls up. Honks. Ben opens the door, revealing 
           Matthew. Matthew turns down the FROZEN soundtrack. 

                                 MATTHEW
                        You okay? 

                                 BEN
                        Yeah. Thanks for coming.

           EXT. BEN AND EMMA’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Emma awkwardly JERKS the cumbersome car into the driveway. 
           She stares up at her DARK house with a sigh.  

           INT. MATTHEW’S VAN - NIGHT

           Ben stares out the window.

                                 MATTHEW
                        I know you need a distraction right 
                        now. So. Wifey gave me permission 
                        to take you to a... strip club! 

                                 BEN
                        Can we just go to your place? 
                                 MATTHEW
                        Dude.

           INT. BEN AND EMMA’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Emma lies in bed. Her phone BINGS -- a work email. She THROWS 
           the phone across the room. 

           INT. KID’S ROOM AT MATTHEW AND LYDIA’S - NIGHT

           Matthew and Lydia walk Ben into a bright pink room. 

                                 LYDIA
                        Welcome to the former guest room.

                                 MATTHEW
                        You can take either bunk. 

                                 BEN
                        I promise it’s only temporary.

                                 LYDIA
                        Don’t even worry about it.

                                 MATTHEW
                        The kids love bunking with us. 

           RACHEL (4, bubbly girly-girl) sprints by, underwear on head, 
           swinging a pillow.  

                                 RACHEL
                        SLEEPOVER! SLEEPOVER!

           WALTER (7, awkward, earbuds jammed in) chases after. 

                                 WALTER
                        Gimme back my underwear!

           Matthew and Lydia chase after her, leaving Ben all alone. He 
           reaches in his bag and cracks another beer. 

           INT. CINDY'S OFFICE - DAY

           Emma sits before her Mom's desk, ashamed and embarrassed.

                                 EMMA
                        I know I slipped these past few 
                        weeks. I promise it’s all over. 

                                 CINDY
                        Home life can be distracting. 
                                 EMMA
                        You are correct. 

                                 CINDY
                        “Set your boundaries and don’t ever 
                        compromise.” Sun Tzu. Clear?

           Emma opens her mouth to respond -- gag burps.

                                 EMMA
                        Excuse me. Thank you, mom. For 
                        understanding and for still 
                        believing in m-

           Emma gags again, a wave of nausea rising.

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        I’ll-... be right-... back. 

           Emma runs out.

           INT. OFFICE BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Emma sprints into the closest stall and BARFS her guts out.

           A HAND slides under her door holding a wad of toilet paper. 

                                 CINDY (O.S.)
                        Not feeling so hot?

           Emma yelps as Mom's head pokes out under the stall.

                                 CINDY (CONT’D)
                        You can tell me if the pressure is 
                        too much. 

                                 EMMA
                        It’s just food poisoning. 

                                 CINDY
                        I get it. Your father and I had bad 
                        Tom Kum Gai in Samui that nearly 
                        cost me my rectum. 

           Emma HEAVES again. 

                                 EMMA
                       (weakly)
                        I think that’s the last of it.

           As Mom exits...
                                 CINDY (O.S.)
                        Good. I'm just relieved you're not 
                        pregnant.

           Emma looks up as the door closes -- uh-oh.

           INT. EMMA AND BEN'S HOME - BATHROOM - LATER

           Emma sits on the toilet, peeing onto a pregnancy test stick.

                                 EMMA
                       (whispering)
                        Oh-fuck-oh-fuck-oh-fuck-oh-fuck...

           Emma stares at the stick, waiting for the results.

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        Oh-fuck-oh-fuck-oh-fuck-oh-fuck...

           A picture materializes -- a PINK PLUS SIGN.

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        OH, FUCK! 

           She collapses onto the sink for support, overwhelmed.

           INT. CHUCK E. CHEESE - DAY

           Ben floats in the BALL PIT, lifting his arm out of the balls 
           to swig from a bottle of beer. This is rock bottom. 

           Some KIDS wade nearby.

                                 CURIOUS TODDLER
                        Mister? Are you all right? 

           Ben “splashes” him with balls.

                                 BEN
                        Leave me. 

           An EMPLOYEE approaches-

                                 EMPLOYEE
                        Sir, we don’t allow adults in the 
                        ball pit. Or beer.  

                                 BEN
                        Really? What about urination?

           Ben reaches under the surface of the balls. 
                                 EMPLOYEE
                        What? No!

                                 BEN
                        Ahh... Too late.

           The Employee walks away.

                                 EMPLOYEE
                        Fuck this job.

           Ben finishes his beer and throws the bottle. He takes a deep 
           breath, and sinks... falling deeper and deeper... IMPOSSIBLY 
           DEEP, like he’s sinking to the bottom of a ball pit ocean.

           HANDS PLUNGE in the balls and PULL him to the surface. 

           He GASPS as his eyes focus on EMMA. 

                                 BEN 
                        How did you find me?! 

                                 EMMA
                        Matthew told me you were coming 
                        here. Alone.  

                                 BEN
                        I always thought I’d take my kid 
                        here. Oh, well.

           He sinks again, but she grabs him. 

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Let me go!

                                 EMMA
                        Listen to me! I’m pregnant.

                                 BEN
                        What?

                                 EMMA
                        Three weeks. 

           Ben sits up more fully, stunned.

                                 BEN
                        The fucking Pre-Seed Night...

                                 EMMA
                        You don’t have to say or do 
                        anything. I’m taking care of it. 
                                 BEN
                        Taking care-... WAIT, you’re 
                        aborting him? Her, whatever?

                                 EMMA
                        It’s a burden we don't need. 

                                 BEN
                        Let’s think carefully about this-

                                 EMMA
                        We’ve thought about this ever since 
                        we got married. You know we’ll 
                        never be ready.

                                 BEN
                        Why would you say that?

                                 EMMA
                        Look at us!

           Emma gestures to Ben -- covered in his own piss in a Chuck E. 
           Cheese ball pit. 

                                 BEN
                        We can handle this together.

                                 EMMA
                        No. You were right. I can’t 
                        sacrifice me for something else. 
                        That’s just who I am. And this...
                       (gesturing at him)
                        This is who you are. 

                                 BEN
                        I don’t want to give up. 

                                 EMMA
                        It was never going to work, Ben. 
                        I'm sorry.

           As Ben watches her go, he notices...

           ... PARENTS and CHILDREN together. Moments of affection and 
           frustration, pain and happiness. None of it will ever be his. 

           Ben sinks down, letting himself drown in the ball pit.

           INT. EMMA’S OFFICE - AFTERNOON

           Emma speaks on the phone.
                                 EMMA
                        Yes... July 23rd... two weeks. 
                        Thanks. 

           She hangs up and puts an appointment in her computer. She 
           sighs away tears before diving back into work.

           Ben stumbles to avoid a collision and trips over his own 
           skates. He lies in a heap while the opposing team scores. 
           Alan watches his son with concern.  

           LATER

           Ben and Alan pack up their gear after the loss.

                                 ALAN
                        What happened out there? 

                                 BEN
                        I know! I cost you the game-

                                 ALAN
                        I don't give two shits about the 
                        game. I want to know what happened 
                        out there to you. My son.

                                 BEN
                        So you really care? 

                                 ALAN
                        Of course. Don’t you know that?

                                 BEN
                        I'm not sure I know anything. 

                                 ALAN
                        Ben... when your mother passed, I 
                        was devastated. I had just been 
                        drafted to the Kings. Suddenly, the 
                        Doctor tells me the love of my life 
                        is gone and hands me this newborn. 
                        And I’m thinking, “This isn’t how 
                        it was supposed to go.” I was 
                        afraid.  

                                 BEN
                        You were? 

                                 ALAN
                        There were ten million ways I could 
                        have ruined you.

                                 ALAN (CONT'D)
                        And I thought about every one of 
                        them. But then, you smiled. And 
                        nothing else mattered to me. I’d 
                        bear all that pain and sacrifice 
                        again and again to see you smile. 
                        Trust me, Ben. It was worth it. 

           EXT. STARBUCKS - AFTERNOON

           Emma fake smiles at her girlfriends playing with their kids. 
           She pulls out her Blackberry, distracting herself with work. 

           EXT. HOCKEY RINK - PARKING LOT - DAY

           Ben hurls his hockey equipment into his car when he sees-

           A YOUNG DAD teaching his SON (4) to ride a bike. The bike 
           teeters. Young Dad comforts his frightened son with a hug.

                                 YOUNG DAD
                        It’s okay if you fall. Just get 
                        back up and see it through. 

           Ben’s face lights up. Inspiration strikes!

                                 BEN
                        Yes!

           Young Dad notices Ben staring and ushers his son away. 

           Ben waves apologetically and jumps in the car.

           INT. OFFICE - NIGHT

           In the glass-walled conference room, an exhausted-looking 
           Emma and Cindy sit at the head of a table of BOARD MEMBERS.

                                 EMMA
                        I’m not ready to give up on this 
                        deal.

                                 WHINY BOARD MEMBER
                        It’s 9PM. 

                                 CINDY
                        You have a date?  

                                 WHINY BOARD MEMBER
                        Just hoping to tuck my kids in.
                                 EMMA
                        We all have to make sacrifices.

                                 CINDY
                        Love that fire. Emma, why don’t you 
                        take us through the deal points?

                                 EMMA
                        As I was saying-

           HONK-HONK! Heads turn OUTSIDE, where Ben stands next to his 
           Minivan, holding two giant to-go bags.

                                 BEN
                        Crab legs!

           Emma looks mortified. 

                                 CINDY
                        Is that your husband?

                                 EMMA
                        I think it's a vagrant.

                                 BEN
                        Emma!!! EMMMMAAA!

                                 CINDY
                        He’s saying, "Emma".

                                 EMMA
                        I heard "Mecca". Could be a call to 
                        worship. Let’s push through-   

                                 BEN
                        Emma Kaplan! Em! Ma! Kap! Lan!

           Emma lowers her head. 

                                 EMMA
                        Excuse me.

           Cindy is NOT amused.

           EXT. OFFICE - EVENING

           Emma storms out. Ben drops the bag of crab.  

                                 EMMA
                        I'm in the middle of the most 
                        important meeting of my life!
                                 BEN
                        Is it done?! Am I too late?!

                                 EMMA
                        We started hours ago...

                                 BEN
                        Not the meeting! Your-... Our baby.
                        (whispering)
                        THE ABORTION.

                                 EMMA
                        No. Not yet. 

           Ben pulls her into a hug.

                                 BEN
                        Thank you! Thank you. 

           Emma sees Cindy watching through the conference room window, 
           frustrated. 

                                 EMMA
                        I have to go. 

                                 BEN
                        Wait. Please. 

                                 EMMA
                        Ben. This isn’t going to work.  

                                 BEN
                        Just hear me out.

                                 EMMA
                        We’re not meant for this-

                                 BEN
                        I have a way to fix everything-

                                 EMMA
                        What is there to say? 

                                 BEN
                        A lot, if you just LISTEN! PLEASE!

           Emma stops. Whoa. Ben has grown a pair.

                                 EMMA
                        Okay. Two minutes. 

                                 BEN
                        Okay.
                        (clears his throat)
                                 (MORE)
                                 BEN (CONT'D)
                        Okay. We tried riding a bike, 
                        right? Metaphorically. And we fell 
                        off and skinned our knees up pretty 
                        bad. But we can’t just quit bikes. 
                        Then what? Ride the bus? How does 
                        that even fit into the metaphor? It 
                        doesn't. What we have to do is take 
                        off the training wheels and ride 
                        like big boys. Metaphorically.

           Emma looks baffled. Ben unfolds a piece of paper. 

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Read this.  

                                 EMMA
                        “CPR”... “Get our finances in 
                        order”... What is this?

                                 BEN
                        This is the list we should have 
                        been making.

                                 EMMA
                        None of this will prove we’re 
                        ready.

                                 BEN
                        I know. So at the end of this list, 
                        we’ll give ourselves a final test:  
                        sacrificing a weekend to babysit 
                        Matthew and Lydia’s kids.

                                 EMMA
                        Whoa. 

                                 BEN
                        We've fought strippers, we've taken 
                        drugs, we've pooped on each other; 
                        we can do this. 

           Emma thinks it over, torn but not fully convinced.

                                 EMMA
                        I have my appointment in two weeks. 
                        Everything’s timed out with work- 

                                 BEN
                        We don’t quit in this family.

           He offers Emma a crab leg. She considers it... and grabs the 
           leg. CRACKS it in half.
                                 EMMA
                        I’m in. Where do we start? 

           EXT. MATTHEW AND LYDIA'S HOME - FRONT DOOR - DAY

           Emma helps Ben carry his bag to the front door, Lydia and 
           Matthew watching. 

                                 BEN
                        Your house is yours again.  

                                 LYDIA
                        Maybe Matthew and I can get back to 
                        some much needed special time. 

                                 EMMA
                       (suggestively)
                        Oh, yeah?

                                             LYDIA
                    MATTHEW
           She means doing the laundry. 
                                    I mean doing the laundry. 

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        We got you something to say thanks 
                        for letting Ben stay here. 

           She hands Lydia a GIFT CARD.

                                 BEN
                        That's a gift card for a spa 
                        weekend at the Ritz downtown. 

                                 LYDIA
                        Is this supposed to be some kind of 
                        sick joke?

                                 MATTHEW
                       (sotto)
                        Oh, shit. 

                                 LYDIA
                        I mean, how clueless can you be? 
                        Unlike you, we can’t just trek off 
                        onto some whimsical adventure! You 
                        think we can lock our kids in the 
                        house with a working toilet and 
                        pizza money?!

                                 MATTHEW
                        I left them alone for five minutes 
                        yesterday so I could dump. 
                        They broke her menorah. 
                                 LYDIA
                        A Jonathan Adler! So thanks a lot 
                        for bringing your bucket of fried 
                        chicken to the set of "Biggest 
                        Loser," but go fuck yourself!

                                 BEN
                        Guys! Relax! We’re gonna watch your 
                        kids over the weekend while you go.

                                 LYDIA
                        Are you serious? 

                                 MATTHEW
                        Three kids, dude. The difficulty 
                        increases exponentially. 

                                 LYDIA
                        You think you’re ready for that?

                                 EMMA
                        No. 

           Ben holds up the list.

                                 BEN 
                        But we will be. 

           INSERT: PARENTHOOD PREP LIST, 1. Baby CPR

           -- Emma and Ben stand amongst PREGNANT COUPLES in a COMMUNITY 
           CENTER CONFERENCE ROOM. The enthusiastic male INSTRUCTOR 
           guides Emma's hand as she sweeps her fingers inside the mouth 
           of a baby-sized CPR DUMMY.

           -- The sweep-move isn't working! Ben grabs the baby, 
           performing the compressions as the Instructor screams... 

           -- A sweating Ben performs CPR on the baby, bringing it back 
           to life.  

           -- The Instructor smiles and places a "CPR CERTIFIED" sticker 
           on Ben’s shirt. Emma beams. 

           INSERT: PARENTHOOD PREP LIST, 2. Baby-Proof the House

           Ben and Emma look at a baby-proofing website. 

                                 EMMA 
                        We really have to do this? 

           Ben shows her a horrifying picture of babies gauging eyeballs 
           on sharp corners. He lowers the tablet revealing their home 
           is IDENTICAL to the Dangerous House.
                                 BEN 
                        Our house is a deathtrap.

                                 EMMA 
                        Maybe we can change a few things. 

           -- Emma shoves a styrofoam corner onto a coffee table.

           -- Ben latches a safety-lock onto the toilet lid.

           -- Emma installs a baby-gate at the top of the staircase; Ben 
           installs one at the bottom.

           -- Ben moves her meticulously arranged topiary of cactus 
           plants into their STORAGE ROOM. Emma stews. 

           -- Emma boxes up Ben’s violent video games. He stews. 

           -- Emma shake her head as Ben moves her standing mirror.

           -- Ben watches somberly as Emma pulls down a vintage poster 
           of Claudia Schiffer. He rolls it up reverently.

                                 BEN
                        Goodbye, Claudia. 

           -- They slide the poster into a packed storage room.

           -- Ben shuts the door and Emma padlocks it. They look around 
           at the baby-proofed house. 

                                 EMMA
                        It’s kinda empty. 

                                 BEN
                        Let’s fill it. 

           He holds up a brand new COSTCO card. Gold Club. 

           INSERT: PARENTHOOD PREP LIST, 3. Gear Up

           -- COSTCO doors open in SLO-MO, cueing “A Milli” by Li’l 
           Wayne. Ben and Emma flash their Gold Card at the BOUNCER and 
           make their entrance.

           -- Emma makes it rain BABY WIPES into the cart.  

           -- Ben slam dunks plastic tubs of cheese sticks and apple 
           sauce into the cart. Celebration dance.  

           -- Ben grabs Emma’s cell phone away and hands her a CHEESE & 
           CRACKER sample.
           -- Emma tosses baby Tylenol and baby cough medicine in the 
           cart. Ben lugs over a "Home Defibrillator Kit". Emma shakes 
           her head "no". 

           -- The CASHIER rings them up. $700 bucks! Ben points at their 
           savings of $63. They fist-bump. 

           -- Emma and Ben push the cart outside while DOUBLE-FISTING 
           pizza and hot dogs.

           The music cue abruptly FADES as they STOP and look around. 

                                 EMMA
                        You remember where we parked? 

           Ben hits the PANIC button on his keys. In the distance, their 
           MINIVAN beeps. Music cues BACK UP in as they PIMP WALK away.

           INT. BEN AND EMMA’S HOUSE - FRONT DOOR - NIGHT

           The doorbell rings -- DING-DONG. Ben and Emma are already at 
           the door, staring through the peep hole. 

                                 EMMA
                        Look at all of them.

           DING-DONG. DING-DONG. DING-DONG!

                                 LYDIA (O.S.)
                       (outside)
                        Rachel! Knock it off.

                                 BEN
                        Do it fast. Like a Band-Aid. 

           Emma nods and rips open the door, revealing-

           Lydia and Matthew with their children: Walter, Rachel and 
           baby BECCA (1, precious bundle of joy). 

                                 LYDIA
                        Look at your place.

                                 EMMA
                        Look at all of you.

                                 BEN
                        High-fives!

           He raises his hand. Rachel jumps back, hiding.

                                 RACHEL
                        Mommy! 
                                 MATTHEW
                        They just need to warm up.  

                                 BEN
                       (re: his high-five)
                        Putting this away. Into the pocket. 

                                 LYDIA
                        Walt, go with Rachel in the house 
                        while we unload. 

           Walt GROANS as he runs after his screaming sister.

                                 MATTHEW
                        And don’t let her lick the wall 
                        sockets. 

                                 BEN
                        She does that? 

                                 MATTHEW
                        Rarely. 

           EXT. BEN AND EMMA'S HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - NIGHT

           Ben and Matthew haul luggage, loaded up like suburban 
           Sherpas. Lydia guides Emma through an itemized BINDER of 
           materials.

                                 LYDIA
                        Here are their weekend activities.

                                 EMMA
                        This looks like Obama’s day 
                        planner.

                                 LYDIA
                        They crave order. 

                                 MATTHEW
                        And sugar. 

                                 LYDIA
                        But NEVER give Rachel sugar.

                                 BEN
                        Not even a little?  

                                 MATTHEW
                        It’s like feeding a Gremlin after 
                        midnight. 
                                 EMMA
                        It says here bedtime is at 8PM? 

                                 LYDIA
                        You really should start the 
                        brushing and combing around 7, 
                        though. Because of the wrangling.  

                                 EMMA
                        No sugar; 8PM. We got this. 

                                 LYDIA
                        You guys are the best. 

                                 BEN
                        It’s just a weekend. 

           Matthew pulls Ben into a tight hug, whispering in his ear.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Thank you. 

                                 LYDIA
                        Okay, Becca, here you go.

           Lydia hands her to Emma. Becca EXPLODES into tears.

                                 EMMA
                        Oh, my god. I should get her 
                        something, right?

                                 LYDIA
                        No-no-no. Let her cry it out. 

           Lydia and Matthew lean in the front door.

                                 MATTHEW
                        Rachel, Walt, we’re leaving.

                                 LYDIA
                        Behave, goddammit! 

           Lydia and Matthew exit. The door SLAMS shut, the sound 
           echoing with finality. 

           INT. BEN AND EMMA'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Emma turns off the TV and collapses on the couch next to a 
           passed out Walt and Rachel. Ben tiptoes downstairs and joins 
           her. Their house is now a disaster area. 

                                 BEN
                        All right, Becca’s finally asleep.
                                 EMMA
                        I don’t know how we’ll make it 
                        through tomorrow. 

                                 BEN
                        We will. Look how cute they are.

           Ben and Emma take in the kids, sleeping peacefully. Until- 

           RACHEL BOLTS UPRIGHT, SCREAMING! 

           Ben and Emma LEAP back, screaming!

                                 RACHEL
                        THERE’S A MONSTER!

                                 BEN
                        Where? 

                                 EMMA
                        I don’t know! I don’t know!

           Rachel SCREAMS again! Then PASSES OUT.  

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        What. The FUCK was that?

                                 BEN
                        I don’t want to panic you. But I 
                        think she’s possessed.

                                 EMMA
                        Hang on.

           Emma flips through the binder... finding: 

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        She gets night terrors. 

                                 BEN
                        Should we tie her down? 

           From upstairs, the sound of BAWLING.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Dammit. 

           INT. BEN AND EMMA'S HOUSE - GUEST BEDROOM - NIGHT 

           Emma rocks a WAILING Becca. Ben paces. 

                                 EMMA
                        What are we doing?
                                 BEN
                        Pull it together.

                                 EMMA
                        She won’t stop, and I have to work!

                                 BEN
                        Let me try something.

           Ben gently takes Becca, gliding her into his arms with 
           proper, baby-class technique. But then he stalls out.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        I don't know any lullabies.

                                 EMMA
                        ABC’s? Twinkle-Twinkle... did you 
                        not have a childhood?!

                                 BEN
                        I’m under pressure here!

                                 EMMA
                        Just sing a song with "baby" in it.

                                 BEN
                        Ummmm... okay. Got one.
                       (singing softly)
                        YOU KNOW YOU LOVE ME
                        I KNOW YOU CARE
                        JUST SHOUT WHENEVER
                        AND I'LL BE THERE

           Becca calms.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        ...It’s working.

                                 EMMA
                       (joining in softly)
                        YOU ARE MY LOVE
                        YOU ARE MY HEART
                        AND WE WILL NEVER, EVER, EVER 
                        BE APART. AND I WAS LIKE-

                        I THOUGHT YOU'D ALWAYS BE MINE...

           Becca’s fallen fast asleep on Ben’s shoulder.
                                 BEN
                       (whispering)
                        Look what we did.

                                 EMMA
                        How can something so annoying be so 
                        cute?

                        Evolutionary tactic. Thanks for the 
                        assist.

           It's a tender moment... until Walt walks past the door.

                                 WALTER
                        Lame.

                       (whisper shouts)
                        Go to bed!

           INT. BEN AND EMMA'S HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - DAY

           The alarm BLARES -- 6:00am.

           Ben and Emma roll out of bed and check on Becca in her crib -- 
           they recoil and cover their faces. 

                                 BEN
                        She exploded.

                                 EMMA
                        It’s like a Venezuelan mudslide.

                                 BEN
                        Nothing we haven’t dealt with 
                        before.

           EXT. BEN AND EMMA’S HOUSE - BATHROOM - DAY

           Ben and Emma SPRAY Becca off with a HOSE. 

                                 BEN
                        And lift.

           They flip Becca with coordination. 

                                 EMMA
                        There’s still some in her hair.

           More spraying as BECCA giggles. 
           INT. BEN AND EMMA'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

           Walter sulks in and joins Ben at the breakfast table. 

                                 BEN
                        I’ll make you some cereal.

                                 WALTER
                        I got it.

           Ben watches as Walter clumsily dumps a Costco-size box of 
           Cheerios all over the table.

                                 BEN
                        Maybe I can help with the milk?

                                 WALTER
                        I’m not a baby.

                                 BEN
                        I understand. Sometimes, we need to 
                        take on new challenges...

           Ben trails off as Walter tips the heavy gallon jug into his 
           overflowing bowl. Milk pours everywhere.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        That’s okay. Nothing to cry over...

           Walter puts in his headphones and eats. 

           Ben sighs and eats his cereal DRY.

           Emma RUSHES IN, clapping with enthusiasm.  

                                 EMMA
                        Kids are up, van’s packed.  
                        Everything’s running on time. 

                                 BEN
                        Wait -- where’s Rachel? 

                                 EMMA
                        Rachel? She was right-...

           Emma’s eyes go wide. 

           INT. BEN AND EMMA'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY

           Ben and Emma frantically search the house. 

                                 BEN/EMMA
                        Rachel! 
                                 BEN
                        What if she was taken? I have to 
                        find her, I have to save her!

                                 EMMA
                        Who are you, Liam Neeson?

           Emma hears GIGGLING from the closet. She signals Ben. They 
           silently approach the closet...

                                 BEN
                        Rachel... ?

           Doors BURST open! Rachel CHARGES out laughing and RAMS 
           herself into Ben’s nuts. 

           Ben flies back and SLAMS his head on a coffee table as Rachel 
           TEARS out of the room.

                                 EMMA
                        Are you concussed?

           Ben points at the styrofoam corner. 

                                 BEN
                       (with wonder)
                        The baby-proofing saved me. 

                                 EMMA
                        Good. Hold these. 

           Emma throws Ben her shoes and BOLTS out of the room. 

           INT. VAN - PARKED - DAY

           Emma throws a KICKING Rachel into the van. She LOCKS her into 
           her seat with the safety belt. 

                                 EMMA
                       (out of breath)
                        I ran a half-marathon in under two 
                        hours; you ain’t there yet. 

           Emma SLAMS the door. 

           MOMENTS LATER

           Ben hops into the driver’s seat, and adjusts the mirror to 
           address Emma and the kids. 

                                 BEN
                        Ladies and gentleman, this is your 
                        Captain speaking.

                        headwinds, so we need to move fast 
                        today. If anyone needs to use the 
                        restroom, the seats are water-
                        proof. 

           Walter groans. 

                                 EMMA
                        Dad-jokes? 

                                 BEN
                        Getting into character.

           He slides on a pair of BLUEBLOCKER sunglasses and backs out 
           of the driveway SLOWLY.

           EXT. SOCCER FIELD - DAY 

           Emma SCREAM-CHEERS like a maniac as Rachel KICKS a goal.

           LATER

           Ben hands out orange slices and Capri Suns. 

           INT. GYMBOREE - DAY

           Ben and Emma sit in a circle with the kids, playing maracas 
           and singing "Let It Go". 

           LATER

           Exiting, Ben and Emma run into orgy-hosts Zack and Ellie.

                                 ZACK/ELLIE
                        Hey!

                                 ZACK
                        You come here, too? How funny. You 
                        know, we should do a playdate.

                                 BEN/EMMA
                        NO.

           EXT. TOYS-R-US - DAY

           The group walks in, Emma checking her shopping list.

           LATER
           Rachel SPRINTS out the front door -- escape attempt! -- 
           THWAP! She’s SNAPPED back to Ben’s wrist by a backpack LEASH. 

           INT. MINIVAN - PARKED - DAY

           Emma packs up the Toys-R-Us purchases, while Ben hunches over 
           Rachel, applying sunscreen.

           Ben finishes and joins Emma up front. 

                                 EMMA
                        All set? 

                                 BEN
                        No way that kid’s getting skin 
                        cancer. 

           Emma looks back -- Rachel’s face DRIPS with sunscreen. 

                                 RACHEL
                        I’m covered in mayonnaise. 

                                 EMMA
                        Let’s get to that pool party.

           She jacks up the radio, and smiles at Ben. 

           Ben reaches for her hand-

           Emma’s phone RINGS -- incoming from "MOM".

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        I gotta take this. 

                                 BEN
                        She can’t. It’s Sunday.

                                 EMMA
                        She wouldn’t call unless it was 
                        important.

                                 RACHEL
                        Are we going soon?

                                 BEN
                        Just a minute, sweetie. (To Emma) 
                        More important than this? 

                                 EMMA
                        Maybe. 

           Emma picks up the phone. Intercut with her Mom, frantically 
           exiting an airplane.
                                 EMMA (CONT’D)

                        Airport in fifteen minutes.

                                 EMMA
                        What?

                                 CINDY
                        Client wants us in an hour. I just 
                        landed. We can prep in the car.

                                 EMMA
                        Today is really not a good day.

                                 CINDY
                        The client thinks it’s a good day. 
                        It’s a good day.

                                 EMMA
                        But-

                                 CINDY
                        There’s nothing you and Ben can’t 
                        do another day. Make the right 
                        choice.  

           The call disconnects.

                                 EMMA
                        She needs me right now.

                                 BEN
                        We need you right now. 

                                 RACHEL
                        Auntie Emma, can we go in the big 
                        pool together? 

           Emma’s phone beeps -- a text from MOM: "u coming???" Emma 
           looks up at the kids, all expectation... but...

                                 EMMA
                        I’ll be quick.  

           Emma hops out and slams the door. 

                                 WALTER
                        Can we just go? We’re late. 

                                 RACHEL
                        Let’s go! Let’s go!
           Becca cries. 

                                 BEN
                       (to himself)
                        Be strong.

           EXT. BEVERLY HILLS COUNTRY CLUB - VALET STAND - DAY

           The Minivan SCREECHES to a stop in front of a TEENAGED VALET. 

           Ben OPENS the door. We hear POUNDING, and CHANTING-

                                 WALTER/RACHEL
                        Let’s go! Let’s go! Let’s go!

           And Becca CRYING over it all. The chaos is too much.

           PUSH IN on Ben’s face -- like Mark Wahlberg in that crazy 
           cocaine scene in BOOGIE NIGHTS. 

           HONK! A tanned MIDDLE-AGED BACHELOR in a JET BLACK TESLA 
           yanks Ben back to reality.  

                                 BACHELOR
                        You gonna move?

           Bachelor jumps out of his car.

                                 BACHELOR
                        What’d you say to me, you Manny?

                                 BEN
                        Nothing! Kids, come on!

           INT. BEVERLY HILLS COUNTRY CLUB - DAY

           Ben lugs the gear, kids following. Walter carries a big 
           wrapped gift. 

                                 BEN
                        Please let me help you with that.

                                 WALTER
                        I got it.

           Walt trips and DROPS the gift. Something SHATTERS. 

                                 WALTER (CONT’D)
                        Oops.
           Ben picks up the present.

                        Walt, sometimes you need help from

                                 RACHEL
                        Sneak attack hug!

           Rachel ROCKETS into Ben’s balls. He flies backward and LANDS 
           on the gift, SMASHING it again.

           The kids stand over a moaning Ben. 

                                 BEN
                        Go... to the pool.

           She bursts into tears. Ben slowly closes his eyes.

                                 CINDY (CONT’D)
                        Emma?

                                 EMMA
                        Total focus. Got it.

           Emma's phone BUZZES with another text from Ben -- “Becca just 
           pooped the pool. Do I tell someone?” 

                                 CINDY
                        Are you listening to me? Red light.

                                 EMMA
                        What?

                                 CINDY
                       (pointing at the...)
                        Red light!

           Emma slams the brakes, her face sweaty and pale. 

                                 EMMA
                        Mom, you ever wish you'd let dad's 
                        company go? 

                                 CINDY
                        I wasn’t going to be some useless 
                        house-mom. I needed a purpose.

                                 EMMA
                        Couldn’t you do both? Career woman 
                        and mother? 

                                 CINDY
                        In this life, you have to make 
                        choices. 

           The light turns green, but Emma is frozen.

                                 CINDY (CONT’D)
                        What're you waiting for?

           A beat, as Emma ponders...

                                 EMMA
                        You're right.

           Emma SLAMS the gas and SQUEALS across traffic!
                                 CINDY
                        What the fuck?!

                                 EMMA
                        Change of plans. We’re going to a 
                        pool party.

                                 CINDY
                        What?!

           Emma steps on the gas, hauling ass back to the country club.

           EXT. COUNTRY CLUB - POOL - DAY

           Ben finally gets Rachel back in her harness as the guests 
           sing "Happy Birthday" around a Minecraft cake. 

           Rachel eyes the cake lustily. Checking that Ben is distracted 
           by Becca, Rachel slips back out of her restraints. 

           BEHIND THE CAKE TABLE

           Rachel sneaks up to the cake. She LICKS the frosting. Her 
           eyes pop open. 

                                 RACHEL
                        Oooooh...

           She runs both hands along the side of the cake, shaping the 
           frosting like Swayze in GHOST. SLOM-MO as Rachel SHOVES a 
           handful into her mouth. 

           IN FRONT OF THE CAKE TABLE

           HUNTER, the snotty Birthday Boy, throws a gift aside. 

                                 HUNTER 
                        Next. 

           Ben reaches down and pulls out the big box.

                                 BEN
                        Here’s a little something from 
                        Walter.

                                 HUNTER
                        That geek?

                                 HUNTER'S MOM
                        Hunter!

                                 HUNTER
                        Sorry.
                                 BEN
                        He’s not a geek. Just a late 
                        bloomer. Right, Walter? Walter?

           Ben looks around -- no Walter.

                                 HUNTER
                        My cake!

           Everyone turns to see RACHEL covered in frosting, her eyes 
           POPPED WIDE like a crack addict. 

                                 BEN
                       (sotto voce)
                        Dear God...
                       (then)
                        Rachel, honey, did you eat that?

                                 RACHEL 
                        It’s MINE! 

           She grabs a huge chunk and SPRINTS away. Before Ben can chase- 

                                 HUNTER
                        Hey, look. It’s the geek.

           Everyone turns to see Walter on top of the high-dive 
           platform, tentatively scooting towards the edge.

                                 BEN
                        Walter! You can’t swim!

                                 WALTER
                        Yes, I can!

           Walter scoots closer... and tumbles.

                                 BEN
                        Walter!

           Walter screams as his bathing suit catches on the edge. He 
           dangles by his shorts.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Don't move, Walter! I'm coming!

           Ben sprints and GRABS Rachel, lassoing her to a fence with 
           the leash. She gnarls like a caged animal. 

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        STAY! PUT! 
           Ben runs toward the high dive. 

                                                  CUT TO:

           EXT. COUNTRY CLUB - VALET STAND - DAY

           Emma screeches to a stop in front. She jumps out.

                                 CINDY
                        Don’t fuck your future. 

                                 EMMA
                        I promise, I’m not.

           She flicks the CHILD-SAFETY lock, trapping Cindy in the car. 

                                 CINDY
                        Emma! 

           Emma runs inside. 

           EXT. COUNTRY CLUB - POOL - DAY

           Ben scales the ladder up the high-dive.

                                 BEN
                        Jesus, this is endless.

           Riiip -- Walter’s shorts tear precariously.

                                 WALTER
                        Help me!

                                 BEN
                        I'm coming. Just don’t look down.

                                 WALTER
                        I already did. It’s so high. 

                                 BEN
                        Is it?

                                 WALTER
                        Yes.

           Ben pauses. Looks down. Freezes.

                                 BEN
                        Oh, fuck, it’s like a million feet!

                                 WALTER
                        I know.
           Ben gags with vertigo. 

                                 BEN
                        Okay. I'm gonna puke real quick and 
                        then save you.

           Riiiiiiip.

                                 WALTER
                        Help!

                                 BEN
                       (gagging)
                        Okay, almost there.

           Ben shimmies over the top, sweating hard.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Here I come-

           Walter’s shorts RIP. 

           Time SLOWS DOWN as Ben LUNGES... 

           And GRABS Walter’s waist band, giving Walt the world’s worst 
           wedgie. The crowd moans.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        I gotcha, buddy. Now we just head 
                        back down...

           Ben looks down again. Blanches. Hugs the board.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        I can't do this.

                                 EMMA (O.S.)
                        Yes, you can, you pussy.

           Ben cranes his head to find Emma crawling up behind him.

                                 BEN
                        You’re here!

                                 EMMA
                        I told you I would be. 

                                 WALTER
                       (whimpering)
                        It hurts...

                                 EMMA
                        We gotta save Walt’s asshole! We 
                        have to jump.
                                 BEN
                        I don’t jump!

                                 EMMA
                        We’ll do it tandem style. Gimme 
                        your hand.

                                 BEN
                        I can't let go.

                                 EMMA
                        Yes, you can, Ben. I’m right here 
                        with you. 

           Ben nods, and reaches out... Fingers locking with Emma’s.

                                 EMMA (CONT’D)
                        On the count of three, we’re gonna 
                        jump. Ready? One... two...

                                 BEN
                        Oh, my god, the adrenaline... I 
                        think I’m cracking a fat.

                                 EMMA
                        Perfectly normal. Three! 

           Ben PUSHES off the edge. 

           He, Walt, and Emma FREE-FALL! Their bodies tumble toward the 
           water, Walter accidentally flipping into a half-gainer. 

           They SPLASH into the pool, DOUSING the guests.

           Ben pops up, gasping -- Emma pulls him from the water. Walt 
           is already out of the pool, his friends gathered around him, 
           cheering and patting him on the back.

                                 HUNTER
                        Dude, that shit was sick.

                                 HUNTER’S MOM
                        Hunter! 

                                 BEN
                        Walt, you okay?

                                 WALTER
                       (big smile)
                        Fuck yes.

                                 BEN/EMMA
                        Walter!
           EXT. BEVERLY HILLS COUNTRY CLUB - DAY

           Cindy pounds the window with her shoe until a VALET notices 
           and opens the door. Cindy shoves past him, storming inside.

           A familiar car pulls up -- Matthew and Lydia emerge.

           EXT. POOL - DAY

           Ben towels Emma off. 

                                 EMMA
                        So, I guess I didn’t miss anything?   

                                 BEN
                        Nah. Just me ruining the kids.

                                 EMMA
                        They look alright to me.

           Emma nods to indicate: Walt hanging with his buddies, Rachel 
           passed out peacefully against a fence, Becca sucking happily 
           on Emma’s cell phone.

                                 BEN
                        What about your job? 

                                 EMMA
                        Mom will get over it. 

                                 CINDY (O.S.)
                        HEY!

           Cindy SHOVES through the crowd, fuming.

                                 CINDY (CONT’D)
                        You gave up on your father's legacy 
                        for a fucking birthday party!

                                 EMMA
                        It’s a Minecraft party, mom. It’s 
                        kind of a big deal.

                                 CINDY
                        You’re not thinking clearly. 

                                 EMMA
                        I’ve never thought more clearly in 
                        my life. 

                                 CINDY
                        Sweetheart, I’m trying to save you 
                        from yourself. You need to-
                                 BEN
                        HEY!

           Cindy stops. All heads turn to him.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        That was your choice, Cindy, and 
                        that's fine. But we want this. All 
                        of this. And if you want to be a 
                        part of it, then you better SHAPE 
                        UP! Got it?!

           Cindy nods, stunned.

                                 BEN (CONT’D)
                        Thank you. 

                                 EMMA
                       (whispering)
                        What was that? 

                                 BEN
                       (whispering)
                        I don’t know. Was that too-

           Emma pulls Ben into a huge kiss.

                                 WALTER/RACHEL
                        Mom! Dad!

           Matthew and Lydia run out and embrace their children. 

                                 EMMA
                        You’re early.

                                 MATTHEW
                        We missed the kids. 

                                 LYDIA
                        Plus, we "woo-hoo'ed" right when we 
                        got there, so we're covered for 
                        another three months. Did Walter 
                        swim in the pool?

                                 BEN
                        I can explain- 

                                 EMMA
                        It’s my fault- 

                                 MATTHEW
                        What's to explain? I’ve never seen 
                        them happier. 
                                 LYDIA
                        Whatever you did, keep doing it. 
                        You’ll be parents of the year. 

           Ben and Emma look at each other.  

                                 BEN
                        You think we’re ready? 

                                 EMMA
                        Yeah. We’re ready.  

                                            FADE TO BLACK.

           SUPER: Eight months later...

           INT. HOSPITAL - DELIVERY ROOM - DAY

           The DOCTOR and NURSES attend to Emma as she screams from the 
           delivery bed.

                                 DOCTOR
                        I can see the head.

           Ben leans in. FLASH! He takes a selfie next to the crowning. 

                                 EMMA
                        What are you doing?! 

                                 BEN
                        Savoring every moment. 

                                 EMMA
                        Stop savoring! Get the FUCK in 
                        there and pull it out! 

                                 DOCTOR
                        One more push!

           Emma screams! Ben screams! As the noise and chaos crescendos-

                                              HARD CUT TO:

           MINUTES LATER

           The still aftermath. The BABY rests in Emma and Ben's arms, 
           cooing. 

           Emma and Ben look up at each other, tears in their eyes. 
                             Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 EMMA
                        It was worth it.

                                 BEN
                        Totally.

           Cue up “Baby” by Justin Bieber.

                                            FADE TO BLACK.

           THE END.
