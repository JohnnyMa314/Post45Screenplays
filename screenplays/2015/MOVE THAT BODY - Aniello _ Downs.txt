           INT. CAMPAIGN OFFICE - DAY

           In a small, kind of dingy campaign office, a large banner 
           reads: "JESSICA ANGELO FOR CITY COUNCIL". Five "staffers" 
           (unpaid interns) mill about. JESS (29, cool, charming) sits 
           in her cramped office. She talks on a landline (lol).

                                 JESS
                        A free after-school youth program 
                        will have a ripple-effect on our 
                        community, on it's economy-- 
                        (listening, then)
                        You're right. I'm the youngest 
                        candidate and I have very little 
                        experience in politics. But that's 
                        exactly why I'll make things 
                        happen.
                        (listening...)

           She fist-pumps the air!

                                 JESS (CONT’D)
                        Thank you.
                        (listening)
                        A photo on Wednesday is great. I'll 
                        start moisturizing tonight. 
                        (then)
                        Off the record.

           She hangs up.

                                 JESS (CONT’D)
                        We got the Tribune's endorsement!

           A "staffer", RAVIV (22) updates a white board.

                                 RAVIV
                        (too loud)
                        HELL YEAH!!!

                                 JESS
                        Jesus, Raviv. Relax. You get credit 
                        for the internship whether we win 
                        or lose.

           Her cell rings. We see it’s ALICE (28, bubbly, Rubenesque). 
           In the pic, she’s tightly hugging Jess, circa 2007.

                                 JESS (CONT'D)
                        Hey Alice.
           INT. CAMPAIGN OFFICE / EXT. SCHOOL PLAYGROUND - INTERCUT

           Alice watches her kindergarten students play on a playground.

                                 ALICE
                        Kaylee, let go of Katniss’ pigtail!
                        (to phone)
                        Hey! So! I’m mentally packing and 
                        wanted to ask: do you think Miami 
                        will be too hot for my thigh high 
                        boots?

                                 JESS
                        How high exactly?

                                 ALICE
                        Well, I wanna cover my psoriasis--

           CALVIN (20s, ginger) rushes in, excited.

                                 CALVIN
                        (showing Jess his phone)
                        Ben Tribley’s been banging the 
                        weather girl from Channel 7, and 
                        dick pics he sent her just leaked!

                                 JESS
                        (looking at the pictures)
                        Holy shit. Why would he do that?

                                 CALVIN
                        I know - it’s career suicide. 

                                 JESS
                        No, I meant because his dick is so 
                        thin. But yes, also that!

                                 CALVIN
                        You're a shoo-in.

                                 ALICE
                        Hello? Jess? Who's got a thin dick?

           REVEAL: a SMALL CHILD on the playground clearly hears this.

                                 JESS
                        Alice, I'll call you back!

                                 ALICE
                        Okay, by--

           Jess hangs up. 
           INT. JESS & PETER’S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Wine is poured through an Aerator by Jess' fiancée PETER (30, 
           cute, great taste, swam at Georgetown). Jess unpacks moving 
           boxes.

                                 JESS
                        Apparently he also dresses as a 
                        baby and they fuck in a crib. 

                                 PETER
                        (joking)
                        They stole our thing!

           Jess laughs. 

                                 JESS
                        To each his, her or shiz own.

                                 PETER
                        (raising his glass)
                        Well, to my future wife and city 
                        councilwoman. 

                                 JESS
                        And to the beginning of our life 
                        together.

           They clink glasses and sip. 

                                 PETER
                        Okay. We do an hour of unpacking, 
                        then we get to watch "Game of 
                        Thrones" until we fall asleep 
                        during the opening credits.

                                 JESS
                        They're so long.

           Peter grabs a frame out of a box.

                                 PETER
                        Where do you want this to go?

           Jess sees what he’s holding: it’s a collage of Jess and her 
           friends from college: crowded together under a bed, smoking 
           from a 7 foot bong that is popping out of the sunroof of an X-
           Terra, at the beach.

                                 JESS
                        Oh, you don’t have to put that up.

                                 PETER
                        Why not?
                                 JESS
                        I dunno... I’d rather put up that 
                        photo of us in Tulum where it looks 
                        like my boobs are super big because 
                        of the weird shadow.

                                 PETER
                        I do love that one.

           Jess’ phone rings. She looks at it: it’s Alice again.

                                 JESS
                        Shit. I forgot to call Alice back.

                                 PETER
                        Get it.

                                 JESS
                        No.
                        (silencing it)
                        I’ll be seeing her all weekend.

           Alice calls AGAIN. Jess groans and silences it again.

                                 JESS (CONT'D)
                        To be honest, I’m not really 
                        looking forward to it.

                                 PETER
                        Yeah right. You don’t have to 
                        pretend your bachelorette won’t be 
                        fun.

                                 JESS
                        Frankie and Blair are going to 
                        argue the whole time, Pippa doesn’t 
                        know the other girls, and you know 
                        I love Alice, but she’s... a lot. 
                        I'd rather hang out with you.

                                 PETER
                        Sorry babe, but I've got my 
                        bachelor party and I'm gonna go 
                        buck wild!
                        (jokingly frontin)
                        Me and my squad gon' go hard.

                                 JESS
                        Oh yeah? 

                                 PETER
                        Ohhhh yeah.

           They kiss.
                                 PETER (CONT'D)
                        Let’s go find a crib and fuck in 
                        it.

           She laughs hysterically.

           EXT. WASHINGTON DC DULLES AIRPORT - CURB SIDE - DAY

           Peter and Jess drive to the airport. As they approach the 
           curb, they see Alice. When she sees their car, she yells:

                                 ALICE
                        IT HAS BEGUN!!!!!!!

                                 JESS
                        (to Peter)
                        Just remembered I forgot ear plugs.

           Alice RUNS towards the car, opens Jess’ door, slaps a PENIS 
           TIARA on her head, grabs Jess’ shoulders and looks into her 
           eyes - DEAD SERIOUS.

                                 ALICE
                        This is it: Your bachelorette 
                        weekend. I’ve been dreaming of this 
                        moment since the first day of 
                        freshman year.

           They hug. Alice squeezes Jess so hard.

                                 PETER
                        Hi Alice.

           Peter hands Jess her suitcase, and he and Jess kiss goodbye.

                                 ALICE
                        Peter, get out of here! She’s mine 
                        now!

           Alice grabs Jess’ suitcase and they exit. A moment later, 
           Jess and Peter re-unite to embrace again and kiss.

                                 ALICE (CONT'D)
                        BARFARONI!

                                 PETER
                        Okay! Okay!

           Peter departs. Jess waves goodbye to him longingly as Alice 
           ushers her into the airport.
                                 ALICE
                        So it suxxx we can’t sit together, 
                        but my aunt hooked me up with the 
                        jump seat. Twenty bucks!

                                 JESS
                        But you have to sit with the 
                        stewardesses, right?

                                 ALICE
                        Get to! And I get my damn fill of 
                        mini-Toblerones.

           Jess laughs and puts her arm around Alice. 

                                 ALICE (CONT'D)
                        This is going to be So. Much. Fun! 
                        I can’t wait to see mah gurls!!!!!!

           MONTAGE-ISH:

           EXT. PROTEST - DAY

           Frankie (28, activist, young Janeane Garofalo, uses Tom's of 
           Maine "deodorant") chants along at a protest. We see signs: 
           “NSA IS EVIL” and “STOP WATCHING ME MASTURBATE!”

                                 FRANKIE
                        Hey hey, ho ho, mass surveillance 
                        has got to go!

           Frankie looks at her phone and leans over to a white girl 
           with dreadlocks:

                                 FRANKIE (CONT'D)
                        I gotta head to the airport. If 
                        anyone disappears from the protest, 
                        text me immediately.

                                 DREADLOCK GIRL
                        (disgusted)
                        You have a cell phone?!

           EXT. NYC - FINANCIAL DISTRICT - DAY

           Blair (29, hedge fund analyst, perfect blowout, dressed in 
           Theory) says goodbye to her 4-year-old, BEN. Her ex-husband, 
           MALCOLM (33) looks on.

                                 BLAIR
                        I’ll come pick you up on Monday 
                        morning, sweetie--
                                 MALCOLM
                        (looking at watch)
                        Technically my time started two 
                        minutes ago.
                        (typing on his phone)
                        Going to note this for the custody 
                        hearing.

           Blair hugs her son, and over his shoulder to Malcolm:

                                 BLAIR
                        (silently mouthing)
                        Suck my dick.

                                 MALCOLM
                        Gonna note that, too.

           INT. AIRPLANE - DAY

           Jess reads from her seat. Alice, in a jump seat, laughs HARD 
           at a movie she’s watching on an iPad on her lap. She sits 
           between two flight attendants who aren’t loving it.

           INT. AIRPLANE - DAY

           Frankie reads “How To Steal Back The American Dream” while 
           she eats free-trade Goji berries.

           INT. AIRPLANE - DAY

           Blair types quickly on her laptop and nods as a steward 
           places two glasses of white wine on her tray.

           END MONTAGE.

           INT. MIAMI AIRPORT - ARRIVAL GATE - DAY

           Jess and Alice de-board.

                                 ALICE
                        There they are!

           ANGLE ON: Blair and Frankie sit together (they’ve been 
           waiting at Jess and Alice’s gate.)

                                 BLAIR
                        Someone keeps signing me up for a

                                 FRANKIE
                        I’m surprised you noticed. I 
                        thought you'd be too busy 
                        destroying the middle class with 
                        sub-prime loans.

                      ALICE
                                                 JESS
           Oh hello-o-o!
                                       Stop arguing!

           They all hug and greet each other.

                                 JESS (CONT'D)
                        (to Frankie)
                        You smell great.

                                 FRANKIE
                        It’s the weed in my bra.

                                 BLAIR
                        (to Alice)
                        What’s on your face?
                        (rubbing Alice’s face)

                                 ALICE
                        That’s a mole, it’s always been 
                        there. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        Jess, please tell me that leather 
                        jacket was sustainably farmed.

                                 JESS
                        (it wasn't)
                        It was.

                                 ALICE
                        Uhh, excusez-a-moi! Do you love my 
                        extensions?!

           She turns around, modeling her hair extensions.

                                 ALICE (CONT'D)
                        Human hair. India. VERY--
                        (rubbing fingers together, 
                         "expensive")

           Everyone’s “ooohs”.

                                 BLAIR
                        Okay. Wine time!
                                 ALICE
                        There's a liquor store 1.2 miles 
                        away, and they have that Simi 
                        Valley cab you like.

                                 BLAIR
                        You always were my favorite.

                                 JESS
                        Honestly, we all look better than 
                        ever.

                                 FRANKIE
                        Very superficial of you... but it's 
                        true.

                                 ALICE
                        Oh my GOD!!! The Wallach 5th floor 
                        girls are together again! I'm 
                        already having so much fun that my 
                        nipples are hard! Look!

           They are. They all laugh. 

                                 ALICE (CONT'D)
                        Enough pillow talk! Let’s roll bbs! 
                        I’m wanna get sunburnt ASAP!

                                 JESS
                        We have to meet Pippa at the 
                        International terminal.

                                 BLAIR/ALICE/FRANKIE
                        (totally forgot)
                        Right. / Yes. / I didn’t forget!

           As they walk away:

                                 ALICE
                        Who want's mini Toblerones? I stole  
                        fifty!

           INT. INTERNATIONAL TERMINAL - LATER

           PIPPA (27, Australian Boho sprite) arrives. Pippa and Jess do 
           a deep sun-spirit-life-force-embrace. Pippa holds Jess's 
           forehead against hers. No words are needed.

                                 JESS
                        Guys, this is Pippa. Pip, this is 
                        Blair, Frankie, and Alice. I can’t 
                        believe this is the first time 
                        you’re all meeting.
                                 PIPPA
                        I just wanna say, you’re all best 
                        friends with Jess, and I’m best 
                        friends with Jess -

           Alice does a ‘say what?’ face.

                                 PIPPA (CONT'D)
                        - so in my book, we’re already best 
                        friends.

                                 ALICE
                        Well, Jess and I were freshman year 
                        roommates, which is actually more 
                        like family, so...

                                 PIPPA
                        Same for semester abroad hosts! 
                        That makes us step-sisters! 
                        Excellent.

                                 JESS
                        (trying to diffuse)
                        This is gonna be great. You know 
                        what? I’ll run ahead and get in 
                        line for a cab.

           Jess leaves.

                                 PIPPA
                        You guys plus me and my chill, laid-
                        back yet swanky vibe is gonna be 
                        the perfect combination - like 
                        Vegemite on bread!

                                 ALICE
                        What’s Vegemite?

                                 PIPPA
                        It’s an Australian treat made of 
                        brown yeast paste! Here! I brought 
                        you all some!

           She takes out a jar of Vegemite and opens it.

                                 ALICE
                        Oof, hun, that went bad.

                                 PIPPA
                        Nope! That’s just the delicious 
                        smell of Vegemite!

                                 ALICE
                        Whoa, you Kiwis are weird.
                                 PIPPA
                        Actually, Kiwis are New Zealanders. 
                        It's actually a slur to 
                        Australians...

                                 ALICE
                        Oh come on, it’s a fruit!
                        (leading the group out)
                        Did you check any bags, Kiwi?

           [NOTE: PIPPA WILL HENCEFORTH BE REFERRED TO AS KIWI.]

           MONTAGE:

           B-Roll of Miami set to Gloria Estefan’s “Conga”: Aerial shots 
           of the beach, very sexual people on rollerblades, people in 
           thongs spiking volleyballs, ET CETERA! YOU GET IT!

           EXT. STREET - DAY

           A taxi pulls up to a gorgeous modern Miami beach front home.

                                 JESS
                        She said we can pick up the keys 
                        from the neighbors...

           They make their way to the house next door. On the neighbor’s 
           door they find a note written in lipstick: “We’re out back!”

           EXT. LEA & PIETRO’S POOL - DAY

           The girls walk around the house to find a couple: PIETRO 
           (40s, mustache) and LEA (40s, hot) sunbathing topless.

                                 JESS
                        Hello? We're here to pick up the 
                        keys for next door?

                                 LEA
                        Oh, hi girls! I’m so sorry, let me 
                        put something on.

           Lea puts on a “top”: a thick rope that barely covers her 
           nipples. The outline of Pietro's dick is very clearly visible 
           in his linen pants. Pietro sees Blair and makes a beeline.

                                 PIETRO
                        (kissing Blair's hand)
                        Enchanté. What brings you ladies to 
                        Miami? Business? Pleasure? The 
                        business of pleasure?
                                 ALICE
                        Bachelorette weekend.
                        (indicating Jess)
                        Jess is getting married!

                                 LEA
                        (wistfully)
                        Ah, monogamy... how retro.

                                 PIETRO
                        Lea!
                        (re: Blair)
                        Doesn’t she remind you of that 
                        French girl from Turks & Caicos?

           Lea checks Blair out as she hands over the keys.

                                 LEA
                        Oh yes! Same body!

                                 BLAIR
                        (ew)
                        Thanks? We’ll try to keep it down.

                                 LEA
                        So will we.

           Pietro winks. The girls head out.

                                 PIETRO
                        Wait!

           He tosses Blair a bottle of Suntan Lotion (SPF 0). He says 
           nothing, smiles and raises his martini glass. The girls, 
           mostly creeped out, leave.

           INT. MIAMI MANSION - DAY

           The girls enter the “Miami modern” house. It’s huge and tacky 
           with lots windows that look out to the pool and beach. (Good 
           bones, but if you bought it, you'd reno the shit out of it.)

                                 ALICE
                        (running, diving on couch)
                        REAL WORLD BABY! This TV is insane!

           Alice tries to turn on the TV. There are six remotes, a full 
           keyboard, and 6 cable boxes. She hits “power” on a remote and 
           a ceiling fan turns on. Alice is already frustrated.

                                 BLAIR
                        I’m opening wine!
           She opens the utensil drawer to find nothing but two spoons.

                                 BLAIR (CONT'D)
                        No corkscrew?

                                 KIWI
                        I got it!

           Kiwi grabs a spoon uses it to push the cork into the bottle. 
           Wine splatters.

                                 JESS
                        Don’t stain the white rug please!

           Blair pours herself a glass, takes a sip and before she can 
           put the drink down, Jess has slid a coaster underneath.

                                 JESS (CONT'D)
                        One of my only donors, Ms. Carney, 
                        very graciously offered us her 
                        beach house for weekend so let's be 
                        really careful, okay?

           Alice wheels over her bag and opens it.

                                 ALICE
                        Guys! Look at this amazing 
                        bachelorette kit I brought. We got 
                        it all: mud masks, handcuffs, penis 
                        straws, penis shot glasses, uhp  -
                        that’s my psoriasis ointment, don’t 
                        know how that got in there--

           They are interrupted when they hear Frankie LAUGH.

           INT. BEDROOM - DAY

           They all run into a bedroom and see her staring at a SEX 
           SWING in the walk-in closet.

                                 ALICE
                        What is that?

                                 FRANKIE
                        A sex swing!

                                 KIWI
                        Kinky.

                                 ALICE
                        Keep it in your pants, Kiwi.
                                 KIWI
                        It's Pippa.

                                 ALICE
                        ("give me a break")
                        Oh eat me out.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER

           The girls are dressed up for dinner. Alice is STILL trying to 
           turn on the TV.

                                 JESS
                        You’re sure it’s plugged in?

                                 ALICE
                        YES! Input should be HDMI1. GOD 
                        DAMMIT! I wish my kindergartners 
                        were here. They can do this shit 
                        with their eyes closed.

           She throws the remote. The TV turns on.

                                 ALICE (CONT'D)
                        Yes! I rock!

           A cab honks outside.

                                 BLAIR
                        Well turn it off, the cab’s here.

                                 ALICE
                        NO WAY! I'll never get it back on. 
                        I'll just leave it on mute.
                        (taking the remote, then)
                        Uch. Where’s the mute button?

           She hits a button and the lights go out.

           INT. MIAMI RESTAURANT - NIGHT (8 PM)

           The girls eat at a hip South Beach restaurant.

                                 BLAIR
                        (to Frankie)
                        I’m not saying I agree with the 
                        Rodney King verdict, I’m just 
                        saying a riot is never the 
                        solution.
                                 FRANKIE
                        A riot is the language of the 
                        unheard. Doctor King.

           ANGLE ON: Kiwi shows Alice photos of a hot shirtless guy.

                                 KIWI
                        It’s been on-again-off again for 
                        awhile. We met when we were both on 
                        X-Factor Australia.

           Alice grabs the phone for a better look.

                                 ALICE
                        THIS is your boyfriend?

                                 KIWI
                        I know, right? In Australia I’m 
                        like an 11. Men go crazy for my 
                        joie de vivre and hygiene. Did you 
                        just text yourself that picture?

                                 ALICE
                        No.

           We hear Alice’s phone receive a text message. Guilty.

           ANGLE ON: Jess is on her phone.

                                 JESS
                        They just released the new polling 
                        projections. I'm up by 6 points--

                                 ALICE
                        Ugh, no more work crap! This is OUR 
                        night!

                                 JESS
                        Okay, okay! Sorry. You’re right.

           Jess puts her phone away. Alice raises her glass.

                                 ALICE
                        Toast! Jess, I can’t believe you’re 
                        getting married. It seems like just 
                        yesterday you were showing me how 
                        to use cover up to hide that cat 
                        scratch on my face and taking me to 
                        the Delta Sig party where I gave my 
                        first foot job.

                                 JESS
                        Can literally never forget.
                                 ALICE
                        Even though we don't see each other 
                        a lot, mostly because you’re so 
                        busy with Peter and the campaign  
                        and picking out paint swatches or 
                        whatever, you’re still my best 
                        friend, and I love you.
                        (holding up glass)
                        To me and Jess!

                                 BLAIR
                        Okay, Alice. You’re cut off. Three 
                        toasts is your limit for tonight.

                                 FRANKIE
                        Be right back.

                                 ALICE
                        Guys, no one responded to the e-
                        mail about which club we should go 
                        to, so I printed out the top 10 
                        from Trip Advisor dot com. 

           Alice pulls out a STACK of printed pages from her purse.

                                 JESS
                        Oh - I was hoping to make it an 
                        early night. I've been swamped at 
                        work and I'm getting photographed 
                        by the Tribune next week, so I'd 
                        love to get some beauty sleep. 

                                 ALICE
                        What?! This is one of the biggest 
                        weekends of our life!

                                 FRANKIE
                        (returning, excited)
                        I just got coke from a busboy.

                                 ALL
                        What?! / No way. 

                                 ALICE
                        (to Jess)
                        Now you won’t be tired! No excuses!

                                 JESS
                        I can't do cocaine! I'm running for 
                        office!
                                 BLAIR
                        First of all, it's city council. 
                        And come on, no one’s going to find 
                        out you did a little coke at your 
                        bachelorette party.

                                 FRANKIE
                        George W. Bush practically bragged 
                        about his cocaine use. It's the one 
                        thing I liked about him!

                                 ALICE
                        I’ve never done it, but ever since 
                        I saw “Yes Man” I’ve been trying to 
                        say yes to more experiences!

                                 KIWI
                        I really prefer more natural drugs, 
                        like mushrooms, peyote, morning 
                        glory seeds... but I’ll try 
                        anything thrice.

                                 JESS
                        I don’t know...

                                 ALICE
                        (guilting her)
                        Come on Jess. I just wanna have fun 
                        with you like we used to. We never 
                        spend any quality time together 
                        anymore.

                                 JESS
                        That's not tr--

                                 ALICE
                        You know it's true. If we do 
                        cocaine together, it would mean so 
                        much to me.

           Off Jess’ sympathetic sigh --

                                                 SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. BATHROOM STALL - MOMENTS LATER

           The girls are crammed into a bathroom stall, doing coke. They 
           snort, spit, and sniffle through the process.

                                 BLAIR
                        It’s so disgusting.
                        (extends her finger)
                        A little more, please.
                                 ALICE
                        OH WOW I LOVE THIS!

                                 KIWI
                        I need a pomegranate juice to get 
                        this--
                        (hacking for soo long)
                        --taste out of my mouth. This is 
                        why you should only do this stuff 
                        rectally...

                                 JESS
                        I’ll go with you.

           Alice rolls her eyes. Frankie makes sure they’re gone.

                                 FRANKIE
                        Let’s get Jess a stripper.

                                 ALICE
                        Nasty! In a good way!

                                 BLAIR
                        I haven’t had a stiff dick pressed 
                        against me in a loooong time. Let's 
                        do it.

                      ALICE
                                             BLAIR (CONT'D)
           YEAH!!!!!!
                                       YEAH!!!!!!

           Some girls in the bathroom yell back as Frankie starts to 
           look up strippers on her phone.

                                 BATHROOM GIRLS
                        YEAH!!!!!!!

                                 ALL
                        YEAH!!!!!!!

           EXT. MIAMI STREET - NIGHT

           The girls walk down Lincoln Boulevard. THEY R TURNT UP EVEN 
           THO THEY HAVE TO GOOGLE WHAT THAT MEANS! They high-five 
           rollerblading women (men?).

           They arrive at CLUB LIV. Alice palms a bouncer and winks at 
           him as they walk in. Reveal she gave him $5. He’s like WTF.

           INT. CLUB LIV DANCE FLOOR - LATER

           They all dance. Alice dances with her butt against a guy.
                                 ALICE
                        I’m a power bottom!

                                 JESS
                        I don’t think you know what that 
                        means!

                                 ALICE
                        Oh yes I do!

           A CREEPSTER dances up on Blair.

                                 BLAIR
                        (yelling over music)
                        Frankie, do you have a tampon? I 
                        need one.

           Frankie nods, and leads Blair away from the Creepster.

                                 KIWI
                        (truly screaming)
                        REGULAR OR SUPER ABSORBENT?

                                 JESS
                        No, no - that’s our code. In 
                        college we would ask each other for 
                        tampons if some dude was creeping 
                        us out and we needed to be saved.

                                 KIWI
                        Oh good. You should all use diva 
                        cups anyway. Way more eco.

           “Glamorous” by Fergie (ft. Ludacris) starts playing.

                                 ALICE
                        YES!!!!

                                 DJ
                        We gotta a special request from 
                        Adam!

                                 ALICE
                        It’s Alice!!!
                        (to Kiwi)
                        This is our song. We won the 
                        freshman floor talent show with our 
                        sick moves. I had to get stretched 
                        out pretty hard afterwards.

                                 JESS
                        I don’t really feel like dancing--
           Alice grabs Jess a reluctant Jess and waves Blair and Frankie 
           over. She makes room in the middle of the dance floor. 

                                 ALICE
                        5, 6, 7, 8 --

           Alice fucking NAILS the choreography, Frankie and Blair kind 
           of know the moves, while Jess struggles to remember. At a 
           climax, Alice throws her hands in the air and falls backwards 
           hitting the floor HARD!

                       ALL
                                                  DJ
           Oh, shit!!!
                                       Oh, shit!!!!

           Jess helps her up. The DJ changes the song. Alice gets up, 
           rubbing the back of her head.

                                 ALICE
                        I think I fractured my skull!!! 

                                 BLAIR
                        You're fine.

                                 FRANKIE
                        It’s not that easy to break a human 
                        skull.

           Kiwi runs over clapping.

                                 KIWI
                        That was so funny! And they say 
                        Americans have no sense of humor!

                                 ALICE
                        Jess, you were supposed to catch 
                        me. It’s ball, change, step, catch!

                                 JESS
                        I’m sorry, I forgot!

                                 FRANKIE
                        It has been a long time Alice.

                                 ALICE
                        But I sent you guys the refresher 
                        video! It took so long to make! My 
                        cat kept ruining the shot and my 
                        psoriasis flared up something 
                        nasty!

                                 BLAIR
                        Would some cocaine make you feel 
                        better?
                                 ALICE
                        YES!

           INT. BATHROOM STALL - MOMENTS LATER

           All the girls are crammed back into a bathroom stall. They 
           all snort a bump at the same time.

                                                   SMASH CUT:

           INT. WINE TASTING - SAME

           Peter and his friends take DEEP SNIFFS of their wine glasses. 
           Anita Baker’s “Caught Up In The Rapture” plays at his 
           bachelor party: a quiet wine tasting.

           Peter’s friends are PATRICK (pretentious foodie), JAKE 
           (slutty), TOBEY (the one with a big heart, his best friend), 
           and JOE (real cheap).

                                 SOMMELIER
                        Montepulciano is planted on much of 
                        the east coast of Italy.

           They are all intrigued/surprised: “hmmmmm”.

                                 SOMMELIER (CONT'D)
                        It’s rebellious and majestic, full, 
                        sharp, inscrutable. What are you 
                        tasting?

                                 TOBEY
                        Black pepper.

                                 PATRICK
                        Forest floor.

                                 JOE
                        It tastes expensive.

                                 JAKE
                        (showing his phone)
                        Does this girl look 18?

           Peter’s phone rings. He takes it and steps aside.

           INT. CLUB / INT. WINE TASTING - INTERCUT

           We join Peter and Jess mid-convo.
                                 JESS
                        (drunk)
                        Babeeee, I love you...this is Jess.

                                 PETER
                        Sounds like you're having fun.
                        It’s pretty wild over here, too. We 
                        just had an Amerone and it was very 
                        spicy. I may have to take a tums.

           Alice grabs Jess by the shoulders.

                                 ALICE
                        (to Jess)
                        Jess!!! Come touch this guys’s six-
                        pack with me! Uch, is that Peter?!
                        (yelling into phone)
                        PETER!!!! She’s ours for tonight! 
                        Say your good-byes motherfucker!!!

                                 PETER
                        Call me when you get home.

                                 JESS
                        I will, I love you--

           They get cut off when Alice presses “end” on her phone.

                                 JESS (CONT'D)
                        Jesus, Alice, I was going to get 
                        off. You didn’t need to do it for 
                        me.

                                 ALICE
                        Okay, geez! The one time we 
                        actually get to hang and you're 
                        talking to your fiancée who you're 
                        obsessed with?! Can you say 'party 
                        foul'? 

           Alice bounces off. Jess, irked, returns to the group.

           INT. UBER - LATER (12 AM)

           The girls are in an Uber SUV driven by Artemis Pebdani (NO WE 
           ARE NOT FLEXIBLE ON THIS CASTING).

                                 ARTEMIS
                        ...but I’m a cool Muslim.

                                 FRANKIE
                        Well, yeah - only extremists aren’t 
                        cool, no matter their faith.
           Blair rolls her eyes. We hear on the radio:

                                 NEWS REPORT (O.S.) 
                        A bank robbery has occurred at the 
                        Wachovia in Coral Gables. Shots 
                        were fired...

                                 ARTEMIS
                        Speaking of fire, ya'll wanna hear 
                        my single with Big Pun? RIP.

                                 KIWI
                        Sure!

           Artemis puts in a CD on and blasts INCREDIBLE homemade 
           international hip-hop. Out of nowhere, a COP CAR pulls up 
           behind them and puts on his lights.

                                 ARTEMIS
                        Shit.

                                 BLAIR
                        What should I do with the coke?!

                                 ARTEMIS
                        You have coke in my car?! Get rid 
                        of it!

           They all quickly do the coke while Artemis turns the music 
           down, pulls the car over, and starts praying, loudly.

           The cops FLY BY THEM. They are all SO RELIEVED.

                                 ARTEMIS (CONT'D)
                        Praise Allah!
                        (turning music back on)
                        Let’s fuckin’ roll!

           She starts to drive off, then stops.

                                 ARTEMIS (CONT'D)
                        Please put your seat belts on.

           EXT. MIAMI MANSION - BACK POOL - NIGHT

           Back at the house, post clubbing, Jess, Alice, Frankie, Blair 
           and Kiwi change into bathing suits on the pool deck.

                                 KIWI
                        (on the phone)
                        One cheese pizza. For the second 
                        one, do you have fiddlehead ferns?
           The girls are not shy about being naked in front of each 
           other, but Jess hides her body.

                                 FRANKIE
                        Oh come on Jess - are you seriously 
                        covering up in front of us?

                                 JESS
                        I’m not... what is this, ‘Girls 
                        Gone Wild’?

                                 ALICE
                        We’ve all seen each other’s bushes 
                        a million times. Well, except 
                        Blair’s.

                                 BLAIR
                        (to Kiwi)
                        I had mine lasered off on my 21st 
                        birthday. Best decision of my life.

           Blair shows off her bare pussy.

                                 JESS
                        I prefer self-waxing.

                                 ALICE
                        Like, with those weird paper strips 
                        from CVS?

                                 JESS
                        Yeah.

                                 BLAIR
                        It’s 2015 - that’s insane.

                                 KIWI
                        Is that...
                        (sadly)
                        ... what you think you deserve?

           The DOOR BELL rings.

                                 JESS
                        Is that the pizza already?

           Blair, Alice, and Frankie giggle as they put their clothes 
           back on.

                                 FRANKIE
                        Don’t think so.
           INT. FOYER - MOMENTS LATER (1AM)

           Blair and Alice open the door to find SCOTTY (late 20s). He’s 
           sweaty and large and kinda hunky - exactly what you’d imagine 
           if you ordered a last-minute male stripper in south Florida.

                                 SCOTTY
                        Hey. My car broke down--

                                 ALICE
                        Oh, no, you’re early!

                                 BLAIR
                        STRIPPER’S HERE!

                                 JESS
                        (realizing what they did)
                        Oh my God, no! You guys!!!

           They drag Scotty into the living room.

                                 ALICE
                        Did you bring a CD or something?

                                 SCOTTY
                        No...

                                 ALICE
                        All good, I have some pretty hard 
                        core hip-hop on my iPhone.

           Alice winks at him. Blair turns the lights down and Alice 
           puts on the music: “Ignition (Remix)” by R. Kelly. Frankie 
           puts a chair in the middle of the living room and pushes Jess 
           into it. The girls cheer and giggle.

                                 BLAIR
                        (to Scotty)
                        This is Jess - the bride to be. You 
                        can do whatever you want to her!

                       KIWI
                                                FRANKIE
           Yeah!
                                       Whoo!!!

                                 ALICE
                        Fuck her!

                                 FRANKIE
                        Alice. No.

           Scotty looks at Jess for a moment (sizing her up?), then 
           dances up and grinds on her for a good thirty seconds.
           She’s laughing and is kind of mortified, but it is kind of 
           hot. He sweats profusely. He puts her hands on his butt.

                                 JESS
                        (to herself)
                        Wow. Very warm back there...

           He takes off his shirt and tosses it.

                                 JESS (CONT'D)
                        Oh my god...

           Alice catches it and sniffs it deeply. Scotty starts kissing 
           Jess’ neck, then goes down and starts “eating her out” 
           through her jeans.

                                 JESS (CONT'D)
                        Okay, I’m good!

           She stands up, sits him down, and moves away.

                                 ALICE
                        MY TURN!!!

           Alice takes a running start and JUMPS spread-eagle onto 
           Scotty. The chair he’s in flips backward and Scotty’s head 
           SMACKS onto the corner of a fireplace. HARD. It’s that dull 
           kind of WHACK sound that only a head can make.

           Jess, Blair, Frankie and Kiwi cover their mouths in shock.

                       JESS
                                                FRANKIE
           Oh my God.
                                       Are you okay?

                                 ALICE
                        (jumping up)
                        I’m good!

           Alice jumps up with her hands in the air. They all just stare 
           at her, concerned.

                                 ALICE (CONT'D)
                        What?

                                 JESS
                        He just hit his head really hard.

                                 ALICE
                        (getting a little scared)
                        Oh, I’m sure he’s fine.

           Scotty’s face is blank and he’s not moving.
                                 ALICE (CONT'D)
                        Right, bud?

           Alice grabs his wrist and tries to help him up but he’s limp. 
           That’s when they see the STREAM OF BLOOD POURING out of the 
           back of his head. They BUG OUT.

                                 ALL
                        HOLY SHIT! / Fuck! / OH MY GOD.

           Alice is frozen in shock. Everyone else rushes to Scotty.

                                 BLAIR
                        He’s not breathing!

                                 FRANKIE
                        CPR! Jess you were a lifeguard!

                                 JESS
                        In high school! I don’t really 
                        remember...

                                 FRANKIE
                        TRY!

           Jess starts breathing into his mouth and doing chest 
           compressions. The blood comes out faster.

                                 BLAIR
                        It’s making it worse!

           Alice starts to hyperventilate. Kiwi grabs a throw pillow 
           from the couch and presses it against his head.

                                 JESS
                        He doesn’t have a pulse.

                                 KIWI
                        CALL AN AMBULANCE!

           Alice stares in shock and does nothing.

                                 KIWI (CONT'D)
                        CALL AN AMBULANCE!

                                 JESS
                        He’s... dead.

           They take this in. “Ignition” still blares:
                                 R. KELLY (O.S.)
                        (sung)
                        The way you do the things you do / 
                        Reminds me of my Lexus Coupe /
                        That's why I'm all up in yo grill--

                                 BLAIR
                        Turn off that fucking music!

           Kiwi does. There’s a long silence where the girls don’t know 
           what to say or do or think. Alice, crying, hyperventilates on 
           the couch.

                                 JESS
                        (noticing)
                        Fuck - the blood.

           Blood is pooling very close to the white rug. Jess runs into 
           the kitchen and grabs a roll of paper towels. She comes back 
           and quickly uses them all up on the blood.

                                 KIWI
                        I’ll get more.

           Kiwi also goes to the kitchen. Frankie goes to find more too.

                                 KIWI (CONT’D)
                        (running back in)
                        I got these from the bathroom.

           She throws the white towels onto the blood.

                                 JESS
                        No, not the towels--

           It’s too late. The towels are soaked in blood.

                                 BLAIR
                        It’s fine. They’re Sofia Vergara 
                        for K-Mart. We can replace them.

                                 FRANKIE
                        What are you two talking about? Who 
                        cares about replacing fucking 
                        towels?!

                                 JESS
                        I don’t know!!! I don’t know what 
                        to do!

           Alice is still hyperventilating. Frankie hits a joint and 
           shotguns smoke into her mouth, which starts to calm her down.
                                 FRANKIE
                        Deep breaths.

                                 KIWI
                        We gotta call the police.

           She reaches for her phone. Jess stops her.

                                 JESS
                        Wait! We can't call the police. All 
                        these drugs-- I'm running for 
                        office, this is my bachelorette 
                        party... we need to make this look 
                        as innocent as possible.

                                 BLAIR
                        (sarcastic)
                        Yeah, a dead stripper screams 
                        innocent.

                                 FRANKIE
                        Well, technically... he’s a 
                        prostitute.

                       JESS
                                                BLAIR
           A prostitute!?
                                       WHAT?!

                                 FRANKIE
                        I got him off craigslist! He’s a 
                        stripper, but also an escort. 

                                 BLAIR
                        You ordered a gigolo?!

                                 FRANKIE
                        Don’t judge him. Sex work is a 
                        legitimate--

                                 JESS
                        What the fuck, Frankie?! The 
                        election’s in a month! How could 
                        you put me in this situation?

                                 FRANKIE
                        It's worse for me! I have two 
                        strikes! If I get a third, I'll go 
                        to jail for 25 to life.

                                 KIWI
                        What?! What for?

                                 FRANKIE
                        I’m an activist.
                                 BLAIR
                        You broke into a lab and set fire 
                        to it.

                                 FRANKIE
                        They were testing on animals!

                                 BLAIR
                        All the animals died in the fire.

                                 FRANKIE
                        And I still haven’t forgiven myself 
                        for that!

                                 ALICE
                        Stop! This was an accident! We 
                        won’t get in trouble for an 
                        accident, right?

                                 FRANKIE
                        You would think so, but you never 
                        know how this situation could be 
                        misread. We’re in Florida, and a 
                        white man is dead at the hands of a 
                        bunch of women.

                                 KIWI
                        It was the chair's fault! Fucking 
                        shit chair!

           Kiwi kicks the chair.

                                 BLAIR
                        Okay, calm down. Listen: it’s all 
                        going to be fine. We’ll call 
                        police. But Jess is right. We need 
                        to make this situation seem as 
                        innocent as possible. So before we 
                        call, let’s get rid of the drugs.

           Alice JUMPS up and starts SNORTING the cocaine on the table.

                                 JESS
                        No, not by DOING them!

           DING DONG!!! The doorbell rings and the girls all JUMP!

           INT. FOYER - CONTINUOUS

           They rush quietly to the door and Frankie looks through the 
           peep hole. A DELIVERY GUY (very short, Latino, 20s) stands at 
           the door with pizzas.
                                 FRANKIE
                        (whispering)
                        Pizza!

           On either side of the front door are two LARGE windows that 
           look into the living room and the bloody scene. The delivery 
           guy could easily see in.

                                 JESS
                        We gotta move this body.

           They all silently nod, hastily agreeing. They rush to the 
           body. Jess grabs him under the arms and Kiwi pushes his feet 
           as they slide him behind a couch.

           The pizza guy KNOCKS LOUDLY.

                                 JESS (CONT'D)
                        Someone answer the door!

                                 ALICE
                        Do we have cash for a tip!?

                                 KIWI
                        I have Australian dollars. They're 
                        stronger than American dollars...

           Jess slips in the blood! Frankie throws the last of the 
           towels on the floor. She nods to Blair.

           Blair opens the door, trying to appear calm, grabs the boxes 
           and hands over cash.

                                 BLAIR
                        Hello. Thank you. Keep the change.

                                 DELIVERY GUY
                        But this is $50--

                                 BLAIR
                        JUST GO!!!

           Blair slams the door and the Delivery Guy walk/runs away. 
           Alice grabs a slice and immediately starts wolfing it down.

                                 BLAIR (CONT'D)
                        How can you eat right now??

                                 ALICE
                        Eating is the number one way people 
                        deal with stress!
                                                 JESS
                      FRANKIE
               (taking a slice)
                                         (taking a slice)
           She’s right.
                                       Yeah.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           The girls sit in shock and silence as they chew their pizza, 
           Scotty’s feet peeking out from behind the couch.

                                 FRANKIE
                        I guess it's not that hard to break 
                        a human skull.

           Kiwi smears Vegemite on her slice. Alice holds her nose and 
           shakes her head as she takes another bite.

                                 KIWI
                        (noticing)
                        It’s my comfort food!

                                 JESS
                        Okay, listen. We need to get rid of 
                        these drugs.

           INSERT SHOT: Cocaine and weed and pills and mushrooms are 
           flushed down a toilet. A stray finger tries to catch some 
           coke, is slapped away.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

                                 FRANKIE
                        While we wait for the cocaine to 
                        pass through our system, maybe we 
                        should call a lawyer to know what 
                        to say during the interrogation.

                                 ALICE
                        We’ll get interrogated?! I can’t 
                        handle an interrogation! I can’t 
                        even handle when someone stops me 
                        on the sidewalk and asks for 
                        directions -- I usually just 
                        pretend to be deaf!

                                 FRANKIE
                        We are 100% going to be 
                        interrogated. Someone died in a 
                        sketchy way. They’re going to 
                        separate us and ask us to explain 
                        what happened.
                                 JESS
                        Let’s definitely call a lawyer.

                                 ALICE
                        My neighbor Betty is a paralegal--

                                 BLAIR
                        My Uncle Jack was on the team that 
                        defended Bernie Madoff.

                                 ALICE
                        No offense Blair, but doesn’t that 
                        mean he lost?

                                 BLAIR
                        (trés sarcastic)
                        You know what? You’re right. Let’s 
                        vote: All those in favor of calling 
                        Alice’s “neighbor Betty”, raise 
                        your hands.

           Alice is the only one to raise her hand.

                                 BLAIR (CONT'D)
                        All those in favor of calling my 
                        blood relative who normally charges 
                        $4500/hour, raise your hand.

           They all raise their hands but Alice.

                                 ALICE
                        (’your loss’)
                        Betty’s cool.

           Blair starts to dial.

                                 ALICE (CONT'D)
                        Wait! Calling a lawyer first will 
                        make us seem guilty of something. 
                        Shouldn’t we use a burner phone? 
                        That way there’s no record we 
                        called him.

                                 JESS
                        Good point Alice.

                                 FRANKIE
                        Okay, we’ll get a burner phone--

           Jess’ phone rings. It’s Peter.

                                 JESS
                        Shit. It's Peter. I didn’t call him 
                        when I got home.
                                 BLAIR
                        Don’t answer!

                                 JESS
                        I have to! 

           INT. LAKE HOUSE - NIGHT

           While Peter waits for Jess to pick up, his friends play 
           scrabble by a fire, and drink Madeira (dessert wine).

                                 JESS (O.S.)
                        Hey!

                                 PETER
                        Hi! You didn’t call me when you got 
                        home...

           INTERCUT - INT. LAKE HOUSE / INT. MIAMI MANSION - CONTINUOUS

           All the girls are crowded around the phone.

                                 JESS
                        I’m home. Yeah.

                                 PETER
                        Okay... did you have fun?

                                 JESS
                        .....fine.

                                 PETER
                        Is everything okay? You sound 
                        weird.

           The girls all motion for Jess to get off the phone! NOW!!!

                                 JESS
                        Igottagobye.

           She hangs up. The girls are relieved.

                                 ALICE
                        That was great.

                                 JESS
                        That was horrible. I hate lying to 
                        him.

                                 BLAIR
                        You’re about to get married, you 
                        better get used to it.
           Her phone rings again - it’s Peter.

                                 KIWI
                        Don’t answer it.

                                 JESS
                        If I don’t, he’ll know something’s 
                        up.

                                 ALICE
                        Just text him a poop emoji! He’ll 
                        chill out!

           She picks up. Peter has moved away from his friends and into 
           a library.

                                 PETER
                        Jess - something’s wrong. Just tell 
                        me what it is.

           Jess looks at the girls - they give her the DON’T DO IT eye.

                                 JESS
                        Something really bad happened.

                                 BLAIR
                        Shit.

                                 PETER
                        What? Are you okay?

                                 JESS
                        There was a guy who came over. It 
                        was a stripper. A prostitute 
                        actually. And we were fucked up and 
                        it just happened so fast--

                                 PETER
                        What?!

                                 JESS
                        I don't know what to do--

                                 PETER
                        About what? The wedding??

           Blair grabs Jess’ phone and they wrestle over it.

                                 BLAIR
                        Give me the phone!

                                 PETER
                        Jess, are you saying you don't want 
                        to get married?
           Blair grabs the phone and launches it into the wall. It 
           smashes.

                                 JESS
                        I can't believe you just did that!

                                 BLAIR
                        We all have to be on the same page 
                        here. We can’t talk to anyone until 
                        we talk to a lawyer. I’m collecting 
                        everyone’s phones. We won’t 
                        communicate with anyone until we 
                        know what the plan is. Agreed?

           They all nod and hand her their phones. She gets to Jess’ - 
           hers is just shards.

                                 BLAIR (CONT'D)
                        You can keep yours.

           INT. BLAIR’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Blair goes into her bedroom, stashes the phones in the drawer 
           of her night stand, and locks it with the decorative key [the 
           kind your aunt has with the tassel on the end].

           INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

                                 ALICE
                        We can get a burner phone at the 7-
                        Eleven. We’ll pay with cash and ask 
                        someone there to buy it. We can’t 
                        be caught on camera, and we can’t 
                        have a paper trail.

                                 JESS
                        (impressed/disturbed)
                        Jesus, Alice.

                                 ALICE
                        Gone Girl.

                                 FRANKIE
                        Blair and I can go.

                       KIWI
                                                 JESS
           Umm...
                                       ...or anybody else?

                                 FRANKIE
                        What?
                                 KIWI
                        Just seems like you’re on different 
                        vibrations--

                                 JESS
                        You two always argue.

                      BLAIR
                                                FRANKIE
           We do not argue.
                                       We do sometimes.

                                 BLAIR
                        We debate, sure, who doesn’t - 
                        that’s a normal part of talking.

                                 FRANKIE
                        It’s the same thing Blair--

                        (whispering to Jess)
                        They used to hook up, didn't they?

                                 JESS
                        (whispering)
                        Yes. How'd you--

                                 KIWI
                        (whispering)
                        Opposites attract.

           INT. LAKE HOUSE - NIGHT

           Patrick, Joe, Tobey and Jake continue to play scrabble.

                                 PATRICK
                        Blewish isn't a word.

                                 JOE
                        Then what do you call black Jews?

                                 PATRICK
                        Black Jews.

           Peter returns to his friends. He's clearly been crying.

                                 PETER
                        ... it’s happening again.

                                 TOBEY
                        What are you talking about?

           The guys stop playing their game.
                                 PETER
                        She said she was drunk and 
                        something really bad happened with 
                        a prostitute!

                                 JAKE
                        Yeah that sounds bad.

                                 PETER
                        And then I asked her if she still 
                        wanted to get married and she hung 
                        up! And now she's not answering!

                                 JAKE
                        This is like, the fifth time you've 
                        been cheated on, right? What is 
                        that? Does your penis bend weird 
                        when it gets hard or something? Or 
                        does your cum taste weird?

                                 PETER
                        I don't know! I've never tasted my 
                        own cum!

                                 JAKE
                        (definitely has)
                        Yeah, me neither.

                                 PETER
                        (spiraling)
                        Oh my god. What am I going to tell 
                        my Mom? I can't date now! I don't 
                        know how to Tinder! I'm getting 
                        dizzy, I'm going to throw up. Oh, 
                        and the deposit. What are we going 
                        to do with all the food?!

                                 PATRICK
                        Give him some Mederia!

           They hold down a spiraling Peter and pour dessert wine into 
           his mouth.

           EXT. 7-ELEVEN PARKING LOT - NIGHT (1:45 AM)

           Blair and Frankie crouch in the bushes on the edge of a 7-
           Eleven parking lot. Their faces are covered green mud masks 
           from Alice’s spa kit.

                                 FRANKIE
                        This is stupid - you can still see 
                        our faces.
                                 BLAIR
                        But no one can definitively ID our 
                        race.

                                 FRANKIE
                        Honestly, we’ve never been more 
                        white. Well, maybe you have.

                                 BLAIR
                        Teens!

           Two SKATEBOARDING TEENAGERS are headed toward the entrance. 
           Blair and Frankie get their attention.

                   BLAIR (CONT'D)
                                                FRANKIE
           Hey teens!!
                                       Come here!

           The teens are like WTF re: green face.

                                 TEEN #1
                        You tryna molest us or some shit?

           The teens give them the finger and skateboard away.

                                 BLAIR
                        PUBLIC SCHOOL TRASH!

                                 FRANKIE
                        How do you know they go to public 
                        school?

                                 BLAIR
                        Please. They were on skateboards.

           They see a sweet ELDERLY COUPLE. Blair and Frankie nod to 
           each other.

                                                 JUMP CUT TO:

           They stand with the Elderly Couple in the parking lot.

                                 FRANKIE
                        -- any brand is fine.

                                 OLD MAN
                        What is she saying?

                                 OLD WOMAN
                        They need to make a call!

           The couple goes in. Blair and Frankie retreat to the bushes.
           INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Jess, Alice and Kiwi wait for Frankie and Blair to return 
           from 7-Eleven. Alice looks over to Scotty, who now lies in a 
           small pool of toweled blood. His eyes are open.

                                 ALICE
                        (emotional)
                        He’s staring at me. It feels like 
                        he’s following me with his eyes.

           Jess and Kiwi look over - weird, it does look like he’s 
           staring at her.

                                 ALICE (CONT'D)
                        I can’t believe he was alive and 
                        now he’s dead. And it’s my fault. I 
                        killed someone. Somebody's son, or 
                        maybe even someone's dad! Oh God!

           Alice cries.

                                 JESS
                        Alice. It’s not your fault. It was 
                        an accident.

                                 ALICE
                        I don’t even have mouse traps. I 
                        wouldn’t ever want to kill 
                        anything.

           Jess puts her arm around an emotional Alice. Alice leans on 
           Jess.

           Kiwi goes over to his body, crouches very close to his face, 
           and takes a deep moment with him. She then closes his eyes.

                                 KIWI
                        (whispering)
                        Sleep now. Embrace the Akashic 
                        plane and fly.

           His eyes slowly open again.

                                 ALICE
                        Ohhhhh Lord--

           Kiwi tries to close them again.

                                 KIWI
                        Okay. Sleep now, sweet prince.

           They POP back open.
                      ALICE
                                                 JESS
           OH NO!
                                       EW EW EW EW.

           Alice runs (screaming the whole time) to her bag - she grabs 
           something.

           She returns with sunglasses from her bachelorette party kit 
           and puts them on Scotty. The girls step back to assess.
           They’re “penis sunglasses”: the lenses are balls and a 
           plastic dick covers his nose.

                                 ALICE
                        Much better.

           EXT. 7-ELEVEN PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           The old people emerge with a plastic bag. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Finally!

           Frankie pulls out a pre-paid calling card out of the bag.

                                 FRANKIE
                        What the fuck is this?

                                 OLD MAN
                        You need to make a call right?

                                 BLAIR
                        Not with this!

                                 OLD WOMAN
                        Here - you can use our cell phone. 
                        I don’t know the number but you can 
                        try it.

           She offers the girls her flip phone.

                                 FRANKIE
                        No! No. We need a burner phone. 
                        They should be behind the counter.

                                 OLD WOMAN
                        (heading back in)
                        All right. All right!

                                 OLD MAN
                        (can’t hear?)
                        We’re going back in?
           From inside the store, there’s a knock on the window. Blair 
           and Frankie look over to see the old woman holding up a 
           burner phone.

                                 OLD WOMAN
                        (yelling)
                        This?!

           Frankie and Blair nod YES! The clerk leans over and sees 
           Blair and Frankie. Shit! They jump behind a bush.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Jess wipes blood off her engagement ring.

                                 KIWI
                        Your ring looks so much bigger IRL 
                        than it does on Skype.

                                 ALICE
                        You guys Skype?

                                 JESS
                        (covering)
                        Do we? I guess we do?

                                 KIWI
                        She’s joking. Because of the time 
                        difference, we're actually able to 
                        have breakfast together every 
                        morning over Skype.

                                 ALICE
                        Really!

                                 KIWI
                        Yeah, it’s so spiritually grounding 
                        to start the day with a hemp 
                        smoothie and a Skype.

                                 ALICE
                        I didn’t know that.

                                 KIWI
                        Oh, Skype is an app where you can 
                        make free calls--

                                 ALICE
                        I know what it is. I Skype with my 
                        cat when she's at cat care. I 
                        didn’t think Jess ever used it 
                        because she’s always invisible.
                                 KIWI
                        Ah. Well, she always calls me so I 
                        never noticed.

           We see Alice is hurt by this.

           Suddenly a loud DOG BARK interrupts them. They turn around to 
           find a GERMAN SHEPARD barking incessantly at the sight of 
           Scotty’s body from outside the glass slider (the whole wall 
           is glass looking out to the pool and ocean).

           His owner, a JOGGER, calls for him from the beach

                                 JOGGER (O.S.) 
                        Charlie! Here boy!

           The girls PANIC!

                       JESS
                                                ALICE
           Fuck!
                                       Shit!

                                 JOGGER (O.S.)
                        (getting closer)
                        Charlie!

                                 ALICE
                        Shush, doggie, shush!

                                 JESS
                        Oh fuck! He’s headed toward the 
                        house!

                                 KIWI
                        I’ll take care of it. Animals and I 
                        have an understanding.
                        (to dog)
                        Come on, Charlie!

           Kiwi slides open the door and grabs the dog by the collar. 
           The dog snarls at her. It's clear she very much does not have 
           an understanding with animals. 

                                 KIWI (CONT'D)
                        (calling to owner)
                        I’ve got him! I’ll bring him to 
                        you. It’s all good!

           Kiwi leaves.

                                 JESS
                        This house is all glass! Anyone 
                        could just come up off the beach 
                        and see him!
                                 ALICE
                        If someone reports it before we do, 
                        we're dead!

                                 JESS
                        We need to get him out of sight. 
                        The garage!

                                 ALICE
                        Yes. We’ll put him back before we 
                        call the cops. Easy!

                                                 SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Jess, Alice and Kiwi struggle to carry the body. It is NOT 
           easy. Jess and Kiwi each have an arm while Alice holds both 
           legs. His lifeless head bobs with each step.

                                 JESS
                        Watch his head!

                                 KIWI
                        Why?

           Jess nods - good point. As they cross the landing, Alice 
           trips and falls. Her face SMASHES into Scotty’s dead crotch.

                                 JESS
                        Shit - are you okay?

                                 ALICE
                        (getting up)
                        Yeah. His dick broke my fall. I 
                        think it’s big...

                                 JESS
                        Alice. Come on.

                                 ALICE
                        You know what - I’m actually more 
                        comfortable walking backwards. I 
                        was a figure skater and backwards 
                        skating was kinda my thing, so...

           They all shimmy to rotate his body and continue. His head and 
           ankles nick the corners of the hallway as they finally make 
           it to -
           INT. GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER

           Jess, Alice and Kiwi finally get the body through the side 
           door to the garage. It’s dark. They stumble down three little 
           steps and Alice knocks over a shelf with tons of metal shit - 
           it makes a huge noise.

                                 ALICE
                        Shit!

                                 JESS
                        Turn on a light!

           Kiwi hits a buton. But the GARAGE DOOR opens instead. We can 
           now see in the garage: a jet-ski, bikes, etc. Also, they are 
           now in clear view of any passing people and cars.

                                 KIWI
                        Bugger!

           In a panic, Kiwi presses the button a dozen times trying to 
           get the door to stop.

                                 KIWI (CONT'D)
                        Nooo no no no!

           The door starts going UP and DOWN non-stop. Jess and Alice 
           drop the body in a panic.

                                 JESS
                        (trying the door button)
                        Alice - cover him!

           Alice grabs a bike, wheels it in front of the body and poses, 
           “casually” frozen.

           Just then the garage is flooded with the high beams of 
           headlights turning into the driveway!!! OH GOD!!!!

           INT. TAXI - SAME

           It’s Frankie and Blair in a taxi. The TAXI DRIVER notices the 
           commotion.

                                 TAXI DRIVER
                        This you?

           Frankie and Blair see a frantic Jess and Kiwi running around 
           the garage trying to find something to cover the body, while 
           Alice poses perfectly still with her bike as the garage door 
           goes up and down.
                      FRANKIE
                                                BLAIR
           Jesus -
                                       - Christ.

           Blair runs out of the car to help while Frankie distracts the 
           driver as she pays:

                                 FRANKIE
                        I just wanted to say before that 
                        the Armenian genocide is a tragedy 
                        that is too often overlooked.

                                 TAXI DRIVER
                        I’m Greek.

                                 FRANKIE
                        Well. We should all keep the 
                        Armenian genocide in our thoughts.

           INT. GARAGE - CONTINUOUS

           The garage door is now STUCK halfway open. 

                                 BLAIR
                        What is going on???

                                 JESS
                        We’re starting a garage band. Do 
                        you play bass?
                        (then)
                        What do you think?! We’re trying to 
                        hide a fucking dead guy!

                                 BLAIR
                        You’re doing a terrible job.

                                 JESS
                        Help us get him back inside!

           They all grab Scotty and pull him back inside.

           INT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           As the girls carry the body back inside:

                                 BLAIR
                        Why did you move him in the first 
                        place?

                                 KIWI
                        There was a dog - a beautiful 
                        German Shepard, actually--
                                 JESS
                        We’re too exposed in this house. 
                        There’s so much glass.

                                 FRANKIE
                        Where can we put this body where 
                        it’s out of sight for real?

                                                 SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. CLOSET - MOMENTS LATER

           Scotty’s dead body hangs in the sex swing, wearing penis 
           sunglasses. Cut to reverse of all our girls. They look sadly 
           at the corpse, then closing the closet door.

           INTERCUT: INT. NEW ENGLAND HOUSE - BATHROOM / LIVING ROOM

           The girls huddle around the burner phone, on speaker with 
           Blair’s uncle JACK EASON (early 70s). He is in the midst of 
           dying his hair pitch black in his bathroom.

                                 JACK EASON
                        From what you’ve told me so far, 
                        this would likely be classified as 
                        involuntary manslaughter. 
                        Potentially criminally negligent 
                        homicide. Both felonies.

                                 BLAIR
                        Jesus.

                                 JACK EASON
                        Manslaughter comes with a sentence 
                        of 2-20 years, criminally negligent 
                        homicide up to 2.

           Alice gasps.

                                 JACK EASON (CONT'D)
                        Don’t panic. It’s quite possible 
                        you can prove it was just an 
                        accident.
                        (then)
                        You haven’t moved the body or 
                        tampered with the scene, right?

                                 KIWI
                        We put him in a sex swing.
                                 JACK EASON
                        Right. Okay.
                        (sighs)
                        You’re all guilty of accomplice 
                        liability or accessory after the 
                        fact. And moving the body or  
                        tampering with the scene is 
                        obstruction of justice. No bueno.

                                 JESS
                        Fuck.

                                 JACK EASON
                        To be perfectly honest, it’s 
                        unlikely you’ll get off without 
                        serving some time.

           Jesus. The girls take all this in - realizing this is REALLY 
           FUCKING SERIOUS.

                                 JACK EASON (CONT'D)
                        Also, this is a pretty juicy story, 
                        I’d imagine there’d be quite a bit 
                        of press about it.

           Jess holds her head in her hands - this is so bad.

                                 BLAIR
                        What can we do?! We can’t go to 
                        jail!

                                 JACK EASON
                        Are we on an open line here girls?

                                 ALICE
                        It’s a burner phone.

                                 JACK EASON
                        Good. Like I told Rob Lowe: if 
                        there’s no body, there’s no case.

           The girls take this in. Jack gets dye on his nose.

                                 JACK EASON (CONT'D)
                        Ah shit. All right girls, I gotta 
                        go. Blair, your aunt had another 
                        cyst removed and she’s not happy 
                        she hasn’t heard from you.

                                 BLAIR
                        Okay, I’ll call her. Love you.

           He hangs up. Alice immediately launches the burner phone into 
           the wall, smashing it.
                                 JESS
                        Don’t think you needed to do that.

                                 BLAIR
                        I can’t believe this is happening.

                                 ALICE
                        Well - he said there’s a chance 
                        that the jury will believe it was 
                        an accident, right?

                                 FRANKIE
                        A woman in Florida was sentenced 
                        for 20 years for firing a warning 
                        shot when her husband threatened to 
                        kill her. This isn’t a state that 
                        gives women the benefit of the 
                        doubt.

                                 KIWI
                        This country is insane!

                                 FRANKIE
                        If we'd had this bachelorette in 
                        Portland or that Indian reservation 
                        in Wyoming I suggested, we wouldn't 
                        be in this situation! 

                                 JESS
                        If a dick pick can ruin a career, 
                        this will ruin everything.

           Jess gets up and walks to the window, overwhelmed.

                                 JESS (CONT'D)
                        (emotional)
                        I was so close... I almost had 
                        everything I wanted. Peter, my 
                        career was really taking off-- I-- 
                        Now everything will be gone. Just 
                        like that.

                                 ALICE
                        I'm so sorry Jess. I...

                                 FRANKIE
                        You guys will get off with just a 
                        few years. I will do hard time, 
                        maybe for life.
                                 BLAIR
                        I can’t do any years! I’m in the 
                        middle of a custody battle and 
                        Malcolm is chomping at the bit to 
                        keep Ben away from me. Even the 
                        trial would be enough of a reason 
                        for him to get custody, never mind 
                        jail time.

                                 ALICE
                        My students idolize me! They’ll all 
                        turn to crime! I can't go to jail! 
                        I couldn’t even get through the 
                        pilot of “Orange Is the New Black”!

                                 JESS
                        None of us can!

                                 ALICE
                        Too soapy, right?

                                 JESS
                        No, I meant we can’t go to jail.

                                 FRANKIE
                        Even if we only get charged with 
                        tampering with the scene, who knows 
                        who this guys is! His family could 
                        try to get revenge!

                                 BLAIR
                        She’s right. We’ll have to look 
                        over our shoulders for the rest of 
                        our lives.

           LONG BEAT. They’re all thinking the same thing.

                                 BLAIR (CONT'D)
                        He did say it would be hard to 
                        convict with no body...

                                 ALICE
                        It was an accident. It’s not like 
                        we deserve to go to jail.

                                 FRANKIE
                        He’s an independent contractor. He 
                        doesn't work for an escort company 
                        or anything, so I don’t think 
                        anyone knows he’s even here...

           They look to Jess. They’re thinking the same thing.
                                 JESS
                        We gotta get rid of him.

           They all nod.

                                 KIWI
                        Let’s dump him behind a gay bar!

           SILENCE.

                                 ALICE
                        It does kinda make sense...

                                 JESS
                        No. We can’t leave him somewhere 
                        that public. Besides, we don’t have 
                        a car.

                                 FRANKIE
                        Wait! His car!

           They all rush to the door - they open it and find - the 
           driveway is EMPTY.

                                 FRANKIE (CONT'D)
                        Weird. How did he get here?

                                 BLAIR
                        He said he was having car trouble. 
                        He must have walked?

                                 JESS
                        Okay. No car.

           They move back into the living room.

                                 JESS (CONT'D)
                        We need to put him somewhere he’ll 
                        never be found.

           In the silence, they hear the sound of the waves crashing. 
           Jess looks out, and they all turn their heads to look towards 
           the dark ocean.

                                 FRANKIE
                        Blair's vagina.

                                 BLAIR
                        You bitch.

                                 JESS
                        THE OCEAN! We're gonna dump him in 
                        the ocean.
           INT. LAKE HOUSE - NIGHT

           Peter is pacing, still spiraling. He hangs up his phone.

                                 PETER
                        None of them are answering. 
                        Something really bad happened if 
                        none of them are answering. 

                                 JOE
                        You don’t know she cheated, okay? 
                        Sure, yes, it’s her bachelorette 
                        and if she was going to cheat this 
                        would be when she’d do it. But 
                        cheating doesn't have to end the 
                        relationship.

                                 PETER
                        It's not just about cheating! I 
                        asked if she still wanted to get 
                        married and she hung up! 

                                 JAKE
                        That's a pretty clear message. Why 
                        don't you just get on Tinder now 
                        and get a head start on a rebound?

                                 TOBEY
                        What are you talking about dude?! 
                        This is Peter and Jess! They're 
                        perfect for each other. I mean 
                        she's a little out of his league, 
                        but-- 

                                 JAKE
                        He'll get over it - he always does.

           This hits Peter.

                                 PETER
                        This is different. I love her. 

                                 TOBEY
                        If you love her, you gotta go down 
                        there and figure it out.

                                 PETER
                        You're right. I gotta go to Miami. 
                        Right now.

                                 TOBEY
                        Yes, dude!
                                 JOE
                        (already checking phone)
                        The first flight out is... 10 a.m. 
                        tomorrow morning.

                                 PATRICK
                        There’s a train that can get you 
                        there tomorrow night.

                                 TOBEY
                        That’s not soon enough. Peter. You 
                        gotta sad astronaut.

                                 PETER
                        Sad astronaut?

                                 TOBEY
                        Lisa Marie Nowak was an astronaut. 
                        And she was in love with another 
                        astronaut named Will. Lisa 
                        suspected that Will was hooking up 
                        with some hottie Air Force captain 
                        and Lisa Marie was pissed. So she 
                        decided to deal with this Air Force 
                        chick once and for all. She loaded 
                        up her car with a bunch of adult 
                        diapers so she wouldn’t have to 
                        stop and waste precious time going 
                        to the bathroom, and drove directly 
                        from Houston to Orlando, to, I 
                        guess, kidnap the Air Force chick 
                        or something. But the beauty of the 
                        sad astronaut is that Lisa Marie 
                        used her crazy physics astronaut 
                        brain to figure out the fastest way 
                        humanly possible to get to Florida. 
                        You gotta sad astronaut, bro.

           Beat.

                                 PETER
                        Let’s get some diapers.

           INT. GARAGE - NIGHT

           The girls wheel the jet-ski trailer out of the garage.

           EXT. BACKYARD BEACH - NIGHT

           The girls pull the jet-ski towards the ocean. Scotty slouches 
           over it, stomach-down. The girls are out of breath.
                                 KIWI
                        Has anyone ever driven one of these 
                        before?

                                 ALICE
                        I did once - that Spring Break we 
                        went to Cabo.

                                 BLAIR
                        That’s right! You took ecstasy and 
                        rode it for five hours straight.

                                 JESS
                        Didn’t you get second degree burns?

                                 ALICE
                        (bragging?)
                        Third degree.

           As they approach the water, FLOOD LIGHTS COME ON from next 
           door and shines on their faces. Squinting, they see Lea and 
           Pietro waving and heading in their direction. 

                                 LEA
                        OH HELLO!!!

                                 JESS
                        Shit! The neighbors!

                                 FRANKIE
                        Hide him behind the Jet-Ski!

           They toss Scotty’s body behind the Jet-Ski. Kiwi furiously 
           tries to cover him with sand. Not going well.

                                 BLAIR
                        We can still see him.

           ANGLE ON: Lea and Pietro get closer.

                                 LEA
                        (shouting to Pietro)
                        Nope!

                                 PIETRO
                        Dang!

                                 LEA
                        We hoped you were skinny dipping.

                                 JESS
                        Oh hahaha - no.
                                 PIETRO
                        Taking the Jet-Ski out for a night 
                        spin? Adventurous...

                                 LEA
                        Oh my!

           Lea gasps at what’s going on behind the Jet-Ski. The girls 
           turn around, scared, only to see that Kiwi is on top of 
           Scotty, “making out” with him.

                                 PIETRO
                        What do we have here?

                                 BLAIR
                        I think... they wanna make love... 
                        in international waters.

                                 LEA
                        (knowingly, nodding)
                        Ah, international waters, where 
                        consent is ageless.

                                 BLAIR
                        We should let them do their thing.

           Blair ushers Lea and Pietro back up towards the houses.

                                 PIETRO
                        That certainly gets me in the mood.

           He kisses the back of Lea’s neck, making eye contact with 
           Blair.

                                 JESS
                        You need a tampon, Blair?

                                 BLAIR
                        Maybe...

                                 LEA
                        (subtly touching Blair)
                        We just opened a bottle of 
                        Châteauneuf-du-Pape and were 
                        listening to some remastered 
                        Fleetwood Mac. It's beautiful, you 
                        can really hear the cocaine in 
                        Stevie's voice.

                                 PIETRO
                        We’d love for you to join us...

                                 BLAIR
                        Uhhhh...
                                 LEA
                        No pressure--

                                 PIETRO
                        Unless it’s asked for.

                                 BLAIR
                        Thank you, but I think I’m going to 
                        head to bed.

                                 PIETRO
                        Ah, understood. We’re fluent in 
                        body language. We’ll leave you be.
                        (to the group)
                        Good night ladies. Have fun.

                                 ALICE / JESS / FRANKIE
                        Good night. / Night. / Night.

           Lea and Pietro make their way to their house, go inside, and 
           turn off their exterior lights.

           The girls scuttle back to Kiwi and Scotty.

                                 JESS
                        Jesus, are you okay?

                                 KIWI
                        Yeah.
                        (beat)
                        It’s insane to think he and I have 
                        a cosmic connection, right?
                        (long beat)
                        I’m going to take your silence as a 
                        yes.

           INT. CVS - NIGHT

           In a SLOW MOTION MUSICAL SEQUENCE set to HORNY RAP MUSIC 
           Peter and Tobey clear out the adult diaper section of a CVS 
           and put it in a cart.

           They then haul cases of Red Bull over their shoulders and 
           roll up (totally bad-ass) to a FEMALE CLERK (65). Suddenly 
           the slo-mo and music cuts out and it becomes scenic:

                                 FEMALE CLERK
                        NOT THIS BRAND!!! THESE LEAK!!!

           We RESUME SLO-MO and music as Peter and Tobey return to the 
           adult diapers, put those away, and get another brand. The 
           Female Clerk nods and smiles (slo-mo thumbs up!) as they pay 
           and leave.
           EXT. BEACH - NIGHT

           Scotty is draped on the back of the Jet-Ski. Alice hops on.

                                 JESS
                        We’re really sorry, Scotty.

                                 FRANKIE
                        You deserved better than this.

                                 BLAIR
                        But you’re in a better place than 
                        Miami now.

                                 KIWI
                        We’ll meet again.... one day.

           Alice hits the gas and speeds off into the ocean. The girls 
           watch as she Jet-Skis far in to the distance.

                                 FRANKIE
                        We will never speak of this again. 
                        Agreed?

                                 ALL
                        Agreed.

           ANGLE ON: Alice, now about 500 feet away, does a SHARP turn, 
           flinging Scotty into the ocean where he hits the water HARD.

                                 KIWI
                        Wow.

                                 JESS
                        That could’ve been more gentle.

           Alice is now heading back to them pretty quickly.

                                 BLAIR
                        She’s going pretty fast.

           She does not slow down.

                                 FRANKIE
                        What is she doing?

           The Jet-Ski SPEEDS towards the beach and PLOWS into the sand, 
           sending Alice FLYING THROUGH THE AIR.

           She flips in the air! Yet SOMEHOW, she lands on her feet! 
           Perfect landing!

                                 BLAIR
                        Holy shit!
           Alice slowly turns around to look back at the girls. She is 
           shocked!

                                 ALICE
                        (whisper yelling)
                        Did you see that!?

                                 KIWI
                        That was amazing!

                                 FRANKIE
                        Did the brakes not work??

                                 ALICE
                        No, I forgot how to stop! Last time 
                        the gas just ran out.
                        (then)
                        Oh my God! This sucks! I can’t tell 
                        anyone about it!

                                 JESS
                        Well, you can, just don’t tell them 
                        about the dead guy part.

           EXT. CVS PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           Tobey loads the last case of Red Bull into Peter’s Prius. 
           Peter puts on a diaper. (He wears just a button down and 
           diaper.)

                                 TOBEY
                        You sure you don’t want me to come? 
                        I can take Monday off - or just 
                        quit...

                                 PETER
                        No. Thank you. I need to do this on 
                        my own.
                        (then)
                        So I just piss right into this. 
                        Just let it out?

                                 TOBEY
                        Yeah, even a baby can do it. 
                        (then)
                        Here.

           Handing him a bottle of pills and some CDs.

                                 TOBEY (CONT'D)
                        Adderall. It’ll keep you awake when 
                        you run out of Red Bull. And 
                        Spanish Language CDs. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 TOBEY (CONT'D)
                        If Jess hooked up with a Cuban guy, 
                        you may have to reason with him.

                                 PETER
                        Thanks man. Okay. I’m really doing 
                        this. I’m gonna get her back.

                                 TOBEY
                        Get her back, man.

           They hug. We hear the soft sound of peeing in a diaper.

                                 TOBEY (CONT'D)
                        Already?

           EXT. BACK LAWN - MOMENTS LATER

           Jess, Alice, Blair, Frankie and Kiwi make their way back to 
           the house, dragging the Jet-Ski.

                                 KIWI
                        So what do we do now?

                                 FRANKIE
                        We should go about the weekend as 
                        we were planning, make everything 
                        seem normal.

                                 BLAIR
                        Great. I’ll drink a bottle of wine 
                        and work on my Pinterest.

                                 ALICE
                        Is there any pizza left?

                                 JESS
                        I don’t think so.

           ALICE SCREAMS!

                                 JESS (CONT'D)
                        Jesus Christ. We can order more.

                                 ALICE
                        NO! That!

           She points -- Lea and Pietro’s house has a SECURITY CAMERA 
           POINTED AT THE BEACH! FUCK!

                                 BLAIR
                        They have all that on tape!
                                 KIWI
                        Fuck mate!

                                 ALICE
                        Oh my God. Oh my God! There’s 
                        footage of us disposing of a body! 
                        Maybe we should just turn ourselves 
                        in now--

                                 JESS
                        (intense)
                        No. We’ve come too far. We need to 
                        get that footage.

                                 BLAIR
                        How?!

           They all slowly turn to Blair. Yeah. She needs to get it.

                                 BLAIR (CONT'D)
                        No. Absolutely not.
                        (off their look)
                        N--

                                                 SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. LEA AND PIETRO’S LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Pietro hands Blair a weird Mai Tai.

                                 BLAIR
                        Thank you.

           Blair sits on Lea and Pietro’s large, mohair ottoman. Their 
           house has clearly been designed for threesomes: daybeds, 
           woven poufs, and lots of soft, round leather furniture. 
           Fleetwood Mac (or something less expensive but equally 
           sensual) plays.

                                 BLAIR (CONT'D)
                        Your house is so... 

           Blair sees leg straps built into the wall.

                                 BLAIR (CONT'D)
                        ...funky.

                                 LEA
                        Thank you. I decorated it myself.

                                 PIETRO
                        I think ankles are by far the most 
                        erotic part of the human body.

                                 PIETRO (CONT'D)
                        (looking at Blair’s 
                         ankles)
                        Look at that - she’s got two.

                                 LEA
                        (staring, leaning in)
                        May I?

                                 BLAIR
                        Sure?

           Lea kisses her. It’s sweet and not too intense. Blair is 
           being shy. Pietro reclines and watches them, sniffing his own 
           underarm.

                                 PIETRO
                        Idea! Let’s play oil!

                                 LEA
                        Oooh! YES!

                                 BLAIR
                        What’s oil?

                                 LEA
                        It’s like Jenga, but with bodies. 
                        And olive oil. Oh! Pietro! We could 
                        play Rag Doll...
                        (to Blair)
                        That's when I take a Dramamine and 
                        a glass of white wine and you two 
                        do whatever you want.

                                 PIETRO
                        God, you make me red hot.

           Lea kisses Pietro deeply. As they kiss Pietro’s hand wanders 
           to Blair’s face. He keeps trying to insert his thumb in her 
           mouth, but she keeps avoiding it.

                                 BLAIR
                        You know what would be really hot? 
                        If we caught this on tape.

                                 LEA
                        Ooh, naughty girl.

           Pietro is almost instantly up and fumbling with an old-ass 
           VHS camcorder on a tripod. Clearly he’s done this before.

                                 BLAIR
                        Wait, wait - I saw you guys have 
                        some cameras outside...

                                 BLAIR (CONT'D)
                        It’s always been my fantasy to get 
                        caught on a security camera.

                                 PIETRO
                        My my my. You’re giving the French 
                        girl from Turks and Caicos a run 
                        for her money.

           Pietro throws open the backyard door and gestures outside.

                                 PIETRO (CONT'D)
                        Mademoiselles?

           EXT. BACK YARD - POOL AREA - NIGHT

           Lea and Pietro kiss. Blair looks up at the camera and makes 
           sure they’re in it’s sights. Lea stops kissing Pietro and 
           kisses Blair. Lea then stops and starts to go down on Blair. 
           Blair takes a deep breath. Here we go. Pietro starts 
           massaging Blair’s ankles.

           INT. MANSION - CONTINUOUS

           The other girls watch what’s going down from next door.

                      ALICE
                                                 JESS
           Interesting.
                                       Wow.

                                 FRANKIE
                        They must do capoeira.

           INT. PETER’S CAR - NIGHT

           Peter chugs a Red Bull as he listens to Jess’ voicemail 
           message on speakerphone as he FLIES down a highway.

                                 JESS (O.S.)
                        It’s Jess. Leave a message!

                                 PETER
                        It’s me again. Peter. Your fiancee! 
                        Haha! Okay, call me back!

           He hangs up. He is so depressed. We hear the sound of him 
           urinating an entire Red Bull. This takes about 20 seconds. He 
           calls again.

                                 PETER (CONT'D)
                        Hi! It's Peter--
           EXT. BACK YARD - POOL AREA - NIGHT

           The waves crash against the shore. Off-screen we hear Lea and 
           Pietro orgasming.

                   PIETRO (O.S.)
                                              LEA (O.S.)
           Uhhhhhhhh!
                                         (screaming)
                                       DIANA!!!!!!

           Lea and Pietro rise into frame, sweaty and tussled. Blair 
           rises into frame.

                                 BLAIR
                        Um. My name’s Blair.

                      PIETRO
           Oh no--
                                                 LEA
                                       That’s the Roman Goddess of 
                                       animals.

                                 BLAIR
                        So, uh - you know what I’d love is 
                        a copy of that security footage. 
                        You know. For jerking off later.

                                 PIETRO
                        The what?

                                 BLAIR
                        The tape. From the cameras.

                                 LEA
                        Oh, they don’t actually work.

                                 BLAIR
                        ‘Scusemewhat?

                                 PIETRO
                        Yeah, they don’t work, but that’s 
                        not what this was about, right? 
                        This was fantasy fulfillment, 
                        creating a mis-en-scene--

                                 BLAIR
                        Why the fuck would someone have 
                        security cameras that don’t work?

                                 LEA
                        ADT installed them for free.
                                 PIETRO
                        There was no charge for the first 
                        three months. After that we didn’t 
                        want to pay for the service.

                                 LEA
                        Keeps away the riffraff.

                                 BLAIR
                        I gotta go.

           She leaves quickly. Lea and Pietro look up and catch the 
           other girls all watching from their window. Caught, Jess and 
           Alice drop to the floor out of sight, Frankie runs out of the 
           room and Kiwi pretends to be inspecting the curtains.

           Lea and Pietro share a suspicious look.

                                                 SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. MIAMI MANSION - LATER

           BLAIR’S ANGRY FACE.

                                 FRANKIE
                        So there is no footage?!

                                 BLAIR
                        NO!

                                 JESS
                        But we’re in the clear! That’s 
                        great!

                                 BLAIR
                        She ate me out for 40 minutes while 
                        he massaged argan oil on my 
                        temples!

                                 JESS
                        It was 20 minutes, and you looked 
                        like you were okay with it.

                                 BLAIR
                        (still angry)
                        Yeah, she gave me multiple orgasms!

                                 FRANKIE
                        Really?

                                 BLAIR
                        (begrudgingly)
                        Yes. She was amazing. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 BLAIR (CONT'D)
                        She was powerful and got me off 
                        like eight times.

                                 JESS
                        Soooo, you also had some fun.

                                 BLAIR
                        I fucked two total strangers for 
                        nothing! I definitely have scurvy 
                        or whatever pirates die from. I am 
                        not happy.

                                 JESS
                        So nothing’s changed. Cool.

                                 FRANKIE
                        We just got away with murder, 
                        literally. I think it’s time to 
                        celebrate.

           Frankie sits on the couch and takes a joint out of her bra 
           and sits in front of the TV - still on mute.

                                 BLAIR
                        We were supposed to throw out the 
                        drugs!

                                 FRANKIE
                        Pot’s not a drug.

                                 KIWI
                        Agreed. Nothing grown from the 
                        earth should be classified as a 
                        drug. I mean, what’s the limit, you 
                        know? Is coffee a drug? Is a banana 
                        a drug? Is --

                                 JESS
                        Should we leave Miami right now?

                                 ALL
                        Yes.

                                 FRANKIE
                        We'll go to the airport and get on 
                        the first flight outta here.

                                 JESS
                        Let’s do it.

           MONTAGE of the girls furiously cleaning the house:

           - bleaching bloody towels.
           - wiping down the fireplace.

           - putting the couch back.

           - fluffing the pillows.

           - each girl high-fives every other girl. 

                             *Mission accomplished*

           INT. JESS’S BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Jess packs her toiletries. She picks up the pink furry 
           handcuffs. Shaking her head she puts them in her bag.

           Suddenly we hear Alice SCREAM from down the hall.

           Jess runs into --

           INT. ALICE’S ROOM - NIGHT

           The other girls also run in to see Alice - she’s pointing 
           outside -- where SCOTTY’S BODY HAS WASHED UP ON SHORE.

           EXT. BEACH - NIGHT

           The girls SPRINT towards Scotty’s body, whisper-yelling.

                                 JESS
                        I thought we weighed him down!

                                 BLAIR
                        I put rocks in his pockets!

           They reach the corpse, which is now pant-less, only wearing 
           underwear, being pecked at by seagulls.

                                 BLAIR (CONT'D)
                        Men need to wear belts!

                                 ALICE
                        Ew birds! Get outta here!

                                 KIWI
                        It’s just their nature!

                                 JESS
                        Shh! We gotta be quiet!
           They roll Scotty onto the boogie board and drag him back 
           toward the house.

                                                 SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. CLOSET - MOMENTS LATER

           Scotty’s body hangs in the sex swing. He’s looked better. 
           They put the penis glasses on him again. They shut the door.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           The girls pace, frantic. This is getting dire.

                                 JESS
                        We’ve already almost been caught, 
                        and that was in the middle of the 
                        night! When the sun comes up there 
                        will be people on the beach, we 
                        won’t be able to move him at all!

                                 ALICE
                        And someone somewhere’s going to 
                        start looking for him!

                                 JESS
                        Not to mention Ms. Carney and her 
                        husband will be here Monday - I 
                        can't leave a dead body in her 
                        house!

                                 FRANKIE
                        If we rent a car in the morning and 
                        get full coverage we could put him 
                        inside and just blow it up. 
                        Insurance would cover it.

                                 KIWI
                        That sounds good!

                                 BLAIR
                        I have some Enterprise rent-a-car 
                        points we can use--

                                 ALICE
                        No. Sorry, but you can’t burn bone.
                        (off their looks)
                        Bones.
                        (off their looks)
                        The TV show. Bones.
                                 KIWI
                        Maybe we should just call the 
                        police.

                                 BLAIR
                        I didn’t just suck an old school 
                        dick that had hair on the shaft to 
                        then give up and call the police!

                                 JESS
                        Jesus Christ! We’re never getting 
                        rid of this body! This body is 
                        going to follow us around for the 
                        rest of our lives. We’re gonna have 
                        to drag it around everywhere we go, 
                        like "Weekend at Barney’s" –

                                 FRANKIE
                        Oh my God, did you just say 
                        "Weekend at Barney's"?

                                 ALICE
                        Like the purple dinosaur?

                                 BLAIR
                        Or the high end clothing store?

                                 JESS
                        Oh my God, I did! 

           They all laugh hysterically, delirious with stress. The 
           laughter dies down, slowly, until there's nothing but 
           silence.

                                 JESS (CONT'D)
                        We did kill a man, though.

                        (sighing)
                        Yeah. / We did. 

           There’s a KNOCK at the door.

                                 JESS
                        (whispering)
                        Who the fuck is that?

                                 COP (O.S.)
                        POLICE! OPEN UP!

           The girls go white. Fuck. They all do shush signs and whisper-
           yell to each other.
                                 JESS
                        Fuck!

                                 BLAIR
                        The neighbors must have called the 
                        police! They must have been 
                        suspicious about the camera 
                        footage!

                                 JESS
                        Or maybe someone saw the body on 
                        the beach. Or in the garage. Or 
                        through the windows. Or--

                                 KIWI
                        What are we going to do?!

                                 COP
                        (pounding harder)
                        POLICE!

                                 FRANKIE
                        I’ll handle it. Turn out the lights 
                        and hide.

           They hide behind the couch and watch.

           INT. FOYER - CONTINUOUS (2:30AM)

           Frankie opens the door. It is indeed a COP (late 20s, looks 
           intense). He shines a flashlight in Frankie’s face.

                                 FRANKIE
                        Can I help you officer?

                                 COP
                        Step aside miss.

                                 FRANKIE
                        What’s this about?

                                 COP
                        Put your hands where I can see 
                        them.

                                 FRANKIE
                        (raising her hands)
                        Officer, I’m not resisting. I am 
                        cooperating--

                                 COP
                        Turn around, put your hands against 
                        the wall.
                                 FRANKIE
                        Officer--

                                 COP
                        (shouting)
                        I said hands against the wall!

           She does.

                                 FRANKIE
                        What are you doing?

                                 COP
                        I have reasonable suspicion to 
                        conduct a strip search.

           He does a quick search of her sides, then slips his hands 
           underneath her arms and starts groping her breasts and leans 
           against her with his body.

                                 FRANKIE
                        No! NO!

           Frankie instinctively knocks his hands down in a self-defense 
           motion, and knocks him out COLD with the back of her head.

                                 ALICE
                        OH FUCK!

                                 JESS
                        HOLY SHIT!

           The girls rush over to see the Cop lying in a heap on the 
           floor as Frankie’s rubs her head. They’re all like WTFFFFFF.

                                 BLAIR
                        Awesome! Now we have a dead body 
                        and an unconscious cop?! If we 
                        didn't look guilty before, we 
                        certainly do now! Frankie, what is 
                        wrong with you?!

                                 FRANKIE
                        Are you kidding? He was a rape cop! 
                        This is what they do! When they 
                        have dirt on you, they sexually 
                        assault you knowing you won’t 
                        report it! It happens all the time! 
                        In Oklahoma City, Daniel Holtzclaw 
                        assaulted 13 women.

           The girls look confused and unsure.
                                 FRANKIE (CONT'D)
                        Thirty percent of incarcerated 
                        women have reported sexual assault 
                        from officers. One in three-

                                 ALICE
                        Like Matt Dillon in “Crash”!

                                 BLAIR
                        Oh shit, that was really bad.

                                 KIWI
                        Okay, I get it now.

                                 JESS
                        Guys! We’re totally fucked right 
                        now! We need a plan!

                                 FRANKIE
                        Let’s just move this guy before 
                        those pervy neighbors come back to 
                        eat Blair out again.

           They all grab parts of the Cop’s body to lift him.

                                 JESS
                        On the count of three. One, two, 
                        three--

           They lift him and his uniform rips off - velcro style - 
           revealing a completely shaved and buff bod in a neon green g-
           string. There is a very, VERY long pause. This is clearly a 
           stripper.

                                 BLAIR
                        (confused)
                        How many strippers did you order?

                                 FRANKIE
                        Just one.

                                 JESS
                        Then who is this?

           Long beat of contemplation.

                                 FRANKIE
                        Let me see his dick.

                                 ALICE
                        (come again?)
                        Hmm?
                                 FRANKIE
                        The stripper I ordered had a dick 
                        pic in his ad. I can ID him by his 
                        dick.

           The shrug. They peek at his dick. Frankie takes a long look.

                                 KIWI
                        Ew! It’s circumcised?!
                        (off their look)
                        Nobody’s circumcised in Australia. 
                        It’s male genital mutilation. 

                                 FRANKIE
                        It’s hard to tell - it was hard in 
                        the picture. This one’s soft.

                                 ALICE
                        (breathing on her hand)
                        I can get it hard.

                                 ALL
                        No. / No. / No.

                                 FRANKIE
                        (gravely)
                        I need to see the dead guy's dick.

           INT. SEX SWING CLOSET - NIGHT

           The girls look at the dead guy’s dick. Frankie concentrates 
           on it, not sure.

                                 JESS
                        He was just in cold water...

                                 FRANKIE
                        Okay, I need to see the g-string 
                        guy’s dick again.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           She looks at the Cop’s dick again.

                                 FRANKIE
                        Okay. Yes. This is the stripper I 
                        ordered. This is Scotty with the 
                        Body.

                                 JESS
                        Then who’s the dead guy??
           INT. PETER’S CAR - NIGHT

           Peter chugs another Red Bull and tosses it on the floor of 
           his car with about 10 other empty cans. He looks crazed, his 
           eyes wide and red. A Spanish language CD blares.

                                 SPANISH INSTRUCTOR (O.S.) 
                        Este niño no es mi hijo.

                                 PETER
                        Este niño no es mi hijo.

                                 SPANISH LANGUAGE INSTRUCTOR (O.S.) 
                        This child is not my son.

           EXT. HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Peter’s car speeds past a waiting police car. Inside, the 
           GEORGIA STATE TROOPERS - GARY (40s) and CAROL (30s) get a 103-
           MPH speed reading and pull out to pursue.

           INT. PETER’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Peter sees the lights behind him. Fuck.

                                 PETER
                        No no no no nooooo...

           He pulls to the side of the road.

           The state troopers approach, Gary on the driver’s side, Carol 
           on the passenger’s. Peter rolls down his window.

                                 PETER (CONT'D)
                        (too loud)
                        Good morning officer!

                                 STATE TROOPER GARY
                        Sir have you been drinking tonight?

           He shines light in Peter’s red, non-blinking, glazed-over 
           eyes.

                                 PETER
                        (talking fast)
                        No. Absolutely not, officer. Well, 
                        I did some wine tasting. Italian 
                        reds, mostly. But that was hours 
                        ago. I’m completely sober, I assure 
                        you--
           ANGLE ON: Carol shines her flashlight on the floor of Peter’s 
           car, illuminating A LOT of used diapers that glow green. She 
           flashes Gary a look and takes out her gun.

                                 STATE TROOPER GARY
                        (drawing weapon)
                        Step out of the vehicle sir.

                                 PETER
                        But officer--

                                 STATE TROOPER GARY
                        NOW!

           Off Peter’s devastation...

           INT. DOWNSTAIRS BEDROOM - NIGHT

           The girls “carefully” place the unconscious Cop (NOTE: from 
           here on referred to as G-STRING GUY) onto Blair’s bed. He has 
           cold gel mask tied onto the lump on his head.

                                 ALICE
                        We should make sure nothing is 
                        broken...

           She touches up and down his legs, squeezes his torso, holds 
           his hand--

                                 FRANKIE
                        I think he’s fine.

                                 ALICE
                        Really fine.

           Jess puts a blanket on him. Frankie uncovers one foot.

                                 FRANKIE
                        That’s how everyone sleeps, right? 
                        One foot out?

                                 BLAIR
                        I have no idea how I sleep. I take 
                        my cat’s xanax and usually wake up 
                        naked on the floor.

                                 JESS
                        That sounds healthy.

                                 BLAIR
                        It’s one of the only joys I have 
                        left.
           Kiwi puts one of his arms behind his head, and has his other 
           hand do a “thumbs up”.

                       JESS
                                                FRANKIE
           Nice.
                                       Perfect.

                                 ALICE
                        (begrudgingly)
                        That’s really good.

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT

           Peter is in the middle of his field sobriety test, still in 
           his diaper. State Troopers Gary and Carol watch on.

           With the precision of a gymnast on a dangerous amount of 
           Adderal, Peter “power” walks quickly in a perfectly straight 
           line, spins around and recites the alphabet backwards while 
           touching his fingers to his nose, with great speed.

                                 PETER
                        Z-Y-X-W-V-U-T-S-R-Q-P-O-N-M-L-K-J-I-
                        H-G-F-E-D-C-B-A.

           Peter drops into a push up, turns that into a handstand, and 
           comes out of it gracefully in a back bend. Carol and Gary 
           watch, dumbfounded.

                                 STATE TROOPER CAROL
                        You only had to walk the line, sir.

                                 STATE TROOPER GARY
                        Are you a dancer, son?

                                 PETER
                        No. I’ve never done that before in 
                        my life.

                                 STATE TROOPER GARY
                        Well, since we can’t actually 
                        arrest you for having a car full of 
                        dirty diapers --

                                 STATE TROOPER CAROL
                        -- though we should be allowed to--

                                 STATE TROOPER GARY
                        (writing something down)
                        -- all we can do is give you a 
                        speeding ticket.
                                 PETER
                        I want you to know it will be my 
                        pleasure to pay this ticket.
                        (accepting the ticket, 
                         shaking their hands)
                        I appreciate you. I appreciate you.

                                 STATE TROOPER GARY
                        Slow down.

                                 PETER
                        Yes sir.

           Peter gets back into his car and slowly pulls out. He drives 
           responsibly for a few moments until he reaches the state line 
           then SPEEDS past the “Welcome to Florida” sign.

           INT. MANSION - NIGHT

           The girls are back in the living room, brainstorming.

                                 ALICE
                        I think this is good! I mean, the 
                        stripper’s here, he’s alive, he’s 
                        fine.

                                 JESS
                        We still got a dead guy in the sex 
                        swing.

                                 FRANKIE
                        Who is that guy?

                                 BLAIR
                        Who cares who he is? It’s better we 
                        don’t know.

                                 ALICE
                        It was weird he just showed up with 
                        no car...

                                 KIWI
                        Wait! How did the real stripper get 
                        here?

           There’s a quick beat, then they all run to the window and 
           see: a (pimped out) SmartCar in the driveway.

           INT. GARAGE - NIGHT

           The SmartCar is now in the garage, and the girls carry the 
           Dead Guy in.
                                 JESS
                        Here’s what we’re gonna do: we’re 
                        gonna drive him to some alligator 
                        bog, dump him out, bring the smart 
                        car back, wake up G-String Guy, 
                        tell him he hit his head, Blair’s 
                        gonna give him a shit load of cash--

                                 BLAIR
                        What?

                                 JESS
                        --and we’re home fucking free.

                                 ALL
                        Great / Amen / Ya.

           Frankie opens the SmartCar door. The front seat is pushed up 
           VERY far.

                                 FRANKIE
                        What the fuck?

           She opens the “trunk” to find HUGE speakers.

                                 BLAIR
                        Trashy.

                                 FRANKIE
                        Why would anyone pimp out a 
                        SmartCar?

                                 ALICE
                        Is he even going to fit in there??

                                 JESS
                        Oh, he’ll fit.

                                                 SMASH CUT TO:

           The Dead Guy is in the passenger seat. The girls slam the 
           door - it hits his knee and bounces back open.

                                 ALL
                        (re: door slam)
                        Oof...

                                                 SMASH CUT TO:

           The girls have now positioned Dead Guy with his head on the 
           floor, feet coming out the moon roof. Way too conspicuous.

                                                 SMASH CUT TO:
           The girls have smushed him inside, his face pressing against 
           the windshield. It looks sad/bad.

                                 JESS
                        Wait. I can’t dump him by myself. 
                        He’s too heavy. Someone needs to 
                        come with me.

                                 ALICE
                        I’ll go. I’m Jess’ best friend, I 
                        should be there to support her.

                                 KIWI
                        First of all, so am I, but also, I 
                        can fit in the car.

                                 ALICE
                        BITCH!

           Alice raises her hands like she’s going to claw Kiwi. The 
           other girls pull her away.

                                 JESS
                        What is going on here???

                                 BLAIR
                        Alice, it’s gotta be Kiwi - she's 
                        tiny.

                                 ALICE
                        FINE!! 

           Kiwi and Jess get into the car as the girls try to stuff Dead 
           Guy in with them.

                                 JESS
                        Maybe if you lay him across our 
                        laps?

           They put him in, his head in Jess' lap, his body contorted 
           and legs in front of Kiwi's face. They push the door closed - 
           blood spurts out onto Jess' face and hair. 

                                 JESS (CONT'D)
                        (sad/defeated)
                        No...

                                                   SMASH CUT:

           INT. SEX SWING CLOSET - NIGHT

           The girls throw the Dead Guy’s body onto the sex swing. It 
           pretty much misses and his body hits the floor.
                                 BLAIR
                        Who cares.

           They shut the door.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           The girls sit in the living room, exhausted, hungover, and 
           out of ideas. Jess has wiped her face but still has blood 
           matted in her hair and on her clothes.

                                 KIWI
                        In Australia there was a guy who 
                        cooked his girlfriend and ate her.
                        (off everyone’s look)
                        I’m just mentioning it because it 
                        was a big story there! I’m not 
                        saying it’s the best idea!
                        (beat)
                        But it’s kind of the best idea!

           Beat.

                                 JESS
                        I mean, I did eat rattlesnake in 
                        Sedona once. I thought I couldn't 
                        handle it but when I tried it... I 
                        actually liked it. 

                                 ALICE
                        I think human meat tastes like 
                        chicken. I could handle that - I 
                        eat chicken almost everyday. 
                        (pointing to herself)
                        Real chicken-head.

                                 BLAIR
                        How would we even do that?! 

                                 FRANKIE
                        I think there's a grill out back. 
                        That would be easiest to clean up. 
                        And probably taste best.

                                 BLAIR
                        No! I mean you'd have to like cut 
                        him up!

                                 KIWI
                        I can't cut him up. I'm vegetarian.

                                 ALICE
                        WE KNOW!
                                 FRANKIE
                        But you'd eat him?

                                 KIWI
                        I don't eat animals. You can still 
                        be vegetarian and eat a human.

                                 BLAIR
                        I can't eat a person!

                                 ALICE
                        Let's cover him in Vegimite. 
                        (pointing to Kiwi)
                        This one will eat the shit out of 
                        him.

                                 JESS
                        WHAT THE FUCK ARE WE TALKING 
                        ABOUT?! Jesus. This is INSANE.
                        (then)
                        We need to come clean.

                                 BLAIR
                        We can’t come clean now! It’s 
                        obvious we’ve been trying to cover 
                        this up - we’ll go to jail.

                                 ALICE
                        But it was an ACCIDENT!

                                 JESS
                        We know it was an accident Alice, 
                        but he’s still dead and we moved 
                        the body. Like, a lot. This is why 
                        I should’ve said no to drugs!

                                 ALICE
                        Well it wouldn’t have happened if 
                        Frankie hadn’t bought us the drugs!

                                 FRANKIE
                        It was Blair’s idea to order the 
                        stripper!

                                 BLAIR
                        Oh, of course! Frankie’s never to 
                        blame! She’s such a good person, 
                        she’s fixing the world!

                                 FRANKIE
                        Oh fuck you! You act like everyone 
                        else is so stupid for not being a 
                        merciless asshole like you!
                                 BLAIR
                        No, you’re the asshole!

                                 ALICE
                        You’re kind of both assholes.

                      BLAIR
                                                FRANKIE
           You stay out of this.
                                       Seriously.

                                 KIWI
                        No offense, Alice, but you’re the 
                        biggest asshole of all.

                                 ALICE
                        Excuse me bitch?! I’m a fucking 
                        sweetheart!

                                 KIWI
                        You call me Kiwi even though I told 
                        you it was a slur, and you know I’m 
                        vegetarian and I saw you put bacon 
                        in my asparagus soup.

                                 ALICE
                        That was an American joke! Get a 
                        sense of humor you Crocodile Dundee 
                        bitch!

                                 JESS
                        Just stop! Jesus! This is bad 
                        enough without you two going at it.

                                 BLAIR
                        And I thought your bridal shower 
                        was a nightmare.

                                 ALICE
                        What are you talking about? She 
                        didn’t have a bridal shower.
                        (beat, realizing)
                        ...you had a bridal shower?

                                 JESS
                        No, I didn’t. I mean, I did, but it 
                        wasn’t a big thing. Peter’s mom 
                        really wanted to plan it, and it 
                        was mostly work friends--

                                 ALICE
                        But Blair went?!

                                 BLAIR
                        It wasn’t even open bar. True 
                        nightmare.
                                 ALICE
                        How could you not invite me?

                                 JESS
                        I knew we’d have this weekend to 
                        have fun and that was more of a 
                        formality, for Peter’s family, 
                        really--

                                 ALICE
                        UGH PETER! He fuckin’ sucks! He’s 
                        boring and annoying and so 
                        codependent. And I know he doesn’t 
                        like me because he’s jealous!

                                 JESS
                        He’s not jealous of you.

                                 ALICE
                        Then why would you not have your 
                        best friend at your bridal shower?!

                                 JESS
                        (losing it)
                        You wanna know why? Because I knew 
                        if I had invited you, you wouldn’t 
                        have let me talk to anyone else! 
                        You monopolize my time, and then 
                        you make me feel guilty for not 
                        spending enough time with you! I 
                        can’t win!

                                 ALICE
                        I don’t monopolize your time! I 
                        just try to make the most of it 
                        because you never make the effort 
                        to even see me!

                                 JESS
                        That’s not fair!

                                 ALICE
                        It’s true! You’re always at work or 
                        you already have plans or you’re -
                        (indicating Kiwi)
                        - Skyping with other people! It’s 
                        like I don’t exist to you anymore. 
                        And now I’m alone.

                                 JESS
                        That's not my fault! That’s your  
                        fault! You’re just... too much.
                                 ALICE
                        What does that mean?

                                 JESS
                        It means you’re right! I don’t make 
                        time for you! Because you’re loud 
                        and pushy! We’re not roommates 
                        anymore, and I'd rather hang out 
                        with people who don’t guilt me all 
                        the time and who don’t leave 
                        bruises from their hugs! Stop 
                        living in the past and move on, 
                        Alice!

           Alice holds back tears.

                                 ALICE
                        I’m sorry. I didn’t... I won’t 
                        bother you anymore, Jess.

           Alice walks out of the living room. The girls stand, shell 
           shocked.

                                 KIWI
                        Wow. Jess... that was really harsh.

                                 JESS
                        Please stop. I can’t! I can’t 
                        handle any more guilt! I can’t 
                        handle any of this anymore! You're 
                        all to blame for forcing me to have 
                        this stupid bachelorette.  

                                 FRANKIE
                        Jess--

                                 JESS
                        We’re going to turn ourselves in.
                        The end. And I’m going upstairs to 
                        shower this blood off me. I want to 
                        look good for my mug shot.

           Jess goes up to her room.

                                 JESS (CONT'D)
                        (yelling back down)
                        And self waxing is NOT weird, and I 
                        don’t appreciate your hair removal 
                        shaming.

           Jess SLAMS the door of the bathroom. Frankie, Blair and Kiwi 
           sit in silence.
           INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Jess is on the toilet, crying softly while peeing. She feels 
           bad for what she said to Alice, for having to go to jail, for 
           everything.

           She flushes the toilet, plugs in her flatiron to heat up, and 
           gets in the shower.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME

           The girls sit in awkward silence. Suddenly a loud, digital 
           BEEP goes off.

                                 FRANKIE
                        What is that?

           The girls look around. It BEEPS again.

                                 BLAIR
                        Where’s it coming from?

           Frankie follows the sound under the couch, and finds a cell 
           phone.

                                 KIWI
                        His phone must have fallen out when 
                        we ripped off his shirt!

           They look at the screen, which reads: FINDING MY iPHONE. The 
           BEEP goes off again. 

                                 BLAIR
                        Someone’s looking for this guy.

                                 KIWI
                        Turn it off!

                                 FRANKIE
                        I’m trying!

           Alice, red faced from crying, hears the commotion and returns 
           to the room.

                                 ALICE
                        What’s going on?

                                 KIWI
                        Someone’s trying to track this 
                        phone!

                                 FRANKIE
                        It’s off. It’s off.
           The girls sigh a breath of relief.

                                 BLAIR
                        Thank God.

           DING-DONG!

           INT. FOYER - MOMENTS LATER (4AM)

           The girls hurry to the front door. (The windows to the side 
           of the door have now been covered by beach towels.) Kiwi 
           looks through the peep hole. It’s two guys: DETECTIVE FRAZIER 
           (30s, plain clothes) and DETECTIVE RUIZ (30s, plain clothes) 
           holding up badges.

                                 DETECTIVE FRAZIER
                        I’m Detective Frazier and this is 
                        Detective Ruiz. Have you seen this 
                        man?

           He holds up a pic of the dead guy.

                                 DETECTIVE RUIZ
                        We tracked his phone to this house. 
                        We know he’s in there.

           The girls know this is the end. They look at each other. 
           Frankie shrugs. Blair nods. They have to do this. They open 
           the door to the detectives.

                                 ALICE
                        He’s dead.

           EXT. PORT ST. LUCIE, FLORIDA - GAS STATION - NIGHT

           Peter pulls into a rural, seedy gas station. He hurriedly 
           jumps out to get gas. He swipes his card. It reads: 
           TRANSACTION FAILED.

                                 PETER
                        What the--

           His cell phone rings. He answers.

                                 AUTOMATED VOICE

           Peter's hand are legit shaking from all the Red Bull. He goes 
           to press one, but his finger accidentally hits two.

                                 AUTOMATED VOICE (CONT'D)
                        Thank you for pressing two.

                                 PETER
                        No!!!

                                 AUTOMATED VOICE
                        Your card has been suspended due to

                        Thank you!

                                 PETER
                        No no no no come on!

           Peter goes through his wallet - no cash. He opens the 
           passenger door and goes through the glove compartment and 
           center console - nothing. He looks around the gas station.

                                                   SMASH CUT:

           MONTAGE:

           - Peter furiously squeegees down a mini-van’s front window 
           (still in diaper). He extends his hand for a tip. An OLD MAN 
           pulls a gun out of his pocket and points it at Peter, then 
           pulls out, almost running over Peter’s foot.

           - He squeegees another car - A RICH WOMAN gives him a nickel.

           - A school bus of FOOTBALL PLAYERS point and snicker as he 
           wipes their windows.

           - A semi pulls up. Peter, sweaty, and now dirty, climbs up on 
           the trailer to wipe down the window. The owner hops out.

                                 TRUCK DUDE
                        Hey, thanks man.

                                 PETER
                        My pleasure!

                                 TRUCK DUDE
                        You need any more meth?

                                 PETER
                        Oh, no! Thanks! Just looking for 
                        some gas money to get to my fiancee 
                        who cheated on me!
                                 TRUCK DUDE
                        Whoa! That’s crazy! You wanna suck 
                        my dick for $15?

                                 PETER
                        Ummm... I’m good, thanks.

           Peter counts his money: he’s made five dollars and change. He 
           approaches a pick-up's window with his squeegee.

                                 PETER (CONT'D)
                        Hi there sir! May I?

           A DAD-looking motherfucker jumps out.

                                 DAD
                        (yelling)
                        Hell no, homo!

                                 PETER
                        Um, okay?

                                 DAD
                        (quietly, to Peter)
                        Let me suck your dick real fast.

                                 PETER
                        ...no thank you.

                                 DAD
                        Okay. You got any meth?

           He flashes cash. Peter gets an idea. He looks over to the 
           convenience store and sees the semi-truck driver is inside, 
           eating an egg sandwich with two donuts as bread.

           INSERTS:

           - Peter takes Dad’s thick stack of cash.

           - Peter pockets some of the cash. GAS MONEY BABY!

           - He approaches the Truck Driver.

                                 TRUCK DUDE
                        Oh good, you here to suck my dick?

           - Peter hands rest of cash to Truck Driver.

           - Truck Driver hands Peter a baggie of meth. Peter pinches it 
           with his fingers, not wanting to touch it.

           - Peter hands the meth to Dad.
                                 DAD
                        Thanks, man! You still a no-go on 
                        that BJ? I can get you off in under 
                        a minute.

                                 PETER
                        No, thanks. But, actually, you know 
                        what? I want to introduce you to 
                        someone.

           EXT. PORT ST. LUCIE - GAS STATION - NIGHT

           From a distance, we see Peter introduce Truck Driver and Dad. 
           They shake hands hello, almost sweetly. Peter leaves the 
           store. The two guys talk for a moment, then head to the 
           bathroom together. Peter smiles.

           INT. SEX SWING CLOSET - NIGHT

           The detectives look at the corpse, which is in a heap on the 
           ground.

                                 ALICE
                        He must have fallen out of the 
                        swing.

           The detectives look at each other, then at the girls, who are 
           mentally preparing themselves for jail.

                      BLAIR
           It just happened so fast--
                                                FRANKIE
                                       We all witnessed it - it was 
                                       an accident.

                                 FRAZIER
                        You ladies are lucky.

                                 RUIZ
                        This is a dangerous man.

                                 BLAIR
                        What are you saying right now?

                                 ALICE
                        Oh my god.

                                 FRAZIER
                        He robbed a bank and killed two 
                        security guards. The whole state’s 
                        looking for this guy.
                                 RUIZ
                        He escaped on foot, and he must 
                        have tried to enter the house for 
                        cover.

                                 KIWI
                        So we’re not in trouble!?

                                 FRAZIER
                        It sounds to me like you have a 
                        pretty clear case of self defense 
                        here.

                                 BLAIR
                        So... just, to clarify: we won’t be 
                        charged with anything?

                                 FRAZIER
                        I can't see a world where the DA 
                        would press charges.

           The girls are so relieved! Alice starts crying tears of 
           happiness. Kiwi crosses herself.

                                 ALL
                        HOLY SHIT! / Thank you God!

           INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Jess gets out of the shower, and starts blow drying her hair.

           INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Frankie knocks on Jess’ bedroom door (bathroom is in the 
           bedroom. En suite!). 

                                 FRANKIE
                        Jess! We’re not going to jail!

           She tries to open the door but it’s locked.

           INT. BATHROOM - UPSTAIRS - SIMULTANEOUS

           Jess can’t hear Frankie over the blow dryer.

           INT. BATHROOM - UPSTAIRS - NIGHT

           Frankie gives up and heads back downstairs.
           INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           In the living room, Blair, Kiwi and Alice are questioned by 
           the detectives. Frankie joins them. Ruiz hands Alice a glass 
           of water.

                                 FRAZIER
                        Did he say anything that might be 
                        relevant?

                                 BLAIR
                        No. He didn’t really say anything.

                                 RUIZ
                        Did he enter the house with a bag 
                        of any kind?

                                 ALICE
                        I don’t think so?

                                 FRAZIER
                        (intense)
                        Think.

                                 KIWI
                        No. Not that I remember.

                                 RUIZ
                        It’s really important that you 
                        remember for sure.

                                 FRAZIER
                        He made off with over half a 
                        million dollars. We need to locate 
                        that bag.

           Frankie sees something on the muted TV: it’s the local news, 
           and they’re doing a SPECIAL REPORT on the robbery. They show 
           the dead guys’ mug shot. The chyron says: “Police are also 
           searching for these fugitives” and pictures come on screen of 
           THE TWO DETECTIVES IN THE LIVING ROOM!

                                 DETECTIVE FRAZIER
                        Is there anywhere he could have 
                        stashed it?

           Frankie does her best not to freak out as she puts together 
           that these guys are looking for the money. She’s the only one 
           seeing this.

                                 FRANKIE
                        Blair! I need a tampon.

           Blair looks at her confused. The detectives are weirded out.
                                 FRANKIE (CONT'D)
                        (slow, deliberate)
                        I need the biggest tampon ever, my 
                        flow is out of control. I think you 
                        locked some in your side dresser 
                        drawer?

                                 BLAIR
                        No, I put our--

                                 FRANKIE
                        I need one, NOW.

           She smiles to the detectives, who are like ew. Blair looks at 
           the Detectives, and then back at Frankie who nods.

                                 FRANKIE (CONT'D)
                        (re: detectives)
                        I need... a tampon.

                                 BLAIR
                        One tampon, coming up!

           INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Blair enters the room and eyes the side table where she 
           stashed their cell phones: inches away from the unconscious G-
           String Guy. She fumbles to find the key to the drawer.

                                 BLAIR
                        (whispering to herself)
                        What the fuck is going on here...

           She opens the drawer and powers on one of the phones. It 
           immediately gets a million texts: DING DING DING DING.

           This wakes G-String Guy up. He sees Blair, touches the lump 
           on his head - he gets scared.

                                 BLAIR (CONT'D)
                        Shhh...

                                 G-STRING GUY
                        DON’T HURT ME!

           INT. LIVING ROOM - SIMULTANEOUS

                                 G-STRING GUY (O.S.)
                        PLEASE DON’T HURT ME!

           The detectives hear the commotion.
                                 RUIZ
                        What’s going on in there?

           Frankie sees this as her opportunity to turn off the TV, 
           while fumbling with the remote, accidentally un-mutes it.

                                 NEWSCASTER
                        All residents should keep their 
                        doors locked, and in accordance 
                        with Florida state law, if you see 
                        something, shoot something.

           Frazier turns around and sees the TV report with their faces 
           still plastered on it.

                                 FRAZIER
                        Shit.

           Ruiz turns around and sees it too. They look at each other, 
           knowing their cover’s blown. They draw their guns. The girls 
           are terrified.

                                 FRAZIER (CONT’D)
                        (to Ruiz, re: Blair in 
                         other room)
                        Go deal with that.

           Ruiz leaves.

           INT. BLAIR’S BEDROOM - CONTINOUS

           G-String Guy cowers in the corner as Blair tries to calm him 
           down.

                                 BLAIR
                        We’re not going to hurt you... 
                        again.

           Ruiz enters to Blair and G-String Guy.

                                 RUIZ
                        Don’t move.

           Blair and G-String Guy scream at the sight of him.

                                 RUIZ (CONT'D)
                        Put the cell phone down and your 
                        hands where I can see them.

           Blair puts the phone down and they put their arms in the air.

                                 RUIZ (CONT’D)
                        LET’S GO!
           He forces them out of the bedroom and into the living room.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - SIMULTANEOUS

           Ruiz pushes Blair and G-String Guy into the group.

           Alice makes a run for the sliding door to the beach - Frazier 
           chases after her and grabs her by the hair -- her extensions 
           rip out in his hands. This only angers him, and he violently 
           grabs her real hair and aggressively pushes her back with 
           everyone else.

                                 FRAZIER
                        Get on the ground!

                                 RUIZ
                        Play time’s over. We want that 
                        fucking money. NOW!

                                 FRANKIE
                        We told you we don’t know where it 
                        is!

                                 RUIZ
                        (cocking his gun)
                        Bullshit!

                                 FRANKIE
                        Look, I know you've been forced 
                        into this by a lack of economic 
                        opportunity and the systematic 
                        oppression that the--

                                 RUIZ
                        SHUT UP!

           INT. JESS’S BATHROOM

           Jess turns off the blow drier and looks for towels - none.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Alice looks upstairs. She remembers Jess is there.

                                 ALICE
                        BLAIR DID YOU GET THAT TAMPON? 
                        FRANKIE NEEDED A TAMPON! HOW DARE 
                        YOU DENY THIS WOMAN A TAMPON!
                                 RUIZ
                        Shut the fuck up about the fucking 
                        tampon!

           INT. JESS’ BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Jess hears this, and knows something’s up. She opens her door 
           onto the breezeway. Completely naked, she sneaks to the 
           balcony and peers over to see her friends being tied together 
           with duct tape.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Frazier holds his gun on the girls as Ruiz tapes their wrists 
           together behind them. He binds them together so they are 
           forced to sit back to back, including G-String Guy.

                                 RUIZ
                        Jay double-crossed us and took off 
                        with OUR money.
                        (getting in Blair’s face)
                        Where did he put it?

                                 BLAIR
                        We told you - we don’t know where 
                        the money is.

                                 KIWI
                        We never saw it!

                                 FRANKIE
                        I don’t even like money - it’s the 
                        root of all evil!

                                 BLAIR
                        I can wire you $50,000 if you let 
                        us go right now.

                                 ALICE
                        Minus the cost of my extensions!

           Ruiz pistol whips Alice across the face. He then gets REAL 
           close.

                                 RUIZ
                        (sinister)
                        My money’s here. And I’m going to 
                        find it.
                        (to Frazier)
                        Shoot anyone who moves.

           He heads upstairs. Jess hides herself in her bathroom.
           INT. ENSUITE BATHROOM - NIGHT

           She hears Ruiz, who is now rifling through the bedroom right 
           next to her. She closes her eyes and steadies her resolve.

           INT. JESS’ BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Ruiz finishes looking through Jess' stuff and throws her 
           suitcase against the wall.

                                 RUIZ
                        FUCK!

           INT. ENSUITE BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Ruiz, still with a gun in hand, enters the completely dark 
           bathroom. When he turns on the lights, a nude Jess SPRAYS him 
           in the face with hair spray.

                                 RUIZ
                        JESUS!!!

           He covers his face with one hand, and points his gun towards 
           Jess with the other. She takes her HOT FLAT IRON and CLAMPS 
           down on his hand! He drops his gun.

           They both dive for it, but Jess is just a moment faster. She 
           points it to Ruiz. He starts to open his mouth--

                                 JESS
                        If you make a sound I’ll shoot.

           Ruiz nods and looks her body up and down.

                                 JESS (CONT'D)
                        (whisper-yelling)
                        Don’t look at my body!

           She tosses Ruiz the pink furry handcuffs from Alice’s 
           bachelorette kit.

                                 JESS (CONT'D)
                        Handcuff yourself to the pipe under 
                        the sink.

           Ruiz hesitates. Jess cocks his gun. She’s not fucking around. 
           He does, begrudgingly.

           Jess grabs a wax strip and furiously rubs it. Ruiz is 
           scared/confused - what the fuck is she doing?
           Jess takes the wax strip and presses it on Ruiz’s mouth, 
           rubbing it to seal it closed.

                                 RUIZ
                        YOOOOMMMMMFFFFF---

           She flips him off as she turns off the light and closes the 
           door behind her. Still nude ;)

           INT. UPSTAIRS BREEZWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Jess, gun in hand, stands at the edge of the breezeway to 
           survey the situation in the living room below. She’s covering 
           her breasts with one hand and her vagina with the gun. She 
           sees Frazier holding his gun on her friends.

                                 FRAZIER
                        (yelling up to Ruiz)
                        Hurry up man!

           Jess aims her gun at Frazier’s head - she lines him up 
           perfectly.

           Her finger begins to put pressure on the trigger - when 
           suddenly he moves - and Alice is in her cross hairs! Jess 
           puts the gun down, quickly. Holy shit. That was CLOSE.

           Frazier keeps nervously moving in front of her friends, and 
           Jess realizes that there’s no way she can get a clear shot.

           Alice looks up and sees Jess. They share an intense moment.

                                 ALICE
                        (silently mouthing)
                        RUN.

                                 JESS
                        (silently mouthing)
                        No.

                                 FRAZIER
                        You know what?! When we find the 
                        fucking money, we’re going have to 
                        shoot you all anyway so you don’t 
                        call the police, so how’s this? 
                        I’ll kill each one of you until 
                        someone tells.

           He takes his gun and puts it to Alice’s head.

                                 FRAZIER (CONT'D)
                        We’ll start with you, you fuckin’ 
                        fake hair little whore.
           ALICE SCREAMS.

                      FRANKIE
                                                BLAIR
           NO!!!
                                       STOP!!!

           Jess has to do something!! SHE HOLDS HER ARMS OUT AND JUMPS 
           off the second floor breezeway and LANDS on Frazier!

           The landing is not graceful and very painful. Both their guns 
           scatter across the ground.

                       KIWI
                                                ALICE
           Holy shit!
                                       Yes, bitch!

           Frazier and Jess, both dazed, struggle to get up. Frazier’s 
           arm seems to be dislocated. Jess starts to crawl over towards 
           one of the guns when Frazier jumps on her, and PUNCHES her in 
           the face with his good arm.

                                 ALICE (CONT'D)
                        Not her beautiful face! She’s 
                        getting married in a month you 
                        monster!

           Jess struggles and knees Frazier in the BALLS. He recoils.

                                 KIWI
                        Look!

           Kiwi nods her head over to the second gun, which has slid a 
           few feet away from the group. The group looks to each other 
           and nods: they gotta get that gun.

                                 KIWI (CONT'D)
                        Everybody push - one, two, three!

           They stand-up, outward-bound style, by pushing into each 
           other and make their way over to the gun.

           Jess and Frazier continue to fight, and Jess’ face is getting 
           pretty gory. Frazier crawls closer to his gun. Jess grabs a 
           very ugly modern sculpture off a side table and hits him with 
           it hard, slowing him down.

                                 BLAIR
                        Okay, one -

                                 FRANKIE
                        - two -

                                 G-STRING GUY
                        - three!

           They squat down, and Alice grabs the gun!
                                 ALICE
                        I got it! Point me in his 
                        direction!

           The group shimmies clockwise so that the gun is facing 
           towards Frazier.

           Frazier looks up to see Alice has the gun!

           Frazier then looks over and sees the first gun under the 
           couch. He frantically lunges for it (Jess tries to stop him 
           but can’t) while Alice tries to aim the gun.

                                 ALICE (CONT'D)
                        I don’t have a shot!!!
                        (to G-String Guy)
                        Your leg is in the way!

                                 G-STRING GUY
                        Oh shit!

           Frazier puts his hand on the gun!

           G-String nimbly lifts his leg up and puts it over Frankie’s 
           shoulder.

           Frazier lifts his gun!

           Alice, now with a clear shot, closes her eyes, and SHOOTS 
           FRAZIER TWICE!

           He falls onto the floor over in pain. The gun slides out of 
           his hand.

                                 JESS
                        OH MY--

                                 ALICE
                        YEAHHHH! I FUCKING SHOT YOU! I 
                        FUCKIN' ROCK!

           Jess limps over to Frazier’s gun, and kicks it away from him. 
           She then goes over to the group, and takes the gun from Alice 
           and continues to point it at Frazier.

           Frazier screams in pain.

                                 FRANKIE
                        (to Frazier)
                        You were sooo rude to us.

                                 KIWI
                        That’s karma, man.
                                 BLAIR
                        (to Jess)
                        Are you okay?

                                 JESS
                        Yeah, I’m okay.

                                 FRANKIE
                        Your body is amazing!

           She gives them a big nude hug.

                       JESS
                                                ALICE
               (crying)
                                         (crying hysterically)
           Alice, I’m so sorry --
                                       -- no, I’m so sorry! --
           -- you’re such a good friend, 
           you’re my best friend --
                                       -- you’ve always been my best 
                                       friend!!
           -- and I’ll never take you 
           for granted again --
                                       -- even if you do, it’s like, 
                                       whatever! You’re my best 
                                       friend!!!
           -- I’ll never do it again. I 
           love you so much.
                                       -- I love you so much!!!

                                 ALICE (CONT'D)
                        I know I come on too strong 
                        sometimes--

                                 JESS
                        It’s what makes you awesome. I take 
                        you for granted because I know 
                        you’ll always be there. But I can’t 
                        imagine the thought of not having 
                        you in my life. I love you.

                                 ALICE
                        I love you too. 

           More hugging. 

                                 ALICE (CONT'D)
                        And I'm sorry I said Peter sucks. 
                        He doesn't. One time I even had a 
                        sex dream about him and I didn't 
                        tell you. 

                                 JESS
                        Cool. Okay, let me cut you guys 
                        out!

           She goes over to the utensil drawer - only spoons!
                                 JESS (CONT'D)
                        Shit, okay, I gotta go find some 
                        scissors.

                                 RUIZ (O.S.)
                        Drop the gun you naked piece of 
                        shit.

           She looks up to see RUIZ! HE ESCAPED AND IS HOLDING THE GUN 
           THAT JESS KICKED AWAY! (Also, he has clown mouth: the skin 
           around his mouth is red and irritated from the wax strips.)

                                 FRANKIE
                        Don’t body shame her!

                                 RUIZ
                        Shut up! Drop the gun!

           Jess, realizing she has no choice, slowly places the gun on 
           the ground and kicks it over to Ruiz.

                                 RUIZ (CONT'D)
                        (holding up the keys)
                        They were taped to the handcuffs 
                        you fucking idiot.

           He throws them at her. Jess shakes her head. She blew it.

                                 RUIZ (CONT'D)
                        You’re all fucking dead.

           He points the gun at Alice. Jess steps in front of Alice.

                                 RUIZ (CONT'D)
                        Whatever.

           He cocks the gun. Jess closes her eyes. BAM!!!

           A CAR SMASHES THROUGH

           THE

           FUCKING

           WALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

           AND FUCKING HITS RUIZ!!!!!!!!

           ......................................THAT MOTHERFUCKER DEAD.

           As the dust clears, the shocked girls watch Peter, filthy and 
           dazed, get out of the car in nothing but a diaper. He looks 
           insane. He grabs his chest and collapses.
                                 JESS
                        Peter!

           As we begin to hear sirens in the distance, we...

                                                    FADE OUT.

           EXT. MANSION DRIVEWAY - EARLY MORNING

           Cops retrieve a duffel bag full money from the mailbox (which 
           is a miniature model of the house). Other cops talk to 
           Frankie, Blair, Alice and Kiwi, who all huddle under a 
           blanket together on the neighbors front porch while Lea and 
           Pietro hand them hot tea. Lea massages Blair. Blair enjoys 
           it.

                                 OFFICER FOGEL
                        We had the fugitive surrounded. He 
                        must have seen lights on in the 
                        house and figured it was his best 
                        chance at getting cover.

                                 CAPTAIN PHILLIPS
                        You ladies are incredibly lucky. 
                        And because you killed a dangerous 
                        criminal, I’m going to speak to the 
                        mayor about giving you a key to the 
                        city.

                                 BLAIR
                        Would we have to come back to 
                        Miami?

                                 CAPTAIN PHILLIPS
                        Yes--

                                 LEA
                        We have a guest room...

                                 PIETRO
                        It sleeps 12...

                      FRANKIE
                                                BLAIR
           No thanks.
                                       We’ll think about it.

           ANGLE ON: Peter lies unconscious on a gurney in the back of 
           an ambulance, with an IV in his arm. Jess sits next to him 
           (now dressed in a pink bathrobe that says “BRIDE TO BE!”), 
           while a PARAMEDIC (20s, Jamaican woman) explains his 
           diagnosis.
                                 PARAMEDIC
                        He suffered a cardiac episode due 
                        to inhumane level of taurine and 
                        adderall in his system. But he’ll 
                        be fine.

                                 JESS
                        Thank God.

                                 PARAMEDIC
                        But we also found him in an adult 
                        diaper, so when he recovers I 
                        recommend a psychiatric evaluation.

                                 JESS
                        Thanks. I’ll bring it up.

           The paramedic leaves.

                                 PETER
                        (one eye open)
                        Did she leave?

                                 JESS
                        Yeah.

                                 PETER
                        I farted really bad earlier and I 
                        didn’t want her to know I was awake 
                        for it.

                                 JESS
                        I’m so sorry that I let you worry 
                        like that.

                                 PETER
                        I know you didn’t mean to.

                                 JESS
                        I can't believe you drove down 
                        here.

                                 PETER
                        It’s just... you know, with what 
                        happened with my ex... and my other 
                        ex... and my other--

                                 JESS
                        I would never do that to you.
                        I love you so much.

                                 PETER
                        (CRYING WITH TEARS)
                        Do you like my dick???
           Jess, can’t help but kind of laugh.

                                 JESS
                        I love it.

                                 PETER
                        You do??

                                 JESS
                        Yes.

                                 PETER
                        (SMILES - STILL CRYING)
                        Cool.

           They kiss.

                                 JESS & PETER
                        Ow.

           They’re both bruised and swollen. They kiss more gently.

                                                FADE TO BLACK.

           INT. CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

           A sign reads: CONGRATS COUNCILWOMAN ANGELO! A victory party 
           is in full swing. Jess and Peter's faces are still kinda 
           busted. Jess sits next to Alice at a table.

                                 BUSINESSMAN
                        Congrats, Councilwoman. You should 
                        be proud of yourself. You fought 
                        hard. 

                                 JESS
                        I really, really did. Thank you.

           He leaves, and Jess turns her attention back to Alice.

                                 ALICE
                        You sure you don’t want to hang 
                        with Peter for a little while?

                                 JESS
                        Nah, I wanna hang with you.

           Alice beams.

                                 JESS (CONT'D)
                        Plus, I think he's enjoying the 
                        attention.
           ANGLE ON: three elderly women talking to Peter and fawning 
           over him.

           Alice pulls out her phone.

                                 ALICE
                        Okay, So this is the guy Kiwi set 
                        me up with in Australia.

           Alice and Kiwi show Jess a photo of a ripped guy on the 
           beach.

                                 JESS
                        He’s really hot.

                                 KIWI
                        In Australia, you can’t throw a 
                        boomerang without hitting a hot 
                        guy.

                                 JESS
                        (to Alice)
                        A month is so long! I’m going to 
                        miss you!

                                 KIWI
                        I think she’ll be there longer than 
                        that. She’s a 9 in Australia.

           Alice blushes.

           ANGLE ON: Frankie introducing an OLDER COUPLE to her date: 
           THE G-STRING GUY! They are super cutesy together.

                                 OLDER GENTLEMAN
                        So how did you two meet?

                                 G-STRING GUY
                        Well, technically we didn’t 
                        introduce ourselves until that time 
                        in my lawyer’s office --

                                 FRANKIE
                        -- right, yeah. He was pressing 
                        charges against me, aggravated 
                        assault.

                                 G-STRING GUY
                        We settled out of court.

           G-String Guy holds her hand. The older husband is bewildered. 
           The older wife nods and smiles - she's like: 8=======D
           EXT. BAR AREA - LATER

           Kiwi stands in line for a drink. Tobey goes up to her.

                                 TOBEY
                        (flirty)
                        Hey Pippa - can I buy you a free 
                        drink?

                                 KIWI
                        Please. But call me Kiwi. All my 
                        best friends do.

           ANGLE ON: Blair dances with her 4-year-old son BENJAMIN. She 
           kisses him and puts him down. He runs over to Frankie.

                                 BENJAMIN
                        Auntie Frankie - will you dance 
                        with me?

                                 FRANKIE
                        (to G-String guy)
                        You mind?

                                 G-STRING GUY
                        Go for it.
                        (to kid)
                        Don’t get too handsy.

           Frankie takes Benjamin’s hand and joins Blair on the dance 
           floor.

                                 FRANKIE
                        Do they teach him to dance at 
                        public school?

                                 BLAIR
                        No, he goes to ballet twice a week. 
                        But public school is a good way for 
                        him to socialize with his future 
                        employees.

           EXT. CAMPAIGN PARTY - LATER

           DJ RAPUTATION get the party’s attention.

                                 DJ RAPUTATION
                        Congratulations to Councilwoman 
                        Jess Angelo!

           Everyone cheers.
                                 DJ RAPUTATION (CONT'D)
                        And to celebrate her win, we have a 
                        special request!

           Fergie’s “Glamorous” kicks in. We see Alice light up.

                                 ALICE
                        Who...?

           Jess smiles - guilty. Jess takes Alice's hand and leads her 
           to the floor. Alice smiles - she’s truly touched.

           They join Blair and Frankie for their “famous” dance number. 
           Alice waves Kiwi up to join them, too.

           This time, they’ve got the routine down, except for Kiwi, who 
           kind of mimics the moves a few seconds too late.

           A lot of people are confused as to why this is happening at a 
           campaign party. Peter shrugs.

                                 PETER
                        (to a confused gentleman)
                        They’ve been through a lot.

           The crowd watches them finish, and applauds as Jess catches 
           Alice. They hug.

                                                    FADE OUT.

           CREDITS:

           As credits roll, Alice’s 5-part dance choreography refresher 
           video plays. She’s taped all the different parts in her 
           bedroom and spliced them together, so there are 5 Alices (her 
           psoriasis is getting visibly worse). It really did take her a 
           long time on iMovie. Her cat keeps ruining the shots and she 
           keeps having to start over.

                                 ALICE
                        FLASHY YOU BITCH!

                                   THE END
