           EXT. OCEAN DRIVE, MIAMI BEACH- EARLY MORNING

           TIME CARD: MAY 15, 2011

           The sun ascends over the boardwalk, storefront shutters open 
           to a quiet beach, and a jogging group of senior citizens is 
           interrupted by the sound of a bike bell. 

           CALEB KAHN rides his grandmother’s tandem bike alone. His 
           eyeliner channels Courtney Love and both of his shoes are 
           untied. He has a Jansport on his back and a Nikon slung 
           around his shoulder. 

           Caleb is the kind of high school senior that stopped giving a 
           fuck last year when he discovered vintage gay porn and Ziggy 
           StarDust. To say he’s hung over and struggling would be 
           putting it mildly. The jogging group glares at him.

                                 CALEB
                        We get it. You’re old and fit. You 
                        don’t have to rub it in everyone’s 
                        face.

           He continues to ring the bell and the sea of seniors parts, 
           like Caleb is some kind of punk Moses. As he rides in between 
           the joggers, a black elderly runner named BENNY squirts his 
           water bottle at Caleb.

                                 BENNY
                        Aren’t you supposed to get someone 
                        to ride that with you?

                                 CALEB
                        Who says I haven’t?

                                 BENNY
                        I’m going to tell Meryl about this.

                                 CALEB
                        If you’re referring to my 
                        grandmother, she hasn’t heard from 
                        you since Monday Bong Night. She 
                        probably thinks you’re dead, or 
                        even worse, screening her calls.

                                 BENNY
                        Liar. I saw her yesterday. And she 
                        wants to know where you’ve been.

                                 CALEB
                        Around.

           Caleb flashes the Nikon in Benny’s face before pedaling away. 
           Benny shields his eyes and calls out after him:
                                 BENNY
                        You look like shit!

           Caleb holds up the finger and turns the corner to...

           EXT. GAY HEALTH CLINIC - CONTINUOUS

           It’s got that off-white antiseptic look from the ‘70s when 
           everything was all stucco and angular. 

           There’s a rainbow flag next to a banner reading: WRAP YOUR 
           JUNK, A MEN OF MIAMI HEALTH MOVEMENT.

           As Caleb rides up to the clinic, a HOMELESS MAN calls out to 
           him from an adjacent bus bench.

                                 HOMELESS MAN
                        Hey! You got any food?

           Caleb locks up his bike on a NO PARKING sign before running 
           to a trash can and vomiting his stomach lining out. He 
           screams like that kicker who misses the winning field goal. 

           Caleb takes a 7/11 container from his bag and hands it to the 
           homeless man, who looks at it skeptically. 

                                 CALEB
                        Take it. The puke was from a nasty 
                        combo of Schnapps and Nyquil. This 
                        weiner will only bring you joy. 

           Caleb walks inside. The homeless man opens the tray: it’s a 
           day-old 7/11 hot dog. The man shrugs and takes a bite. 

           INT. WAITING ROOM - SHORTLY THEREAFTER

           Only a table of pamphlet racks sits between a cross-legged 
           Caleb and a hot, ripped GUIDO bawling his brains out. 

           Caleb tries to ignore the relentless sobs and stares at the 
           informational posters cluttering the wall: METH ANONYMOUS, 
           HIV COUNSELING, DRAG KARAOKE NIGHT. He nervously starts to 
           make origami hearts out of nearby paper pamphlets when–

                                 JAMAICAN NURSE
                        Kahn, Caleb.

                                 CALEB
                        Present!

           Caleb jolts up, knocking over the racks on the table. 

                                 CALEB (CONT’D)
                        Sorry! I’m sorry.
           He quickly and awkwardly attempts to reassemble them, but 
           ends up pushing pamphlets onto the melancholy guido instead.  

                                 CALEB (CONT’D)
                        I think, I’m just-
                        (beat) 
                        -I’m gonna go with her. 

           Caleb grabs his bag and follows the nurse inside.

           INT. WAITING ROOM - AN HOUR LATER

           Caleb has fallen asleep on the examination table when a knock 
           at the door wakes him up. DOCTOR REID comes in. He’s wearing 
           dad jeans and a Hawaiian shirt.

                                 DOCTOR REID
                        Sorry to wake you.

                                 CALEB
                        Are you...a doctor? 

                                 DOCTOR REID
                        Only if my mother asks, Mr...

           He examines a chart.

                                 DOCTOR REID (CONT’D)
                        Kahn. So what can we do you for 
                        this morning? STI check?

                                 CALEB
                        Yes, ma’am.

           Doctor Reid sits at the computer. 

                                 DOCTOR REID
                        Let’s start with some questions. 
                        How many men have you been sexually 
                        active with in the past three 
                        months?

                                 CALEB
                        Four and a half.

                                 DOCTOR REID
                        Alright, and in the past year?

                                 CALEB
                        I guess five and a half?

                                 DOCTOR REID
                        Was that a monogamous relationship?
                                 CALEB
                        Almost.

                                 DOCTOR REID
                        Right. 
                            (beat)
                        How many women have you been 
                        sexually active with?

           Caleb stares at him blankly. 

                                 DOCTOR REID (CONT’D)
                        I’ll take that as “zero.” Do you 
                        remember the last time you were 
                        tested?

                                 CALEB
                        About six months ago.

                                 DOCTOR REID
                        And do you always practice safe 
                        sex?

                                 CALEB
                        So here’s the thing.

           Doctor Reid turns to Caleb and removes his glasses.

                                 CALEB (CONT’D)
                        I always practice safe sex, but 
                        like a shitty boyfriend, safe sex 
                        has rejected me.

                                 DOCTOR REID
                        I wasn’t aware that someone could 
                        be rejected by safe sex.

                                 CALEB
                        I’m gifted.

                                 DOCTOR REID
                        When did safe sex reject you?

                                 CALEB
                        Last Thursday night. I’m going 
                        through this ‘breakup’ thing and 
                        this ‘can’t afford college’ thing, 
                        and so I went out to this new queer 
                        biker bar, which I’m pretty sure is 
                        just a front for guys to wear 
                        leather suspenders.  Anyway, I met 
                        an Argentine dude who did this 
                        crazy thing with his tongue and so 
                        I had no choice but to bone him. 
                                 DOCTOR REID
                        Is that it?

                                 CALEB
                        Well, I may or may not have taken a 
                        Vicodin and it’s possible that not 
                        enough lube was used. Before I knew 
                        it, there was blood and the condom 
                        looked like the victim of a Freddy 
                        Krugar hand job. 

                                 DOCTOR REID
                        Did you give or receive anal sex?

                                 CALEB
                        I’m a bottom. Borderline vers if 
                        Mercury’s in retrograde.
                            (beat)
                        Mercury was not in retrograde.

                                 DOCTOR REID
                        Okay. Do you know his status?

           Caleb takes out a letter. It is sopping in sweat and Svedka. 
           He reads it aloud without even attempting a Spanish accent. 

                                 CALEB
                        “Querido Caleb, te gusta mucho, 
                        pero necesito decirte algo 
                        importante: tengo VIH. Lo siento 
                        que no te lo dijo antes. Tienes un 
                        pene bonito. Que tenga suerte”

                                 DOCTOR REID
                        I don’t speak Spanish.

                                 CALEB
                        He thinks my penis is pretty. And 
                        he has HIV.

                                 DOCTOR REID
                        If this happened last week, why 
                        didn’t you come in immediately? 

                                 CALEB
                        I don’t know. I had shit to do, 
                        groceries to bag, the usual.

                                 DOCTOR REID
                        I don’t mean to overstep my bounds 
                        here, Mr. Kahn, but you need to 
                        take this more seriously. Time is 
                        of the essence with these things.
                                 CALEB
                        I know. I will. I am. I’m sorry. I 
                        guess I was just kind of- 
                            (beat)
                        -scared. 

           Doctor Reid stares at Caleb, trying to figure this kid out. 
           He returns to his computer. 

                                 DOCTOR REID
                        There is a drug called Post 
                        Exposure Prophylaxis that you could 
                        have taken up to 72 hours after 
                        being “rejected by safe sex.” I’m 
                        not sure how effective that 
                        treatment would be at this point. 
                        It’s also quite expensive.

                                 CALEB
                        I have a gold filling I could pawn 
                        for thirty bucks. That’s about it. 

                                 DOCTOR REID
                        Do you have any symptoms of other 
                        STIs? Colored discharge, burning 
                        sensations when you urinate?

                                 CALEB
                        Peeing’s a dream, but that’s why 
                        I’m here, doc. Let’s test the crap 
                        out of me so this can all be over.

                                 DOCTOR REID
                        We’ll test for gonorrhea, 
                        chlamydia, HPV, and syphilis today, 
                        and you can make an appointment at 
                        the front desk to come back for 
                        HIV.

                                 CALEB 
                        Um. I think your priorities are a 
                        bit twisted, doctor-man. I want to 
                        be tested for HIV. Like, right now.

                                 DOCTOR REID
                        We can test you now, but it won’t 
                        say whether or not you got HIV from 
                        your safe sex rejection. The test 
                        looks for the virus’ antibodies in 
                        your system and they take time to 
                        develop. 

           Caleb officially looks freaked out. He lays down.
                                 DOCTOR REID (CONT’D)
                        In the meantime, here are some 
                        pamphlets with HIV information and 
                        a flyer for the support group I run 
                        twice a week.

                                 CALEB
                        Okay, calm down. I might not have
                            (beat)
                        ‘it’. Let’s not get ‘support-group-
                        excited’ just yet.

                                 DOCTOR REID
                        It’s not just for HIV positive 
                        people. It’s for their friends, 
                        family, and people in your 
                        position. Really anyone who has 
                        been affected by the disease.

                                 CALEB
                        And exactly how long do people in 
                        my position have to wait before 
                        they can get tested?

                                 DOCTOR REID
                        Three months.

           CLOSE UP on Caleb’s face. He’s quietly terrified.

                                                               CUT TO:

           Black screen. In small white writing, we see: DAY FOUR.

                                                               CUT TO:

           EXT. NEVADA STREET, MIAMI BEACH - AN HOUR LATER

           Caleb’s face is pale and pained as he rides down a city 
           street. There’s gauze taped to his arm from the STI tests. 

           As he passes a house with a yellow mailbox, he slows down 
           some. A WOMAN in traditional Jewish garb steps out of her 
           Honda Odyssey and pulls a small CHILD from a car seat. 

           The woman and Caleb make eye contact before she averts her 
           gaze: they know each other. Caleb pedals away.

           EXT. GRANDMA MERYL’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           The house is a one story with walls browning from dirt and 
           neglect. A broken basketball hoop leans awkwardly in the 
           driveway. Caleb props his bike against the side of the house.
           INT. FOYER- CONTINUOUS

           Caleb licks down his hair and composes himself in the mirror. 

           The house looks like an abandoned book shop: texts like THE 
           GERMAN IDEOLOGIES and THREE GUINEAS are scattered around the 
           room. Meryl’s Doctor of Philosophy from Yale hangs on a wall.

           INT. KITCHEN- CONTINUOUS

           MERYL sits at the table in hair curlers and a nightgown. 
           She’s that grandma-kind-of-plump with a smile for days. 

           She scrawls notes on index cards while reading John Stuart 
           Mill’s ON LIBERTY. Infamous elderly jogger Benny sits beside 
           her, working on a newspaper crossword. 

           They pass a joint and turn to Caleb as he grabs a Minute Maid 
           juice box from the fridge.

                                 BENNY
                        I told you he looked like shit. 

                                 MERYL
                        Talk about my grandson like that 
                        again and I’ll neuter you during 
                        our next coed shower. 

                                 BENNY
                        Is that a promise?

           Benny and Meryl kiss passionately. It’s an unkosher mix of 
           intriguing and uncomfortable. 

                                 CALEB
                        I’m begging you to stop.

           Caleb slumps down in a chair and spills a glass of water on 
           Meryl’s index cards. She quickly dries them with her 
           nightgown.

                                 MERYL
                        Careful! I’m working on my lecture 
                        series for the fall. This time it’s 
                        on Mill. You know, utilitarianism, 
                        happiness, the ability to crap 
                        rainbows, that sort of thing. 

           Caleb is distracted and not really listening. He massages his 
           temples and rubs his face. Meryl notices.

                                 MERYL (CONT’D)
                        And where have you been, Cay? I 
                        haven’t seen you since Thursday. 
                                 CALEB
                        I picked up extra shifts at 7/11 
                        and crashed at Wei’s. Trying to 
                        bring in that extra cash money so I 
                        don’t have to live with my grandma 
                        until I’m a grandma. 

                                 BENNY
                        Liar.

           Caleb squirts his juice at Benny. Pay back. Benny scoffs.

                                 MERYL
                        Well a phone call would have been 
                        nice. 
                            (beat)
                        Speaking of ‘cash money,’ I finally 
                        got my last check from FIU. I put 
                        some of it in your college fund 
                        bucket. We’re at a grand now.

           Meryl points to a blue bucket on a shelf in the kitchen. It’s 
           labelled with a sharpie, THIS IS A COLLEGE FUND BUCKET. 

                                 CALEB
                        Great. Now all I need is another 
                        $199,000 for Parsons’ Photography 
                        Program. Luckily, I’ve enrolled at 
                        Miami Dade Community. 

                                 MERYL
                        Have you been filling out those 
                        college grants? Ruth Schwartz’s 
                        grandson got a full-ride to John 
                        Hopkins for accounting.

                                 CALEB
                        Well a million mazels to Ruth 
                        Schwartz’s closeted grandson. 

           She glares at Caleb.

                                 CALEB (CONT’D)
                        You know I’ve been working on the 
                        grants.

           Meryl’s face gets hard and she deeply inhales the joint.

                                 MERYL
                        Well that cunt has all the money in 
                        the world. Let’s pray someone drops 
                        a house on her and we get it all.
                                 CALEB
                        That’s my mother you’re talking 
                        about. But cunt works too. 

           Caleb takes the joint from Meryl and hits it. 

                                 CALEB (CONT’D)
                        I saw her today.

                                 MERYL
                            (beat)
                        I thought you didn’t ride that way.

                                 CALEB
                        She was taking Zev out of the car 
                        seat. He looks less like an alien 
                        and more like a small human now. 
                        And they painted the mailbox a 
                        dehydrated urine yellow. I would 
                        have never approved if I were still 
                        allowed to live there.

                                 BENNY
                            (beat)
                        It’s a damn shame she won’t let you 
                        see your brother.

           Meryl takes Caleb’s Minute Maid and squirts it at Benny. 

                                 CALEB
                        I think I’m gonna go work on that 
                        grant application.

           He takes the joint and gets up to leave.

                                 MERYL
                        Hey, Cay.

           Caleb turns to look at his grandmother. She studies his face. 

                                 MERYL (CONT’D)
                        Your graduation is tomorrow night.

                                 CALEB
                        Is that tomorrow?

                                 MERYL
                        I know you think that all your 
                        classmates are, quote, unquote 
                        “Douche-Bubbles,” but still. You 
                        should go.
                                 CALEB
                        I don’t know. I have this Bagel 
                        Bites thing at 8 and then a Golden 
                        Girls marathon til my eyes bleed. 

                                 MERYL
                        Well, let me know if you change 
                        your mind. 

           Caleb walks away while Meryl calls out to him.

                                 MERYL (CONT’D)
                        And try to get some sleep! You 
                        really do look like shit. 

           INT. CALEB’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Caleb staggers into his room. The walls are plastered with 
           Ziggy Stardust, angsty Simic poetry scrawls, and a hand-
           painted mural of the New York City skyline.

           Origami and underwear are strewn atop the shelves. On his 
           desk, there’s a Parsons acceptance letter and applications 
           for financial grants and art scholarships.

           He sits at his desk and turns a lamp on. He tries to focus. 
           He examines one of the grant forms, which reads, “...your 
           grant application should be supplemented with a creative 
           portfolio that explores a theme that is important to you.”

           Caleb sifts through the different photographs he’s taken: 
           black and whites of Meryl and Benny being affectionate, a 
           homeless woman sleeping on a lifeguard stand, seagulls. 

           He comes across an old Polaroid of a young Caleb wearing an 
           ‘I <3 NY” t-shirt. He’s sitting on a man’s shoulders in the 
           middle of Times Square. 

           Caleb pushes the photographs aside. He takes out the letter 
           he read to Doctor Reid and places it next to his Parson’s 
           letter. He starts to hyperventilate. 

           He walks quickly across scattered pictures to–

           INT. CALEB’S BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Caleb locks the door and looks at himself in the mirror. He 
           takes makeup remover pads and wipes off his eyeliner. He rubs 
           and rubs and rubs til his eyes are a mean kind of red. When 
           the makeup is gone, he keeps rubbing. 

           His panic attack worsens: he can’t catch his breath and he’s 
           dizzy. He lights the joint and sucks hard and fast, puffing 
           til a frozen numbness. 
           He collapses in the bathtub as white noise audio crescendos 
           loudly. Suddenly, all becomes eerily silent. He hears heavy 
           breathing that seems to emanate from nowhere.

                                                               CUT TO:

           INT. MOTEL - FLASHBACK

           CALEB’S POV: As his eyes blink, Caleb sees flashes of a dark 
           motel ceiling. The heavy breathing continues. Caleb’s getting 
           fucked by a DARK FIGURE who thrusts over him. The man’s fists 
           violently punch the head board with a loud crack.

           TIME CARD: Day 5

           EXT. MIAMI BEACH HIGH SCHOOL SCIENCE BUILDING ROOF- EVENING

           WEI LING (butch, a tad chubby) sits atop the science 
           building, drinking a forty in sweats. She looks across the 
           parking lot to the graduation ceremony taking place in the 
           football stadium.

           Her classmates sit in the stands and wait for their diplomas. 
           Their families cheer in the opposing bleachers. 

           Caleb appears, wearing a backpack. He sits beside Wei. 

                                 WEI
                        Yo, bitch. It’s about time. 

                                 CALEB
                        Sorry. I had to borrow this from 
                        work.

           He pulls a bottle of cheap wine and two paper cups from his 
           back pack. He pours generously and they toss ‘em back.

                                 CALEB (CONT’D)
                        What’d I miss?

                                 WEI
                        Fuck if I know. I fell asleep when 
                        class treasurer Jen Lee dedicated 
                        her diploma to Jesus and Justin 
                        Bieber. 

                                 CALEB
                        God I hate them all.

                                 WEI
                        I’ll fucking cheers to that.

           Wei drinks from her cup. Caleb chugs straight from the bottle 
           like it’s his job.
                                 CALEB
                        They make it to the M’s yet?

                                 WEI
                        Caleb. Dom broke up with your ass 
                        cause he’s moving to LA and selling 
                        his soul to the devil or Ryan 
                        Seacrest or some shit. Get over it.

           Wei rips the bottle from Caleb.

                                 CALEB
                        You don’t get it, Wei. I would have 
                        adopted Chinese babies with him. 

                                 WEI
                        Gays can’t adopt in Florida.

                                 CALEB
                        Well I’m trying to get out of 
                        Florida. 

           Wei, too, chugs straight from the bottle.

                                 WEI
                        Oh right, academy for hipster 
                        queers who Instagram weird shit.

                                 CALEB
                        Also known as art school.

           Caleb squints in the distance.

                                 CALEB (CONT’D)
                        Is that Naya Lopez? 

                                 WEI
                        Ugh. Dom hasn’t walked yet, Caleb. 
                        Now stop being a pussy and bend 
                        over for someone else already.

                        I did.

           Wei punches him in the arm.

                                 WEI
                        That’s what I’m fucking talking 
                        about! That’s why you’ve been so 
                        MIA and weird. 

                                 CALEB
                        What do you mean, “weird”?
                                 WEI
                        Well there’s video of you crashing 
                        in the storage room for the past 
                        four fucking days. Suzanne’s 
                        pissed.

                                 CALEB
                        Shit.

                                 WEI
                        Don’t sweat it. I’ll calm her down. 

                                 CALEB
                        Please keep your inappropriate 
                        lesbian relationship to yourself. 
                        I’m in the middle of dinner.

           Caleb takes a swig from the bottle.

                                 WEI
                        Shut up. 
                            (beat)
                        So. Who is this dude?!

                                 CALEB
                        His name was Matias. He didn’t 
                        speak a word of English and was 
                        part Argentine, part horse.

                                 WEI
                        Was?

                                 CALEB
                        He flew back to Buenos Aires a few 
                        days ago. He either had to go back 
                        to work or had to get work done, I 
                        couldn’t really understand. 
                            (beat)
                        He left me a letter. 

           Caleb hands Wei the letter. Over the football loud speaker we 
           hear the principal call a name:

                                 PRINCIPAL
                        Dominic Marquez. 

           Caleb takes out his Nikon and looks through the zoom. He sees 
           his ex walk across the stage to get his diploma. 

           Dom does the touchdown ‘one knee’ move and the crowd erupts 
           in laughter. Caleb looks like he could die. 

                                 WEI
                        Caleb.
           As Wei reads, she goes ghost white. She puts the letter down.

                                 WEI (CONT’D)
                        I failed Spanish both times, but 
                        does this say–

           Caleb doesn’t turn to look at her but instead tracks Dom as 
           he goes back to his seat. He snaps out of it and jumps a bit 
           when he feels Wei give him a hug.

                                 CALEB
                        Well this hasn’t happened since I 
                        punched Mike Hammer for calling you 
                        Plus Size Sailor Moon.

                                 WEI
                        Did you get tested?

                                 CALEB
                        I can’t. Apparently HIV takes three 
                        months to come out of hiding. 

                                 WEI
                        Do you need me to cover your shifts 
                        or something? I could probably 
                        convince the boss to let you take a 
                        few weeks off.

                                 CALEB
                        Just because you’re playing find 
                        the hole with our middle aged boss, 
                        doesn’t mean you’re the queen of 
                        7/11.

                                 WEI
                        Stop giving me shit about Suzanne. 
                        She’s hot.

                                 CALEB
                        She’s married. To a gentleman named 
                        Henry who sells vacuum cleaners.

                                 WEI
                        Bitch isn’t fulfilled by his dick.

                                 CALEB
                        Well thanks, but no thanks. I need 
                        as many hours of minimum wage as I 
                        can get if I’m going to get the 
                        fuck out of here.

           He drinks. Wei stares into her cup for a beat, then-
                                 WEI
                        Have you told your grandma?

                                 CALEB
                        That you’re fucking our boss? No. 

           Wei punches him in the arm.

                                 CALEB (CONT’D)
                        No, I haven’t told her. Why scare a 
                        70 year old who has already had two 
                        heart attacks when I can quietly 
                        die alone inside?

           They sit without talking for a beat and then–

                                 WEI
                        Seriously, man, you gonna be okay?

           Over the loud speaker, the class president’s lisp is heard.

                                 CLASS PRESIDENT
                        Congrath, clath of 2011. We did it!

           The graduates throw their hats in the air while Caleb and Wei 
           look on. He chugs the wine.

           EXT. MIAMI BOARDWALK - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Post graduation, a drunken Caleb rides his tandem bike along 
           an empty boardwalk, swerving from side to side. 

           After one swerve too many, he crashes into the three foot 
           wall separating the path from the sand. He flies off the 
           tandem and lands on concrete. A beat passes before he lifts 
           himself off the pavement. 

           Caleb dusts off his knees and touches his lip: it’s split 
           open and bleeding. He stares at the blood with horror and 
           confusion before wiping it on his shirt. 

           He looks down at the blood-stained shirt and becomes 
           infuriated. He tries to rip it off, but it hilariously gets 
           stuck over his head. 

           Once he finally removes it, he throws it in a nearby trash 
           can. Caleb takes a bottle out of his backpack and pours some 
           alcohol over the shirt. He sets it on fire with a match. 

           The blazing garbage is the only source of light behind Caleb 
           as he walks his bike toward the water...
           EXT. LIFE GUARD STAND - CONTINUOUS

           Caleb leans his bike on one of tower’s legs. He struggles for 
           a few beats while drunkenly climbing it. 

           He crawls to one of the corners where something is etched 
           into the wooden banister. Caleb uses a lighter to illuminate 
           the writing. It reads: YOU’VE BEEN KAHNED BY THE KAHNS 
           12/2002. 

           Caleb is staring at the stars when a CREEPY DUDE shouts from 
           the sand.

                                 CREEPY DUDE
                        Hey, faggot. 

           Caleb rolls his eyes.

                                 CREEPY DUDE (CONT’D)
                        I said, hey FAGGOT.

           Caleb ignores the dude.

                                 CREEPY DUDE (CONT’D)
                        Wanna fuck?

           Still not a rise from Caleb.

                                 CREEPY DUDE (CONT’D)
                        C’mon. Let me fuck you.
                            (beat)
                        We can do it on your bike.

           And he’s pushed a button. Caleb jumps down from the tower.

                                 CALEB
                        Don’t touch my bike.

           The man is fat and shirtless. His hair is every which way and 
           he probably smells like some sort of sharp cheese.

                                 CREEPY DUDE
                        Then let me fuck you.

                                 CALEB
                        Fuck off or I’ll break your face.

           When the creepy dude approaches, Caleb screams so loudly that 
           even he is shocked by the extent of his volume.

                                 CALEB (CONT’D)
                        I’m GONNA BREAK YOUR FUCKING FACE! 
                        I’M GONNA BREAK YOUR FUCKING FACE!
           Caleb starts acting like a crazy person and punches the air. 
           He screams again and again and again. The creepy dude runs. 

           Caleb stands alone. After a beat, he slowly laughs to himself-
           schizophrenic clown style-when he hears police sirens. In the 
           distance, a cop car pulls up to the garbage can, which is now 
           engulfed in flames.

                                 CALEB (CONT’D)
                        Shit.

           Caleb hops on his bike and rides across the wet sand of the 
           shoreline, lit only by the moon.

                                                               CUT TO:

           TIME CARD: Day 10

           INT. 7/11 - AFTERNOON

           Caleb stands behind the register. He has a financial aid 
           essay prompt in front of him but he can’t pay attention to 
           it. Instead, he merely stares into space. 

           Wei is stocking sodas in the aisle when their boss SUZANNE, a 
           middle aged woman past her prime (but still hot in a mom 
           way,) appears.

                                 SUZANNE
                        Hey, Wei? Can I get your help with 
                        these Nestle boxes?

                                 WEI
                        Yes, ma’m.

           They turn to leave when-

                                 SUZANNE
                        And, Caleb. 

           He looks up at her.

                                 SUZANNE (CONT’D)

                        We need to have a talk later.

           Caleb doesn’t respond. Wei follows Suzanne into the closet, 
           but not before winking at Caleb. 

           Caleb flips her off as a teenage BOY and GIRL walk up to the 
           cashier. They are giddy, like they know a fun secret. The boy 
           lays lube and condoms on the counter.
                                 BOY
                        Just these. Oh.

           He takes a box of spearmint Altoids from a counter rack and 
           puts it in front of Caleb as well.

                                 BOY (CONT’D)
                        These too.

           Caleb looks at them giggling and, for just a second, wishes 
           he was a murderer of sexually active teens.

                                 CALEB
                        Those don’t always work, you know.

                                 BOY
                        Oh. Okay. 

           The boy picks peppermint Altoids instead. The girl whines.

                                 GIRL
                        But I like bubblegum!

                                 CALEB
                            (mocking)
                        But I like bubblegum!

           They stare at him, a bit in shock.

                                 CALEB (CONT’D)
                        The condoms. I was talking about 
                        the condoms.

                                 GIRL
                        What do you mean?

                                 CALEB
                        Sure. You guys get handsy in the 
                        back of his mom’s Jetta. He says 
                        some cheesy line about how special 
                        you are and you massage his 
                        nipples. Then after warming up his 
                        stick shift with your Cabbage Patch 
                        lip gloss, you gently slip on a 
                        Trojan, the mightiest of soldiers, 
                        thinking, “great. Now I won’t get 
                        pregnant.” But you’re wrong, Hannah 
                        Montana. Maybe there’s no baby, but 
                        sure enough you have gonorrhea, 
                        God’s punishment for the sexually 
                        active, and you have to get a shot 
                        in the ass from your judgmental 
                        pediatrician who still wears Mickey 
                        Mouse Ties. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 CALEB (CONT'D)
                        But you better hope that’s all you 
                        get, because worst case scenario, 
                        you’re pregnant and dead. All 
                        because he stuck his dick in some 
                        Kardashian wannabe before he shoved 
                        it in you.

           The teenagers stare at him in complete and utter shock. After 
           a beat the boy puts a twenty on the counter.

                                 BOY
                        Asshole.

           They leave in a hurry while Caleb calls out after them.

                                 CALEB
                        But remember, no glove no love!

           Caleb takes a pack of cigarettes and removes his name tag. 

           He walks to the storage closet and opens the door. Wei’s 
           hands are beneath Suzanne’s blouse as they make out.

                                 CALEB (CONT’D)
                        I’m taking my smoke break early.

                                 WEI
                        What the fuck, dude! Shut the door.

                                 SUZANNE
                        Shit shit shit.

           She buttons her shirt as Caleb shuts the door. He walks out 
           onto the street.

           EXT. 7/11 - CONTINUOUS

           Caleb sits on his tandem bike and shakily lights a cigarette. 
           He sees a YOUNG MAN helping an ELDERLY WOMAN pump her gas.

           Caleb takes the HIV pamphlets out of his bike basket when a 
           flyer for Dr. Reid’s meeting falls out. It reads “THE YOUNG 
           AND THE SEXLESS: HIV SUPPORT GROUP, CHRIST THE ROCK CHURCH 
           BASEMENT, WEDNESDAYS, 7-9pm. KARAOKE NIGHT TO FOLLOW.” 

           Caleb mouths the word “karaoke” and scoffs.

           INT. CHRIST THE ROCK BASEMENT - EVENING

           Caleb walks into the basement with his headphones blaring. He 
           ignores the ten or so people chatting and goes to a back 
           table with coffee and snacks. He eats a donut and stuffs 
           three more in his bag when he’s tapped on the shoulder.
                                 ESTHA (O.S.)
                        I saw that.

           Caleb turns around. Behind him, ESTHA (18), a tall, clean cut 
           Indian, holds a bag of Kettle Corn. His accent is slight but 
           present. Estha is cute and Caleb is caught off guard.

                                 CALEB
                        Would you like a prize?

                                 ESTHA
                        Not if it’s one of those donuts.

           Caleb takes one of the donuts out of his bag and mockingly 
           eats it in Estha’s face. Estha smiles.

                                 DR. REID (O.S.)
                        Alright guys, let’s rein it in.

           Behind them, Dr. Reid calls everyone over to a circle of ten 
           chairs. Estha almost says something but takes a seat instead. 
           Caleb sits in the only empty chair, next to Estha’s. 

                                 DR. REID (CONT’D)
                        Hi and welcome to the Young and the 
                        Sexless support group. I see we 
                        have a new face or two in the 
                        circle tonight, so let’s go around 
                        and introduce ourselves. You can 
                        share what you feel comfortable 
                        sharing or, if you’re here to just 
                        sit and listen, that’s okay too. 
                            (beat)
                        I guess I’ll start. My name is Carl 
                        Reid and I have a partner living 
                        with HIV.

           JIM (50), a bald man next to Dr. Reid, raises his hand. 

                                 JIM
                        Bonjour!

                                 DR. REID
                        And we’ve been together for about 
                        twenty five years.

                                 JIM
                        Twenty six, but who’s counting?

           They’ve done this before. The group laughs.
                                 DR. REID
                        I started The Young and the Sexless 
                        in ‘94, to help young men living 
                        with HIV understand that their 
                        lives, and their sex lives, aren’t 
                        over after infection. Over the 
                        years the group’s changed into a 
                        place where anyone can come and 
                        share their story, but we decided 
                        to keep the name anyway.

                                 JIM
                        It gets a lot of hits on Google.

           Caleb smiles and takes off his backpack.

                                 DR. REID
                        And also that. Alrighty, Jim, 
                        you’re up.

                                 JIM
                        And I didn’t even have to take any 
                        pills! Just kidding. 
                            (beat)
                        Maybe. Hi guys! I’m Jim Jenson 
                        Reid, and I’m married to Dr. Oz. 
                        I’m a part-time attorney and a full-
                        time cabaret comedienne. You can 
                        catch me at the Palace on Tuesday 
                        and Thursday nights. 

                                 DR. REID
                        Less marketing, more sharing, Jim.

                                 JIM
                        Right. Well, I’ve been HIV positive 
                        for about 24 years. Carl, I mean, 
                        Dr. Reid, and I were in an open 
                        relationship for about the first 
                        ten years of being together. God I 
                        miss the seventies!
                            (breaks for laughs)
                        I had some irresponsible sexual 
                        encounters. I was young, stupid, 
                        and a total size queen. 

                                 DR. REID
                        Jim!

           Laughs again. 

                                 JIM
                        What? It’s a safe space! 
           Jim kisses him on the cheek. A queer Abbott and Costello.

                                 JIM (CONT’D)
                        Anywho, once we found out I was 
                        positive, we took the proper steps 
                        so that Carl was never infected. 
                        Condoms really do work, people!

           The group laughs and Caleb starts to get the spins.

                                                               CUT TO:

           INT. MOTEL - FLASHBACK

           CALEB’S POV: He drunkenly stumbles out of the bathroom and 
           tosses a condom on the bed where a man sits in the shadows.

           Blurred images of underwear, a cheap ocean watercolor, and a 
           suitcase under the bed flash by and Caleb is on his back atop 
           the mattress getting fucked. The man suddenly stops thrusting 
           and takes himself out of Caleb. He looks down.

                                 CALEB
                            (muffled)
                        Why’d you stop?

           The man smiles and puts himself back in. Caleb moans.

                                                              BACK TO:

           INT. CHRIST THE ROCK BASEMENT - MINUTES LATER

           Caleb snaps back to the present at the sound of a loud POP: 
           Estha opening his bag of Kettle Corn. Caleb zoned out during 
           the previous participant’s story. They’re waiting on him.

                                 DOCTOR REID
                        Caleb? You still with us? Would you 
                        like to share?

                                 CALEB
                        Oh, uh. Sure. My name is Caleb Ka–I 
                        mean Caleb K–or I...

           There’s an awkward pause. Estha chews very loudly on popcorn. 
           Caleb stares at him, intrigued.

                                 CALEB (CONT’D)
                        I’m Caleb. I’m sort of new to this 
                        whole thing, sorry. I’m here 
                        because. Well, because a condom 
                        broke. The guy had HIV and now I’m 
                        just waiting to find out, I guess. 
                        Oldest story in the–
           Estha’s chewing is louder and it’s distracting Caleb.

                                 CALEB (CONT’D)
                            (beat)
                        Book. Or. Something.

           Jim smiles at Caleb.

                                 JIM
                        That depends on what kind of books 
                        you’re reading, sweetie. But let’s 
                        hear more about you.

                                 CALEB
                        Oh. Well, I just graduated from 
                        high school. I live with my 
                        grandma, but she’s like, a cool 
                        grandma, the kind that went to Yale 
                        and bitch-slapped Judy Chicago in 
                        the seventies. Her son, my dad, 
                        died when I was thirteen and that’s 
                        when my mom found Moses or 
                        something. She married a real dick 
                        rabbi and went all wig-wearing 
                        Hasidic on me. I take pictures too. 
                        Photographs really, but that sounds 
                        super douchey. I’m supposed to go 
                        to Parson’s for it, but their 
                        tuition probably costs as much as a 
                        small chain of islands, so we’ll 
                        see. Oh, and I work at 7/11. So 
                        slushie discounts all around. 

           Jim laughs and Estha chews the popcorn loudly. The rest of 
           the group smiles at Caleb politely.  

                                 DOCTOR REID
                        That’s great. Thanks, Caleb. 

           All eyes look to Estha who is still chewing.

                                 ESTHA
                        Hello, I’m Estha. My family moved 
                        to the States from India when I was 
                        twelve. I’m following in my 
                        father’s footsteps and studying 
                        engineering at Cal Tech in the 
                        fall.

           Caleb chuckles at the stereotype. The group glares at him.

                                 ESTHA (CONT’D)
                        And I’m also waiting. 
           Estha and Caleb lock eyes.

           INT. CHRIST THE ROCK HALLWAY - POST MEETING

           The group gathers their things and Caleb tries to make a 
           quick exit when Dr. Reid stops him.

                                 DOCTOR REID
                        I’m glad you actually came. How are 
                        you doing?

                                 CALEB
                        I’m alright, considering. 

                                 DOCTOR REID
                        Good. That’s good to hear. 

           An awkward beat. 

                                 CALEB
                        Soooo, he’s yours?

           Caleb points to Jim, who is trying to talk to OLD LARRY by 
           the snack table. Old Larry is hard of hearing.

                                 JIM
                        NO. I SAID, DO YOU TAKE YOUR COFFEE 
                        WITH MILK?

                                 OLD LARRY
                        YES! I LOVE HATS.

           Doctor Reid laughs.

                                 DOCTOR REID
                        Very much so. 

                                 CALEB
                        He’s funny. I like him. 

                                 DOCTOR REID
                        Most people do.

           Another awkward silence. Caleb looks around and then at the 
           imaginary watch on his wrist.

                                 CALEB
                        Oh wow, it’s late. Well this was 
                        really-
                            (beat)
                        -informational. I think I’m gonna 
                        head out.
                                 DOCTOR REID
                        You’re not going to come to 
                        karaoke?

                                 CALEB
                        You know I’d love to, but I really 
                        shouldn’t. It’s a school night.

                                 DOCTOR REID
                        You just said you graduated.

                                 CALEB
                        Someone, somewhere has school 
                        tomorrow.

           Doctor Reid stares at him. Caleb rolls his eyes.

           INT. PALACE KARAOKE BAR - EVENING

           The bar is lit by deep pink lights and has mirrors for walls. 
           The Young and the Sexless occupy a few tables near the stage. 

           Caleb returns from the bar with a Stella, which is quickly 
           taken by Doctor Reid.

                                 CALEB
                        What the shit? I had to tell the 
                        bartender I was homeless and 
                        pregnant to not pay for that.

                                 DOCTOR REID
                        You’re eighteen. And I’m gonna need 
                        it.

           Just then, Jim, who appears on stage in a purple blazer, 
           starts to sing Cyndi Lauper. He’s theatrical and tone deaf.

                                 JIM
                        “All through the night. I’ll be 
                        awake and I’ll be with you.”

           Doctor Reid takes a long sip and raises the bottle to Jim, 
           who blows him a kiss in return.

                                 DOCTOR REID
                            (beat)
                        You really should talk to him.

                                 CALEB
                        In the middle of a power ballad? 
                        They’d take away my gay card.

           Doctor Reid motions to a table where Estha helps Old Larry 
           turn up his hearing aide. Estha winces at Larry’s volume.
                                 OLD LARRY
                            (screaming)
                        I STILL CAN’T HEAR ANYTHING. ARE 
                        YOU SURE THEY’RE ON? 

                                 ESTHA
                            (yelling back)
                        THEY’RE IN MY HAND. I HAVEN’T PUT 
                        THEM BACK IN YET.  

                                 OLD LARRY
                        OH.

           Old Larry sways to an imaginary beat he can’t hear while 
           Estha attempts to put the aide back in. Caleb laughs. Doctor 
           Reid watches with a motherly contentment.

                                 DOCTOR REID
                        You know, the point of this whole 
                        group thing is to find someone you 
                        can talk to. 

           Estha puts the aide in and Old Larry covers his ears.

                                 OLD LARRY
                        TOO LOUD!

           Caleb laughs.

                                 CALEB
                        Weird popcorn boy? 

           Estha tries to take out the hearing aide but Larry swats his 
           hand away. 

                                 CALEB (CONT’D)
                        He seems busy.

                                 DOCTOR REID
                        Oh, Larry won’t mind. There are 
                        four other people in his head that 
                        he can verbally abuse.

           He hands Caleb a karaoke song book. Caleb hesitates before 
           taking it and walking over to Estha.

                                 JIM
                        “We have no past, we won’t reach 
                        back. Keep with me forward all 
                        through the night.”

                                 CALEB
                        It’s Raja, right?
           Estha turns to look at Caleb just in time for Old Larry to 
           snatch the hearing aide and turn back to Jim. Larry sways off 
           rhythm in the background during the following conversation.

                                 ESTHA
                        Estha. 

                                 CALEB
                        Right right. Well, Estha, I didn’t 
                        know if you had a karaoke book and 
                        thought you might need one.

           He hands the book to Estha.

                                 ESTHA
                        I don’t do karaoke. I’m pretty tone 
                        deaf.

           PAN TO Jim, who is LIVING on stage while giving the audience 
           the cool vocal stylings of a dying, rabid cat. 

                                 JIM
                        “All through the night stray cat is 
                        crying so stray cat sings back.”

                                 ESTHA
                        Maybe you should sing something.

           Estha pulls out a chair and hands the book back to Caleb.

                                 CALEB
                        No thanks. Last time I did karaoke 
                        I totally butchered my favorite 
                        Bowie song. I still feel the shame.

           Estha shrugs his shoulders. Caleb sits next to him.

                                 ESTHA
                        I don’t know who that is.

                                 CALEB
                        Bowie? David Bowie?

           Estha shrugs again.

                                 CALEB (CONT’D)
                        C’mon, you HAVE to know David 
                        Bowie! Ziggy Stardust? Kind of 
                        looks like a woman, kind of looks 
                        like a man, kind of looks like 
                        someone you’d want to avoid in a 
                        dark alley?
                                 ESTHA
                        Nope.

                                 CALEB
                        Do you live under a rock or 
                        something?

                                 ESTHA
                        No. I’m from India.

                                 CALEB
                        There are plenty of rocks in India. 
                            (beat)
                        I can’t believe you don’t know 
                        Bowie.

                                 ESTHA
                        Sorry.

                                 CALEB
                        It’s cool.
                            (beat)
                        So who would you sing?

                                 ESTHA
                        Out of American music? Probably 
                        Taylor Swift.

           Caleb breaks out hysterically laughing. Estha stares blankly.

                                 CALEB
                        Oh my God you’re serious.

                                 ESTHA
                        What? I like her songs. Sometimes I 
                        think she steals my journal and 
                        writes about my life.

                                 CALEB
                        Really? Is her next crossover hit 
                        going to be called “This is what I 
                        get for riding bareback?”

           Estha’s face shows no emotion. Caleb immediately feels like 
           he wants to fall into a hole and never climb out. A beat and 
           then Estha breaks out laughing. 

                                 ESTHA
                        Let’s hope not. 

           They smile. Jim finishes up on stage. 

                                 JIM
                        “Until it ends there is no end.”
           EXT. THE PALACE BAR - LATER THAT EVENING

           The Young and the Sexless stand outside the bar and give 
           lingering goodbyes. Estha says goodnight to Jim and starts to 
           walk away. Caleb involuntarily stops him.

                                 CALEB
                        Hey!

           Estha turns around.

                                 CALEB (CONT’D)
                        It was cool to meet you.

           Estha smiles and offers out his hand.

                                 ESTHA
                        It was good to meet you too.

           Caleb awkwardly shakes it. He soon starts to ramble and Estha 
           watches him with a foreign fascination.

                                 CALEB
                        Sorry for the weird Taylor thing. 
                        She’s really nice, just not my 
                        style. But I bet people love her in 
                        India. Cause she’s blonde and 
                        stuff. Not that they only like 
                        blondes, I’m sure they like all 
                        different kinds of hair colors. I 
                        bet gingers are really big in 
                        India.
                            (beat)
                        So did you drive here or..?

           Estha laughs. 

                                 ESTHA
                        No, I took the bus. I have to ask 
                        permission to use my parents’ car 
                        and they think I’m at a friend’s.

                                 CALEB
                        Oh. You haven’t–
                            (beat)
                        I haven’t told my grandmother 
                        either.

                                 ESTHA
                        It’s just easier since they don’t 
                        know about the whole homosexual 
                        thing. I think they’d kill me.
                                 CALEB
                        Yeah. I get that.
                            (beat)
                        Do you want a lift or something? I 
                        have this tandem bike. That means 
                        two people can ride it.

                                 ESTHA
                        I know what a tandem bike is.

                                 CALEB
                        Well you didn’t know Bowie, so I 
                        don’t want to assume.

                                 ESTHA
                        My house is a couple miles away.

                                 CALEB
                        Doesn’t matter to me. I charge by 
                        the minute.

                                 ESTHA
                            (beat)
                        Oh. It’s okay. I think I’ll just 
                        take the bus then.

           Caleb can’t help but smile. He’s never met someone like this.

                                 CALEB
                        I was kidding. My bike’s locked up 
                        in that creepy back alley. 
                            (beat)
                        But don’t worry, I won’t rape you.

           Estha looks at him, half in wonder, half in confusion.

                                 ESTHA
                        You say very strange things.

                                 CALEB
                        I get that a lot.

           As they walk to the alley, Doctor Reid smiles at them.

           EXT. MIAMI STREETS - CONTINUOUS

           Caleb takes the front seat and steers the bike while Estha 
           pedals in the back. They’d be a funny sight to see, but it’s 
           late in the evening and no one is around.

                                 CALEB
                        How’s it going back there?
                                 ESTHA
                        I’m afraid you’re going to crash.

                                 CALEB
                        This is the only bike I’ve ever 
                        had. I could ride it with my eyes 
                        closed.

                                 ESTHA
                        I’d appreciate it if you didn’t.

                                 CALEB
                        Noted. 
                            (beat)
                        So how long have you been going to 
                        the meetings?

                                 ESTHA
                        A couple weeks since...you know. 
                        Right around the time I could have 
                        taken the PCR test. 

                                 CALEB
                            (clueless)
                        Oh. Right.

                                 ESTHA
                        I decided not to though. When I 
                        know, I want to really know. For 
                        sure.
                            (beat)
                        It’s a left up here.

                                 CALEB
                        Cool. Hold on.

           Estha giggles as the bike smoothly wraps around the corner. 

                                 CALEB (CONT’D)
                        So PCR. That sounds very 
                        interesting.

                                 ESTHA
                            (beat)
                        You didn’t read the pamphlets, did 
                        you?

                                 CALEB
                        I’m really more of a skimmer.

                                 ESTHA
                        You can take it two weeks after 
                        exposure. It tests for RNA rather 
                        than antibodies.

                            (beat)
                        But there can be false positives, 
                        so.

                                 CALEB
                        Oh. Right. RNA, false positives. I 
                        totally remember now.

           Caleb brakes when they get to a red stop light. A beat then:

                                 CALEB (CONT’D)
                        So how’d you get into all of this?

           Estha is silent. 

                                 CALEB (CONT’D)
                        You know what, it’s alright, we 
                        don’t have to–

                                 ESTHA
                        I was new to the gay thing. It’s 
                        not something we talked about back 
                        home. Then I came here and my 
                        parents kept going on about 
                        arranged marriages through the 
                        temple and I nodded politely. There 
                        was a lot of polite nodding. But I 
                        met this guy at school and–

                                 CALEB
                        Wait. I’m sorry, arranged 
                        marriages? That’s, like, still a 
                        thing people do? 

                                 ESTHA
                        It’s a thing my people do, yes.

           The light turns green and they ride.

                                 CALEB
                        Fuck. That blows.

                                 ESTHA
                        It does-
                            (beat)
                        -blow. My parents had an arranged 
                        marriage. It hasn’t been working 
                        out so well.
                            (beat)
                        It’s a right up here.

           Caleb abruptly veers right without warning. Estha screams. 
           Caleb steadies the bike as they turn the corner.
                                 ESTHA (CONT’D)
                        Could you not drive so recklessly, 
                        please? Lately I’ve been afraid of 
                        dying.

           Caleb brakes hard and Estha grabs on to his shoulders. Caleb 
           smiles.

                                 CALEB
                        Well it would certainly be a shame 
                        for you to miss all that nodding. 

           EXT. ESTHA’S BLOCK - LATER

           As they round the far corner...

                                 ESTHA
                        You can stop here.

           Caleb slowly brakes. He steadies the bike as Estha gets off.

                                 CALEB
                        This is you, huh? It’s cool. You’ve 
                        got a great lawn. That says a lot 
                        about a person. I mean, look at 
                        those really nice-
                            (beat)
                        -bushes. Perfectly trimmed. A Plus. 

                                 ESTHA
                        Actually I live down the street. 
                        But it’s better if you let me off 
                        here.

           Caleb’s taken aback.

                                 CALEB
                        Wow. Do I give off a serial killer 
                        vibe or something?

                                 ESTHA
                        No. My dad stays up late and I 
                        didn’t want him seeing a white boy 
                        drop me off on a gay, two man bike. 
                        It’d raise a lot of questions.

                                 CALEB
                        Oh. Right.

           Estha almost walks away but turns around.

                                 ESTHA
                        You seem nervous.
                                 CALEB
                        Well I’m-
                            (beat)
                        -sometimes I get too talkative 
                        around guys. I ask a lot of 
                        questions. It’s a thing I do. That 
                        I might be working on.

                                 ESTHA
                        I meant nervous about what’s 
                        happening. The three months.

                                 CALEB
                        Oh. Yeah I guess. Sleeping’s hard.
                            (beat)
                        That was really embarrassing, by 
                        the way. Implying I get nervous 
                        around you. For being a guy. 

           Estha laughs.

                                 ESTHA
                        If you can’t sleep, you can call 
                        me. Sometimes I can’t sleep. And I 
                        can’t really talk to anyone either.

           Caleb starts to say something but, for the first time, can’t. 

           Estha pulls a crumpled coupon and a pen from his pocket. He 
           begins writing his number down, when–

                                 CALEB
                        Wait. I’m sorry. Are you writing 
                        your number on the back of a Subway 
                        coupon? What is this, 1997? Just 
                        put it in my phone.

           And embarrassment comes full circle. Estha blushes as he 
           takes Caleb’s phone and enters his number. He starts to walk 
           toward the house when Caleb calls out (a bit too loudly.)

                                 CALEB (CONT’D)
                        Are you going to eat popcorn?

           Estha turns and tells him to “shh.” He smiles while doing so.

                                 CALEB (CONT’D)
                        Or kettle corn? If that’s more your 
                        thing.

           This time Estha shushes with attitude. Caleb scream whispers:

                                 CALEB (CONT’D)
                        Sorry!
           He texts Estha his name and number before pedaling away. 

           INT. CALEB’S BEDROOM - THE NEXT MORNING

           Caleb wakes up when his cell phone starts to ring loudly on 
           his dresser. He puts the pillow over his face and lets the 
           phone go. A beat later, it beeps. 

           Caleb groans and grabs it: there’s a text from Estha and a 
           voice mail. For a moment, Caleb forgets his life and giddily 
           opens Estha’s text. It reads:

           ESTHA: Thanks for the ride home last night. I appreciate not 
           being raped.

           Caleb triumphantly punches the air. He checks his voice mail.

                                 DOCTOR REID (O.S.)
                        “Hey Caleb, it’s Doctor Reid. Stop 
                        by the clinic when you can today. 
                        We’d like to talk about your 
                        results. Call me if you have any 
                        questions. My number is–”

           Caleb hangs up and looks toward the ceiling in terror.

           INT. KITCHEN- 15 MINUTES LATER

           Meryl is reading her index cards at the kitchen table and 
           Benny is stretching for a run when Caleb walks in. He tries 
           to hide his face and makes for the college fund bucket. 

           He closes his eyes, takes a deep breath, and grabs all the 
           money he can. He quickly heads to the fridge for a Minute 
           Maid. Meryl looks up and is elated to see him. 

                                 MERYL
                        There you are! It’s time to 
                        celebrate! I finished the first 
                        half of the series and I think I’m 
                        going to change the name of the 
                        class from ‘On John Stuart Mill’ to 
                        ‘Fallacy of Composition? Pound 
                        Sign, Or Not.’

                                 CALEB
                        Pound sign?

           Meryl raises her index card, revealing a Twitter Hashtag.

                                 CALEB (CONT’D)
                        Oh. Yeah. Pound sign.

           He heads for the door.
                                 MERYL
                        Wait! Where are you going? I wanted 
                        you to take a picture of me to 
                        remember this joyous milestone! 
                        Then maybe we can order Chinese, 
                        play mahjong, hang out.   

                                 CALEB
                        I have work.

                                 MERYL
                        C’mon, Caleb. One picture.

                                 CALEB
                        My camera isn’t on me and I don’t 
                        have time to look for it. Suzanne, 
                        Duke of the Lesbians, is already up 
                        my ass for being late last week.

                                 BENNY
                        At least grab a granola bar or 
                        something.

           Caleb takes a deep breath and heads for the pantry.

                                 MERYL
                            (beat)
                        Hey, Caleb. You alright?

           He takes out one of the bars and bee-lines for the door.

                                 CALEB
                        Yeah I’m good. I’ll see you later.

           He heads out of the house. Meryl turns to Benny.

                                 MERYL
                        Does Caleb seem different to you?

                                 BENNY
                        When does Caleb not seem different?

           Meryl thinks about this before heading to the backyard.

                                 MERYL
                        I’ll be working out back.

           Meryl leaves and Benny’s face drops. He takes a paper out of 
           his pocket and unfolds it: it’s one of Caleb’s HIV flyers.

           INT. GAY HEALTH CLINIC EXAMINATION ROOM - AN HOUR LATER

           Caleb is awake and alert on the examination table this time 
           when Doctor Reid comes in.
                                 DOCTOR REID
                        Hi, Caleb.

                                 CALEB
                        Am I dying? Because that would 
                        really, really suck. 

                                 DOCTOR REID
                        Caleb, no matter what happens, 
                        you’re not going to die. I swear.

                                 CALEB
                        Can doctors promise those things? I 
                        think that’s illegal.

                                 DOCTOR REID
                        Even if you are positive, HIV isn’t 
                        the death sentence it used to be. 

                                 CALEB
                        So you freaked me out this morning 
                        because...

                                 DOCTOR REID
                        You have anal gonorrhea, Caleb.

                                 CALEB
                        Oh.
                            (beat)
                        Is that different from regular, 
                        normal gonorrhea?

                                 DOCTOR REID
                        No, it’s just in the anus. 

                                 CALEB
                        That word is gross.

                                 DOCTOR REID
                        Gonorrhea?

                                 CALEB 
                        No, well yes, but I was talking 
                        about anus. Why don’t you just say 
                        butt?

                                 DOCTOR REID
                        I’m a doctor. I can’t say butt.

                                 CALEB
                        Fine. 
                            (beat)
                        But I don’t have any symptoms.
                                 DOCTOR REID
                        It can be asymptomatic...that 
                        means–

                                 CALEB
                        I know what it means. 

                                 DOCTOR REID
                        I’m also obligated to inform you 
                        that the presence of gonorrhea 
                        helps the contraction of HIV.

                                 CALEB
                        Wait.
                            (beat)
                        Does that mean I–

                                 DOCTOR REID
                        That doesn’t mean anything yet.

           Caleb stares at the floor, thinking. 

                                 DOCTOR REID (CONT’D)
                        Are you allergic to any 
                        medications? Like penicillin?

                                 CALEB
                        No, I don’t think so.

           Doctor Reid opens the door and calls to the nurse.

                                 DOCTOR REID
                        Jennifer? Could you get a dose of 
                        penicillin for Mr. Kahn? Thanks.

           He shuts the door and sits back down.

                                 CALEB
                        So is this a good time to ask you 
                        about this PCR test?

                                 DOCTOR REID
                        Wow. You read the pamphlets?

                                 CALEB
                            (beat)
                        Sure. What’s all that about?

                                 DOCTOR REID
                        It’s a test we can do sooner than 
                        the antibody test. 

                                 CALEB
                        Why didn’t you tell me this before?
                                 DOCTOR REID
                        You left quickly. It’s also not 
                        always accurate and expensive. 

                                 CALEB
                        How not accurate and how much are 
                        we talking here?

                                 DOCTOR REID
                        The test could come back positive 
                        and you might not be positive. 
                        There are a lot of emotional 
                        implications to that kind of 
                        experience. It’s also a few hundred 
                        dollars. 

                                 CALEB
                        I have the money. And I’d like to 
                        get that done. Please.

           Doctor Reid almost says something, but instead nods.

                                 DOCTOR REID
                        Absolutely. 

           Jennifer, the Jamaican nurse, comes in with penicillin and a 
           medical smock. 

                                 DOCTOR REID (CONT’D)
                        Put this on and knock on the door 
                        when you’re ready. We’ll just be 
                        outside.

           Jennifer and Doctor Reid step out of the room. 

           Caleb sits on the table for a minute, thinking. He looks 
           around him and takes in this sterile, awful place. 

           Caleb puts on the smock and knocks. Doctor Reid returns.

                                 DOCTOR REID (CONT’D)
                        Hop up on the examination table and 
                        get into the fetal position.

                                 CALEB
                        Story of my life.

           Caleb climbs atop the table. Doctor Reid readies the shot. 

                                 CALEB (CONT’D)
                        So this should take care of it?
                                 DOCTOR REID
                        Yep. Penicillin is pretty amazing. 
                        Alexander Fleming discovered it in 
                        the 20’s.

                                 CALEB
                        Please spare me the history lesson. 
                        It’s bad enough I’m getting a shot 
                        in my ass.

           Doctor Reid puts the shot in Caleb’s butt. Caleb groans from 
           the pain.

                                 DOCTOR REID
                        He left his lab a mess for the 
                        weekend, and when he came back, a 
                        weird fungus was growing in a petri 
                        dish. And from that fungus, we have 
                        penicillin. 

                                 CALEB
                        That sounds really gross.

           Doctor Reid puts a band-aid on Caleb, who sits up.

                                 DOCTOR REID
                        Yeah, but it’s pretty amazing what 
                        you can discover after shit gets 
                        fucked up.

           EXT. 7/11 - LATER THAT DAY

           Caleb walks up to the door of the 7/11, limping from the 
           penicillin shot in his ass. There’s gauze around his arm 
           again from the PCR test. 

           INT. 7/11 - CONTINUOUS

           When Caleb walks in, Wei is holding back tears while 
           restocking the Hot Cheetos.

                                 CALEB
                        Hey. You okay?

                                 WEI
                        Bitch called it off. She said I was 
                        just a kid and that she has a 
                        shitty family to think about. But 
                        here I am. Still stocking her 
                        fucking Cheetos.

           She suddenly notices the gauze around his arm and tenses up.
                                 WEI (CONT’D)
                        -shit. Is that? 
                            (beat)
                        Are you okay?

                                 CALEB
                        Yeah, yeah. I’m totally fine. Just 
                        some blood tests and needles. 
                        Another casual Tuesday.

           Suzanne comes out of the stock room. She won’t look at Wei.

                                 SUZANNE
                        Caleb. My office. Now.

                                 CALEB
                            (to Wei)
                        Excuse me while I try not to kill 
                        myself.

           INT. SUZANNE’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           There’s a corkboard with two pictures of Suzanne’s family on 
           it: her husband, her kids, and three border collies. Caleb 
           wants to light them on fire. 

                                 SUZANNE
                        Sit.

           Caleb abides.

                                 SUZANNE (CONT’D)
                        I’m not happy, Caleb. 

                                 CALEB
                        I can see that.

                                 SUZANNE
                        You’ve been consistently late to 
                        work, you’ve been consistently 
                        leaving early, and you’ve been 
                        consistently not paying for 
                        cigarettes.

                                 CALEB
                        Well at least I’m consistent.

                                 SUZANNE
                        I won’t take that tone. I’m trying 
                        to run a business here. A 
                        profitable, respectable business. 
                                 CALEB
                        It’s a 7/11. We serve day old hot 
                        dogs and ten types of Funyons.

                                 SUZANNE
                        Do not test me, Caleb. I will fire 
                        you.

           He composes himself. He knows he’s tight on cash.

                                 CALEB
                        I’m sorry. It won’t happen again.

                                 SUZANNE
                        I’m not sure I believe you.

                                 CALEB
                        Suzanne, I need this job. I need to 
                        save money for school. I promise. 
                        It won’t happen again. 

           She makes him sit and sweat for a beat or two, then-

                                 SUZANNE
                        Well it better not. And if I catch 
                        you sleeping here or coming in 
                        after hours one more time, I’m 
                        calling the cops.

           Suzanne starts filing through papers on her desk. She looks 
           back up to Caleb.

                                 SUZANNE (CONT’D)
                            (beat)
                        That’s it. Get to work. 

           INT. 7/11 - CONTINUOUS

           Caleb emerges and Wei runs over to him.

                                 WEI
                        Well?

                                 CALEB
                        I can’t believe you like her. She’s 
                        five kinds of evil. Luckily she 
                        didn’t fire me...yet.

                                 WEI
                        I meant did she say anything about 
                        me?

                                 CALEB
                        No, Wei. She didn’t.
                                 WEI
                        Fuck, man. What do I do? Maybe I’ll 
                        show up to her house. With like a 
                        sign or a boombox or something.

                                 CALEB
                        This is not an 80s rom-com, Wei. 
                        She lives with her husband. And 
                        children.

                                 WEI
                        I know, but-

                                 CALEB
                        Wei. I can’t right now, okay?

                                 WEI
                        Fine. 
                            (beat)
                        We’re still going to get hammered 
                        and watch Spiders from Mars later, 
                        right? I got some sh-weed.

                                 CALEB
                        I don’t know. I close tonight.

                                 WEI
                        So after.
                            (beat)
                        Oh. Some kid was looking for you. 
                        He came in to buy Pop Secret. I 
                        think he’s still waiting outside.

           Caleb darts his gaze to the store front window where Estha 
           stands by the curb. Estha waves to him. Wei looks worried.

                                 WEI (CONT’D)
                        Dude. Are you. Fucking him? Can you-
                            (beat)
                        -do that?

                                 CALEB
                        No, I’m not. He’s just a friend.

                                 WEI
                        Sure. 

                                 CALEB
                        Oh, go organize the canned tuna. 
                        I’ll be right back.

                                 WEI
                        You’re leaving? You almost got 
                        fired for leaving.
           He ignores her and walks outside.

           EXT. 7/11 - CONTINUOUS

           Estha stuffs popcorn in his mouth when Caleb walks over.

                                 CALEB
                        You do know that popcorn isn’t the 
                        only food group?

           Estha holds out the bag to Caleb. Caleb eats some.

                                 ESTHA
                        Jim’s got a cabaret show tonight. 
                        Do you want to go?

                                 CALEB
                        That depends. Are you asking me 
                        out?

                                 ESTHA
                        That depends. Can you give me a 
                        ride?

                                 CALEB
                        Maybe.

                                 ESTHA
                        Then maybe.

           They smile. 

                                 CALEB
                        I don’t get off until 8.

                                 ESTHA
                        The show starts at 9.

                                 CALEB
                        Should I pick you up at your–

                                 ESTHA
                        I’ll meet you here.

                                 CALEB
                        Oh. Okay. Cool.

           A beat. No one speaks and then–

                                 ESTHA
                        Is she your friend?

           He points to a sad Wei who vacantly restocks the chips.
                                 CALEB
                        She’s kind of my only one.

                                 ESTHA
                        I figured.

                                 CALEB
                        How?

                                 ESTHA
                        You both say very strange things.

           He takes another bite and walks away. Caleb watches him go.

           From the exterior, we watch Caleb walk inside the store. He 
           finds Wei in the aisle, taps her on the shoulder, and hugs 
           her. It’s robotic and awkward. She’s taken aback for a beat 
           or two before closing her eyes and returning the gesture.

           EXT. 7/11 - EVENING

           It’s dark. Caleb walks out of the store and Estha is waiting. 
           Caleb unlocks his tandem and steadies it, helping Estha climb 
           on back. Then, they ride.

           A beat afterward, Wei rides up to the 7/11 on her skateboard. 
           She looks inside the darkened windows: no Caleb. She looks at 
           her phone and we see a few texts she sent to him earlier.

           WEI: We still good for tonight?

           Caleb hasn’t responded. Wei walks inside the 7/11. We see her 
           grab a bag of Cheetos and sadly start eating. 

           INT. THE PALACE BAR - LATER

           The only people at Jim’s comedy cabaret are members of The 
           Young and the Sexless and a disgruntled bartender. Doctor 
           Reid sits with Old Larry while Caleb and Estha occupy a 
           neighboring table. Jim’s on stage and owning it. 

                                 JIM
                        When a hot red head walks down the 
                        street, does anyone else imagine 
                        God knocking over a bottle of 
                        Siracha?

           The seven or so people laugh. Caleb checks his phone and sees 
           five missed calls from Wei. Doctor Reid leans over to Caleb 
           and whispers over Jim’s set.
                                                     JIM (O.S.)
                                            Like he’s all, “hey, St. 
                                            Peter, could you pass the hot 
                                            sauce?”
                       DOCTOR REID
           Hey, Caleb. Jim asked if you 
           could take photographs of the 
           set. He wants to put them in 
           the group’s newsletter.
                                               (pretends to knock it 
                                               over)
                                            Whoops. Oh my God! It’s 
                                            Lindsay Lohan circa 2005!

                                 CALEB
                        Wait, we have a newsletter?

                                 DOCTOR REID
                        What kind of support group doesn’t 
                        have a newsletter?

                                 CALEB
                        I don’t know. I haven’t–

                                 DOCTOR REID
                        Great! Thanks.

           The group laughs while Doctor Reid goes back to his table. 
           Caleb hesitates before pulling a camera out of his backpack. 

           He starts to take pictures. When Estha laughs at one of Jim’s 
           ginger jokes, Caleb takes a photograph of him. 

                                 JIM
                        Well I think it’s time for a song.

           The bartender rolls his eyes. Jim points to the DJ.

                                 JIM (CONT’D)
                        This is a special request from an 
                        audience member in the front row! 
                        Everyone wave to Estha! 

           Estha blushes as SPACE ODDITY by David Bowie starts to play. 
           Caleb’s mouth drops. Estha smiles sheepishly. In an 
           exaggerated British accent, Jim croons.

                                 JIM (CONT’D)
                        “Ground control to Major Tom. 
                        Commencing countdown, engine on.”

           EXT. MIAMI STREET - LATER THAT EVENING

           Caleb and Estha ride in the dark.

                                 ESTHA
                        It looked like you got some great 
                        pictures.
                                 CALEB
                        Let’s hope so.

                                 ESTHA
                        Is that what you want to go to 
                        school for?

                                 CALEB
                        That was the plan. Go to college in 
                        New York, eat lots of Ramen, become 
                        a photographer, open a gallery by 
                        the time I’m thirty. But now. 
                        Things have gotten complicated. 

                                 ESTHA
                        Can you even make a living taking 
                        pictures? That doesn’t seem 
                        practical.

                                 CALEB
                        Practical is very 2010.
                            (beat)
                        But I’ve been shitty at it lately 
                        anyway. I can’t seem to focus.

                                 ESTHA.
                        Yeah. 
                            (beat)
                        Today I was sending out financial 
                        aid forms and I accidentally 
                        switched the return and sender 
                        addresses. 

                                 CALEB
                        Is that an Indian thing?

           No response.

                                 CALEB (CONT’D)
                            (beat)
                        I’ve only slept about six hours in 
                        two days.

                                 ESTHA
                        I said you could call me.

                                 CALEB
                        I know.

           Caleb looks at the street. The ground is wet from rain and 
           the road is slicked and slippery. The surrounding houses on 
           the street are asleep. Even a stray cat dozes on a driveway.
                                 CALEB (CONT’D)
                        Do you ever think about what you 
                        would do? If it–

                                 ESTHA
                        No. I try not to.

                                 CALEB
                        Yeah. I mean. I know that if you 
                        take everything you’re supposed to, 
                        it doesn’t kill you. At this point, 
                        you’d probably have worse luck with 
                        cancer. But-
                            (beat)
                        -I don’t know. I kind of wish it 
                        were something else instead. 
                        Anything else. 

                                 ESTHA
                        You’d rather have cancer?

                                 CALEB
                        No. Well. Maybe. At least then it’s 
                        not. I don’t know. It’s not–

                                 ESTHA
                        Your fault?

           They let that sit for a minute.

                                 CALEB
                        Are you going to go to sleep when 
                        you get home or...

                                 ESTHA
                        Am I going home?

           Caleb smiles.

                                 CALEB
                        Have you ever been to shul?

           EXT. CALEB’S OLD SHUL PLAYGROUND - CONTINUOUS

           Caleb locks his bike on one of the playground fence posts 
           while Estha waits by the gate. He looks around nervously.

                                 ESTHA
                        Are we going to get into trouble?

                                 CALEB
                        It’s always a possibility.
           Caleb’s phone starts to vibrate: it’s a call from Wei. As he 
           lets it ring, Estha stares at the temple.

                                 ESTHA
                        Is this where your step dad works?

           The phone goes quiet. Caleb puts it in his pocket.

                                 CALEB
                        He’s not my step dad.

                                 ESTHA
                        So what is he?

                                 CALEB
                        An asshole.

                                 ESTHA
                        Why would your mom marry an 
                        asshole?

                                 CALEB
                        Because she’s an asshole.

           Estha looks down and puts his hands in his pockets.

                                 ESTHA
                            (beat)
                        I know she’s not great but you 
                        really shouldn’t talk about her 
                        like that. She’s still your mom.

           Caleb looks up from the bike lock.

                                 CALEB
                        Moms aren’t supposed to forget to 
                        pick you up from middle school 
                        because she’s too busy finding a 
                        new husband. Moms aren’t supposed 
                        to say that you have to live with 
                        your grandma because your gay 
                        lifestyle doesn’t go with said 
                        husband’s mezuzah. Moms aren’t 
                        supposed to pretend like you’re a 
                        total and complete stranger.

                                 ESTHA
                            (beat)
                        What’s a mezuzah?

                                 CALEB
                        It’s like this thing you nail to 
                        your house that has the bible in it 
                        or something.
                                 ESTHA
                        Why would you nail the bible to 
                        your house?

                                 CALEB
                        Your people would too if they were 
                        constantly being robbed of shit 
                        since the dawn of Jew.

                        Hey, Indians have their problems 
                        too. Haven’t you heard about 
                        Kashmir?

                                 CALEB
                        You know I’m not into fashion.

           Caleb puts an arm around his shoulders, lightening the mood.

                        Now, come on. This jungle gym is 
                        gonna blow your mind.

           INT. PLAYGROUND - CONTINUOUS

           There are monkey bars, a blue tunnel, and a slide sticking 
           out from a mini jungle gym. Caleb gives a tour.

                                 CALEB
                        So I lost three baby teeth after 
                        falling off these monkey bars. The 
                        tooth fairy was supposed to give me 
                        money, but instead I got two carrot 
                        sticks and a pack of Chiclets.

                                 ESTHA
                        That’s upsetting.

                                 CALEB
                        It was pretty hilarious actually. 
                        My dad was always doing stupid shit 
                        like that.
                            (beat)
                        I had my first kiss inside this 
                        tunnel with Jordan Levinson during 
                        first grade day care. She smelled 
                        like apple sauce and always had 
                        glue in her hair. Needless to say, 
                        I was smitten.

                                 ESTHA
                        What happened to him?
                                 CALEB
                        Jordan was a girl. I didn’t kiss a 
                        boy until Ryan Green’s 15th 
                        birthday party.

                            (beat)
                        I meant your dad.

                                 CALEB
                        Oh. He had a heart attack. Nothing 
                        super glamorous.
                            (pointing to the jungle 
                             gym)
                        I once peed down this slide. 
                            (beat)
                        Okay, I’m lying. I peed down this 
                        slide a lot.

                                 ESTHA
                        That’s hard.

                                 CALEB
                        I’ve got great aim.

                                 ESTHA
                        I was referring to–

                                 CALEB
                        I know what you were referring to.

           Caleb walks to the other side of the slide.

                                 ESTHA
                        When did he–

                                 CALEB
                        I’m sorry, but I kind of can’t talk 
                        about it.

                                 ESTHA
                        Oh. Okay.

           The ensuing silence isn’t so much awkward as it is sad.

                                 ESTHA (CONT’D)
                        So about this tunnel.

           INT. THE BLUE TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

           The tunnel is large enough for Caleb and Estha to sit Indian-
           style. They stare at each other.
                                 ESTHA
                        I think I’m sitting on a dead 
                        spider.

                                 CALEB
                        Welcome to the blue tunnel.

                                 ESTHA
                        I can’t believe this is outside the 
                        place where you pray.

                                 CALEB
                        I mean, sure there’s a sanctuary in 
                        there, but it’s also a preschool 
                        and a catering hall. We’re nothing 
                        if not an economical people.

           Estha grabs Caleb’s face and kisses him. It’s quick and they 
           soon separate, staring at one another. 

           Caleb suddenly grabs Estha’s face and they go at it again, 
           harder this time. It lasts for a few seconds before Caleb 
           gets the spins.

           INT. MOTEL ROOM - FLASHACK

           The dark figure pushes Caleb hard against the wall. He grabs 
           his face and kisses him violently, biting his lip.

           The figure picks Caleb up and throws him on the bed. 

           Caleb’s drunk and can’t focus. The figure mounts him and 
           licks his neck. He starts to pull down Caleb’s pants.

                                 CALEB
                            (muffled)
                        Wait. Wait one minute.

           Caleb slips off the bed and heads toward the bathroom, 
           exaggerating his hip movements from side to side as he walks. 
           When he opens the bathroom door, he looks over his shoulder 
           to the bed and smiles.

                                                               CUT TO:

           INT. THE BLUE TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

           Caleb pulls back from Estha.

                                 ESTHA
                        Are you okay?

                                 CALEB
                        Yeah. Yeah, I’m good. 
           Caleb pop kisses Estha on the cheek.

                                 CALEB (CONT’D)
                        Ready to go?

                                 ESTHA
                        Sure.

           Caleb turns around and crawls out of the tunnel. We linger on 
           Estha’s face.

           TIME CARD: Day 35

           INT. CHRIST THE ROCK BASEMENT - AFTERNOON

           The regular group sits in a circle while Estha shares. He 
           intermittently eats handfuls of popcorn.

                                 ESTHA
                        I’ve been okay. I’m trying to keep 
                        my mind busy as much as I can. I 
                        cooked last night for the first 
                        time in a while. That was nice. 
                            (beat)
                        Well, it was more distracting than 
                        nice I guess, but, for now, 
                        distracting is-

           He looks at Caleb. They smile.

                                 ESTHA (CONT’D)
                        -nice. I put some leftovers on the 
                        back table. It’s Meen Vevichathu. 
                        Fish curry.

           Old Larry turns to Caleb.

                                 OLD LARRY
                            (meant to be a whisper)
                        SOMETHING SMELLS VERY STRANGE!

                                 DOCTOR REID
                            (ignoring Larry)
                        Thanks, Estha. 
                            (beat)
                        And how about you, Caleb?

                                 CALEB
                        Yeah, you know, I’m pretty good. 
                        Things have been looking up 
                        recently. My job’s great. I talked 
                        to my boss last week and we’re both 
                        excited to take our work 
                        relationship to the next level. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 CALEB (CONT'D)
                        I get my PCR results back tomorrow, 
                        and I’m strangely zen about the 
                        whole thing. I think it’s this new 
                        sleep regimen I’m on. 
                            (beat)
                        Oh. And I’ve been riding my bike 
                        everywhere lately, so I’m both 
                        saving the planet and engaging my 
                        core. 

                                 DOCTOR REID
                        That’s great, Caleb.

           The group politely smiles at Caleb. Estha gives him an 
           encouraging nod. Caleb smiles back.

           INT. CALEB’S BEDROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Caleb looks like he’s peacefully asleep in bed. For a few 
           beats, he breathes rhythmically, cradling his pillow.

           Suddenly, he whips his eyes open and snatches the clock off 
           his dresser.  He brings it to his face: 1:00am. Caleb groans 
           and hits the mattress with his fists. 

           He stares at the ceiling and breathes deeply, face twisted in 
           pain. After a beat, he gets up, turns a record player on, and 
           removes a joint from the night-stand. 

           NIGHT MONTAGE

           Each segment starts with a shot of the clock.

           1:30 am - Caleb sways stoned to YOUNG AMERICANS.

           2:00 am - Caleb drinks a Minute Maid lemonade while putting 
           on eyeliner. He starts to draw random shapes on his face. 

           2:30 am - Caleb floats two recently folded origami swans in a 
           bowl of water. He lights them on fire with a match. They 
           start to really burn, hilariously startling a stoned Caleb. 

           3:00 am - He cuts out the heads of models in magazines and 
           mismatches their facial features. He takes photographs of the 
           Picasso-esque creations and even holds up some cut outs to 
           his own face. He takes pictures of that too. He sees the 
           grant forms sitting on his desk. 

           3:30 am - Caleb attempts to fill out the grant paperwork. He 
           shuffles through his photographs and tries to come up with a 
           collection of pieces he likes. He hates everything. After a 
           beat, he ends up slamming his head on the desk in 
           frustration. 
           4:00 am - Caleb is under the sheets, masturbating.

           4:30 am - Caleb stares vacantly at the ceiling before 
           reaching for his phone. He scrolls through his contacts and 
           comes across Estha’s name. He hesitates and brushes his 
           finger over the CALL button for a beat or two. 

           He calls. But, after it rings four times, he hangs up. 

           As Caleb places the phone back on the dresser, it starts to 
           ring. He answers:

                                 CALEB
                        Hey.

           INT. MERYL’S KITCHEN - LATE MORNING

           Caleb’s eyes have more bags than a Japanese tour group when 
           he tries to slip out, unnoticed. As he makes his way past the 
           kitchen table, someone grabs his backpack from behind.

                                 BENNY
                        And where are you going?

                                 CALEB
                        Work.

                                 BENNY
                        And where are you really going?

                                 CALEB
                        To do drugs and graffiti buildings 
                        and tee pee the principal’s house.

                                 BENNY
                        Caleb.

                                 CALEB
                        Not now, Benny. Please.

           Benny lets go and Caleb makes for the door.

                                 BENNY
                        The Young and the Sexless?

           Caleb stops in his tracks. Benny unfolds the flyer. 

                                 CALEB
                        Where’d you find that?

                                 BENNY
                        You left it in your bike basket.

           Caleb doesn’t flinch.
                                 CALEB
                        Oh, right. I’m just doing this 
                        photo series about gay men in 
                        crisis: the HIV positive, homeless 
                        youth, those that can’t dress for 
                        their body type.

                                 BENNY
                        Liar.

                                 CALEB
                        Go fuck yourself, Benny.

           Caleb opens the door.

                                 BENNY
                        Tell her. Or I will.

           Caleb stops. He turns and looks at Benny, half in rage, half 
           in despair. Benny’s stomach drops when he sees Caleb’s face.

                                 BENNY (CONT’D)
                        You’re still a kid, Caleb.

           Caleb slams the door.

           EXT. ESTHA’S HOUSE - DAY

           Caleb peeks out from behind an oak and watches Estha unload 
           groceries from his mother’s car. 

           Estha is orderly about unloading, organizing the groceries on 
           the concrete driveway before placing them into a cart. 

           He rolls them toward the house when his mother appears. She 
           looks at the bags and reprimands him in Hindi. Estha takes a 
           deep breath and recombines the various food items into 
           different bags. Caleb watches in wonder. 

           Caleb hides behind the tree and logs onto a website from his 
           phone: LAB RESULTS ONLINE. There’s an unopened message that 
           reads, RESULTS. He puts it back in his pocket.  

           Caleb sees Estha give his mother a kiss on the cheek before 
           walking down the driveway. His mother watches him closely as 
           he goes. 

           When she disappears inside the house, Caleb makes himself 
           known. Estha rushes over to him in a panic.

                                 ESTHA
                        What are you doing? You were 
                        supposed to meet me at the corner!
                                 CALEB
                        They had their sprinklers on. I 
                        wasn’t going to get wet for you.

                                 ESTHA
                        My mother could have seen you.

                                 CALEB
                        So what?

                                 ESTHA
                        What do you mean “so what?” You 
                        know “so what.” 

                                 CALEB
                        Yeah. Sorry.

                                 ESTHA
                        It’s fine.
                            (beat)
                        Did you fall back asleep?

                                 CALEB
                        No.

                                 ESTHA
                        Did you check your results?

                                 CALEB
                        Too nervous.

                                 ESTHA
                        Do you want me to check them for 
                        you?

                                 CALEB
                        I’m good.

                                 ESTHA
                        You’re being difficult.

                                 CALEB 
                        Benny found the support group flyer 
                        and today is PCR day, so I’m in a 
                        shitty mood. Sorry.

                                 ESTHA
                        Let’s do something about that.
           EXT. BOOMERS THEME PARK - AN HOUR LATER

           Caleb and Estha are surrounded by Cuban regulars and the 
           guests of a seven year old’s birthday party at a run-down 
           theme park. They walk past cotton candy stands, bumper cars, 
           and an embarrassingly small roller coaster.

                                 CALEB
                        What are we doing here? 

                                 ESTHA
                        Having fun. Have you been here 
                        before?

                                 CALEB
                        Twice. But luckily I was drunk both 
                        times. The roller coaster was 
                        decent though.

           Estha ignores his attitude.

                                 ESTHA
                        Do you want to check the message 
                        now or-how are you feeling?

                                 CALEB
                        Anxious. 
                            (beat)
                        I mean look at all these little 
                        people. We’re practically bathing 
                        in e.coli.

           Estha stops walking and turns to him in a way that 
           intimidates the shit out of Caleb.

                                 ESTHA
                        Listen. I’m trying to help. I 
                        really am. But if you’re going to 
                        keep acting like this, I’m going to 
                        leave. You don’t have to turn 
                        everything into a joke all the 
                        time. Not with me.

                                 CALEB
                        I’m sorry. Everything is just crap 
                        for me right now and I–

                                 ESTHA
                        Yeah. Everything is crap. But not 
                        just for you. The world doesn’t 
                        revolve around Caleb Kahn. 

                                 CALEB
                        I never said it did-
                                 ESTHA
                        Don’t you remember how we met? I’m 
                        in crap too. And I get that you’re 
                        scared about today, but you don’t 
                        have to take it out on me.

                                 CALEB
                        Okay okay. I get it. I’m sorry. 
                        You’re right.

                                 ESTHA
                        Thank you. 

           As soon as Estha says this, a little girl in a pink princess 
           dress runs over and vomits on Estha’s shoes. Her mother 
           hurries over and picks her up, murmuring “lo siento” before 
           whisking the girl away. 

           Estha’s mouth is agape in shock. Caleb laughs. 

                                 CALEB
                        Looks like everyone is taking 
                        things out on you today. 

                                 ESTHA
                        I hate you so much right now.

           They start to laugh.

                                 CALEB
                        Maybe we should find a bathroom.

                                 ESTHA
                        Please.

           EXT. CAROUSEL - CONTINUOUS

           On their way to the bathroom, Caleb sees a Cuban kid holding 
           a little girl’s hand by the carousel. He whips around.

                                 CALEB
                        Fuck.

                                 ESTHA
                        What’s wrong?

                                 CALEB
                        Um...nothing.

                                 ESTHA
                        It doesn’t sound like nothing.

                                 CALEB
                        Let’s just wait here for a second.
                                 ESTHA
                        Caleb. I’m covered in vomit. Can we 
                        please just go to the bathroom?

                                 CALEB
                        Do you see a kind of cute Latino 
                        heading in this direction.

           Estha looks over Caleb’s shoulder to see Dom walking over.

                                 ESTHA
                        I mean he’s not my type but if 
                        that’s what you’re into.

           Caleb looks around for a place to run to, but they’re out in 
           the open. After a beat, Dom taps Caleb on the shoulder.

                                 DOM
                        Caleb?

           Caleb tries to act “super chill.”

                                 CALEB
                        Oh. Hey, man. What’s up?

                                 DOM
                        Just here for my cousin’s birthday.
                            (beat)
                        It’s good to see you. 

                                 CALEB
                        Yeah, back at ya. 

           A beat. It’s very awkward.

                                 DOM
                        You weren’t at graduation.

           Estha watches this exchange with amusement.

                                 CALEB
                        Oh, yeah. Graduation. I just 
                        couldn’t make it. You know. I had 
                        some shit to do.

                                 DOM
                        You always did.
                            (beat)
                        I heard about Parsons. Congrats. 

                                 CALEB
                        Yeah, thanks.
                                 DOM
                        When do you leave?

           Estha looks to Caleb, who swallows hard.

                                 CALEB
                        Oh, you know, probably late August 
                        or something.

                                 DOM
                        That’s great. I leave for Cali in a 
                        few weeks. 

                                 CALEB
                        Right. I forgot. Have fun with 
                        that.

           Now even Estha feels awkward. A beat and then:

                                 DOM
                        Listen. I’m sorry about-

                                 CALEB
                        Fuck, man. Sorry. We have to run. 
                        My really good friend Estha and I 
                        need to find a bathroom.

           Estha offers his hand to Dom.

                                 ESTHA
                        Hi, I’m Es-

           Caleb grabs Estha’s hand and pulls him away.

                                 CALEB
                        Okay it was great to see you bye!

           Caleb drags Estha to the bathroom. Dom remains standing 
           there, half upset, half confused.

           INT. BOOMER’S BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Estha washes off his shoes and Caleb’s lost in thought.

                                 ESTHA
                        That was interesting.

                                 CALEB
                        I know. I haven’t been vomited on 
                        in years.

                                 ESTHA
                            (beat)
                        Who was he?
                                 CALEB
                        No one really. Just my ex-
                        boyfriend.

                                 ESTHA
                        Was he the one that gave you-
                            (beat)
                        I mean, might have given-

                                 CALEB
                        Oh. No no no. He never even liked 
                        to have sex. Just a lot of blow 
                        jobs and the occasional dry hump.
                            (beat)
                        God, that would be shitty. Getting 
                        it from a slutty boyfriend. Can you 
                        imagine?

           Estha looks down sadly. He keeps wiping the vomit off of him.

                                 ESTHA
                        Yeah.

           Silence.

                                 CALEB
                        Oh. I. I didn’t know. We never 
                        really-

                                 ESTHA
                        It’s alright. 
                            (beat)
                        You should check your phone soon.

                                 CALEB
                        Yeah. Definitely.
                            (beat)
                        But maybe we should eat first or 
                        something. Don’t want to have a 
                        panic attack on an empty stomach.

           Estha turns off the sink. 

           EXT. BOOMERS THEME PARK - CONTINUOUS

           Estha and Caleb wait in line at a popcorn stand.

                                 CALEB
                        I was thinking more along the lines 
                        of pizza.

                                 ESTHA
                        I want popcorn.
                                 CALEB
                        Why? What the fuck is so good about 
                        popcorn?

           A mother in line with her son scowls at Caleb’s cursing. She 
           picks her kid up and quickly exits the line.

                                 ESTHA
                        Back in Kerala we used to go to the 
                        American movie theater on Sundays. 
                        It was called Golden Cinema and my 
                        mother made me wash the car for two 
                        hours before going. For us, it was 
                        an event. 

                                 CALEB
                        Sounds like it.

                                 ESTHA
                        I would look forward to it all 
                        week. They only ever played the 
                        classics, like Breakfast at 
                        Tiffany’s or A Star is Born. 

                                 CALEB
                        Those are great movies. Audrey 
                        Hepburn is my spirit animal.

                                 ESTHA
                        Well I didn’t really care what the 
                        movie was anyway. I just liked the 
                        popcorn and being somewhere that 
                        wasn’t home. Then when stuff got 
                        bad with my parents, I’d eat the 
                        stale popcorn I stashed in my coat 
                        pocket and pretend I was still at 
                        Golden Cinema, watching Holly 
                        Golightly look for her cat. 

           It’s their turn in line.

                                 POPCORN VENDOR
                        How many bags?

                                 ESTHA
                        Two, please.

           As he scoops their popcorn:

                                 CALEB
                        Well now you’re here and you can 
                        get away whenever you want. So 
                        maybe try a vegetable.
                                 ESTHA
                        I still like eating it. I don’t 
                        know. It helps me not be-

           Estha thinks of a word.

                                 CALEB
                        Sad?

                                 ESTHA
                            (beat)
                        Present.

           A moment of silence

                                 POPCORN VENDOR
                        Five dollars please.

           Estha hands him the money.

           EXT. WOODEN ROLLER COASTER - MOMENTS LATER

           Estha and Caleb are in line for the wooden roller coaster. 
           Estha has finished his popcorn. Caleb hasn’t touched his.

                                 CALEB
                        Okay. I’m going to do it.

                                 ESTHA
                        Yeah?

                                 CALEB 
                        Yeah.

           Estha puts his hand on Caleb’s shoulder.

           Caleb takes out his phone and takes a deep breath. The roller 
           coaster car arrives and more people get on. Suddenly they’re 
           next in line. Estha starts to nervously eat Caleb’s popcorn.

           Caleb gets on the web browser and hesitates before hitting 
           RESULTS. He clicks it and closes his eyes. He opens them.

                                 CALEB (CONT’D)
                        Shit. It’s still loading.

           Estha looks like he’s going to vomit, but when Caleb looks up 
           at him, Estha forces a smile. When Caleb looks back down at 
           his phone, the web browser says ERROR.

                                 CALEB (CONT’D)
                        Error? Are you shitting me!? 

           He refreshes the page. The browser says NO DATA SERVICE.
                                 CALEB (CONT’D)
                        Now no service? This is a fucking 
                        joke.

           The roller coaster car comes back and it’s their turn to get 
           on. Everyone hops in but Caleb and Estha. The RIDE OPERATOR 
           reprimands them.

                                 RIDE OPERATOR
                        Dudes, I have to ask you to get in 
                        the car or get out of line.

                                 CALEB
                        This is some bullshit.

                                 RIDE OPERATOR
                        You have five more seconds.

           Caleb hurriedly enters the car. Estha follows. The car moves 
           around the corner and begins the infamous roller coaster slow 
           climb to the top. Caleb keeps hitting refresh.

                                 CALEB
                        Of course this would happen. Of 
                        course the moment I fucking go on, 
                        it–

           Caleb refreshes the page again and this time, there’s no 
           error. His results pop up: INCONCLUSIVE.

                                 CALEB (CONT’D)
                        Inconclusive.

                                 ESTHA
                        What?

                                 CALEB
                        It says it’s–
                            (beat)
                        -it says inconclusive.

                                 ESTHA
                        Inconclusive?

                                 CALEB
                        Inconclusive.

           As they go to the top, Estha says it a little louder.

                                 ESTHA
                        Inconclusive.
                                 CALEB
                        Yeah, inconclusive. I said it like 
                        four fucking times.

           This time, Estha almost shouts it.

                                 ESTHA
                        Inconclusive!

                                 CALEB
                        Keep your goddam voice down.

           Estha smiles and raises his hands in the air, roller coaster 
           style, and screams as loudly as he possibly can.

                                 ESTHA
                        INCONCLUSIVE!

                                 CALEB
                        What are you–

           Estha grabs Caleb’s hand and holds it up in the air with his.

                                 ESTHA
                        INCONCLUSIVE! INCONCLUSIVE!

           Estha looks at Caleb and smiles. Caleb takes a deep breath. 
           He says it loudly, but not as loudly as Estha.

                                 CALEB
                        Inconclusive.

                                 ESTHA
                        INCONCLUSIVE!

           Caleb gets it. He screams.

                                 CALEB
                        INCONCLUSIVE!

           As the roller coaster almost reaches the top, they keep 
           screaming. The other car passengers look at them like they’ve 
           just escaped from the mental ward.

                          ESTHA
                                                        CALEB
           INCONCLUSIVE!
                                            INCONCLUSIVE!

           As the car is about to go over, there’s a shudder. Both Caleb 
           and Estha immediately bring their hands down and hold on to 
           the car tightly. 

           Everyone whispers concerns around them. After a beat, the 
           ride operator talks over the loud speaker.
                                 RIDE OPERATOR (O.S.)
                        Sorry, people. It looks like Wacky 
                        Wooden Coaster has malfunctioned. 
                        Please keep your hands and feet 
                        inside the vehicle until it comes 
                        to a complete stop. There will be 
                        absolutely no refunds. 

           The car slowly and hilariously starts to descend back down 
           the track. After a beat of this, Estha turns to Caleb.

                                 ESTHA
                        Are you alright?

                                 CALEB
                        Yeah. It could have said something 
                        worse, right?

                                 ESTHA
                        Definitely.

           Caleb and Estha both wearily look off into space as the car 
           continues its way down to the platform.

           EXT. CALEB’S OLD HOUSE - THAT EVENING

           Caleb sits on his bike and stares across the street at his 
           mother’s mailbox. Even at night, it still looks the color of 
           urine. 

           He suddenly sees a nice sedan driving down the street. It 
           parks on the side of the road in front of the house. Caleb 
           retreats into darkness so he can’t be seen. 

           His mom’s HUSBAND (an average, zaftig rabbi) gets out of the 
           car. As he walks to the house, Caleb watches him closely.

           When he approaches the door, it opens. Caleb’s mom greets him 
           with a kiss and lets him in. Caleb stares at the closed door.

           INT. MERYL’S KITCHEN - LATER THAT EVENING

           The house is quiet. Caleb walks into the kitchen, but we 
           can’t quite make out the look on his face in the dark. He 
           grabs a juice box and makes his way toward the hall.

           INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Caleb trudges slowly toward his room. Just before he opens 
           his door, he hears a car skid to a stop and he suddenly gets 
           the spins again...
           EXT. CAR - FLASHBACK

           Caleb is in the passenger seat of a car jerking off the dark 
           figure as he drives. The figure’s moans are interrupted when 
           the car screeches to a halt. 

           The car has knocked over a garbage can and scratched the 
           Prius in an adjacent parking spot. Caleb giggles. Outside the 
           windshield, he sees a poorly lit motel.

           EXT. MOTEL ROOM - FLASHBACK CONTINUOUS

           Caleb and the dark figure make out and stumble down the 
           outdoor corridor hallway to a motel room. The figure pushes 
           Caleb up against the door and bites his ear. The following 
           conversation is muffled. 

                                 CALEB
                        You clean?

           The figure pulls back and smiles. Then he continues to make 
           out with him. Caleb pushes away.

                                 CALEB (CONT’D)
                        Are. You. Clean?

           The figure pulls back.

                                 FIGURE
                        No entiendo.

                                 CALEB
                        Clean. Limpio.

                                 FIGURE
                        Si. Si, con condom.

           They make out again and the figure opens the motel door. They 
           fall through while making out as we...

                                                               CUT TO:

           INT. CALEB’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Caleb stumbles through the door into his bedroom. He makes it 
           to his bed and sits on the edge. 

           After a beat, he pulls out his phone and accesses the results 
           website again: INCONCLUSIVE. He reaches into a drawer. 

           Caleb pulls out a joint and lighter. He attempts to light the 
           weed but his hands are too shakey. He drops the joint. 
           Caleb doesn’t pick it up and he doesn’t move. Instead, we 
           CLOSE UP on his face, which blankly stares at the wall.

           INT. MERYL’S KITCHEN - THE NEXT MORNING

           CLOSE UP on Meryl’s face. She’s crying, but calmly. We pull 
           out to see Caleb awkwardly sitting across from her.

                                 MERYL
                        Oh my God, Cay. How long have you-
                        when did this-why, why are you just 
                        telling me now?

           She pulls him into her bosom and hugs him while she cries.

                                 CALEB
                        Seriously, I’m fine. I don’t know 
                        if I have it. I could not have it. 
                        Honestly, I probably don’t have it.

                                 MERYL
                        Who did this to you? I’m getting my 
                        gun. I’ll kill him.

                                 CALEB
                        No no no. Don’t do-
                            (beat)
                        -wait, you have a gun?

                                 MERYL
                        Of course I have a gun. We live in 
                        Florida.

                                 CALEB
                        That makes me uncomfortable.

                                 MERYL
                        CALEB!

                                 CALEB
                        It was a stupid one night stand. He 
                        doesn’t live here anymore anyway.

           Meryl composes herself.

                                 MERYL
                        Cay. Whatever you need. Whatever I 
                        can do. Everything’s going to be 
                        fine. I promise. You’re going to be 
                        just fine. No matter what happens. 
                        You’re going to be great.

           She looks at him for a beat and then breaks out into 
           hysterics again, pulling him in close.
           INT. CHRIST THE ROCK BASEMENT - THE FOLLOWING EVENING

                                 DOCTOR REID
                        How did it feel telling your 
                        grandmother?

                                 CALEB
                        Good. It was good. 
                            (beat)
                        And terrifying. 

                                 DOCTOR REID
                        I think you did the right thing. 
                        It’s always good to have someone 
                        you can talk to at home.

                                 CALEB
                        Yeah. And the PCR inconclusive? 
                        That was shitty. But, it’s also 
                        kind of the first time I didn’t 
                        react to bad news like a fucking 
                        nut job. I mean, I did freak out a 
                        little bit, but I didn’t drink or 
                        do something too reckless. I’m kind 
                        of. Proud of myself? I don’t know 
                        if that makes sense. I’m definitely 
                        not going to take the PCR again 
                        though. 

           Caleb looks at Estha.

                                 CALEB (CONT’D)
                        When I know, I want to know for 
                        sure.

                                 JIM
                        That makes perfect sense. Good for 
                        you, sir. 

                                 DOCTOR REID
                        And, Estha, how are things going 
                        with you?

           Estha looks a bit nauseous. 

                                 ESTHA
                        They’ve been better. I find out two 
                        weeks from tomorrow and days have 
                        been passing pretty slowly. 

                                 DOCTOR REID
                        That’s very normal.
           Estha seems to get lost in thought. He doesn’t grab popcorn 
           this time. Instead, he lets go of the bag and it falls next 
           to his chair.

                                 ESTHA
                        I’m also scared that my parents 
                        will find out and never talk to me 
                        again.

           Caleb looks down at his feet and Estha looks at Caleb.

                                 ESTHA (CONT’D)
                        No, I’m sorry. It’s not. I didn’t 
                        mean that-
                            (beat)
                        -my cousin had a friend back home 
                        who was caught kissing a boy. No 
                        one has seen him since. His parents 
                        told everyone he went to stay with 
                        an uncle in Bombay, but I never 
                        thought they knew anyone in Bombay 
                        and I’m almost positive he didn’t 
                        have an uncle. 

           Estha starts to tear up: Estha, for the first time, starts to 
           lose it.

                                 ESTHA (CONT’D)
                        I just don’t want to be here 
                        anymore. I want to go back, I would 
                        even go forward, no matter what 
                        that means. It’s here. Here is 
                        where I’m having a problem. When I 
                        can’t even watch the news with my 
                        parents without thinking that they 
                        know it’s there. That they can 
                        smell it on me. 

                                 JIM
                            (softly)
                        Honey. Trust me. With enough 
                        deodorant, the HIV doesn’t smell. 

           Dr. Reid leans over and hits Jim in the arm. Jim winces.

                                 ESTHA
                        I’m not talking about HIV.

                                 DOCTOR REID
                        Then what are you talking about?

                                 ESTHA
                        Shame.
           TIME CARD: DAY 50

           EXT. ESTHA’S HOUSE - MORNING

           Caleb sneaks around Estha’s house when his phone rings. It’s 
           Wei. She’s at the 7/11, whispering into her cell phone behind 
           a counter. Suzanne is screaming at someone in her office in 
           the background. INTERCUT between Caleb and Wei. 

                                 CALEB
                            (whispered)
                        What? 

                                 WEI
                        Happy fourth to you too, dick. You 
                        wanna get high and light fireworks 
                        on my roof like last year?

           Caleb stalks around the side of Estha’s house.

                                 CALEB
                        No. I can’t, sorry. There’s 
                        something I have to do.

                                 WEI
                        Why do you keep ditching me and why 
                        the fuck are you whispering?

                                 CALEB
                        Sorry, I’m on a mission of a 
                        delicate nature.

                                 WEI
                        Are you with that weird Indian dude 
                        again?

                                 CALEB
                        His name is Estha.

                                 WEI
                        Alright whatever, but I gotta tell 
                        you about Suzanne later, man. She 
                        said she loved me this morning. 
                        That she fucking LOVED me! Can you 
                        believe it?! 

                                 CALEB
                        No, actually.

           Caleb steps on a fallen branch and snaps it. It’s loud. He 
           looks around nervously to see if he’s been spotted.
                                 WEI
                        She said she was thinking about 
                        separating from her guy for a 
                        while. How sick is that!? 

                                 CALEB
                        Define sick.

                                 WEI
                        Whatever, man. I think I- 

                                 CALEB
                        Sorry, Wei. Can’t talk. I’ll call 
                        you later.

           Caleb hangs up and continues to stalk. Wei hangs up, annoyed. 

           EXT. ESTHA’S BEDROOM WINDOW - CONTINUOUS

           Caleb crouches beneath Estha’s window and taps on it. Estha 
           peeks through the blinds and Caleb does a lewd gesture. He 
           opens the window.

                                 ESTHA
                        Get out of here. Go!

                                 CALEB
                        Meet me outside.

                                 ESTHA
                        I can’t believe you’re here. You 
                        know my parents are crazy. You have 
                        to leave.

                                 CALEB
                        I’m not leaving until you promise 
                        to meet me around the corner.

                                 ESTHA
                        Fine. I promise.

                                 CALEB
                        Good. If you don’t I’m coming back 
                        to-

                                 ESTHA
                            (scream whispered)
                        Go!

           Caleb sneaks away.
           EXT. AROUND THE CORNER - 5 MINUTES LATER

           Estha walks down the street to Caleb, who waits with his 
           bike. Estha looks like complete shit: his hair is messy, he 
           hasn’t slept in days, and his outfit, for the first time, is 
           not neatly pleated.

                                 CALEB
                        Ready to go?

                                 ESTHA
                        Where?

                                 CALEB
                        Where? It’s the fourth of July! 
                        Anywhere!

                                 ESTHA
                        I’m not feeling well.

                                 CALEB
                        But it’s a holiday.

                                 ESTHA
                        I don’t celebrate American 
                        holidays. I’m not from this 
                        country.

                                 CALEB
                        What’s more American than that?

                                 ESTHA
                        Caleb, I-

                                 CALEB
                        I’m sorry, but if you made me go to 
                        a run down theme park, I can-

                                 ESTHA
                        It’s tomorrow, Caleb. I get my 
                        results tomorrow.

                                 CALEB
                        I know what tomorrow is. 

           Caleb reaches into his bag and pulls out kettle corn. He 
           throws it to Estha. Estha catches it hard and the bag pops, 
           startling him awake.

                                 CALEB (CONT’D)
                        Get on.
           EXT. THE BEACH - THAT AFTERNOON/EVENING

           MONTAGE

           The montage plays over a song that may or may not be SHOT AT 
           THE NIGHT by The Killers. It’s a purposefully indulgent 
           Instagram/music video romantic escapade.

           -Caleb and Estha arrive at the beach amidst a bunch of 
           people. They park their bike on a NO PARKING sign and walk 
           around the boardwalk.

           -Estha looks sad as Caleb buys ice cream. Caleb sees Estha 
           sulk and abruptly smushes his ice cream on Estha’s nose. 
           Estha freezes in shock and throws his cone at Caleb. Caleb 
           laughs. 

           -They play mini-golf by the boardwalk. Caleb makes a really 
           insane hole in one and does a funky victory dance. Estha 
           merely looks down at his shoes. Caleb jumps on Estha’s back, 
           giggling. Estha finally smiles.

           -As the sun is setting, they eat hot dogs on a blanket in the 
           sand, surrounded by other July Fourth-goers. As Estha opens 
           his mouth wide to take a bite, Caleb takes a picture of him 
           putting the long weiner in his mouth.

           -After the sun has gone down, Caleb puts his arm around Estha 
           as they watch fireworks.

           -As others are leaving the beach, Caleb takes off his and 
           Estha’s shoes and drags Estha to the water. They frolic like 
           the queens they are in the high tide, splashing one another.

           EXT. LIFE GUARD STAND - EVENING

           The music fades out as Caleb and Estha finish carving 
           something next to KAHNED BY THE KAHNS on the lifeguard stand. 
           It reads: The Young. And the Sexless?

                                 ESTHA
                        Thanks for kidnapping me.

                                 CALEB
                        I’m a surprisingly good kidnapper. 
                        I feel like I should be more 
                        alarmed about that.

                                 ESTHA
                            (laughing)
                        I am.
                            (beat)
                        I live so close to the beach but I 
                        never come.
                                 CALEB
                        Congratulations. That means you’re 
                        officially a true Floridian.

           Estha gives a cheap smile, but as he looks out at the water, 
           he starts to tear up. Then he starts to cry.

                                 CALEB (CONT’D)
                        Estha, I’m. You know I’m here for 
                        you. 
                            (beat)
                        Please don’t cry. I suck at that 
                        stuff. Ever since this one time in 
                        the fourth grade when Wei-

           Estha starts to sob and puts his head on Caleb’s shoulder. 
           Caleb stops talking and starts to awkwardly pat his back. 
           After a beat, he puts his arm around him.

                                 CALEB (CONT’D)
                        It’s going to be okay. It’s really 
                        going to be okay.

                                 ESTHA
                            (crying)
                        No. No it’s not. You know it’s not. 
                        You know everything could change 
                        tomorrow. I could live with this 
                        thing inside me. This violent awful 
                        thing that will make everyone in my 
                        life leave me. 

                                 CALEB
                            (beat)
                        I won’t leave you.

                                 ESTHA
                            (hysterical)
                        You say that now.

                                 CALEB
                        I won’t leave you.

           Estha looks up at him. Caleb kisses him. It’s different than 
           before. Caleb’s lost in it.

           INT. CALEB’S BEDROOM - AN HOUR LATER

           Caleb opens his bedroom window and climbs inside. He helps 
           Estha climb in afterward. They make for the bed, kissing like 
           crazy the whole way.

           Estha is still crying, but this only makes the kissing more 
           intense. Caleb rips off his shirt and then Estha’s. 
           Caleb looks at Estha, who is still a weeping mess. Caleb 
           smiles. They start making out again.

           Caleb takes off their pants. They roll around in their 
           underwear and bump loudly into the headboard. This time, 
           Caleb shushes.

                                 CALEB
                        Shh! Meryl’s asleep.

           Estha starts ferociously making out with him again. As Caleb 
           goes down to take off Estha’s underwear, Estha stops him.

                                 ESTHA
                        Caleb. This is bad.

                                 CALEB
                        This is fucking great. 

                                 ESTHA
                        I know but. I can’t. We can’t have 
                        sex.

           Caleb pulls back and thinks for a minute. Then, he smiles.

                                 CALEB
                        Who said anything about sex?

           Caleb finds his backpack on the floor and pulls out the half-
           eaten bag of popcorn. He returns to the bed, where Estha lays 
           on his back.

                                 ESTHA
                        What are you doing?

           Caleb smiles and spills the popcorn all over Estha’s chest. 
           Estha involuntarily tries to sit up, but Caleb pins him down.

                                 ESTHA (CONT’D)
                        What are you-

                                 CALEB
                        Relax.

           Caleb positions himself in a push up over Estha. He goes down 
           and eats a piece of popcorn off of Estha’s chest.

                                 CALEB (CONT’D)
                        Salty.

           He does it again. On the third round, he picks up a piece of 
           popcorn with his mouth and feeds it to Estha. It turns into a 
           deep kiss. He returns to Estha’s chest, picks up another 
           piece, and feeds it to Estha with his mouth.
           Caleb hovers over Estha, just looking at him.

                                 ESTHA
                        Again.

           They do it again and again and again, til both are so turned 
           on they want to rip each other the fuck apart. They lock 
           eyes, forget the food, and start hooking up hard.

           Caleb brings his body down on Estha’s, and there’s a loud 
           CRUNCH from the popcorn kernels still left on Estha’s chest. 
           Caleb laughs and Estha smiles.

                                 CALEB
                        That’ll be a bitch to clean 
                        tomorrow.

           Estha slowly slips his underwear off. Caleb does the same. 
           They continue to kiss and Caleb goes under the covers.

                                 ESTHA
                        No.

           Caleb pops his head back out and Estha shakes his head no.

           Instead, they make out while jacking each other off 
           underneath the sheets. Caleb stares at Estha while Estha 
           closes his eyes and moans. 

           INT. CALEB’S BEDROOM - A HALF HOUR LATER

           They lay in Caleb’s bed. Estha stares wide-eyed at the New 
           York skyline mural on Caleb’s wall. Caleb sees him staring.

                                 CALEB
                        I painted that myself when I was 
                        fifteen.

                                 ESTHA
                        You’ve wanted to go for a long 
                        time?

                                 CALEB
                        A very long time.

           They lay silently. A beat, then-

                                 CALEB (CONT’D)
                        Are your parents going to wonder 
                        where you are?

                                 ESTHA
                        I don’t care anymore.
                                 CALEB
                        Alright.
                            (beat)
                        I can go with you tomorrow if you 
                        want. I’m pretty good company. I 
                        can help you make origami hearts or 
                        self-medicate with marijuana.

                                 ESTHA
                        No. I think I’d rather go alone. 
                            (beat)
                        I don’t know what I’m going to do. 
                        If.

                                 CALEB
                        You’re going to take the medication 
                        and you’re going to be fine.

           Estha stares blankly at the wall.

                                 ESTHA
                        Caleb. I don’t think I’d make it. 
                        I’d rather die. I’d rather just not 
                        be here.  

           Caleb sits up and looks at him.

                                 CALEB
                        Don’t even say shit like that. 
                        That’s not something you joke 
                        about.

                                 ESTHA
                        Look who’s talking.

           Caleb grabs his face.

                                 CALEB
                        Promise me you won’t do something 
                        stupid.

           Estha stares back at him, unflinching.

                                 CALEB (CONT’D)
                            (beat)
                        Do you even know what death is?

                                 ESTHA
                        That’s a stupid question.

                                 CALEB
                        No, it’s not. Have you lost anyone?
                                 ESTHA
                            (beat)
                        No.

                                 CALEB
                        Then you have no idea what death 
                        is. It’s not some bullshit concept. 
                        It’s not the ultimate freedom from 
                        sadness or arranged marriages or 
                        fucking AIDS. 

           Estha is shocked. Neither have said that before: AIDS. The 
           smell of the word lingers in the air like rotten garlic.

                                 CALEB (CONT’D)
                        It’s the complete opposite of that. 
                        It’s the shittiest kind of finite. 

                                 ESTHA
                        That’s not what I believe.

                                 CALEB
                        You can believe whatever the fuck 
                        you want to believe. But when it 
                        comes down to it, death is no more 
                        Sunday barbecues, it’s no more 
                        boring Dolphin games, it’s no more 
                        bike rides or box ball or Marx 
                        Brother movie nights. It’s fucking 
                        nothing. That’s all it is. Nothing. 
                        Don’t do that to the people who 
                        love you. Don’t leave them with 
                        nothing. 

                                 ESTHA
                        The people that love me won’t love 
                        me anymore.

                                 CALEB
                        I’ll ask you not to speak for me, 
                        thanks.

           Estha looks at him with surprise. Caleb kisses him and lays 
           back down.

                                 CALEB (CONT’D)
                        Now let’s get some sleep.

                                 ESTHA
                        I can’t sleep.

                                 CALEB
                        Fine. Have it your way.
           Caleb attacks Estha and starts to make out with him. After a 
           beat of resisting, they go at it again.

           INT. CALEB’S BEDROOM - THE NEXT MORNING

           Caleb’s sleeping in bed, smiling. He rolls over and awakens 
           when he feels that Estha is gone.

           INT. MERYL’S KITCHEN - LATER

           Meryl is talking to Caleb while Benny makes them eggs.

                                 MERYL
                        So my research said that you have a 
                        pretty good chance of not catching 
                        it from a one-time exposure. 
                        Apparently it’s hard to get. We can 
                        look up some more stuff after I 
                        finish my last lecture.

           Caleb isn’t paying attention. He’s staring at a text he sent 
           to Estha thirty minutes earlier:

           CALEB: Good luck today. Let’s watch Hepburn find her pussy 
           later. Text me, fool. 

           Estha has not responded.

                                 MERYL (CONT’D)
                        Caleb?

           He looks up.

                                 CALEB
                        Yeah, sorry. What’s up?

           Benny brings over three plates of eggs.

                                 MERYL
                        I asked if you want to research 
                        stuff with me? We can break out the 
                        pot, learn a little bit, maybe 
                        watch a movie. Doesn’t that sound 
                        great, Benny?

                                 BENNY
                        You had me at pot.

                                 CALEB
                        I have work but maybe later. 
                        Thanks.

           Benny sits. They all eat their eggs in silence.
           INT. 7/11 - LATER THAT DAY

           Wei and Suzanne are talking quietly in the corner. Wei turns 
           from Suzanne but Suzanne puts a hand on her shoulder and 
           whispers in her ear. They walk into the back storage room. 
           Caleb’s behind the counter and couldn’t care less.

           He checks his phone. He sent another text to Estha an hour 
           ago.

           CALEB: How’d it go? You okay?

           He stares at his phone when a MAN that looks vaguely familiar 
           walks in the store. He looks around frantically and goes up 
           to the counter.

                                 MAN
                        Where’s Suzanne?

           Caleb has a flashback to a picture on Suzanne’s corkboard. 
           It’s her husband. He hears something fall in the storage 
           room, where Suzanne and Wei are.

                                 CALEB
                        She...left. She said something 
                        about a dog having worms? Or worms 
                        having a dog? It sounded disgusting 
                        and urgent.

                                 MAN
                            (beat)
                        Where is she?

                                 CALEB
                        Um. I told you, sir. She left. That 
                        means she is no longer here.

           Another sound from the back room. The man hears it this time 
           and makes his way to the door. Caleb shouts so Wei can 
           hopefully hear him.

                                 CALEB (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry, that’s for employees 
                        only SUZANNE’S HUSBAND MAKING HIS 
                        WAY TO THE DOOR WITH A SERIAL 
                        KILLER SPARK IN HIS EYE. YOU CAN’T 
                        GO BACK THERE.

           Caleb runs from behind the counter and tries to block the 
           door. The man pushes him out of the way hard. He busts 
           through the door.
                                 MAN (O.S.)
                        What the FUCK, Suzanne? What the 
                        fuck are you doing? 

                                 SUZANNE (O.S.)
                        Henry, stop. Calm down. I was just 
                        helping her-

                                 HENRY (O.S.)
                        Helping her what? Find your tits?

           All of a sudden Henry is dragging Wei by the sweatshirt into 
           the front room. Suzanne follows, pleading.

                                 SUZANNE
                        Let her go, Henry. 

           Henry lets her go. Wei backs into one of the refrigerators 
           and Henry has her cornered. He gets into her face and she can 
           smell the Makers on his breath.

                                 HENRY
                        Should I knock the dike out of you 
                        or her first, Suzanne? Huh? Who?

           Caleb looks at Suzanne.

                                 CALEB
                        Are you going to fucking do 
                        something?

           Suzanne has her hands over her mouth and is frozen with fear.

                                 HENRY
                        You like touching my wife?

           His nose is an inch away from hers. Caleb runs up to Wei and 
           pulls her behind him. 

                                 CALEB
                        Back off. 

                                 HENRY
                        Fuck you.

           He tries to get to Wei but Caleb continues to block his way.

                                 CALEB
                        I said back off.

           Henry pushes Caleb and knocks him into a rack of peanut bags. 
           It falls to the ground. Henry’s up in Wei’s face again.
                                 SUZANNE
                        I’m calling the cops, Henry! Get 
                        out of here. Leave them alone.

           Henry looks back and forth between Wei and Suzanne. He 
           screams loudly. He heads toward the door. Before he leaves he 
           turns to Suzanne.

                                 HENRY
                            (to Suzanne)
                        We’re done! Enjoy your fat bitch.

           He walks out of the store and Suzanne runs after him. Caleb 
           lifts Wei off of the floor.

                                 CALEB
                        Are you okay?

                                 WEI
                        She left! I can’t believe she 
                        fucking left. She just promised me 
                        she wouldn’t leave.

                                 CALEB
                            (taken aback)
                        I’m sorry. Did you not just see 
                        what happened? Her crazy husband 
                        almost tried to KILL YOU! 

                                 WEI
                        I gotta go after her.

           Wei goes to leave but Caleb grabs her.

                                 CALEB
                        Are you serious, Wei? 

                                 WEI
                        Oh, so now you give a shit about 
                        what’s happening in my life? 
                        Because it’s suddenly dramatic and 
                        interesting enough for you? 

                                 CALEB
                        What the fuck has gotten into you?

                                 WEI
                        Me? What’s gotten into me? Caleb, 
                        what the fuck has gotten into you? 
                        Banging weird dudes and ditching me 
                        for that Indian shit and doing 
                        everything you can to fuck yourself 
                        over?!
                                 CALEB
                        Screw you, Wei. You’re the one 
                        going after an old lady whose 
                        husband wanted to OJ Simpson you!

                                 WEI
                        Yeah. Well at least I don’t have 
                        fucking AIDS.

           Caleb freezes. Wei can’t believe she just said that. She 
           pauses for a beat, as if she’s going to say sorry. But 
           instead of apologizing, she turns and runs out of the store.

           Caleb is left alone among the wreckage. He touches his lip: 
           it’s bleeding. But he doesn’t wipe it off this time. Instead, 
           he simply stares at it.

           EXT. ESTHA’S HOUSE - LATER

           Caleb sneaks around to Estha’s window. The blinds are closed 
           and the lights are off. He puts his ear to the glass, but 
           there’s only silence on the other side.

           He knocks gently and waits. No response. He lingers for a 
           second before knocking again. Nothing. He leaves.

           INT. CALEB’S BEDROOM - TWO WEEKS LATER

           Caleb looks like hell. He stares at his phone on the dresser 
           before dialing. A few beats while it rings and then-

                                 CALEB
                        Hey, Estha. It’s me. Taylor Swift. 
                        Just calling you for the five 
                        millionth time to let you know I’ve 
                        written a song about you called, 
                        “Pick Up The Phone, Bitch.” Anyway. 
                        It’s been like two weeks and I just 
                        want to make sure that you’re-

                                 VOICEMAIL
                        Sorry. The person you’ve called has 
                        run out of inbox space. Please try 
                        again later.

           Caleb screams and knocks off all the papers on his desk. 

           He sees his art grant forms fall to the floor. He angrily 
           throws them in the garbage.
           EXT. ESTHA’S HOUSE - EARLY EVENING

           Caleb rides slowly past Estha’s house on the street. It’s 
           just getting dark. As he approaches the house, he sees that 
           Estha’s blinds are closed. 

           Caleb almost stops to get a closer look when he sees Estha’s 
           FATHER sitting in a chair on the driveway. He’s an 
           intimidating man who just stares out onto the street. He 
           locks eyes with Caleb and Caleb rides away.  

           INT. MERYL’S LIVING ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Caleb, Meryl, and Benny sit on the couch while a Marx 
           Brothers movie plays on the television.

           None are actually watching the film: Caleb browses through 
           tens of unanswered texts to Estha, Meryl stares sadly at her 
           grandson, and Benny does the crossword. A beat and then-

                                 CALEB
                        Hey, can you pass the paper?

           Benny hands over the paper, barring the crossword. Meryl 
           pretends not to notice Caleb hold his breath while he scans 
           through the obituaries. Estha’s name is absent.

                                 CALEB (CONT’D)
                        I gotta run out for a bit.

                                 MERYL
                        No, Cay. Please. Just stay with us 
                        tonight. You’re always running off 
                        to go to 7/11 for cigarettes and 
                        paychecks and-
                            (beat)
                        -you should be here with your 
                        family. Maybe we can even help you 
                        put that grant stuff together? I 
                        saw that the deadline was coming up 
                        and it’d be a shame to let it slip 
                        by.

                                 CALEB
                        I’m not applying anymore.

                                 MERYL
                        What? Why not?

                                 CALEB
                        Because I don’t fucking want to. 
                        Because my photos are shit. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 CALEB (CONT'D)
                        Because they shouldn’t have 
                        accepted me in the first place and 
                        they’re sure as fuck not going to 
                        give me any money. 

                                 MERYL
                        What has gotten into you? Of course 
                        they should’ve accepted you. You’re 
                        talented. You can’t let what’s 
                        happening control you like this, 
                        Caleb.

           Caleb stands up and walks toward the door.

                                 MERYL (CONT’D)
                        Caleb, do you hear me?

                                 CALEB
                        I have to go.

           Caleb walks out. Meryl barely holds it together. Benny scoots 
           closer to her and the two of them stare at the television.

           INT. CHRIST THE ROCK BASEMENT - LATER

           There is one chair vacant beside Caleb in the usual circle. 

                                 JIM
                        ...and that’s why I’ve decided to 
                        start my own web site called “From 
                        Him to Jim: A Cabaret Artist’s 
                        Interweb Memoir.” If anyone knows a 
                        good web designer-
                            (beat)
                        -or photographer. I’d pay a hefty 
                        sum to ensure a job well done. 
                        Maybe someone could even put it 
                        toward a certain college fund.

           Caleb stares into space.

                                 JIM (CONT’D)
                        I’m looking at you, Caleb.

                                 CALEB
                        What? 
                            (his brain catches up)
                        Oh. Yeah, sure. 

                                 JIM
                        Great.
                                 DOCTOR REID
                        Well thanks, Jim.
                            (to Caleb)
                        And is there anything you’d like to 
                        share this week?

                                 CALEB
                        No, I’m good.

                                 DOCTOR REID
                        Are you sure? Anything at all-

                                 CALEB
                        I said, I’m good.

           Doctor Reid looks at him with concern.

           INT. CHRIST THE ROCK BASEMENT - POST MEETING

           Caleb rushes up to Doctor Reid by the coffee table.

                                 CALEB
                        Where is he?

                                 DOCTOR REID
                        Where is who?

                                 CALEB
                        Tupac. 
                            (beat)
                        Estha. Where is Estha?

                                 DOCTOR REID
                        I’m not sure. 
                            (beat)
                        Is everything okay?

                                 CALEB
                        No. It’s not. I haven’t heard from 
                        him since he went for his results. 
                        I’ve texted, I’ve called-I even 
                        checked the fucking obituaries for 
                        ‘Estha Indian-last-name-I-can’t-
                        pronounce.’ It’s like he 
                        disappeared. 

                                 DOCTOR REID
                        You know I can’t reveal a patient’s 
                        medical information.

           Caleb looks like he’s going to sob or punt something 
           breakable. Doctor Reid throws him a bone.
                                 DOCTOR REID (CONT’D)
                        But I can tell you he hasn’t come 
                        to a meeting this week. 
                            (beat)
                        It’s going to be okay, Caleb. Maybe 
                        this is a good time to focus on you 
                        and your stuff right now.

           Caleb explodes.

                                 CALEB
                        Focus on me? You’re the one who 
                        wanted me to get close with someone 
                        who understands what I’m going 
                        through. And now that someone has 
                        Harry Houdini-ed into a fucking 
                        black hole.

                                 DOCTOR REID
                        Just calm down. I’m sure he’s 
                        taking his time to process what’s 
                        going on.

           Caleb can’t listen. He walks toward the exit.

                                 DOCTOR REID (CONT’D)
                        Caleb!

           Caleb leaves. 

                                 DOCTOR REID (CONT’D)
                        Shit.

           EXT. ESTHA’S HOUSE - ONE WEEK LATER

           Time card: DAY 60

           Caleb stands behind the hiding tree. It’s clear that he 
           hasn’t slept in weeks. He stares at Estha’s house the way a 
           little kid looks at an ice cream truck driving away.

           Suddenly, the light in Estha’s room turns on. A decent-
           looking Estha appears in the window and shuts the blinds.

           Caleb almost falls over. He leans on the tree to catch his 
           breath and smiles. He sprints toward Estha’s window.

           EXT. ESTHA’S BEDROOM WINDOW - CONTINUOUS

           Caleb sneaks up beneath the window and taps on it. A few 
           beats later and no response. Caleb taps again. Still, no 
           Estha. He starts to knock more loudly and eventually starts 
           banging the window.
                                 ESTHA (O.S.)
                            (scream whispered)
                        You need to leave!

                                 CALEB
                        It’s good to see you too, you fuck. 
                        And there’s no way I’m leaving.

                                 ESTHA (O.S.)
                        I can’t talk now.

                                 CALEB
                        That’s not my problem. Open the 
                        window.

           Estha is silent. A beat and then-

                                 CALEB (CONT’D)
                        Open the window or I’ll scream my 
                        fucking face off.

           Another beat passes and Estha slowly opens his window. Caleb 
           grabs the window and pushes it up quickly, jumping inside 
           Estha’s room. Estha shows no emotion.

           INT. ESTHA’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The room is neat and orderly. A Taylor Swift poster hangs on 
           the wall, as does a banner reading CAL TECH UNIVERSITY. There 
           are lots of books around the room.

           Caleb runs over to Estha and hugs him hard. Estha does not 
           return the hug.

                                 CALEB
                        Holy shit. You’re okay.

           Caleb hits him. Estha doesn’t move.

                                 CALEB (CONT’D)
                        What the hell is going on? Why 
                        didn’t you return any of my calls?! 
                        I told you no matter what happened 
                        I’d be there. Negative, positive-I 
                        don’t give a shit. 

                                 ESTHA
                        I need you to leave. 

                                 CALEB
                        What? No. I’ll be quiet. Your 
                        parents won’t even know I’m here. 
                        Scout’s honor.
                                 ESTHA
                        Caleb.

                                 CALEB
                        Estha. I told you. I don’t care if 
                        you’re positive. Whatever it is 
                        we’ll find a way to-

                                 ESTHA
                        I’m not positive.

           Caleb takes a step back and stares at him. Estha won’t look 
           him in the eye.

                                 CALEB
                        You’re not positive?

                                 ESTHA
                        No.

           A beat and then Caleb starts laughing and dancing.

                                 CALEB
                        That’s incredible! Oh my God! We 
                        need to celebrate. Let’s go to the 
                        beach or karaoke our brains out or- 

                                 ESTHA
                            (cutting him off)
                        Caleb. You can’t be here.

           Caleb looks at Estha strangely. He can’t figure him out.

                                 CALEB
                        Estha. What’s going on? 

                                 ESTHA
                        You were a great friend to me this 
                        summer.

                                 CALEB
                        Wait. I’m sorry. Friend? 

                                 ESTHA
                        But I need to focus on the fall 
                        now. And Cal Tech.

           Caleb starts shaking his head ‘no.’

                                 ESTHA (CONT’D)
                        I need to get out of this town and 
                        this place and I need to put this-
                            (beat)
                        -thing behind me.
                                 CALEB
                        This “thing?”

                                 ESTHA
                        I’m sorry.

           Caleb can’t catch his breath.

                                 CALEB
                        So you weren’t trying to kill 
                        yourself. You were just...ignoring 
                        me? 
                            (beat)
                        Why is that so much worse.

           A light bulb goes off in Caleb’s head and he feels like he’s 
           going to be sick.

                                 CALEB (CONT’D)
                        It’s because you’re fine now, isn’t 
                        it? 

           Estha looks away.

                                 CALEB (CONT’D)
                        And I might not be fine.

                                 ESTHA
                        Caleb, you need to go.

           Caleb has a panic attack. He sees a half-eaten bag of kettle 
           corn rolled and sealed off with a clip next to the bed.

                                 CALEB
                            (to himself)
                        I was your popcorn.

                                 ESTHA
                        What?

                                 CALEB
                            (grows to a yell)
                        That’s all I was? A fucking 
                        distraction for you? A way to help 
                        you pass the fucking time until you 
                        go to your perfect college with 
                        your perfect new friends and your 
                        perfect fucking future?!

           Caleb grabs the bag of popcorn and rips it open. He starts 
           throwing it at Estha and around the room like a maniac.
                                 ESTHA
                            (scream whispered)
                        I’m sorry, Caleb, but you’re crazy! 
                        You’ve always been crazy. And I 
                        can’t stay in the summer anymore. I 
                        just can’t. Now stop yelling!

                                 CALEB
                        Well I’m so sorry I tainted your 
                        perfect FUCKING life with my unholy 
                        blood, you dick!

           Estha’s parents start to knock loudly on the door.

                                 ESTHA’S FATHER
                        Esthappen, what’s going on in 
                        there?!

                                 ESTHA
                        Just watching a movie, pita!
                            (mouthed to Caleb)
                        Go!

           Caleb glares at him.

                                 CALEB
                        I wish you had killed yourself.

           Caleb kicks Estha’s dresser and makes for the window.

                                 CALEB (CONT’D)
                            (screaming)
                        AND TAYLOR SWIFT FUCKING SUCKS!

           He climbs out.

           EXT. MIAMI STREET - CONTINUOUS

           Caleb’s holding back tears as he rides with intense speed 
           down the street. He hyperventilates and can barely see 
           straight. His panic attack escalates as he gets the spins.

           INT. DIVE BAR - FLASHBACK

           Caleb sits alone and checks his phone: he has sent countless 
           texts to Dom, but Dom has not responded. 

           The figure sits next to him and orders a drink. Caleb looks 
           back and forth between his phone and the figure, then-

                                 CALEB
                        Hey.

           The figure turns to him. He nods his head.
                                 FIGURE
                        Hola.

           Caleb looks back down at his phone. Still nothing from Dom. 
           After a beat, he looks back at the figure.

                                 CALEB
                        What are you drinking? 

           The figure is confused. Caleb makes a ‘drinking’ hand motion.

                                 CALEB (CONT’D)
                        Tu bebida.

                                 FIGURE
                        Ah. Tequila.

           Caleb scoots closer and puts his phone away.

                                 CALEB
                        Tequila! Me gusta tequila.

           The figure laughs and downs his drink before motioning for 
           the bartender.

                                 FIGURE
                        Tequila, por favor.

           The figure smiles at Caleb.

                                 FIGURE (CONT’D)
                         Dos.

           Caleb smiles back. The bartender returns with two tequilas.

                                 FIGURE (CONT’D)
                        Para ti, guapo.

           The figure slides one to Caleb. They cheers.

                                 CALEB
                        Hola. 

           EXT. DIVE BAR/STREET - FLASHBACK

           Caleb and the figure walk out of the bar. They make out. 

           As they head to the figure’s car, Caleb checks that his bike 
           is firmly locked to a nearby NO PARKING sign. After, he gets 
           in the car and they ride. The car pulls out and we follow it 
           for a few frames as it makes its way down the street.
           EXT. STREET/DIVE BAR - PRESENT

           On that same street, present Caleb rides toward the bar. He 
           returns to that very parking sign and falls off his bike. He 
           picks himself back up, locks the tandem to the NO PARKING 
           sign, and trudges into the bar.

           INT. DIVE BAR - CONTINUOUS

           Caleb enters. It’s empty except for a few stragglers. He 
           spots an OLDER MAN drinking alone at the bar.

           Caleb takes the stool next to him. He shakily grabs a napkin 
           and starts anxiously folding it into origami. The older man 
           looks at him and smiles. 

                                 CALEB
                            (voice cracking)
                        He-y, wh-at are..

           Caleb takes a deep breath and clears his throat.

                                 CALEB (CONT’D)
                        What are you drinking?

           The man looks surprised that Caleb is talking to him.

                                 OLDER MAN
                        Uh. It’s a Manhattan.

           Caleb’s stomach sinks. He continues to fold.

                                 CALEB
                        Never had one of those before.

           The older man taps on the bar.

                                 OLDER MAN
                        Hey, Joel. Another Manhattan over 
                        here.

           The bartender passes down a drink. Caleb tastes it. It’s 
           awful.

                                 OLDER MAN (CONT’D)
                        You look too young to be here.

           Caleb continues to drink the awful drink.

                                 CALEB
                        Yeah. I probably am.

           Caleb downs the entire thing. The older man smiles.
                                 OLDER MAN
                        There he goes. Like a champ.

           A beat.

                                 OLDER MAN (CONT’D)
                        You have a boyfriend?

           Caleb shakes his head no.

                                 OLDER MAN (CONT’D)
                        A good looking kid like you should 
                        have a boyfriend.
                            (beat)
                        I live around here, you know.

           The older man puts his hand on Caleb’s shoulder. After a beat 
           of Caleb not moving, he slides it down his back. Caleb 
           doesn’t even move.

                                 OLDER MAN (CONT’D)
                        You into role play? PNP? I’ve got 
                        good stuff. 

           Caleb’s hands are shaking.

                                 CALEB
                        I’m into good stuff.

           The man takes out a pen and grabs a napkin. He writes down an 
           address.

                                 OLDER MAN
                        This is my address. Maybe I could 
                        order a pizza and take a liking to 
                        the delivery boy. You know any good 
                        delivery boys?

                                 CALEB
                        Yeah.

           The older man smiles.

                                 OLDER MAN
                        That’s good. Maybe I’ll head out 
                        and maybe the delivery boy could 
                        come to my house in...twenty 
                        minutes?

           He leaves money on the bar for the drinks and hands some more 
           to Caleb.

                                 OLDER MAN (CONT’D)
                        Have another drink on me. 
           He gets up and starts to leave.

                                 OLDER MAN (CONT’D)
                        I’ll see you soon. Knock twice.

           He leaves. Caleb orders another drink. He shakes so much 
           that, when it arrives, he can barely sip it.

           EXT. DOOR - LATER

           CLOSE UP of Caleb’s hand knocking twice on a door. As it 
           opens, we see a CLOSE UP of Caleb’s face. He smiles weakly.

                                 CALEB
                        Hi.

           CUT TO to Honda Odyssey woman (Caleb’s mother EDITH) standing 
           in the doorway. She has Caleb’s hair and eyes (except Caleb’s 
           hair is knotted and his eyes are red.) 

           She is terrified to see him.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The modest living room has blatantly Jewish decor: shabbos 
           candles on the table, a framed map of Israel on the wall, and 
           pictures of Edith’s new family on the mantel.

           Caleb’s on a cushion chair opposite his mother, who stares at 
           him from the couch. They’re silent for a beat, then:

                                 CALEB
                        So how’ve you been?

                                 EDITH
                        Good. Fine.
                            (beat)
                        How’s your grandmother?

                                 CALEB
                        Alive. 
                            (beat)
                        You could call her.

           Edith crosses her legs.

                                 EDITH
                        I’ve been busy with Beth Ahm’s 
                        sisterhood. And Zev.

           Her eyes dart around. They look for a reason to leave.

                                 EDITH (CONT’D)
                        Can I get you something to drink? 
                                 CALEB
                        Okay.

           She goes into the kitchen. While she’s gone, Caleb takes deep 
           breaths. He studies this foreign place.

                                 EDITH (O.S.)
                        What do you want?

                                 CALEB
                        Whatever’s good.

           She comes back out and hands Caleb a Minute Maid juice box.

                                 CALEB (CONT’D)
                            (beat)
                        Nice mailbox.

           Her face is hard, but she shows signs of breaking a smile.

                                 EDITH
                        I didn’t pick the color.

                                 CALEB
                        Thank God.

           She stares at him.

                                 CALEB (CONT’D)
                        I mean.
                            (beat)
                        That’s a relief.
                            (beat)
                        Where’s Aaron?

                                 EDITH
                        He’s working late.

                                 CALEB
                        Rabbis work late? 

                                 EDITH
                        He’s paying a shiva call.

           Caleb sips on the juice box. He eyes a rattle on the floor.

                                 EDITH (CONT’D)
                        You look terrible.

                                 CALEB
                        Disheveled is really in right now.
                                 EDITH
                        You shouldn’t-
                            (beat)
                        -you’re not supposed to be here. Do 
                        you need a ride back ho-

           Home. She stops herself at the sound of the word.

                                 EDITH (CONT’D)
                        -to your grandmother’s?

           Caleb doesn’t answer. Instead, he looks around the room.

                                 CALEB
                            (beat)
                        The house is different.

           She goes to say something, but stops herself.

                                 EDITH
                        I’ve done some redecorating.

                                 CALEB
                        Oh. Cool.

           Edith fidgets with her dress. Caleb sips the last remnants of 
           juice loudly. Another awkward beat and then-

                                 CALEB (CONT’D)
                        So where’d you put them?

           She looks confused.

                                 EDITH
                        Where’d I put what?

           INT. ATTIC - CONTINUOUS

           Edith leads Caleb into the attic and pulls the string of a 
           light bulb. 

                                 EDITH
                        Be quiet.

           The room is filled with boxes. Edith motions to one in 
           particular. Caleb opens it up. 

           There are hundreds of colored origami figures stuffed inside.  
           Wedged between two pieces of origami is a picture of Caleb’s 
           dad: the man from the New York photograph in Caleb’s room. 
           This is a clearer image of him. He’s got a nice smile and 
           Caleb’s build. 
                                 CALEB
                        Swans don’t go with shabbos 
                        candles? 

                                 EDITH
                        They’re not appropriate.

           Caleb takes one out and studies it. It’s made perfectly and 
           carries a high level of paper-folding craft, despite being 
           violently stuffed in an attic box. 

                                 CALEB
                        I don’t think I’ll ever be as good 
                        at this as he was.

                                 EDITH
                        Consider it a blessing. There’s not 
                        much use for paper folding.

           Caleb scoffs. Then he stiffens with fear. But she says 
           nothing.

                                 CALEB
                        Can I have them?

           She hesitates.

                                 EDITH
                        Yes. I’ll mail them to you. Now 
                        it’s time to go.

           He sits on the floor and puts the box on his lap. He takes 
           out another swan and studies it.

                                 CALEB
                            (beat)
                        I ride his bike too.

                                 EDITH
                        I saw.
                            (beat)
                        I thought he left that to Meryl.

                                 CALEB
                        He did.

           Caleb puts the swans back in the box and drops the box on the 
           floor with a thud. Edith glares at him and, a beat later, a 
           baby starts crying.

                                 EDITH
                        I told you to be quiet!

           She leaves the attic quickly. Caleb follows her.
           EXT. ZEV’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Caleb stands outside his half-brother’s room while Edith coos 
           and cradles the baby inside. Everything is blue and there’s a 
           great big rocking chair in the corner.

                                 EDITH
                        Shhh...Zev. Shh. 
                            (singing)
                        Numi, numi yaldati, Numi, numi, 
                        nim.

           Caleb sees his brother’s face for the first time and can’t 
           help but smile.

                                 CALEB
                            (beat)
                        Can I hold him?

           Edith looks up at Caleb in the doorway. She’s stern.

                                 EDITH
                        No.
                            (beat)
                        You shouldn’t even be here.

                                 CALEB
                        So I’ve heard.

           Edith turns from him while bouncing the baby in her arms. Zev 
           faces Caleb now. They, too, have the same eyes.

                                 CALEB (CONT’D)
                        Please. Just for a second. I’ll be 
                        careful, I promise.

           She looks at Zev and back to Caleb. 

                                 CALEB (CONT’D)
                        Please?

                                 EDITH
                        I can drive you back. Aaron will be 
                        home soon. 

                                 CALEB
                        I swear I’ll leave if you let me 
                        hold him.

           A beat.

                                 EDITH
                        Do you even know how?
                                 CALEB
                        Remember Aunt Shelby’s 50th 
                        birthday? I held Jacob all 
                        afternoon. 

                                 EDITH
                        Didn’t he spit up in your face?

                                 CALEB
                        But my cradling technique was a 
                        ten.

           Edith hesitates. She takes a deep breath and hands Zev to 
           Caleb. Caleb can’t believe this is happening. As soon as he 
           feels his brother in his hands, something in him changes. 

           He looks into Zev’s eyes and Zev smiles. 

                                 EDITH
                        He-
                            (beat)
                        -I think he likes you. He doesn’t 
                        smile often. Or ever, actually.

                                 CALEB
                        Hey, little guy. Your fingers look 
                        like baby shrimp. That’s definitely 
                        not kosher.

           Edith stifles a laugh. Caleb looks up at her, back to Zev, 
           and then back to his mother.

                                 CALEB (CONT’D)
                        Mom. I’m not doing too good.

                                 EDITH
                        No you’re actually doing fine. Just 
                        make sure you hold his head.

                                 CALEB
                        No, mom. I. 
                            (beat)
                        I’m not doing good.

           Caleb starts to tear up.

                                 EDITH
                            (beat)
                        Is it the college thing? I asked 
                        Aaron if we could find the money 
                        but-
                                 CALEB
                        No. That’s not it. I-
                            (beat)
                        I might be really sick.

                                 EDITH
                        What do you mean? Are you okay?

           And, for the first time, Caleb starts to cry.

                                 CALEB
                            (his crying intensifies)
                        I. I don’t think so, mom. I don’t 
                        think so.

           Edith puts her hands on his shoulders.

                                 EDITH
                        What is it? What’s wrong?

                                 CALEB
                        I was dumped and I worked so hard 
                        to get into school. So hard, mom. 
                        You know how hard. And now I can’t-

                                 EDITH
                        I know.

                                 CALEB
                        And then I was stupid. I was really 
                        sad and he was a complete stranger. 
                        And I liked that. I liked that he 
                        didn’t know me. I was just so drunk 
                        and the condom must have been old 
                        or something. But I didn’t know. I 
                        swear I didn’t know until it was 
                        over. 

           Edith’s eyes light up with fear. She rips Zev from Caleb.

                                 CALEB (CONT’D)
                        I might. I might be really sick, 
                        mom. 

           Caleb’s crying turns into weeping and this makes Zev bawl. 
           The baby screams and screams without end.

                                 EDITH
                        You are sick.

           Edith puts Zev back in the crib.

                                 CALEB
                        I know. I’m sorry. I know.
           He goes to hug her and she backs away.

                                 EDITH
                        No. YOU are sick, Caleb. You’re not 
                        well. You’ve never been well.

           She starts to push him out of the room.

                                 CALEB
                        No. But. Mom. Wait please. Please 
                        don’t leave me. Please please 
                        please don’t leave me.

                                 EDITH
                        You’re not supposed to come back 
                        here. You’re not welcome here. 

           She forces Caleb out of the room.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Zev is still screaming upstairs and Caleb is crying.

                                 CALEB
                        No! Let go! Please just listen. 
                        Just let me stay!

           Edith opens the front door and forces Caleb out. She can’t 
           look at him.

                                 EDITH
                        Please don’t come back.

           She slams the door.

           EXT. EDITH’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Caleb stands shaking. Zev wails inside his room. Caleb leans 
           against the house. 

           We stay on him for a beat while he weeps. Beneath him is a 
           welcome mat that says, SHALOM.

           INT. MERYL’S KITCHEN - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Caleb walks in still bawling. He hyperventilates and gets the 
           spins, but this time, there are no more flashbacks.

           A beat or so later, Meryl runs out of her room in pajamas. 
           Benny follows her.

                                 MERYL
                        Holy shit. Caleb. What’s wrong?
           Caleb says nothing and instead collapses in her arms. He 
           can’t get out words in between the sobs.

                                 MERYL (CONT’D)
                        Oh, Cay. It’s alright. It’s going 
                        to be okay.

                                 BENNY
                        Come on, kid.

           INT. CALEB’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Each of Caleb’s arms is wrapped around Benny and Meryl’s 
           shoulders. They walk slowly to Caleb’s bed, where he 
           collapses. Benny and Meryl sit next to him. Meryl strokes his 
           hair. He cries throughout the following conversation.

                                 MERYL
                        What happened?

                                 CALEB
                        Everyone leaves me.

                                 MERYL
                        That is not true. 

                                 CALEB
                        Yes it is! Dom, Estha, dad, her. 
                        They all leave. No one lets me 
                        stay.

                                 MERYL
                        I don’t know what an Estha is, but 
                        your dad didn’t want to leave you, 
                        Caleb. 

                                 CALEB
                        That’s only because he didn’t know 
                        this me.  The reckless one who 
                        can’t sleep. The one with the 
                        fucked up blood.

                                 BENNY
                        Caleb, that is not who you are.

                                 CALEB
                        It is! And now all that’s left is a 
                        life of ‘if’ and ‘you fucking 
                        idiot’ and ‘you did this to 
                        yourself. You got what you deserve 
                        for being who you are, so desperate 
                        for someone to give a fuck about 
                        you.’ 
                                 MERYL
                        Caleb, honey. You might feel this 
                        way right now, but under all this 
                        shit, there’s a man who will grow 
                        up to do great things. Positive or 
                        negative, there is a happy life 
                        ahead of you.

           Caleb is hysterical.

                                 CALEB
                        No! My out was Parsons. But now 
                        everything is so fucking fucked.

                                 MERYL
                        I need you to hear me now, Caleb. 
                        You’re my grandson. You’re what I 
                        love most in this fucked up 
                        universe. And for those reasons 
                        alone, you will create great things 
                        and you will find great love. And 
                        you will get out of here. We will 
                        find a way to get you out of here.

                                 CALEB
                        When? Fucking when? I’m so tired of 
                        waiting.  

                                 MERYL
                        That’s just what being alive is. 
                        It’s waiting. But it will come, 
                        Caleb. You’re too good for it not 
                        to.

           Caleb’s exhausted from the weeping and starts to whimper. She 
           bends down and strokes his cheek. As the whimpers get softer, 
           she starts to detangle his hair.

                                 MERYL (CONT’D)
                        But waiting doesn’t mean shutting 
                        down. Waiting doesn’t mean you turn 
                        yourself into the kind of person 
                        who lets the world decide who you 
                        are and what you can do. You fight 
                        for what you want. You fight for 
                        what you deserve. You wait, but you 
                        wait with your fucking fists in the 
                        air.

           She looks at Caleb. He’s finally stopped crying completely. 
           He wraps his body around her in the fetal position. Meryl 
           looks at Benny and nods. 
           They lay down on either side of him and hold him as he falls 
           asleep.

           INT. CALEB’S BEDROOM - EARLY, THE NEXT MORNING

           Caleb wakes up as the sun barely starts to make his curtains 
           glow orange. He looks to either side of him, where Meryl and 
           Benny are passed out. Benny snores like a train.

           EXT. CALEB’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Caleb rolls his bike out from the side of Meryl’s house. He 
           hops on and rides.

           EXT. LIFE GUARD STAND - LATER

           Caleb sits on the life guard stand and looks out at the 
           beach. No one’s around and it’s peaceful. He sits for a beat 
           before taking a knife out of his backpack. 

           He goes to the wooden banisters where the engravings are. He 
           puts his knife to ‘the Young. And the Sexless?’. He starts to 
           scratch it off but stops. 

           He looks at KAHNED BY THE KAHNS 12/2002. He contemplates 
           something when he receives a text message from Meryl. It 
           reads:

           MERYL- Where are you? Are you alright? Please come home.

           EXT. LIFE GUARD STAND - LATER

           Caleb walks his bike back to the boardwalk. As he heads out 
           of frame, we CLOSE UP on the wooden banister. 

           Caleb didn’t finish scratching off the engraving he made with 
           Estha. Instead, the knife he used to mark the original 
           message lays alone, on the floor of the lifeguard stand.

           INT. MERYL’S KITCHEN - LATER THAT DAY

           Benny, Meryl, and Caleb eat sandwiches. 

                                 BENNY
                        You like the tuna?

                                 CALEB
                        It’s good. Really good. Thanks.

                                 MERYL
                            (beat)
                        How are you feeling?
                                 CALEB
                        Shitty. But in an almost manageable 
                        way.

                                 MERYL
                        I’ll take it.

           They all bite their sandwiches. Then-

                                 BENNY
                            (beat)
                        Someone dropped off a box this 
                        morning.

           Caleb looks up at him.

                                 BENNY (CONT’D)
                        It’s in your room.

                                 CALEB
                        Cool.

           Benny and Meryl look at one another.

                                 BENNY
                        And, Caleb. We were also wondering 
                        if you’d let us come to one of 
                        those meetings? 

                                 MERYL
                        If that’s okay.

                                 CALEB
                            (beat)
                        Yeah. It’s fine.

           Benny and Meryl nod. They keep eating. A beat later:

                                 CALEB (CONT’D)
                        I’d actually really like that.

           Caleb gets up from the table and kisses his grandmother on 
           the head. She looks at Benny and smiles with surprise.

           INT. CALEB’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Caleb sits down on his bed next to the familiar box. He opens 
           it up and starts to take out his father’s origami. He studies 
           each one before laying it out on his bed.

           Next to the box he sees a manila folder with a note on it. It 
           reads: Great things. Love, Grandma.
           Caleb takes out the papers from inside the folder: they’re 
           the crumpled art grant forms he threw away. 

           CLOSE UP on “...your grant application should be supplemented 
           with a creative portfolio that explores a theme that is 
           important to you.” He thinks.

           INT. CALEB’S BEDROOM - LATER

           Caleb has hung the origami around his room with string. 

           He takes his Nikon and photographs the different pieces from 
           various angles. He’s moving around the room quickly and with 
           purpose: he’s inspired.

           INT. CHRIST THE ROCK BASEMENT - A WEEK LATER

           The Young and the Sexless sit in a circle. Estha is still 
           gone but, instead, Meryl and Benny sit next to Caleb. Old 
           Larry stares at Caleb intently as he talks. 

                                 CALEB
                        I. I’m not sure how I’m feeling. 
                        And I think that’s okay. At this 
                        point, I’m just ready to know. And 
                        move on. 
                            (beat)
                        I’m definitely scared, though. Like 
                        crap in my pants scared.

           Doctor Reid nods. Meryl holds his hand.

                                 DOCTOR REID
                        That’s normal, Caleb. Totally and 
                        completely normal. You’ve come a 
                        long way.

           The group looks to Jim, who is next to share.

                                 JIM
                        Well, this week, thanks to Caleb’s 
                        fabulous photography skills, I’m 
                        launching-

                                 OLD LARRY
                        YOU’RE LUCKY, GUY.

           Old Larry speaks loudly and seriously. The group watches in 
           awe. 

                                 OLD LARRY (CONT’D)
                        WHEN THIS STARTED, HARDLY ANYONE 
                        MADE IT. PEOPLE WOULDN’T TOUCH YOU. 
                        THEY WOULDN’T LOOK AT YOU. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 OLD LARRY (CONT’D)
                        YOU WERE ALREADY DEAD. NOW, YOU’RE 
                        NOT GOING TO DIE. AND YOU SHOULD BE 
                        DAMN HAPPY THAT YOU’RE NOT GOING TO 
                        DIE.

           Caleb nods.

                                 CALEB
                        Thanks, Old Larry.

           A beat.

                                 OLD LARRY
                        DID YOU JUST CALL ME OLD?

                                 CALEB
                            (beat)
                        No.

                                 OLD LARRY
                        OH. GOOD.

           Everyone stifles a laugh.

           TIME CARD: DAY 89

           INT. CALEB’S BEDROOM - MORNING

           Caleb puts together his grant portfolio when there’s a knock 
           at the door.

                                 CALEB
                        Come in.

           It’s Meryl.

                                 MERYL
                        You have a visitor.

           She pushes open the door, revealing Wei, holding a DVD and 
           looking very apologetic.

                                 MERYL (CONT’D)
                        I’ll give you two a moment.

           Meryl leaves. Wei motions to the bed.

                                 WEI
                        Can I-

                                 CALEB
                        Yeah.

           She approaches the bed. She hands him the DVD.
                                 WEI
                        I got you this.

           It’s ‘The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders 
           from Mars’ on DVD.

                                 CALEB
                        This is the collector’s edition! 
                        How much did you pay for it? You 
                        didn’t have to do that.

                                 WEI
                        I didn’t. I stole it.

                                 CALEB
                        Right.

                                                        CALEB
           An awkward beat-
                           WEI
           Caleb, I’m sorry.
                                            Look, I’m sorry.

           They laugh. 

                                 WEI
                        Listen, I didn’t mean to say that 
                        stuff, man. I don’t think you fuck 
                        weird dudes. 
                            (beat)
                        Well, you have fucked some pretty 
                        weird dudes. But. I know you’re 
                        going through hell right now. And 
                        I’m really sorry. 

                                 CALEB
                        It’s alright. I was a total dick 
                        for thinking my situation was an 
                        excuse to check out on you. Out of 
                        everyone on the planet, you’re the 
                        last person I should have ever 
                        checked out on. I’ll never do it 
                        again. I swear.

           Wei looks choked up. She almost starts to cry, but punches 
           him instead.

                                 WEI
                        Thanks, man. 
                            (beat)
                        Damn. It’s weird to feel shit.
                                 CALEB
                        Tell me about it. I think I’ve 
                        experienced all the feelings at 
                        this point. And if there are more, 
                        please shoot me.

           Wei sits next to him on the bed.

                                 WEI
                            (beat)
                        You know I quit. Right after it 
                        happened. 

                                 CALEB
                        Good for you.

                                 WEI
                        Yeah. 
                            (beat)
                        She had a loose pussy anyway.

           Caleb gags.

                                 CALEB
                        Was that necessary?

                                 WEI
                        It’s true! That’s what happens when 
                        you pop out a kid, man.
                            (beat)
                        So. Are we good?

                                 CALEB
                        We’re good.

           They finally hug it out.

                                 CALEB (CONT’D)
                        And now that you’re here, I could 
                        really use your help with 
                        something.

                                 WEI
                        Whatever it is. I’m down.

           INT. EDITH’S CAR - THAT AFTERNOON

           Edith drives her Honda Odyssey down her street. Zev is in the 
           backseat. She’s listening to Bruce Springsteen but changes it 
           to Jewish music as she gets closer to her house. As she pulls 
           onto her street, she squints at something in the distance.
           EXT. EDITH’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Edith parks her Honda on the street and gets out of the car.

           CLOSE UP on her face as she stares at something, bewildered.

           CLOSE UP on her mailbox, which is no longer yellow. It is now 
           painted purple and is bedazzled with hundreds of sequins and 
           googley eyes.

           INT. MERYL’S KITCHEN - THAT NIGHT

           Benny, Meryl, and Caleb talk over spaghetti dinner.

                                 MERYL
                        So I told Janet that I don’t need 
                        that pre-pubsecent, fake boobed 
                        Ashley to be my TA. If I wanted to 
                        distract my students, I’d just show 
                        up to class without a bra.

           Caleb smiles.

                                 BENNY
                        Good for you, honey.

           They eat in silence for a moment. Meryl looks up at Caleb.

                                 MERYL
                        How are you feeling about tomorrow?

                                 CALEB
                        I’m trying not to think about it.

                                 BENNY
                        Do you want us to come with-

                                 CALEB
                        No. I think this is something I’d 
                        rather do Han Solo, if that’s okay.

                                 MERYL
                        Sure.

           Caleb takes another bite and then-

                                 CALEB
                        Well. The vandalizing took a lot 
                        out of me. I think I’m going to hit 
                        the sack a bit early tonight.

           He gets up and kisses Meryl good night.
                                 MERYL
                        I’ll be here when you get back.

           Caleb starts to walk to his room.

                                 BENNY
                        And what about me?

           Caleb goes up to Benny and he kisses him on the cheek.

                                 BENNY (CONT’D)
                        I’ll see you in the morning, kid.

           INT. CALEB’S BATHROOM - LATER

           Caleb washes his face like he did when he first came home 
           from the clinic. He doesn’t wipe wildly at his make up and he 
           doesn’t collapse in the bathtub this time. He takes a deep 
           breath in the mirror and has a spoonful of Nyquil (nobody’s 
           perfect.) Then he heads to bed.

           INT. CALEB’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           As he gets into bed, he notices that Meryl left her lecture 
           cards next to his pillow. He gets under the blanket and 
           starts to shuffle through them. He focuses in on one quote in 
           particular.

           “The amount of eccentricity in a society has generally been 
           proportional to the amount of genius, mental vigour, and 
           moral courage which it contained. That so few now dare to be 
           eccentric, marks the chief danger of the time.”

           Caleb puts the cards down, shuts the light, and goes to bed.

           TIME CARD: DAY 90

           INT. CALEB’S BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

           Caleb opens his eyes. He takes a deep breath and gets out of 
           bed. 

           As he makes his way to the bathroom, he stares at one of the 
           pieces of origami hanging from a string. He takes it down and 
           looks at it for a beat. 

           Caleb puts the swan in his backpack. He slips his grant forms 
           and creative portfolio into a large addressed envelope. He 
           puts that in his bag too.

           INT. CALEB’S BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Caleb brushes his teeth and stares at himself in the mirror. 
           He takes out a comb and starts to brush his hair.
           INT. MERYL’S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           The house is quiet. Meryl is still asleep but there’s a pot 
           of coffee still warm from Benny in the coffee maker. Caleb 
           goes to the fridge and takes out a Minute Maid.

           As he grabs it, he hesitates. He puts the juice back. 

           Caleb goes over to the pot of coffee and pours himself a mug. 
           He blows on it and sips it: it tastes disgusting. He 
           hilariously spits it out everywhere and makes a gross face. 

           He spills the coffee out in the sink and grabs a water bottle 
           from the fridge instead. He takes a granola bar from the 
           pantry.

           EXT. MERYL’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Caleb wears a blue t-shirt and a backpack. He walks his bike 
           down from the side of the house. At the bottom of the 
           driveway, he gets on. 

           He takes out headphones and puts them in his ears. He presses 
           play and SPACE ODDITY starts to hum through the speakers.

                                 DAVID BOWIE (O.S.)
                        “Ground control to Major Tom.”

           Caleb rides.

           EXT. MIAMI STREET DAY - CONTINUOUS

           Caleb bikes down a neighborhood street. He sees a Post Office 
           mailbox. He hops off his bike, opens up his bag, and drops 
           the grant envelope in.

                                 DAVID BOWIE (O.S.)
                        “Take your protein pills and put 
                        your helmet on.”

           EXT. OCEAN DRIVE, MIAMI BEACH - CONTINUOUS

           The storefront shutters open as Caleb rides by. 

           As he makes his way down the boardwalk, he spots a seniors 
           jogging group. He rings the bell again.

                                 DAVID BOWIE (O.S.)
                        “Check ignition and may God’s love 
                        be with you.”

           He passes by Benny, who doesn’t squirt water this time. 
           Instead, he merely nods. Caleb nods back and continues to 
           ride.
           EXT. GAY HEALTH CLINIC - CONTINUOUS

           Caleb locks his bike on the NO PARKING sign. He hops off.

                                 DAVID BOWIE (O.S.)
                        “Now it’s time to leave the capsule 
                        if you dare.”

           The same homeless man sleeps atop a bunch of blankets. Caleb 
           quietly puts a granola bar down by his head.

           Caleb stares at the Gay Men’s Health Clinic. The glass doors 
           leading inside are pristine and reflect his face back at him. 

                                 DAVID BOWIE (CONT’D)
                        “This is Major Tom to Ground 
                        Control. I’m stepping through the 
                        door. And I’m floating in the most 
                        peculiar way.”

           Caleb readies himself, takes a deep breath, and walks inside.

                                     THE END
