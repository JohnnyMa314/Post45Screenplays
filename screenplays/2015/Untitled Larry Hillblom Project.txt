                          Based on a true story.
           INT. LARRY’S MANSION, BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

           A FILIPINA WOMAN (30’s) lays sideways on a California King, 
           nude, expressionless. Coiled around her, a SKELETAL MAN 
           thrusts his pelvis, focused only on the finish line.

           The man is baby-faced, but his features have been scarred by 
           some kind of reconstructive surgery. He hides them (or seems 
           to) behind a goatee and Coke-bottle eyeglasses.

           He climaxes, and traces a finger across her belly...

                                 MAN
                        That was great. You did great.

           He stands, pulls up his briefs, then gazes out of the floor-
           to-ceiling window beside the bed: beams of sunlight kiss the 
           neon froth of West Pacific. It’s a sight to behold.

           This is LARRY HILLBLOM (52). His house. His view. His island.

           INT. LARRY’S MANSION, KITCHEN - SAME

           Larry pulls open the refrigerator; it’s filled with nothing 
           but GRAPEFRUITS. He takes one.

           He opens a cabinet, which is stacked from top to bottom with 
           BOTTLES OF VITAMINS. He starts pulling them out.

           INT. LARRY’S MANSION, EXERCISE ROOM - SAME

           Larry runs as fast as he can on a treadmill, breath steaming 
           up his glasses.

           INT. LARRY’S MANSION, KITCHEN - SAME

           Larry eats a grapefruit at the kitchen table, soaked with 
           sweat, a bowl of vitamins and a glass of water beside him.

           He alternates obsessively between taking a bite of fruit, 
           swallowing a vitamin, and sipping water. Bite, swallow, 
           sip....bite, swallow, sip...

           INT. LARRY’S MANSION, BATHROOM - SAME

           Larry, wrapped in a towel, scoops a dollop of goo from a tub 
           marked “Retin-A: Anti-Aging Cream” and massages it into his 
           cheeks. A case of unopened “Retin-A” tubs sits by his feet.

           INT. LARRY’S MANSION, WALK-IN CLOSET - SAME

           Larry grabs a tee-shirt from a small pile of men’s clothing 
           in the corner of the closet. The remaining space is devoted 
           to designer women’s fashion, shoes, and handbags.
           EXT. LARRY’S MANSION, DRIVEWAY - MORNING

           Larry walks down the driveway, where a dented ‘87 Carolla is 
           parked next to a DeLorean and a pair of Kawasaki racing 
           motorcycles.

           He hops into the Toyota and drives through a motorized gate, 
           making his way down a tropical hillside.

           INT./EXT. AIRPLANE HANGAR - MORNING

           MR. LONG, a grizzled old pilot, cranks at the propeller of a 
           single-engine aircraft. JESUS, a Pacific Islander, looks on.

                                 JESUS
                        The bitch going to fly, or what?

                                 MR. LONG
                        She’ll fly well enough.

                                 JESUS
                        You saying that ‘cause it’s true, or 
                        ‘cause you won’t get paid if it’s not?

                                 MR. LONG
                        Won’t get paid if we crash, either. 

           He closes the engine cover, wipes his hands with a rag.

                                 MR. LONG (CONT’D)
                        Dead men don’t sign checks.

           A Toyota pulls up outside the hangar, and Larry climbs out.

                                 MR. LONG (CONT’D)
                        Going to get some headwind today, Larry. 
                        Maybe a few bumps near Pagan.

           Larry nods, and boards the airplane; Jesus clambers inside 
           behind him. Mr. Long takes his place in the pilot’s seat, 
           turns on the engine, and taxis down a small runway.

           Then, they speed up and take off, circling back over the 
           island and disappearing into a puff of clouds...

           INT. CNMI SUPERIOR COURTHOUSE, SAIPAN - DAY

           A squeaky ceiling fan does little to cool down JUDGE CASTRO, 
           who sweats through his robes while addressing a court room 
           the size of a kindergarten classroom.
                                 JUDGE CASTRO
                        The defendant is charged with two counts 
                        of Assaulting a Law Enforcement Officer, 
                        one count of Possession With Intent to 
                        Distribute, and misdemeanor Public 
                        Intoxication. How does he plead?

           DAVID LUJAN (40), a handsome island lawyer in a pastel aloha 
           shirt, nudges WILLIE (20’s), his overweight client.

                                 DAVID
                        Say “not guilty.”

                                 WILLIE
                        Man, I just need to talk to Tiny and 
                        explain this shit. He knows how I get 
                        when Jasmine runs off with-

           Lujan smacks him upside the head. Judge Castro smirks.

                                 WILLIE (CONT’D)
                        Not guilty.

                                 DAVID
                        Not guilty, your honor...

                                 WILLIE
                        Pssh. “Your honor,” my dick. Dude’s name 
                        is Alex. He plays video poker with my 
                        Auntie Ro.

           Lujan glares at Willie, then points at-

                                 DAVID
                        Your honor, I believe I see some water 
                        damage in the court house ceiling.

           Everyone in the court room glances upward, and David punches 
           his client dead in the stomach!

                                 JUDGE CASTRO
                         (re: ceiling)
                        Huh, what do you know? We’ll have to get 
                        that spackled. Good eye, Counselor.

           Willie slumps over, gasping. Lujan holds up a legal brief.

                                 DAVID
                        Your honor, the defense would like to 
                        file a motion for a change of venue.

                                 JUDGE CASTRO
                        On what grounds?
                                 DAVID
                        There are 50,000 people on this island, 
                        and my client is blood relative or rival 
                        with every one of them. You can’t expect 
                        us to find an impartial jury in-

           Suddenly, the doors in the back of the court burst open, and 
           a FRANTIC WOMAN rushes down the aisle toward Judge Castro!

           A BAILIFF tries to step in her way, but the judge waves him 
           off. The woman whispers something in Castro’s ear, and his 
           eyes widen; he looks out at the gallery.

                                 JUDGE CASTRO
                        Ladies and gentlemen, I’m sorry to 
                        interrupt these proceedings, but I’ve 
                        just been informed that Larry Hillblom 
                        is...gone.

           Commotion! Turmoil! Castro bangs his gavel for order, as we 
           PULL OUT OF THE COURT ROOM, INTO...

                        The search continues for Larry Hillblom, 
                        reclusive founder of DHL Worldwide 
                        Express, who is missing and presumed

                        Described by colleagues as an “eccentric 
                        genius” and “adrenaline junkie,” 
                        Hillblom leaves behind an estimated

           INT. DHL CONFERENCE ROOM - SAME

           BUSINESSMEN sit around a conference table, sleeves rolled up, 
           ties yanked down. At the head is NICK WAECHTER (50’s), active 
           president of DHL; to his right is PETE DONNICI (40’s), chief 
           counsel to both DHL and the Hillblom estate.

                                 WAECHTER
                        We have arranged for three memorial 
                        services. One in Kingsburg, where he 
                        grew up. One at the ranch in Half Moon 
                        Bay, and one in Saipan.

                                 BUSINESSMAN #1
                        Will we be expected to fly down for...?

                                 WAECHTER
                        No, no. Larry would have hated the fuss. 
                        Unless you can find some sort of amazing 
                        deal on flights, in which case, by all 
                        means, honor him for the cheap bastard 
                        he was.

                                 DONNICI
                        Last night, my wife goes, “I’ll bet the 
                        sonofabitch got himself lost at sea just 
                        to save a few bucks on a coffin.”

           The group shares a much-needed belly laugh.

                                 WAECHTER
                        Pete and I are going to stay on the 
                        island for a bit, to take care of the 
                        estate. Larry being Larry, he named the 
                        “Bank of Saipan” the executor of his 
                        will. It’s quite the crackerjack 
                        financial institution.

                                 DONNICI
                        There’s one branch, in a strip mall next 
                        to a Blimpie’s. I’ve been told they 
                        share a toilet.

           Another laugh. As it wanes...

                                 WAECHTER
                        Look, we all know Larry was a giant. 
                        More than that, he was a friend.

                                 WAECHTER (CONT'D)
                         (chokes up)
                        He was my friend, for thirty years. And 
                        I can’t imagine what the future is going 
                        to look like without him. But I know we 
                        owe it to him to press on. He may be 
                        dead, but his legacy, this company, is 
                        very much alive. So, we keep working.

           He looks around the table, and gets nods in return.

                        What do you know about the will, Pete?

                                 DONNICI
                        I know you cocksuckers aren’t in it.

                                 BUSINESSMAN #3
                        I’ll bet he left his bankroll to Fed-Ex, 
                        just to fuck with us.

                                 DONNICI
                        The thing’s a turd in the tub of the 
                        IRS, and not much else. Eleven pages 
                        long, if that, with at least thirty 
                        references to not paying taxes.

                        So, where’s all the money going?

                                 DONNICI
                        Some bullshit trust. Medical Research at 
                        the University of California.

                                 BUSINESSMAN #1
                        Since when did Larry Hillblom care about 
                        “medical research”?

                                 DONNICI
                        He cared about fist-fucking Uncle Sam, 
                        that’s it. When he donates his assets, 
                        he dodges millions in estate tax.

                                 BUSINESSMAN #2
                        What about his family?

                                 WAECHTER
                         (snorts)
                        I’ll take “things Larry hated more than 
                        the IRS” for $200, Alex.
                                 DONNICI
                        His brothers get $300k apiece, the max 
                        amount you can leave someone without 
                        paying estate tax. His mother gets 
                        nothing.

                                 BUSINESSMAN #1
                        He forgot about his mother?

                                 DONNICI
                        No. His will clearly states, “My mother 
                        gets nothing.”
                         (shrugs)
                        And that’s pretty much it. Nothing about 
                        the businesses or hotels. Nothing about 
                        wives or kids, obviously.

           Waechter takes a sharp breath. Donnici notices.

                                 WAECHTER

                        With few leads and little hope, local 
                        authorities issued a death certificate 
                        for billionaire Larry Hillblom today, 
                        officially declaring him “lost at sea.”

           Seated on the couch beside her, Josephine’s friends, GAIL and 
           PATTY, refill her glass of wine to the brim.

                                 GAIL
                        Girl, the people on the news, they don’t 
                        know shit about Larry.

                                 PATTY
                        They don’t know shit, girl.

                                 GAIL
                        I bet he’s in, like, Ho Chi Minh City 
                        right now, building a swimming pool.

                                 JOSEPHINE
                        But they found his plane! In the ocean!
                                 PATTY
                        You think a plane crash is going to kill 
                        Larry? Baby, please: he already survived 
                        one of them shits two years ago.

                                 GAIL
                        That’s why his face was all fucked up, 
                        yeah?

           Josephine shoots her a glare-

                                 GAIL (CONT’D)
                        He’s real cute, though. Larry’s cute.

                                 PATTY
                        Drink your Chablis, honey.

           THE HOUSE PHONE RINGS, and Josephine answers... 

                                 JOSEPHINE
                        Hello?

           INT. CADILLAC - SAME

           Waechter, stuck in traffic on the highway, talks on a ‘90’s-
           era car phone.

                                 WAECHTER
                        Josephine? Nick Waechter. From DHL.
                         (pauses)
                        He was like a brother to me, Jo. I loved 
                        him. I know you loved him, too.

           INTERCUT AS NECESSARY WITH:

           INT. LARRY’S MANSION, LIVING ROOM - SAME

           Josephine dabs at her eyes, chugs half of her glass of wine.

                                 JOSEPHINE
                        What can I do for you?

                                 WAECHTER
                        Are you alone?

                                 JOSEPHINE
                        Alone?

                                 WAECHTER
                        Yes.

           She puts a finger over her lips, shushing Gail and Patty.
                                 JOSEPHINE
                        I’m alone.

           INT. CADILLAC - SAME

           Waechter chooses his next words very carefully.

                                 WAECHTER
                        I will be arriving in Saipan tomorrow 
                        for Larry’s memorial, and to attend to 
                        the affairs of his estate.
                         (hesitant)
                        I believe it is of the utmost importance 
                        that his assets be disseminated in the 
                        way he would have wished. Do you agree?

                                 JOSEPHINE
                        Okay.

                                 WAECHTER
                        Larry always wanted you to be provided 
                        for, in the event of his death.

           INT. LARRY’S MANSION, LIVING ROOM - SAME

           Josephine narrows her eyes, beginning to grow suspicious.

                                 JOSEPHINE
                        Yes. We talked about this.

                                 WAECHTER
                        You did?

                                 JOSEPHINE
                        Yes.

                                 WAECHTER
                        Good. That’s good.

           INT. CADILLAC - SAME

           Waechter closes his eyes, takes a long, slow breath.

                                 WAECHTER
                        The reason I’m calling...I’m calling to 
                        tell you that in order for you to be 
                        provided for, we must ensure that 
                        Larry’s legacy is secure. And in order 
                        to do so, we need you to take some 
                        precautionary steps. Immediately.

           A HONKED HORN startles him. He opens his eyes, and sees that 
           traffic has cleared: he’s sitting still on an open freeway.
           INT. LARRY’S MANSION, LIVING ROOM - SAME

           Josephine looks from Gail to Patty, bewildered.

                                 WAECHTER
                        Are you still with me, Josephine?

           She gulps down the rest of her wine.

           EXT. DAVID LUJAN’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           A brightly-painted beachfront home with a picturesque view.

                                 DAVID (PRE-LAP)
                        Bless this food for the nourishment of 
                        our bodies. Amen.

           INT. DAVID LUJAN’S HOUSE, DINING ROOM - SAME

           David ends his prayer, and lets go of the hands of his wife, 
           GABBY (30’s,) and daughter, SHANNON (15). They pass dishes 
           around the table, serving each other.

                                 GABBY
                        So, how did fat Willie Napuna do at 
                        arraignment?

                                 DAVID
                        Good. I only had to smack him once.

           He throws a few shadow-punches. Shannon smiles.

                                 GABBY
                        David, please. You’re not working the 
                        door at the cockfights anymore.

                                 DAVID
                        People got to show respect, love.
                         (to Shannon)
                        What’s up with you, huh? You graduate 
                        college yet?

                                 SHANNON
                        The sisters let us out early today.

                                 DAVID
                        Early? What kind of lazy-ass nuns do 
                        they got running that school?

                                 SHANNON
                        Because Larry Hillblom died. They let us 
                        go so we could watch the news and pray 
                        for his soul.
                                 DAVID
                        Oh.

                                 SHANNON
                        Most of my friends just went to the 
                        beach, though.

           David takes a few bites of his supper, says nothing.

                                 SHANNON (CONT’D)
                        You knew him, didn’t you, Dad?

                                 DAVID
                        Hillblom? Yeah, a little bit.

                                 SHANNON
                        Was he nice?

                                 DAVID
                        For a haole.

           Gabby slaps his hand-

                                 GABBY
                        Hey, what’d I say about that matapang 
                        crap? Not in my house.
                         (to Shannon)
                        Mr. Hillblom, he knew a lot of the same 
                        people as your daddy. Politicians and 
                        businessmen. And he was even made a 
                        judge at the Saipan court-

                                 DAVID
                        He made himself a judge.

           Gabby shoots David a “what are you doing this for?”-look, but 
           he ignores it. He turns toward his daughter.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        You’re still young, baby, but someday, 
                        you are going to travel the world. You 
                        are going to run off and explore these 
                        big and faraway lands, and when you do, 
                        you will come to understand that this 
                        place where we live, it is special. It 
                        is a special place, and we must protect 
                        it, because there are and always will be 
                        people out to destroy what is special 
                        about it.

                                 SHANNON
                        Was Larry Hillblom one of those people?

           David considers his response for a moment...
                                 DAVID
                        When Hillblom came to Saipan, he told me 
                        he wanted to help us fight those people. 
                        The corporations trying to put us in 
                        sweatshops; the governments trying to 
                        put us on welfare. And I thought that 
                        with his money and his power and his 
                        incredible mind, he could be our great 
                        warrior. But Larry, he didn’t want to be 
                        our warrior.
                         (pauses)
                        He wanted to be our king.

           Silence, as he returns to his dinner.

           EXT. SAIPAN AIRPORT - MORNING

           A PRIVATE JET emblazoned “DHL, WORLDWIDE” cuts through the 
           sky above the island, landing on a small runway.

           EXT. BEACH ROAD - LATER

           A MERCEDES SEDAN cruises down a two-lane coastal “highway.”

                                 DRIVER (PRE-LAP)
                        Just past those trees, by the water, is 
                        Mr. Hillblom’s restaurant...

           INT. MERCEDES - SAME

           Nick Waechter and Pete Donnici, in funeral-appropriate black 
           suits, gaze out separate windows in the backseat. A DRIVER 
           gives them a guided tour from behind the wheel.

                                 DRIVER
                        Good for a cold beer and a cheeseburger. 
                        Or, if you’re in the mood for something 
                        different, you can try one of Mr. 
                        Hillblom’s other restaurants.

                                 WAECHTER
                        How many restaurants did Mr. Hillblom 
                        own on the island?

           The driver chuckles, politely.

                                 DRIVER
                        Oh, very many, sir. All the restaurants.
                         (points at-)
                        Over there is Mr. Hillblom’s newspaper, 
                        the Saipan Tribune. Its offices are 
                        conveniently located next to Mr. 
                        Hillblom’s pawn shop.
                                 DONNICI
                        He bought a pawn shop?

                                 DRIVER
                        Yes, sir.

                                 DONNICI
                        Who the fuck buys Continental Airlines 
                        and a Micronesian pawn shop?

                                 DRIVER
                        About a kilometer down the road is Mr. 
                        Hillblom’s TV station, where-

                                 WAECHTER
                        What’s that?

           Waechter points out the window at what looks like an OLD WEST 
           TOWN, where a few costumed COWBOYS wander idly around.

                                 DRIVER
                        Ah. That is Mr. Hillblom’s Cow Town.

                                 WAECHTER
                        Cow Town?

                                 DRIVER
                        Saipan’s first-and-only theme park, full 
                        of cows, and...other amusements. Rumor 
                        has it that Mr. Hillblom imported real 
                        cowboys from the Wild West itself.

           The Mercedes turns into the driveway of-

           EXT. HYATT REGENCY SAIPAN - DAY

           A VALET opens the passenger door, and Donnici slides out.

                                 DONNICI
                        I’ll check-in.

           As he heads into the lobby, Waechter grabs the driver-

                                 WAECHTER
                        What other rumors have you heard...have 
                        people heard...about Mr. Hillblom?

           The driver shifts uncomfortably in his seat.

           EXT. ISLAND HOPPER BOAT - SAME

           A WATER TAXI, crammed with LOCALS and TOURISTS alike, slices 
           through the ocean.
                                 BOAT CAPTAIN (OVER P.A.)
                        Next stop, Saipan! Saipan, next stop!

           ON THE UPPER DECK, a Pacific Island girl (26) stands with her 
           son (10). She wears a barely-there halter top, miniscule cut-
           offs, and heavy make-up. To say she looks like a prostitute 
           might be offensive, if she weren’t actually a prostitute.

           This is KAELANI KINNEY. Her son, JUNIOR, is half-caucasian.

           She pulls a stick of chewing gum from her purse. Junior holds 
           out his hand, expectantly.

                                 KAELANI
                        No.

           NOTE: Kaelani has a thick Pacific Island accent. English 
           isn’t her first language.

                                 JUNIOR
                        Why?

                                 KAELANI
                        It’s my last one.

                                 JUNIOR
                        Can I have half?

                                 KAELANI
                        No.

                                 JUNIOR
                        Why?

                                 KAELANI
                        ‘Cause half a piece of gum ain’t shit. 
                        All it do is make you want more gum.

           She puts the gum in her mouth. Junior begins to pout.

                                 KAELANI (CONT’D)
                        Awww...

           She pinches his chubby cheeks.

                                 KAELANI (CONT’D)
                        When you’re a millionaire, you can buy 
                        all the gum you want.

                                 JUNIOR
                        When I’m a millionaire, I’m going to buy 
                        you a mansion, Momma. In Beverly Hills, 
                        90210, California.
           He bats his puppy dog eyes. She melts.

                                 KAELANI
                        I hate your little ass.

           Kaelani holds her chewed piece of gum between her teeth and 
           stretches it until it snaps. Junior snatches his half and 
           pops it in his mouth, triumphant.

           EXT. SAIPAN HARBOR - DAY

           A DECK HAND helps Kaelani and Junior off of the boat.

                                 KAELANI
                        Hey, you know where I can find a lawyer?

                                 DECK HAND
                        What?

                                 KAELANI
                        A lawyer?

           A confused beat, then...the deck hand reaches into his fanny 
           pack and hands her a pamphlet on scuba diving.

           She throws it away and walks Junior down the dock, toward-

           EXT. GARAPAN VILLAGE  - CONTINUOUS

           A bustling beach town caught somewhere between touristy and 
           provincial. Produce markets stand side-by-side with souvenir 
           shops; resort restaurants with locally-owned watering holes. 
           VACATIONERS and ISLANDERS intersect, but rarely interact.

                                 KAELANI (O.S.)
                        ...because I got my child with me, you 
                        fucking hippopotamus.

           Kaelani chews out the OBESE OWNER of a shaved ice cart, while 
           Junior, distracted, checks out the flavors.

                                 KAELANI (CONT’D)
                        I need a lawyer, not a date.

           The man flashes a wad of cash, blows her a kiss. She groans 
           in disgust, drags Junior away...

                                 JUNIOR
                        Can we get ices, Momma?

                                 KAELANI
                        When you’re a millionaire, baby.
           DOWN THE STREET, Kaelani notices a LARGE CROWD, peppered with 
           news crews, amassed in front of a small church.

           INT. “CHRIST THE KING” CHURCH - SAME

           Creaking pews crammed with familiar faces: Lujan and family, 
           Josephine and friends. Pete Donnici is conspicuously absent.

           ON THE ALTAR, Nick Waechter delivers a eulogy beside a blown-
           up photo of Larry Hillblom, strewn with tropical flowers.

                                 WAECHTER
                        People liked to throw every name in the 
                        book at Larry, usually because they were 
                        jealous. They’d call him eccentric, or 
                        offbeat, or idiosyncratic, whatever that 
                        means. Well, I knew the man for thirty 
                        years: he was my boss, my mentor, and my 
                        best friend. And I can stand here today, 
                        with my hand on the Bible, and tell you 
                        plainly he was none of those things. 
                        Larry wasn’t eccentric, or offbeat, or 
                        idiosyncratic. Larry was just...nuts.

           This gets a BIG LAUGH. He waits for it to die.

                                 WAECHTER (CONT’D)
                        He was a businessman who didn’t own a 
                        suit, a billionaire who clipped coupons, 
                        a health nut with an honest-to-God death 
                        wish. In the last ninety days of his 
                        life, he built a golf course, crashed a 
                        motorcycle, and ate nothing but 
                        grapefruit. Larry. Was. Nuts.
                         (then-)
                        He was also a genius.

           AS WAECHTER EULOGIZES IN V.O., Kaelani continues to try (and 
           fail) to get an answer to her question from random strangers.

           A WOMAN recoils and backs away when Kaelani approaches, put 
           off by her appearance; a MAN throws his arm around her and 
           tries to lead her away from her son, making lewd gestures.

                                 WAECHTER (V.O.)
                        By founding DHL, before Fed-Ex, before 
                        AOL, before “Hands Across America” or 
                        “We Are The World,” Larry Hillblom 
                        shrunk the earth. He brought distant 
                        cultures together one delivery at a 
                        time; he made our planet a community of 
                        continents.

                        He united our different walks of life, 
                        and in doing so, enriched each and every 
                        one of them. 

           A pack of WHITE TOURIST GIRLS laugh at her, as she pushes the 
           aggressive man off and pulls Junior away.

           Waechter takes a long look at the photo of Larry beside him.

                                 WAECHTER
                        And if you think that wasn’t his intent, 
                        consider the place where you sit today: 
                        Saipan. Not New York, or San Francisco, 
                        but a small mound of sand in the West 
                        Pacific. What titan of industry, at the 
                        height of his success, would chose a 
                        life this far off of the grid? Did Henry 
                        Ford move to Timbuktu after building the 
                        Model T?
                         (shakes his head)
                        Only Larry, a man who believed not in 
                        one nation, but in all nations as one. 
                        Only Larry, a man who believed the 
                        adventurous life to be the only life 
                        worth living. Only Larry, a man of more 
                        humanity than any I’ll ever know.

           Lujan glowers from his seat.

           Kaelani fends off a SHIRTLESS GUY outside of a 7-11.

                                 KAELANI
                        Yeah, I get it. You want a blowjob. I 
                        want a lawyer.

                                 SHIRTLESS GUY
                        So...?

                                 KAELANI
                        Study hard and find me in eight years.

                                 JUNIOR (O.S.)
                        Momma, look-!

           Kaelani turns and spots Junior standing next to an OLD WOMAN, 
           who points up the street at a storefront in a strip mall. A 
           sign outside reads, “The Law Offices of David Lujan, Esq.”

           Kaelani takes the woman’s hand in gratitude.
                                 KAELANI
                        God bless you.

                                 JUNIOR
                        God bless you, lady!

                                 KAELANI
                        Don’t call the lady “lady,” baby.

           She grabs Junior and heads toward the strip mall.

           EXT. “CHRIST THE KING” CHURCH - AFTERNOON

           The congregation streams out of the chapel, past the media 
           gathered outside. Lujan glad-hands a few acquaintances, 
           kisses his family goodbye, and walks off.

           INT. LUJAN’S OFFICE, WAITING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           David enters, still in his church outfit. CECILIA (20’s), his 
           assistant, jumps up behind her desk.

                                 CECILIA
                        David, I need to speak with you.

                                 DAVID
                        Let me change, CeCe. This suit makes me 
                        look like a lawyer.

                                 CECILIA
                        Wait. Before you go in.

           He steps past her, into-

           INT. LUJAN’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Cluttered yet polished, with a NOTRE DAME LAW SCHOOL DIPLOMA 
           hung prominently on the wall. On the carpet below his desk, 
           Kaelani and Junior draw with highlighters on a legal pad. 

           They look up at David, who freezes in the doorway.

                                 DAVID
                        Who the hell are you?

                                 KAELANI
                        Are you the lawyer?

                                 DAVID
                        My question first.

           Kaelani stands, holds out her hand for a shake.
                                 KAELANI
                        Kaelani Kinney, from Palau. This is my 
                        son, Junior Larry Hillbroom.

                                 JUNIOR
                        Do you have fruit snacks?

           A beat. David begins to chuckle.

                                 DAVID
                        This is a joke?

                                 KAELANI
                        Fuck you.
                         (to Junior)
                        Don’t say that word.

                                 DAVID
                        You know, it’s Hillblom, not Hillbroom.

                                 KAELANI
                        I didn’t speak English so good when my 
                        baby was born.

                                 DAVID
                        Uh-huh. Well, maybe take an Engrish 
                        crass before your next big con.

           Kaelani digs through her purse, finds a small piece of paper, 
           and slaps it down on Lujan’s desk. He glances at it, and his 
           eyes widen...

           It’s a birth certificate for JUNIOR LARRY HILLBROOM, born on 
           Palau in 1984.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        This is real.

                                 KAELANI
                        Of course, yes.

           Lujan sinks into his chair, inspects the certificate. Then, 
           he waves at Junior...

                                 DAVID
                        Come here, little man.

           Junior looks at his mom, who nods at him. Go ahead.

           He approaches Lujan, who takes the boy’s chin in his hand and 
           examines his facial features. After a moment or two, David 
           reaches under his desk and pulls an old newspaper from the 
           trash can: an obituary photo of Hillblom is featured on the 
           front page.
           David holds the paper up next to Junior’s face... 

           The boy and Larry look remarkably alike.

           David tosses the paper, then feigns a one-two punch to the 
           kid’s jaw. Junior laughs, as David turns to Kaelani.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        How did you meet him? Larry Hillblom?

                                 KAELANI
                        He was staying at the Nikko hotel.

                                 DAVID
                        On Palau?

                                 KAELANI
                        Yes. I was working in the bar, for the 
                        men. The mamasan, she give me to him.

                                 DAVID
                        She gave you, specifically?

                                 KAELANI
                        Yes.

                                 DAVID
                        Why?

                                 KAELANI
                        You don’t think I’m a pretty girl?

           She bites her lip, sexually. David shakes his head.

                                 DAVID
                        You get one of those. You do it again, 
                        you’re out on your ass.

                                 KAELANI
                        I...I have no money.

                                 DAVID
                        Why were you, specifically, offered to 
                        Larry Hillblom?

           Kaelani glances down at Junior, and touches her ear; he puts 
           his hands over his own.

                                 KAELANI
                        Because I still had my cherry. He like 
                        the girls who still have their cherry.

           Silence. David’s jaw clenches.
                                 DAVID
                        How old were you?

                                 KAELANI
                        Fifteen.

                                 DAVID
                        Did he know that?

                                 KAELANI
                        Yes.

                                 DAVID
                        Did he know you gave birth?

                                 KAELANI
                        Yes. He pretended no.

                                 DAVID
                        Do his people?

                                 KAELANI
                        His people?

                                 DAVID
                        Do his people know about Junior?

           She thinks about the question for a second...

                                 KAELANI
                        I guess...some yes, some no?

                                 DAVID
                        Some yes?

                                 KAELANI
                        Some no. Some yes, some no.

                                 DAVID 
                        CECILIA!

           Cecilia pokes her head into the office-

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Tell Meliza at CNMI Superior that I’m on 
                        my way, and if Castro tries to adjourn 
                        before 5, I will slash his tires and 
                        plead my case in the parking lot.

           David hurries to the door, beckons to Kaelani and Junior.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Come on, come on, come on-
                                 KAELANI
                        So, you’re my lawyer, now?

                                 DAVID
                        What? No. Of course not.

           He points at Junior.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        I’m his.

           INT. CNMI SUPERIOR COURTHOUSE - AFTERNOON

           Judge Castro presides over an eerily vacant court room, his 
           only company a BAILIFF, a TYPIST, and Mr. Pete Donnici.

                                 JUDGE CASTRO
                        Only one of you today, Counselor?

                                 DONNICI
                        My associates are attending the service 
                        in Garapan.

                                 JUDGE CASTRO
                        As is the rest of Saipan. I wonder, what 
                        is so pressing that it couldn’t wait 
                        until after the memorial?

           Donnici hands a brief to the bailiff, who walks it to Castro.

                                 DONNICI
                        Your honor, I am requesting an immediate 
                        loan of $15 million from DHL, Worldwide 
                        to the Commonwealth Holding Corporation, 
                        the Hillblom estate’s holding company.

                                 JUDGE CASTRO
                        On what grounds?

                                 DONNICI
                        For the settlement of outstanding debts, 
                        and the majority acquisition of the Bank 
                        of Saipan, to provide for an efficient 
                        administration of the estate’s assets.

           Lujan, Kaelani and Junior enter through the back of the court 
           room. They tiptoe down the aisle, trying (and failing) to 
           keep quiet, and take a seat in the first row...

                                 JUDGE CASTRO
                        And based upon your prior relationship 
                        with Mr. Hillblom, you believe these to 
                        be the types of actions that he would 
                        take himself, were he alive?
                                 DONNICI
                        I do, your honor.

           Castro skims the brief in front of him, then bangs his gavel.

                                 JUDGE CASTRO
                        Petitioner is hereby authorized to do 
                        all acts requested in this petition 
                        within the four corners of his fiduciary 
                        duty to this court.

           Castro begins to gather his papers, done for the day. Lujan 
           clears his throat.

                                 DAVID
                        Permission to approach the bench?

                                 JUDGE CASTRO
                        I don’t see another case on my docket.

                                 DAVID
                        This one’s a late addition, your honor. 
                        Extenuating circumstances.

                                 JUDGE CASTRO
                        Extenuating or not, you can’t just waltz 
                        into my court room and cut the line.

                                 DAVID
                        Is there a line? I didn’t see a...

           David glances around, in search of a line.

                                 JUDGE CASTRO
                        Mr. Lujan-

                                 DAVID
                        Would you like me to start a line?

                                 JUDGE CASTRO
                        You can take this up with the clerk.

                                 DAVID
                         (to Junior)
                        Introduce yourself, little man.

           Junior stands, then looks over at his mother. She nods.

                                 JUNIOR
                        Junior Larry Hillbroom.

                                 DAVID
                        Say it like you mean it.
                                 JUNIOR
                        Junior Larry Hillbroom.

                                 DAVID
                        Shout it from the mountaintops!

                                 JUNIOR
                        Junior Larry Hillbroom!

                                 DAVID
                        Your honor!

                                 JUNIOR
                        Your honor!

                                 DAVID
                        ‘Attaboy.

           SILENCE in the court room. Until-

                                 JUDGE CASTRO
                        It’s Hillblom, Counselor. Not Hill-

                                 KAELANI
                        I didn’t speak English so good when my 
                        baby was born.

                                 DAVID
                         (to Junior)
                        Tell Momma I’ll do the talking.

                                 JUNIOR
                        He’ll do the talking, Momma.

           David looks at Castro, gestures at Kaelani-

                                 DAVID
                        What she said.

                                 DONNICI
                        Your honor, I need to interject here-

                                 DAVID
                        I’d like to request a motion to delay 
                        probate in the matter of the Hillblom 
                        estate until my client, Junior Larry 
                        Hillbroom, has a chance to establish 
                        paternity.

                                 DONNICI
                        This is just...this is outrageous!

                                 DAVID
                        Outrageous or inconvenient, sir?
           Donnici has no reply. 

           Lujan puts a hand on Junior’s shoulder and walks him up in 
           front of Judge Castro.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        You’re a good man, Alex. A good judge. 
                        Take a look. What do you see?

                                 DONNICI
                        It doesn’t matter what he sees-

                                 DAVID
                        Look at the boy.

                                 DONNICI
                        It doesn’t matter what anyone sees!

                                 DAVID
                        Look at him.

           Castro stares at Junior, quiet. Then, he bangs his gavel.

                                 JUDGE CASTRO
                        Motion denied.

           David shakes his head, then points at Kaelani.

                                 DAVID
                        She was fifteen, Alex. Like my Shannon.

           He walks out. His clients follow.

           EXT. “DIRTY LARRY’S” BAR & GRILL - NIGHT

           A ROWDY BAND OF LOCALS, many still in their church suits, get 
           shitfaced in the beach restaurant earlier singled-out as 
           belonging to Larry Hillblom.

           Waechter, sweaty, stumbling, shirt unbuttoned to his naval, 
           grinds with a BAR GIRL to Shaggy’s “Boombastic.” 

           When Shaggy drops the bassy “MISTAH BOOOM” that rounds out 
           the chorus, the DJ MUTES THE TRACK...and every soul in the 
           room raises a glass to the blown-up photo of Larry (seen 
           earlier at the memorial) now hanging above the bar.

           Suddenly, a hand clamps on Waechter’s shoulder. He turns.

                                 DONNICI
                        Where the hell have you been?
                                 WAECHTER
                        Been right here, Pete. With the rest of 
                        the island. Grieving.

                                 DONNICI
                        This is how they grieve?

                                 WAECHTER
                        They are excellent at it.

           Donnici pulls him aside...

                                 DONNICI
                        I went to court.

                                 WAECHTER
                        Did we get the bank?

                                 DONNICI
                        There was a boy. About ten, eleven years-
                        old. Lawyered up. He was...mixed.

                                 WAECHTER
                        Mixed?

                                 DONNICI
                        Racially. White and something. Oriental?

           Waechter’s eyes widen; Donnici’s narrow.

           EXT. BEACH - NIGHT

           Donnici and Waechter, still quite drunk, amble down the coast 
           toward their distant hotel, leaving the bar in their wake.

                                 WAECHTER
                        A few years back, we were on Palau for 
                        some real estate junk, going eighteen 
                        with these local scummos. We’re on the 
                        fifth or sixth, Larry’s about to putt, 
                        when out of nowhere, this girl pops up 
                        and starts shrieking. She has a kid with 
                        her: mixed, baggy T-shirt. And he’s just 
                        bopping from trap to trap, stealing golf 
                        balls, not a care in the world. While 
                        his Momma’s beating her chest, howling 
                        at Larry, “This is your son! This is 
                        your son! You said you’d help us!”

                                 DONNICI
                        Jesus. What did he do?
                                 WAECHTER
                        Larry? He putted.
                         (pauses)
                        After security hauled the girl off, I 
                        took him aside and asked, point blank, 
                        “did you know that girl? Was that your 
                        child?” And he goes, “Of course not. 
                        Just some crazy bitch trying to 
                        blackmail me. Not a chance.”

                                 DONNICI
                        Did you believe him?

                                 WAECHTER
                        I didn’t think he was going to die.

           Donnici allows himself a calming breath.

                                 DONNICI
                        How could you keep this a secret?

                                 WAECHTER
                        I kept plenty of secrets.

                                 DONNICI
                        How could you keep this one?

                                 WAECHTER
                        Who was I going to tell, you? What had 
                        you done to earn it?

                                 DONNICI
                        To earn it? I don’t-

                                 WAECHTER
                        That’s what Larry was all about, right? 
                        You get what you earn. It’s why he hated 
                        paying taxes, or hugging his Mom.

                                 DONNICI
                        I’m his lawyer. It’s my job to-

                                 WAECHTER
                        That man made me a millionaire. He 
                        introduced me to my wife. He...he even 
                        wore a suit to my wedding, Pete. Larry 
                        Hillblom earned my loyalty. What the 
                        fuck makes you think you’ve earned his 
                        secrets?

           Donnici sighs. He’s drunk.
                                 DONNICI
                        You need to understand something: we are 
                        standing in the path of a tornado here. 
                        We are now living in a world where the 
                        mulatto son of high-yellow whore could 
                        inherit a majority stake in the company 
                        we’ve spent our whole lives building. I 
                        won’t let that happen: not to our 
                        families, not to our colleagues-

                                 WAECHTER
                        Not to Larry.

                                 DONNICI
                        Larry is dead, Nick. He’s dead.

           Waechter ignores him, glancing over his shoulder at the still-
           lively beach bar, now a good distance behind them.

                                 WAECHTER
                        You know, I can see why he liked this 
                        place. It’s got spirit.

                                 DONNICI
                        It’s got a 95% rebate on income taxes.

                                 WAECHTER
                        You didn’t know him at all.

                                 DONNICI
                        I did. And I admired him. But you don’t 
                        call a sinner a saint as soon as the 
                        coffin door closes.

           They flash room keys at a SECURITY GUARD, and step on to-

           EXT. HYATT REGENCY SAIPAN - CONTINUOUS

           The deserted, private beach in the back of the Hyatt resort.

                                 WAECHTER
                        This “mixed” boy. Did he look like-?

                                 DONNICI
                         (nods)
                        Uncanny. Cabbage Patch Larry with a 
                        spray-on tan.

                                 WAECHTER
                        Who’s his lawyer?

                                 DONNICI
                        Some local barracuda named Lujan. Wears 
                        Hawaiian shirts. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 DONNICI (CONT'D)
                        Looks like he sleeps in a coconut tree. 
                        We can “first world” him.

           As they head toward the hotel’s back entrance-

                                 DONNICI (CONT’D)
                        He’s going to request a DNA test to 
                        prove paternity. Every retard with a 
                        cable box knows about DNA after O.J.

                                 WAECHTER
                        Yeah, don’t worry about that. It’s fine.

                                 DONNICI
                        It’s not fine. Just because they never 
                        found Larry’s body doesn’t mean they 
                        won’t find samples of his-

                                 WAECHTER
                        I took care of it, okay?

           Donnici shoots him a puzzled look.

           EXT. DANDAN ROAD - MORNING

           Tropical rain hammers the windshield of a JEEP WRANGLER as it 
           pulls into a small clearing at the top of a hill.

           Lujan hops out, holding his briefcase over his head to keep 
           dry, and runs across the street toward...

           EXT. LARRY’S MANSION - CONTINUOUS

           He pushes the buzzer at the front gate; no response. He presses 
           it again; nothing.

           He turns to leave, when suddenly, he hears a muffled noise in 
           the distance. It sounds like...a vacuum cleaner?

           EXT. LARRY’S MANSION, DRIVEWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Lujan wades through muck, following a fence along the edge of 
           the property, until he comes upon...

           LARRY’S DELOREAN, parked in the middle of the driveway, doors 
           wide-open despite the downpour. Sticking out of each door is 
           a pair of WOMEN’S LEGS, an industrial vacuum base beside it.

           Lujan begins to bang his fists against the wire fence!

                                 DAVID
                        Hey! Stop that! Stop it right now!
           The two vacuums power down, and the legs shimmy out of the 
           car doors, revealing themselves as attached to...Gail and 
           Patty, Josephine’s friends.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Good morning, Gail. Patty.

           They stare at him, frightened.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Ladies, I don’t want to jump to any 
                        conclusions, but it looks as though 
                        you’re destroying evidence in an on-
                        going case.

                         GAIL
                                                     PATTY
           We’re not.
                                          We’re definitely not.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Uh-huh.

           A beat.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Well, as an officer of the court, I’m 
                        going to have to ask you to cease and 
                        desist. Or, you know...I’ll have you 
                        arrested.

           No reply. The pitter-patter of raindrops. Then-

           THE GIRLS SLAM THE CAR DOORS and dash into the house. Lujan 
           spins around and speeds through the mud back to his car.

           EXT. BEACH ROAD - LATER

           Lujan’s Jeep screeches to a halt at a STOP SIGN. As SURFERS 
           cross the street in front of him, he turns and sees... 

           Waechter, Donnici, and a group of ATTORNEYS dragging boxes 
           out of the BANK OF SAIPAN (right next to a Blimpie’s) and 
           loading them into the back of a van.

           His eyes narrow. He floors it.

           INT. CNMI SUPERIOR COURTHOUSE, JUDGE’S OFFICES - LATER

           Lujan harangues a CLERK, who works outside Castro’s office.

                                 CLERK
                        I’m sorry, Counselor, but the Judge gave 
                        me strict instructions not to-
                                 DAVID
                        Is he in there?! Tell him it’s urgent!

                                 CLERK
                        He’s writing opinions in his chambers 
                        all morning, and has asked that-

                                 DAVID
                        I don’t care what he-!
                         (pauses)
                        In his chambers, you said?

           She nods. He runs off.

           EXT. KANOA GARDENS GAMING DEN - MORNING

           Lujan’s Jeep pulls up in front of an off-road gambling parlor.

           INT. KANOA GARDENS GAMING DEN - SAME

           A windowless room filled with slots and video poker machines, 
           thick with cigarette smoke and sweat. Castro hunches over a 
           console in the corner, playing “Five Card Draw,” a Big Gulp 
           full of silver dollars in the cup holder beside him.

           Lujan approaches, plops down on the swivel stool next to his.

                                 DAVID
                        You know, when Meliza said you’d be in 
                        your “chambers,” I assumed she meant 
                        Lucky’s or Susupe Jackpots-

                                 JUDGE CASTRO
                        Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you!

           Castro smacks his poker machine, unhappy with his hand-

                                 DAVID
                        You’ve got to tell me when you switch 
                        “offices.”

           Judge Castro notices David for the first time, nods. Then, he 
           stands, grabs his cup of silver dollars, and peruses the row 
           of empty machines until he finds one that feels “hot.”

           He starts pumping coins into it. Lujan sits down beside him.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        I was at Hillblom’s place this morning. 
                        Those Filipina girls, the ones that are 
                        always hanging around Jo Nocasa? I 
                        caught them vacuuming his car.

           Silence. Castro’s in the zone.
                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Then I’m heading back towards Garapan, 
                        and what do I see, but those ‘Frisco 
                        haoles lugging boxes out of the BOS.

                                 JUDGE CASTRO
                        And?

                                 DAVID
                        And that doesn’t concern you?

                                 JUDGE CASTRO
                        Fucking, goddamned spades!

           Castro smacks his poker machine, again. Lujan sighs.

                                 JUDGE CASTRO (CONT’D)
                         (annoyed)
                        I’m sorry, David. What concerns you?

                                 DAVID
                        What concerns me, Alex, is you might be 
                        the most intelligent man on this island, 
                        and you’re wasting your time in this 
                        shithole. And do you know why this 
                        shithole is here?

           He points at the U.S. FLAG, which hangs over the door beside 
           the flag of the Northern Mariana Islands (CNMI).

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Because it’s illegal over there. Because 
                        some wealthy white man called some other 
                        wealthy white man and said, “find me 
                        somewhere poor and brown where I can 
                        break the rules.” And just like that-
                         (snaps his fingers)
                        -the smartest guy I know is playing 
                        hooky to blow his paycheck on video 
                        games.

                                 JUDGE CASTRO
                        I come here to relax.

           David leans in close to Castro’s face. Really close.

                                 DAVID
                        You want to know what concerns me? I’ve 
                        got friends in garment factories less 
                        than a mile away, working for pennies in 
                        conditions that’d make Dachau look like 
                        Disneyland, all because a wealthy white 
                        man said, “find me somewhere poor and 
                        brown where I can break the rules.”
                                 JUDGE CASTRO
                        Okay, David-

                                 DAVID
                        Pedophiles. Puddle-jumping from island-
                        to-island. Raping our daughters without 
                        fear of consequence. That concerns me.

                                 JUDGE CASTRO
                        Enough-

                                 DAVID
                        But you want to know what concerns me 
                        most of all? It’s the lack of respect. 
                        Because no matter who we are...judge or 
                        lawyer, butcher, baker or candlestick 
                        maker...they look at you and they look 
                        at me and you know what they see?
                         (seething)
                        A new shade of nigger.

           He jabs, once more, at the AMERICAN FLAG...

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        And until we can do something to change 
                        that, we might as well walk around with 
                        that thing planted in our assholes.

           Castro meets Lujan’s eyes, swept up by his intensity.

                                 JUDGE CASTRO
                        Look, David, it’s...

                                 DAVID
                        I will get that boy what’s rightfully 
                        his. Or, so help me God, I will hang 
                        from a fucking tree.

           And Castro watches, stunned, as he storms out the door.

                                 JUDGE CASTRO (PRE-LAP)
                        In the matter of the estate of Larry Lee 
                        Hillblom...

           INT. CNMI SUPERIOR COURTHOUSE - AFTERNOON

           The buzz of NEWS CAMERAS and the occasional pop of a FLASH 
           BULB are the only sounds heard in the packed courtroom, as 
           Judge Castro delivers a prepared statement.

           On one side of the room, Lujan, clad in his usual pastel and 
           linen, sits with Kaelani and Junior. On the other, Waechter 
           and Donnici sit with a team of attorneys.
                                 JUDGE CASTRO
                        ...I am hereby designating Junior Larry 
                        Hillbroom, age ten, an “interested 
                        party.”

           UPROAR in the gallery. Lujan and Kaelani celebrate; Donnici 
           and his team protest, outraged.

                                 JUDGE CASTRO (CONT’D)
                        I am further issuing an immediate 
                        restraining order halting the 
                        destruction of any and all potential DNA 
                        evidence until paternity is established. 
                        Hillbroom’s counsel is hereby entitled 
                        to review all of the estate’s documents, 
                        records, and possessions, as well as 
                        initiate testing on salvageable DNA...

           IN THE CHEAP SEATS, a pasty kid with over-gelled hair watches 
           the action. This is RANDY FENNELL (early-30’s), and his 
           wheels are spinning. They always are.

           EXT. CNMI SUPERIOR COURTHOUSE - LATER

           ON THE COURTHOUSE STEPS, Lujan faces down a mob of cameras and 
           microphones, Kaelani and Junior at his side.

                                 COURT REPORTER #1
                        How do you respond to the accusations 
                        that your client seeks to defraud-?

                                 DAVID
                        My client seeks his birthright. Nothing 
                        more, nothing less.

                                 COURT REPORTER #2
                        And what about you?

                                 DAVID
                        Truth and justice. Always.

                                 COURT REPORTER #3
                        Are you certain that DNA testing will 
                        prove your client’s assertions of-?

                                 DAVID
                        You know, I’m from Guam, originally. And 
                        my father, he was a judge out there back 
                        when DNA was just AND spelled backwards. 
                        I remember, he used to decide these kind 
                        of cases with his eyes, by standing a 
                        man and boy side-by-side and taking a 
                        long, hard look. If the man was dead, 
                        he’d use a photograph.

                                 DAVID (CONT'D)
                         (smirks)
                        I’m pretty sure this one would have been 
                        a slam dunk in my daddy’s day, too.

           He tousles Junior’s mess of hair.

           INT. LUJAN’S JEEP - AFTERNOON

           David drives toward Garapan, Kaelani beside him, Junior in 
           back. The Temptations are on the radio. Everyone’s smiling.

                                 KAELANI
                        All of them cameras. Like I was Mariah 
                        Carey or something. And Junior was that 
                        little white boy from “Jerry Maguire.”

                                 JUNIOR
                        I’m “Terminator 2.”

                                 KAELANI
                        “Terminator 2” is a movie, not a person.

                                 JUNIOR
                        It’s a movie about a guy named 
                        “Terminator 2”-

                                 KAELANI
                        It’s the number two movie about the 
                        Terminator. Don’t be stupid around your 
                        lawyer.

                                 JUNIOR
                        I’m not!

                                 KAELANI
                        Your Grammy Naoko should’ve never let 
                        you see that movie, anyway. It’s got 
                        butts in it.

                                 DAVID
                        The judge gave Junior’s claim legitimacy 
                        today. It’s a big deal now. You should 
                        expect more media attention and-
                         (looking O.S.)
                        What the hell?

           ON THE SHOULDER AHEAD, Randy Fennell stands beside a parked 
           GEO PRISM, waving his arms.

           EXT. SHOULDER OF ROAD - CONTINUOUS

           David pulls over, rolls down his Wrangler’s passenger-side 
           window. Fennell leans inside-
                                 FENNELL
                        Thanks for stopping. My battery conked 
                        out on me. Can I get a jump?

                                 DAVID
                        Yeah, okay.

                                 FENNELL
                        Thank you. Thanks a million.

           Lujan parks his Jeep bumper-to-bumper with the Geo. He turns 
           off his engine and climbs out; Kaelani and Junior stay put.

                                 DAVID
                        You need cables?

           Fennell tosses him a set of jumper cables; Lujan pops his 
           hood, gets to work. 

                                 FENNELL
                        Where I come from, it would’ve been an 
                        hour before anyone stopped to help. It 
                        really is like they say it is down here, 
                        huh? “Spirit of Aloha,” and all that.

                                 DAVID
                        Aloha’s Hawaii.

                                 FENNELL
                        Right. I just meant-

                                 DAVID
                        It’s four thousand miles away.

                                 FENNELL
                        Same vibe, though. Same culture.

           Lujan finishes clamping the cables to his battery, looks up-

                                 DAVID
                        Where are you from?

                                 FENNELL
                        Seattle. Washington.

                                 DAVID
                        Is it just like they say? The “Spirit of 
                        Konichiwa,” and all that?

                                 FENNELL
                        Ha. I see what you...it’s different-

                                 DAVID
                        Why?
                                 FENNELL
                        You know, you look so familiar.

           Lujan pops the Geo’s hood. He frowns.

                                 FENNELL (CONT’D)
                        Why do you look so familiar?

                                 DAVID
                        Your battery looks brand new.

                                 FENNELL
                        Does it? That’s effing weird.

           David narrows his eyes. He turns, slowly.

                                 DAVID
                        Give me your keys.

                                 FENNELL
                        What’s your name, man? Actually, let me 
                        go ahead and introduce my-

                                 DAVID
                        Give me your keys or I’ll break your 
                        fucking teeth.

           Fennell tenses up. Lujan’s eyes say, unequivocally, “I’ve 
           done it before, and I’ll do it again.”

                                 KAELANI (O.S.)
                        Mr. Lujan? You okay?

           Kaelani leans out the Jeep’s open window-

                                 DAVID
                        I’ll just be a second.

           Fennell tosses over his keys. Lujan unlocks the Geo, nods at 
           the passenger-side door. Get in.

           INT. GEO PRISM - CONTINUOUS

           David climbs behind the wheel; Fennell hops into the shotgun 
           seat. They shut their doors; Lujan locks them.

                                 DAVID
                        Seatbelts.

           Fennell puts on his seatbelt, as Lujan slides the key in the 
           ignition. He twists it, and the engine wakes up: there is 
           nothing wrong with this car’s battery.
                                 FENNELL
                        Listen, I’m-

           Lujan punches him once in the gut, then once in the face, 
           before slamming his head into the dash! 

           As he wraps a seatbelt around Fennell’s neck...

                                 DAVID
                        Who the fuck are you?!

                                 FENNELL
                        I’m nobody! I’m a lawyer!

                                 DAVID
                        For who?!

                                 FENNELL
                        For no one! For myself! I just...I 
                        needed to meet you in person!

                                 DAVID
                        Are you trying to subpoena me?!

                                 FENNELL
                        No! I’m trying to work with you!

           Lujan stops choking him. Fennell pulls out a business card.

                                 FENNELL (CONT’D)
                        Randy Fennell. Two N’s, Two L’s.

           Lujan looks at the card, and begins to laugh.

           EXT. SHOULDER OF ROAD - CONTINUOUS

           Lujan climbs out of the Geo, closes the hood of his Jeep.

                                 FENNELL
                        I think Hillblom’s got more kids out 
                        there.

           David turns, as Fennell emerges behind him-

                                 FENNELL (CONT’D)
                        I’d bet my mother’s life on it.

                                 DAVID
                        That’s a pretty selfish bet.

                                 FENNELL
                        My mother’s an asshole.

           Fennell laughs; David doesn’t.
                                 FENNELL (CONT’D)
                        Look, I don’t know if you ever pledged a 
                        fraternity. I did. I’m going to assume 
                        that you didn’t, okay?
                         (pauses)
                        When you’re in a frat, you see a lot of 
                        weird shit, a lot of weird...sex shit. 
                        It’s a crash course in male depravity, 
                        and the only thing I took away from it, 
                        besides HPV, was the knowledge that a 
                        man will indulge his darkest cravings 
                        until he has reason to stop.

                                 DAVID
                        And...?

                                 FENNELL
                        You don’t pay for sex with an underage 
                        girl unless it’s what you crave, and 
                        Larry never had a reason to stop.

           David says nothing. Fennell approaches.

                                 FENNELL (CONT’D)
                        You know you’re going to end up settling 
                        this one out of court. If you and I find 
                        more of these illegitimates, who knows 
                        how much we could end up raking in? The 
                        sky is the limit. You’re taking these 
                        rich bastards for key bumps, when you 
                        could be taking them for kilos.

           A beat. Then-

                                 DAVID
                        Larry Hillblom had one son, and he is my 
                        client. This is my case. And I advise 
                        you to stay far, far away from it.

           He gets back in his car and drives off.

           INT. JEEP - CONTINUOUS

           David crushes Fennell’s card in his cup holder.

                                 KAELANI
                        Who was that man?

                                 DAVID
                        Bible salesman. Where am I dropping you 
                        two off?

                                 KAELANI
                        Your office is fine.
                                 DAVID
                        It’s late. There are no motels around my 
                        office. Where are you staying?

           Kaelani says nothing. Neither does Junior.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Hello? Where did you stay last night?

           No response. That’s when it occurs to David that he may not 
           want to know the answer to the question...

                                 DAVID (PRE-LAP) (CONT’D)
                        Bless this food for the nourishment of 
                        our bodies. Amen.

           INT. DAVID LUJAN’S HOUSE, DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           The Lujan family, plus Kaelani and Junior, pass plates of 
           food around the table. Kaelani is a model of manners and 
           etiquette, self-conscious in the middle class household.

                                 KAELANI
                        Everything smells very good. Delicious.

                                 GABBY
                        It’s just take-out I picked up on my way 
                        home from work. Lord knows, David didn’t 
                        marry me for my cooking.

                                 DAVID
                        I married her because she never laughed 
                        at my jokes. I love a challenge.

                                 KAELANI
                        And why did you marry him, Mrs. Lujan?

           Gabby chuckles at the question...

                                 GABBY
                        When I met David, he’d just come out of 
                        Juvenile Hall. He’d grown-up in brothels 
                        and gambling dens, beating people up and 
                        getting beat-up. He had a rap sheet a 
                        mile long. He was a thug.

                                 SHANNON
                        So romantic, Mom.

                                 GABBY
                        On our very first date, he looked me in 
                        the eye and said, “I’ve decided I’m 
                        going to be a lawyer.” And I-
                                 DAVID
                        She laughed in my face. True story.

                                 GABBY
                        I said, “how are you going to pull that 
                        off? You’ve got no money, no education, 
                        a criminal record.” And David, he just 
                        shrugged. He shrugged the most confident 
                        shrug that has ever been shrugged, and 
                        he said, “I’m a hard worker, and I know 
                        God.”
                         (smiles)
                        I guess I also like a challenge.

           She reaches out, squeezes David’s hand. Junior nudges Kaelani 
           and points at a BOX OF HERSHEY BARS on a nearby counter.

                                 KAELANI
                        Yes. I see those.

           He gives her the wide eyes, the puppy-dog pout...

                                 KAELANI (CONT’D)
                        Hey, you just be grateful for the food 
                        on your plate.

                                 SHANNON
                        He can totally have one after dinner.

                                 KAELANI
                        We’ll see. Why do you have so many?

                                 SHANNON
                        For school. We’re selling candy to make 
                        money for a trip to Washington, D.C.

                                 JUNIOR
                        Momma does tricks to make money.

           Thudding silence.

           Junior gazes around the table, confused: he knows he’s messed 
           up, but he isn’t sure how. Kaelani turns to him, humiliated.

                                 KAELANI
                        Momma doesn’t do tricks anymore, baby.

                                 JUNIOR
                        Oh. How will we get money, then?

                                 KAELANI
                        There...there are other ways.
                         (to David)
                        Will you excuse me, please?
                                 DAVID
                        Yeah, of course. Shannon, why don’t you 
                        show them where they’ll be sleeping?

           Shannon ushers them into the hallway, grabbing a Hershey Bar 
           off the counter as she walks out. When they’re gone, David 
           and Gabby sit quietly, eating their meals. 

           Finally, their eyes meet. Something is wordlessly translated.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        C’mon, Gab, I have a big day tomorrow.

                                 GABBY
                        I didn’t say anything.

                                 DAVID
                        They were on the street. What else was I 
                        supposed to do?

                                 GABBY
                        Get them a hotel room. Expense it.

                                 DAVID
                        It didn’t feel...proper, you know?
                         (then-)
                        Besides, their faces are all over the 
                        local news now. People are trying-

                                 GABBY
                        Honey, you’ve got a heart as big as your 
                        mouth. I love that about you. But let me 
                        be clear: there is no way in hell you’re 
                        going to guilt me into adopting a 
                        hooker.

           David starts to respond, then...thinks better of it.

           INT. DAVID LUJAN’S HOUSE, GUEST ROOM - SAME

           Kaelani slumps on a chair, as Shannon guides Junior to a bed.

                                 SHANNON
                        There’s only the one bed in here, but I 
                        think it’s big enough for you both. If 
                        not, we’ve got sleeping bags.

           BEHIND HER BACK, she slides the Hershey Bar under one of the 
           pillows, then winks at Junior.

                                 SHANNON (CONT’D)
                        I think the chocolate fairy left you a 
                        little housewarming present.
           Junior looks under the pillow, finds the candy, and gleefully 
           rips it open. Shannon walks to the door, turns to Kaelani.

                                 SHANNON (CONT’D)
                        I’m sure your left-overs will be in the 
                        ‘fridge. Towels and stuff are in the 
                        hallway closet, and-

                                 KAELANI
                        You’re very pretty.

           Shannon stops mid-sentence, caught off-guard.

                                 SHANNON
                        Thank you.

                                 KAELANI
                        How old are you?

                                 SHANNON
                        Fifteen.

                                 KAELANI
                        So pretty.

           Shannon shrugs, uncomfortable.

                                 KAELANI (CONT’D)
                        You’re lucky to have your mom and dad, 
                        you know? Blessed.

                                 SHANNON
                        I know.

                                 KAELANI
                        Where I’m from, a pretty girl like you? 
                        They’d tear your little pussy right up.

           Shannon doesn’t move an inch.

           EXT. CARLSMITH BALL LAW OFFICES - MORNING

           Nick Waechter and Pete Donnici stand outside of a two-story 
           building, comparatively sleek for Saipan. Donnici checks his 
           watch, as a familiar Jeep Wrangler pulls up.

           David and Cecilia, his paralegal/assistant, get out and walk 
           toward the men, sporting briefcases and stern expressions.

                                 WAECHTER
                        Mr. Lujan?

                                 DAVID
                        Please, call me David.
                                 WAECHTER
                        I’m Nick Waechter, president of DHL.

           They shake hands. David gestures at-

                                 DAVID
                        This is Cecilia Samai, my paralegal and 
                        all-around saving grace.

                                 WAECHTER
                        Pleasure to meet you, Cecilia.

                                 CECILIA
                        Ms. Samai is fine.

                                 WAECHTER
                        Of course, you recognize Mr. Donnici, 
                        senior partner here at Carlsmith Ball 
                        and chief counsel in the matter of the 
                        estate of Larry Lee Hillblom?

                                 DAVID
                        Of course. Mr. Donnici?

           He holds out his hand for a shake-

                                 DONNICI
                        Pete’s fine. This way.

           Donnici turns, abruptly, and leads them inside.

           INT. CARLSMITH BALL, CONFERENCE ROOM - SAME

           David and Cecilia sit side-by-side under blinding hot lights, 
           yellow legal pads and ballpoint pens at the ready. Donnici 
           and Waechter stand at the opposite end of a long table.

                                 DONNICI
                        As you’re well-aware, CNMI Superior 
                        granted you full access to our files 
                        yesterday afternoon. Now, we are more 
                        than happy to comply, but for your own 
                        sake, I do have to ask: is there any 
                        specific place you’d like to begin?

                                 DAVID
                        Wherever the bodies are buried, Pete.

           Donnici shouts into the hall-

                                 DONNICI
                        Let’s get them set-up!
           Suddenly, an army of OFFICE DRONES flood the conference room, 
           each carrying a pile of boxes overflowing with paperwork. One 
           by one, they stack these boxes on top of each other; boxes on 
           boxes on boxes on boxes, until there’s barely room to move!

           Donnici watches the action from the doorway, a gleam in his 
           eye. He’s not just giving them files, he’s overloading them: 
           this is a full-scale DOCUMENT DUMP!

           Cecilia picks up her pen and scribbles a message on her legal 
           pad. She slides it over to David, who reads it: “holy shit.”

           He scribbles a reply and slides it back: “do. not. flinch.”

           Waechter clears his throat. They look up.

                                 WAECHTER
                        Coffee?

                                 DAVID
                        Black as the night, Nick.

           Everyone smiles through grit teeth, as we segue into...

           A TIME LAPSE.

           As day turns to night, David and Cecilia pour through boxes 
           of documents: taking obscene amounts of notes, drinking 
           obscene amounts of coffee.

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:

           LATE EVENING.

           David yawns, rubs his eyes. He points to a random box.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        You do that one?

                                 CECILIA
                        Yeah. That one’s got two-or-three docs 
                        about the Air Micronesia holdings, and 
                        then a bunch of xeroxed files from...

           She points to another box-

                                 CECILIA (CONT’D)
                        ...that one mixed-in to confuse us. Plus 
                        a few files from a totally different 
                        case as a bonus “go fuck yourself.”

           Lujan puts down his legal pad.
                                 DAVID
                        What do you know, CeCe?

                                 CECILIA
                        I know these guys are criminals.

                                 DAVID
                        Can you prove it?

                                 CECILIA
                        Do I have to do everything?

           He smiles. She does, too.

                                 DAVID
                        PETE! HEY, PETEY! YOU CALL IT A NIGHT?!

           Donnici pokes his head into the room-

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        There he is. Get in here, you son of a 
                        bitch! You too, Nick!

           Donnici turns and sees that Waechter’s sidled up behind him. 
           They enter, and sit down on cardboard boxes.

                                 DONNICI
                        What can we do for-?

                                 DAVID
                        The Bank of Saipan is the executor of 
                        Hillblom’s will, right? It ultimately 
                        decides who gets his billions, his 
                        businesses. DHL. Everything.

                                 DONNICI
                        That’s correct.

                                 DAVID
                        And when Larry died, he owned roughly 
                        34% of it. Is that also correct?

                                 DONNICI
                        It is.

           David smiles, then looks down at his notes.

                                 DAVID
                        A few days ago, something called the 
                        Commonwealth Holding Corporation took 
                        out a hefty loan from DHL and used it to 
                        buy 20% of the Bank. Were you aware?
                                 DONNICI
                        Of course. The CHC is the Hillblom 
                        Estate’s holding company.

                                 DAVID
                        So you take Larry’s 34%, tack on another 
                        20%, and presto, the estate controls the 
                        bank, which controls the will, which-

                                 WAECHTER
                        It’s all perfectly legal.

                                 DAVID
                        Is it, though?

           Donnici scoffs, amazed at the audacity.

                                 DONNICI
                        Look, I don’t know what kind of law they 
                        teach at Margaritaville University, but 
                        I went to Yale, and I can assure you 
                        that whatever truffle you think you’ve 
                        sniffed out is nothing but a snout full 
                        of shit.

                                 DAVID
                        Maybe. It’s just that I had Ms. Samai 
                        run out and make a couple of calls-

                                 CECILIA
                        Texaco pay phone. Such a hike in heels.

                                 DAVID
                        And as it turns out, the board of this 
                        Commonwealth Holding Corporation is 
                        chaired by a pair of fellows named Peter 
                        Donnici and Nicholas Waechter. Fellows 
                        whom, unless we’re looking at an 
                        astounding coincidence, I’m going to go 
                        ahead and assume I’m sitting across 
                        from. And you know what that means?

                                 CECILIA
                        It means you stole millions from your 
                        dead friend to buy the Bank of Saipan 
                        for yourselves, so you could control who 
                        got every last cent of his fortune.

                                 DAVID
                        You tried to hijack his whole fucking 
                        estate. Which is very, very illegal. I’m 
                        not sure if they covered that at Yale.

           No reply. Donnici glares at him, blood boiling.
                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        I hereby request that the CHC relinquish 
                        control of the bank by noon tomorrow, or 
                        I’ll file a fraudulent practices claim 
                        with the FTC and motion for your entire 
                        team to recuse itself from this case.
                         (looks at Donnici)
                        Cool?

                                 DONNICI
                        I think we’re done. Take whatever you 
                        need. Feel free to request copies of 
                        anything else by fax or phone.

                                 DAVID
                        We haven’t discussed sampling procedure.

                                 DONNICI
                        We’ll begin at 8 AM with the approved 
                        team. Goodnight, Mr. Lujan.

                                 DAVID
                        David. Please.

           Donnici walks out. Cecilia picks up a few heavy boxes.

                                 CECILIA
                        I’m going to throw these in the Jeep.

           She exits, leaving Lujan alone with Waechter.

                                 WAECHTER
                        So, what kind of percentage do you get, 
                        if you win?

                                 DAVID
                        Less than I could, more than enough. Are 
                        you trying to bribe me now?

                                 WAECHTER
                        You don’t even realize you’re one of the 
                        bad guys, do you?

           David rolls his eyes.

                                 DAVID
                        If you expect me to cry myself to sleep 
                        because some hospital for millionaires 
                        isn’t getting its trust fund-
                                 WAECHTER
                        DHL is a multi-national conglomerate, 
                        and you’re putting its future in the 
                        hands of someone who sleeps with a night 
                        light.

                                 DAVID
                        The kid has no interest in running a 
                        corporation. He’ll be bought out 
                        immediately, and you know-

                                 WAECHTER
                        And then what? Consumer trust plummets, 
                        market share shrinks-

                                 DAVID
                        Your friend Larry-

                                 WAECHTER
                        -the company name is forever linked with 
                        bastard kids and pedophilia. Thousands 
                        of workers lose their jobs, their 
                        pensions! Families go hungry!

                                 DAVID
                        Your friend Larry-!

                                 WAECHTER
                        My friend Larry was a genius with a 
                        flawed character. But you know what? 
                        Genius trumps character. Freud was a 
                        racist! Edison was a sadist! If Jack the 
                        Ripper had invented the microwave, no 
                        one would remember the dead whores!

           Lujan chuckles to himself, then exits, shaking his head.

           EXT. LARRY’S MANSION - MORNING

           A MINI-MOTORCADE pulls into the driveway: Lujan in his Jeep, 
           Donnici and his team of lawyers in a pair of black Mercedes, 
           and a white utility van.

           A DNA SWEEP TEAM in identical uniforms piles out of the van, 
           snapping on surgical gloves and prepping sterile instruments.

                                 DAVID
                        Morning, Jo!

           Josephine appears at the door, looking anxious.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        These guys are going to come in and take 
                        a look around, okay?
           She disappears into the house.

           INT. LARRY’S MANSION, LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Josephine sits on the floor, watching daytime television, a 
           half-empty bottle of Chardonnay at her side. The Sweep Team 
           buzzes around her, plucking couch cushions with tweezers, 
           scouring carpets with magnifying glasses, etc.

           David circles the room with the SWEEP TEAM LEADER, impressed.

                                 DAVID
                        Christ, look at them go...

                                 SWEEP TEAM LEADER
                        These guys are the cream of the cheese, 
                        man. They work all the high-profile 
                        cases: O.J., Bobbitt, Buttofuco. They 
                        just got off of the Oklahoma City thing. 
                        If there’s something to find here, 
                        believe me, they’ll find it.

           They walk into...

           INT. LARRY’S MANSION, BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           It’s being inspected with the same attention to detail as the 
           living room. David and the team leader walk over to the bed, 
           which one DNA SWEEPER is shining with a blacklight.

                                 SWEEP TEAM LEADER
                        What are we looking at?

                                 DNA SWEEPER #1
                        It’s the strangest thing. Mattress is 
                        fresh out of the plastic. And the room 
                        itself is...spotless. Like the whole 
                        place was hosed down with bleach.

           David frowns, then nods at-

                                 DAVID
                        What about the closet?

                                 DNA SWEEPER #1
                        Take a look for yourself.

           Lujan walks across the bedroom, steps into-

           INT. LARRY’S MANSION, WALK-IN CLOSET - CONTINUOUS

           Larry’s little corner has been emptied out: not a single sock 
           remains. Josephine’s clothing hangs in its usual place, 
           however every last piece of it is in a dry cleaning bag.
           David takes it all in, mystified. Then, FROM DOWNSTAIRS-

                                 DNA SWEEPER #2 (O.S.)
                        Tommy?! You’ve got to see this!

           INT. LARRY’S MANSION, BATHROOM - MORNING

           A DNA Sweeper holds up several pieces of pipe he’s unscrewed 
           from beneath the sink: they are spotless, as if they just 
           came off the factory line.

                                 DNA SWEEPER #2
                        Clean as a baby’s blood test. It’s like 
                        they’ve been flushed out with acid.

                                 DAVID
                        What about his toothbrush? His comb?

                                 DNA SWEEPER #2
                        You let me know if you find them.

                                 DAVID
                        Have you ever seen anything like this?

                                 DNA SWEEPER #2
                        No, sir. I have not.

           David curses under his breath.

           INT. LARRY’S MANSION, LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Lujan plunks a folding chair down beside Josephine. He eases 
           into it, nods at her bottle of wine.

                                 DAVID
                        Five o’clock somewhere, yeah?

           She refills her glass, holds it up in a mock-toast.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        You know, my grandma had this saying. 
                        I’m sure she stole it from somewhere, 
                        but it went, “it’s foolish to tear our 
                        hair out in grief, as though our sorrow 
                        would be made less by baldness.”
                         (pauses)
                        She outlived three husbands, that woman. 
                        Died at 92 on a cruise to Alaska.

           Josephine drinks, ever defiant. David nods.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Where’d you put all his things, Jo?
                                 JOSEPHINE
                        I need to speak to my lawyer.

                                 DAVID
                        I am your lawyer.

                                 JOSEPHINE
                        For real?

                                 DAVID
                        Who got you off on that shoplifting 
                        charge? When you stole the sixer of 
                        Bartles & Jaymes?

           She nods, vaguely remembering...

                                 JOSEPHINE
                        Well, I need to find a new lawyer, and 
                        then I need to speak to him.

                                 DONNICI (O.S.)
                        Is there a problem, Josephine?

           Donnici approaches from the other side of the room.

                                 JOSEPHINE
                        He wants to know what happened to 
                        Larry’s things.

                                 DONNICI
                        Then, tell him.

                                 JOSEPHINE
                        Tell him?

                                 DONNICI
                        She burned them.

                                 DAVID
                        Bullshit.

                                 DONNICI
                        Burned them as part of a religious death 
                        rites ritual, as is customary in her 
                        area of the Philippines.

                                 DAVID
                        I’ve never heard of this “ritual”...

                                 DONNICI
                        Have you ever visited her village on the 
                        day of a funeral? No? Go figure.

           David frowns. Donnici looks down at-
                                 DONNICI (CONT’D)
                        According to Josephine, when a man dies, 
                        his loved ones burn his possessions and-

                                 DAVID
                        You’re better than this, Jo.

                                 JOSEPHINE
                        I would like to speak to a lawyer.

                                 DONNICI
                        Okay. I’m a lawyer. Let’s speak.

           He guides her out a set of sliding glass doors, toward-

           EXT. LARRY’S MANSION, SWIMMING POOL - CONTINUOUS

           Josephine and Donnici sit down in a shaded, pool-side cabana.

                                 DONNICI
                        That was great. You did great. 

           He pats her knee, then lets his hand rest there...

                                 JOSEPHINE
                        Are you my lawyer, now?

                                 DONNICI
                        Well, in a way. I’m Larry’s lawyer, and 
                        what’s good for Larry is good for you.
                         (off her look-)
                        Listen, doll, you don’t need your own 
                        lawyer. We’ve taken care of everything.

                                 JOSEPHINE
                        Larry promised things to me.

                                 DONNICI
                        And we are going to get you those 
                        things. Believe me, honey, we have your 
                        best interests at heart. But if you hire 
                        your own attorney, he’s going to bleed 
                        you dry filing claim after claim after 
                        frivolous claim, and we’ll all be tied 
                        up in court until the year 2000.
                         (chuckles)
                        Now if you sit tight, I promise, you’ll 
                        get to keep the house, the cars...maybe 
                        we can get you, say, a million dollars 
                        of walking-around money. And you won’t 
                        pay a dime in legal fees, so-

                                 JOSEPHINE
                        No.
                                 DONNICI
                        I’m sorry?

                                 JOSEPHINE
                        That is unacceptable.

           Silence. Then-

                                 DONNICI
                        Okay. What can I do to make it more-?

                                 JOSEPHINE
                        Before he died, Larry planned to liquefy 
                        his shares in the UMDA and put the sum 
                        in escrow under my name, pending certain 
                        exemptions. I have that in writing. Now, 
                        I’m happy to negotiate an alternative 
                        with you: a minority interest in Air 
                        Mike, maybe, along with the golf course 
                        in Binh Thuan? But given what I was 
                        promised, I’m not willing to accept 
                        anything less than $50 million.

                                 DONNICI
                        $50 million?

                                 JOSEPHINE
                        Yes.

           Donnici stares at her, speechless. Finally-

                                 DONNICI
                        Let’s put a pin in this and circle back.

           He walks back into the house.

           EXT. CNMI SUPERIOR COURTHOUSE - THE NEXT DAY

           Randy Fennell hops out of his Geo Prism and jogs around the 
           side of the car. He opens the back door and gingerly removes 
           something small. We can’t see what it is.

           He skips up the courthouse steps, whistling a happy tune.

                                 DONNICI (PRE-LAP)
                        Mr. Lujan has yet to produce a single 
                        shred of evidence-

           INT. CNMI SUPERIOR COURTHOUSE - SAME

           Judge Castro presides over a court room packed, once again, 
           with GAWKERS. Lujan, standing with Kaelani and Junior, and 
           Donnici argue heatedly from their benches.
                                 DAVID
                        Because you destroyed every shred of-!

                                 DONNICI
                        -a single shred of evidence to back up 
                        his claims about-

                                 DAVID
                        Your honor, the estate’s counsel has-

           Castro bangs his gavel!

                                 JUDGE CASTRO
                        One at a time, please.

                                 DAVID
                        The opposition has employed a series of 
                        illegal and fraudulent tactics in order-

                                 DONNICI
                        How much more of this are we going to be 
                        forced to listen to?! Is this is a court 
                        of law or a high school cafeteria?!

           Castro bangs his gavel, again!

           INT. CNMI SUPERIOR COURTHOUSE, CLERK’S DESK - SAME

           We track Fennell from behind as he approaches the CLERK, his 
           briefcase under one arm and...something else in the other.

                                 FENNELL
                        Randy Fennell. Two N’s, Two L’s. I’d 
                        like to file a claim.

           INT. CNMI SUPERIOR COURTHOUSE - SAME

           Donnici hands a file to the bailiff, who gives it to Castro.

                                 DONNICI
                        The estate feels that probate has been 
                        delayed long enough, and asks that the 
                        court revoke Junior Hillbroom’s status-

                                 DAVID
                        We are still collecting evidence, your 
                        honor, in an effort to locate some 
                        usable DNA. We’ve been searching Mr. 
                        Hillblom’s many homes and vehicles, 
                        we’ve been trying to track down his kin, 
                        all of whom seem to have vanished off 
                        the face of the earth. We’ve subpoenaed 
                        UC-Davies for his medical records-
                                 JUDGE CASTRO
                        And how was that subpoena received?

           No reply. David looks away.

                                 JUDGE CASTRO (CONT’D)
                        Counselor? How was that subpoena-?

                                 DAVID
                        It was ignored.

                                 JUDGE CASTRO
                        Ignored?

           Fennell, blurry, enters the back of the court and sits.

                                 DAVID
                        The UC-Davies Medical Center stands to 
                        benefit substantially from the grants in 
                        Mr. Hillblom's will. As such, it-

           And suddenly, the sound of a baby crying...

           Every head in the room swivels toward Randy Fennell, who 
           holds an infant like a running back with a football! 

                                 JUDGE CASTRO
                        Sir, I’m going to have to ask you to 
                        take your baby out of my courtroom.

                                 FENNELL
                        Hmm? Oh, ha! Not my baby, your honor. 
                        Just a baby.
                         (then-)
                        I call her Doe. Jane Doe. Not her real 
                        name, of course, but she’s trying to 
                        keep it on the low-low.

                                 JUDGE CASTRO
                        Well, she’s disrupting-

           BABY JANE DOE (aka JELLIAN CUARTERO) belches, giggles.

                                 FENNELL
                        Correction: last name, Patooty; first 
                        name, Cutie. Am I right? I mean...

                                 JUDGE CASTRO
                        Sir, do I need to have the bailiff 
                        escort you out?

                                 FENNELL
                        No, no. Of course not. I’m sorry.
           He stands, throws the baby over his shoulder.

                                 FENNELL (CONT’D)
                        I just wanted to bring her by to meet 
                        her brother.

                                 JUDGE CASTRO
                        Excuse me?

                                 FENNELL
                        Her brother, Junior Hillbroom. They’ve 
                        got the same dad.

           ...AND THE COURTROOM GOES APESHIT!

           EXT. LUJAN’S OFFICE - AFTERNOON

           NEWS VANS park outside, cameras trained on shaded windows.

                                 FENNELL (PRE-LAP)
                        Scale of one to ten, how hard is your 
                        dick right now?

           INT. LUJAN’S OFFICE - SAME

           He’s talking to Kaelani, who stares blankly back at him.

                                 FENNELL
                        ‘Cause I’m, like, crazy-stupid-turgid. I 
                        could joust with this thing.

           David peers out the window, then turns.

                                 DAVID
                        You made fools out of us.

                                 FENNELL
                        I made stars out of us. You’re Cochran, 
                        I’m Shapiro; Junior’s “the Juice,” the 
                        baby’s...I don’t know, Kato?

           ON THE FLOOR, Junior holds Baby Jane in his arms, letting her 
           grab hold of his fingers. He looks captivated.

                                 DAVID
                         (re: the baby)
                        Where’s her mother?

                                 FENNELL
                        Are we going to work together or what?

           A scuzzy grin. David nods at Kaelani.
                                 DAVID
                        I’ll be right back.

           He opens his office door, waves Fennell into-

           INT. LUJAN’S OFFICE, WAITING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Daylight peeks through the blind slats of an otherwise dark 
           room. Cecilia sits at her desk, answering a never-ending 
           stream of phone calls.

                                 CECILIA (ON PHONE) 
                        David Lujan’s office? We have no comment 
                        at this time.

                        David Lujan’s office? We have no com-

           Fennell struts in. David closes the door behind him.

                                 DAVID
                        Where is the baby’s mother?

                                 FENNELL
                        Buy me a shot first, sailor. Jeez.

           He spins around, rubs his palms together-

                                 FENNELL (CONT’D)
                        Look, I’m gonna tell you everything, but 
                        first, I want a guarantee that-

           Lujan rips the cord out of Cecilia’s phone and lunges at him!

                                 FENNELL (CONT’D)
                        She’s in Manila!

                                 DAVID
                        How did you find her?!

                                 FENNELL
                        Why are you such a bully?!

           Lujan raises the phone receiver to bludgeon him-

                                 FENNELL (CONT’D)
                        She found me! Fuck!

           NOTE: The following story is told in QUICK-POP FLASHBACKS.

           EXT. RED LIGHT DISTRICT, MANILA - FLASHBACK

           Fennell walks down a filthy, cluttered street, as very-young, 
           barely-clothed FILIPINA GIRLS beckon suggestively to him from 
           bars, nightclubs, and storefront windows.
                                 FENNELL (V.O.)
                        When you assaulted me in my Geo Prism, I 
                        realized that I might be on my own. So, 
                        I called up Delta, and I booked a trip 
                        to all of the sex tourism hotspots I 
                        could get to using miles. Thailand, 
                        Vietnam, the Philippines...

           He looks around, noticing that the streets are full of WHITE 
           MEN, grabbing and groping the girls.

           INT. MASSAGE PARLOR, HO CHI MINH CITY - FLASHBACK

           Fennell walks through a bar filled with off-duty “MASSEUSES.” 
           Through beaded curtains, he can easily see into rooms where 
           various sex acts are being performed.

                                 FENNELL (V.O.)
                        Then, I printed up flyers with Larry’s 
                        face on them: “Have You Balled This Man? 
                        Did You Reproduce? If So, You May Be 
                        Entitled To A Small Settlement.” And I 
                        posted them everywhere snatch was sold.

           He tacks a FLYER (featuring LARRY HILLBLOM’S FACE) to the 
           wall beside the ladies’ room.

           INT. COYOTE CLUB, BANGKOK - FLASHBACK

           Two hundred YOUNG THAI GIRLS, wearing the exact same tiny 
           outfit, perform a synchronized dance on a big stage. MALE 
           CLIENTS point and beckon at the ones they like.

           Fennell sits at a table with three COYOTE GIRLS, who shout 
           over each other, the flyer laid out in front of them.

                                 FENNELL (V.O.)
                        It didn’t take long for girls to start 
                        coming out of the woodwork. Lots of 
                        them. I mean, it was like-

                                 DAVID (PRE-LAP)
                        Cinderella?

           INT. LUJAN’S OFFICE, WAITING ROOM - PRESENT

           Fennell wrinkles his brow, confused. David shakes his head. 

                                 DAVID
                        Tell me, CeCe: how many ladies tried to 
                        get their foot in the glass slipper 
                        before the Prince found Cinderella?
                                 CECILIA
                        So many. All the ladies in the kingdom.

                                 DAVID
                        That’s why I pay you the big bucks.

           Cecilia puts her feet up on her desk, shines her knuckles.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                         (to Fennell)
                        You put a billion dollars on a piece of 
                        paper and said, “any takers?” Shit, I’m 
                        surprised my wife didn’t call you.

                                 FENNELL
                        Not all of these girls were liars.

                                 DAVID
                        How do you know?

                                 FENNELL
                        Because I’m a liar, and liars know the 
                        truth when they hear it: it’s like 
                        giving a fat kid diet soda.
                         (then-)
                        The baby’s mom is named Julie Cuartero. 
                        She met Hillblom last year at this spot 
                        in Manila, the Opal Club. He took her 
                        back to his place and raped her on an 
                        air mattress.

                                 CECILIA
                        Oh, Jesus-

                                 FENNELL
                        A few months later, she saw him again, 
                        and told him she was pregnant. He threw 
                        a hundred dollars in her face and told 
                        her to get an abortion.

           David puts his hand on Cecilia’s shoulder.

                                 FENNELL (CONT’D)
                        She ran away scared, and moved in with 
                        some family in an outer province, where 
                        she and her little girl now “live in 
                        shame.” Her words, not mine.
                         (pauses)
                        I know the truth when I hear it.

           A quiet moment. It’s a brutal story.

                                 DAVID
                        Why isn’t she here with you?
                                 FENNELL
                        Who? The mother?
                         (then-)
                        Well, I didn’t need to pay for an extra 
                        plane ticket, right? I mean, the baby’s 
                        got all the money DNA.

                                 CECILIA
                        So, you just took away her child?!

                                 FENNELL
                        She gave it to me! I’m on a budget!

           His eyes dart toward David, in search of an ally-

                                 FENNELL (CONT’D)
                        I’m going to give it back!

                                 DAVID
                        Get out of my office.

                                 FENNELL
                        Wait! Listen!

           David walks toward him, ready to bludgeon.

                                 FENNELL (CONT’D)
                        I wasn’t going to mention this until we 
                        made our partnership official, but I’ve 
                        got a pretty good line on another baby.

                                 DAVID
                        What kind of man are you?

                                 FENNELL
                        I’m thinking these DHL bastards have got 
                        to want to settle now that we’ve got two 
                        little Larrys, right? They have to. So, 
                        we let’em lowball us, take a small cut 
                        for Junior, a small cut for Baby Jane, 
                        pretend we’re shitty pigs, and then-
                         (fist-pumps)
                        BAM! We shove a fresh baby right up 
                        their assholes! Take them for all 
                        they’re worth!

           Silence. He meets Lujan’s gaze.

           EXT. LUJAN’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Fennell is tossed to the pavement like a drunk at last call. 
           He looks up, just as his briefcase flies out the door and 
           lands on his head.
           He stands, dusts himself off, nods at the gathered press. And 
           then, Junior walks out behind him, Baby Jane in his arms.

                                 JUNIOR
                        Take care of my sister, okay?

           He hands the baby to Fennell, who’s caught off-guard.

                                 FENNELL
                        Yeah. Of course.

           Junior scurries back into the office.

           INT. HYATT PENTHOUSE SUITE, BEDROOM - NIGHT

           On a neatly made hotel bed, Waechter is ridden to orgasm by 
           the BAR GIRL he was dancing with after Larry’s memorial.

           She climbs off of him and begins to get dressed. He throws on 
           a robe, pulls his wallet from a pair of pants on the floor, 
           and takes out some cash.

                                 WAECHTER
                        Here.

                                 BAR GIRL
                        Oh, I...no.

           She holds up her palms. She doesn’t want any money.

                                 WAECHTER
                        Please. I insist.

                                 BAR GIRL
                        No. Thank you.

                                 WAECHTER
                        Take it.

                                 BAR GIRL
                        I don’t-

                                 WAECHTER
                        Take it.

           He shoves the cash in her hand. She stares at him.

                                 WAECHTER (CONT’D)
                        I’m married.

           IN THE NEXT ROOM, a knock...
           INT. HYATT PENTHOUSE SUITE, LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Waechter opens the door, and the girl slips into the hotel 
           hallway past Donnici, who watches her walk to the elevator...

                                 DONNICI
                        Your wife get some work done, Nicky?

           Waechter ignores the jab, walks to the bar.

                                 WAECHTER
                        Something to drink?

           He pours himself a scotch. Donnici closes the door.

                                 DONNICI
                        San Francisco wants to make an offer to 
                        settle. A few million up front, a small 
                        monthly stipend for life: $40, $50 G’s-

           Waechter hops up on a bar stool-

                                 WAECHTER
                        That’s foolish.

                                 DONNICI
                        Your penis.

                                 WAECHTER
                        I don’t follow?

                                 DONNICI
                        I can see your penis.

           Waechter crosses his legs, still naked under his robe.

                                 WAECHTER
                        Lujan would never take that deal, and 
                        you know it. He’d see it as a slap in 
                        the face.

           Donnici sighs, slumps into an armchair.

                                 DONNICI
                        Two kids?

                                 WAECHTER
                        I don’t want to talk about it.

                                 DONNICI
                        Two kids?

                                 WAECHTER
                        This wasn’t a kid. It was a baby.
                                 DONNICI
                        What’s the difference?

                                 WAECHTER
                        Babies are babies: that’s the 
                        difference! They all look like 
                        fucking...babies!

                                 DONNICI
                        I honestly have no idea what you’re-

                                 WAECHTER
                        I’m saying, who the hell knows, you 
                        know? Some asshole brought a baby to 
                        court...so what?! Could’ve been his 
                        baby, could’ve been your baby-

                                 DONNICI
                        Drink your cocktail.

           Waechter pounds his drink. A tense beat.

                                 DONNICI (CONT’D)
                        You’ve got to come clean now, okay? 
                        About Larry. I know you loved him. I 
                        know he gave you the world. But he is 
                        dragging you down to hell.

           Waechter opens his mouth, and nothing comes out. Donnici 
           walks to the bar, refills his glass, pours one of his own.

                                 DONNICI (CONT’D)
                        Nick, listen to me...when paradise fell, 
                        nobody stood by the snake. 

           He clinks their glasses together, takes his drink down.

                                 WAECHTER
                        He was sick, Pete.

                                 DONNICI
                        Sick how?

                                 WAECHTER
                        He liked them young. Fourteen, fifteen. 
                        He’d buy them from brothels, sometimes 
                        straight from their families, with the 
                        promise that...that they’d never...
                         (pauses)
                        Cherry girls, they were called. Larry, 
                        you know, he was a hypochondriac, and 
                        when the AIDS-thing hit in the ‘80s-
                                 DONNICI
                        We all started using condoms.

                                 WAECHTER
                        Not Larry. He started buying virgins.

           Silence. Waechter gulps his liquor like water.

                                 DONNICI
                        How many were there?

                                 WAECHTER
                        Oh, God. Hundreds. Hundreds.

                                 DONNICI
                        Did he father any other children?

                                 WAECHTER
                        I honestly don’t know. He’d joke about 
                        it sometimes, when he drank. “I’ve got 
                        no kids...that I know of,” and then he’d 
                        wink. Or he’d say, “I always tell the 
                        girls I’m JFK Junior, in case I slip one 
                        past the goalie and they come looking-”

           Suddenly, the sound of a machine whirring...

           IN THE CORNER, a FAX MACHINE begins to print a document. They 
           walk over to it, and Waechter scans the cover page.

                                 WAECHTER (CONT’D)
                        What in God’s fucking name-?

           OVER HIS SHOULDER, we can just make out the heading-

           TO: Members of the Print & Television Media
           FROM: Randy H. Fennell, Esq.
           RE: Nicholas Waechter; Peter Donnici; Carlsmith-Ball, Inc.

           FOR IMMEDIATE DISSEMINATION.

           EXT. SURF LODGE - DAY

           Fennell stands outside a cheap motel, cradling Baby Jane in 
           his arm. Her mother, JULIE CUARTERO (17, Filipina), stands 
           beside him, spooked by the PRESS MOB that surrounds her.

           A REPORTER waves a copy of Fennell’s fax in the air-

                                 REPORTER #1
                        You make a lot of incendiary accusations 
                        in this document, Mister...?
                                 FENNELL
                        Fennell. Two N’s, two L’s. I say nothing 
                        I can’t back up with hard evidence.

                                 REPORTER #1
                        So, you have proof that employees of 
                        Larry Hillblom, including Nicholas 
                        Waechter and Peter Donnici-

                                 FENNELL
                        -especially Waechter and Donnici-

                                 REPORTER #1
                        -actively procured minors with whom he 
                        had sexual intercourse?

                                 REPORTER #2
                        What about these allegations that your 
                        client, Ms. Jane Doe, was, and I quote, 
                        “roughed up by goons hired by Nick 
                        Waechter” at the Manila airport?

           Fennell puts his hand on Julie’s back-

                                 FENNELL
                        Honey, I know this is painful, but can 
                        you show them the bruise?

           Julie pulls up the sleeve of her tee-shirt, and the reporters 
           all simultaneously lean toward her shoulder...

           A beat. Fennell glances at her arm.

                                 FENNELL (CONT’D)
                        Okay, well, it’s faded a bit. You should 
                        have seen it yesterday, though.

                                                           CUT TO:

           INT. CNMI SUPERIOR COURTHOUSE - DAY

           Fennell lifts Julie’s shirt sleeve, as Judge Castro leans in 
           and squints at her shoulder.

                                 FENNELL
                        It’s a bit faded. You should’ve seen it 
                        a few days ago. It was, like...wow.

           Donnici shakes Fennell’s fax at Castro, furious.
                                 DONNICI
                        Your honor, it is evident, from the most 
                        cursory reading of this affidavit, that 
                        it is a vicious compilation of hearsay, 
                        double hearsay, triple hearsay, gesture, 
                        conjecture, and absolutely no fact-

                                 FENNELL
                        One must rely on hearsay and unnamed 
                        sources when people are scared to 
                        implicate themselves.

                                 DONNICI
                        It’s libelous. It’s repulsive. It’s just 
                        plain...weird! It’s a weird document, 
                        and I motion that it be struck from the 
                        record immediately.

                                 DAVID
                        Your honor, I’ll second that motion.

                                 JUDGE CASTRO
                        You will?

           Donnici looks at Lujan, stunned. He holds up Fennell’s fax.

                                 DAVID
                        This is a waste of time. It’s not even a 
                        clever waste of time, either. It’s like 
                        the People Magazine crossword.

                                 FENNELL
                        With all due respect-

                                 DAVID
                        I mean, you accuse these guys of leaking 
                        Baby Jane Doe’s real name to the press, 
                        in order to “instigate her kidnapping”?

                                 FENNELL
                        That’s right. It’s unconscionable.

                                 DAVID
                        Why would anyone want to kidnap her now? 
                        Who would that serve? Whatever kidnapper 
                        decides to abduct this child before 
                        she’s declared Larry Hillblom’s child is 
                        the most stupid kidnapper of all time.

           No reply. Fennell just stares.

                                 JUDGE CASTRO
                        Mr. Fennell, would you care to respond?
                                 FENNELL
                        There are stupid kidnappers out there, 
                        your honor, contrary to what Mr. Lujan 
                        thinks.

           As David takes his seat, Nick Waechter catches his eye, and 
           gives him the slightest of nods. A sign of respect.

           INT. LUJAN’S OFFICE - LATER

           Junior tickles Baby Jane’s belly on the floor, as Lujan and 
           Fennell argue by the window.

                                 FENNELL
                        You fucked me!

                                 DAVID
                        You fucked yourself.

                                 FENNELL
                        Then why aren’t I smiling!

           BESIDE DAVID’S DESK, Kaelani and Julie passive-aggressively 
           bicker while watching their children.

                                 KAELANI
                        All I’m saying is you seem like a nice 
                        girl, and you’ve got a cute-ass little 
                        baby, but we ain’t taking a penny less 
                        just ‘cause you all popped up.

                                 JULIE
                        Oh, that’s all you’re saying?

                                 KAELANI
                        That’s all I’m saying. You do you. We do 
                        us.

                                 JULIE
                        Oh, that’s all you’re saying?

                                 KAELANI
                        That’s all I’m saying.

           ON LUJAN AND FENNELL, still going at it.

                                 DAVID
                        I mean, what was the plan, here? Were 
                        you just trying to get on TV?
                                 FENNELL
                        I was going to shame them into settling. 
                        Throw a bit of chum in the water for the 
                        media, make the motherfuckers look like 
                        the motherfuckers they are, have’em pay 
                        me to shut up, and then spring another 
                        Hillblom baby on them.

           A quiet moment. David looks him up and down.

                                 DAVID
                        In court, I implied you weren’t clever.

                                 FENNELL
                        You said I was a People Magazine 
                        crossword.

                                 DAVID
                        I was wrong.

           A slow nod. It’s clear Fennell appreciates hearing this.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        But there’s something you need to get 
                        through your head: this idea that 
                        there’s no such thing as bad publicity? 
                        It doesn’t apply in the court room, 
                        especially in a case like this. Public 
                        opinion matters, and if you start lying 
                        to the press, it is going to turn on 
                        you. Team David will start rooting for 
                        Team Goliath, and we will be crushed 
                        like cockroaches. Do you understand?

                                 FENNELL
                        We?

                                 CECILIA (O.S.)
                        David-?

           And suddenly, silence.

           IN THE DOORWAY, Cecilia stands next to a young Filipina girl, 
           with braces on her teeth and a baby in her arms.

           This is MERCEDES FELICIANO (15). Her daughter is MERCEDITA.

           EXT. CNMI LEGISLATURE - AFTERNOON

           A ranch-style building tucked into an old sugar cane field, 
           surrounded by a cluster of smaller bungalows.
           INT. CNMI LEGISLATURE, LOBBY - SAME

           Waechter gazes up at a unstable ceiling fan, his foot tapping 
           restlessly. Donnici glances at him from over the top of a 
           Hammacher Schlemmer catalogue.

                                 DONNICI
                        You alright?

                                 WAECHTER
                        What? Yeah. Yeah.

           REP. ROBERT INOS (60’s) steps out of a hallway, all-smiles.

                                 INOS
                        Gentlemen, sorry to keep you waiting.

           INT. REP. INOS’ OFFICE - LATER

           Inos sits at a desk featuring a plaque that says “Rep. Robert 
           F. Inos, CNMI.” He proudly shows Donnici and Waechter a PHOTO 
           of himself and Larry, in a “Three Stooges”-pose: Hillblom in 
           his judges’ robe, bonking Inos on the head with a gavel.

                                 INOS
                        I broke this one out when I heard you 
                        were coming. Two crazy kids having fun.

                                 WAECHTER
                        It’s a great picture, Bob.

                                 INOS
                        He was a good judge, you know? Sure, he 
                        had his own agendas. But even so, he 
                        couldn’t ever bring himself to say 
                        something he knew was wrong, even when 
                        it was in his best interest. His ego was 
                        like a trip wire for his brain.

           Inos looks at the photo for a few seconds longer...

                                 DONNICI
                        I’m sure you’ve heard by now that 
                        Larry’s estate is under siege.

                                 INOS
                        Terrible. Cowardly. To go after a man 
                        when he isn’t alive to defend himself.

                                 DONNICI
                        That’s exactly why we need your help.

           Donnici pulls a file out of his briefcase, slides it to Inos.
                                 DONNICI (CONT’D)
                        We need you to get this bill through the 
                        legislature.

           Inos opens the file, begins to read. His eyes widen.

                                 INOS
                        You can’t be serious.

           Donnici glances at Nick, raises his eyebrows-

                                 WAECHTER
                        It’s what Larry would’ve wanted, Bob.

                                 INOS
                        But, this is...it’s totally transparent.
                         (reading)
                        “In order for a child to lay claim on an 
                        inheritance, his or her father must have 
                        openly and notoriously acknowledged the 
                        child as his child prior to his death by 
                        taking the child into his home, unless a 
                        custodial agreement dictates otherwise.”

                                 DONNICI
                        We think it’s tough, but fair.

                                 INOS
                        “DNA evidence is legally inadmissable as 
                        proof of paternity.” We’re anti-science 
                        now?

                                 DONNICI
                        We can amend some of the language, but 
                        time is of the essence. We need you to 
                        get this passed by end of the day 
                        tomorrow.

                                 INOS
                        And you honestly expect the governor to 
                        sign this?

                                 DONNICI
                        Do you have any idea what Larry did for 
                        the economy of the Marianas? The man is 
                        more than due. We believe the governor 
                        understands that.

           A beat. Donnici nudges-

                                 WAECHTER
                        We’ve got to put the cork in the bottle, 
                        Bob. We don’t know how many more of 
                        these girls are out there.
                                 INOS
                         (sighs)
                        Fellas, I’m sorry, but having to take a 
                        kid into your home to prove paternity? I 
                        mean, what if the father dies before 
                        it’s born? What if he moves away?

                                 DONNICI
                        If we removed that language, would you 
                        be willing to work with us?

           A moment of thought, then-

                                 INOS
                        Hey, whatever happened to that DeLorean 
                        I used to see Larry cruising around in? 
                        That’s a beautiful damned car.

           Donnici smiles. Waechter doesn’t.

                                 DAVID (PRE-LAP)
                        Bless this food for the nourishment of 
                        our bodies. Amen.

           INT. DAVID LUJAN’S HOUSE, DINING ROOM - EVENING

           An awkward hush, as dinner is passed around an uncomfortably 
           crowded table. On one side, David sits beside Shannon and 
           Gabby; on the other, Fennell sits by Julie and Baby Jane. 
           Kaelani and Junior squeeze together at far end, while 
           Mercedes cradles Mercedita at the near end.

           David tries (and fails) to make small talk with his daughter.

                                 DAVID
                        So, did the nuns break out the rulers 
                        today, kiddo?

                                 SHANNON
                        What rulers?

                                 DAVID
                        The rulers. You know, to hit you?

                                 SHANNON
                         (taken aback)
                        You’re asking if the nuns at my school 
                        beat me with rulers?

           Junior tugs on Kaelani’s arm as she serves him-

                                 JUNIOR
                        I don’t like carrots.
                                 KAELANI
                        Eat what I put on your plate, Junior.

                                 JUNIOR
                        But I don’t eat orange things.

                                 KAELANI
                        That’s not true. You eat clementines, 
                        you eat creamsicles, you eat Twinkies-

                                 JULIE
                        Twinkies are yellow.

                                 JUNIOR
                        Twinkies are yellow though, Momma.

                                 KAELANI
                         (to Julie)
                        Why don’t you mind your business?

                                 JULIE
                        Why don’t you learn your colors?

           Fennell, sensing trouble, puts his hand on Julie’s arm.

                                 FENNELL
                        Okay, ladies, we’re guests in-

                                 KAELANI
                        Do you have a problem with me?

           Suddenly, MERCEDES’ BABY STARTS CRYING-

           She picks her daughter up, rocks her back and forth. Somehow, 
           it eases tensions.

                                 SHANNON
                        What’s her name?

                                 MERCEDES
                        Mercedita Feliciano. Hillblom.

           Her face flickers with emotion at the surname. Gabby notices.

                                 GABBY
                        That child’s all yours, honey. You’re 
                        her moon and stars.

                                 MERCEDES
                        Yes. I know.
                         (pauses)
                        We were going to be married.

           Silence. No one knows how to respond to that.
                                 DAVID
                        You and...Larry Hillblom?

                                 MERCEDES
                        Yes.

                                 DAVID
                        He told you this?

           A girlish nod.

                                 MERCEDES
                        Thank you so much for the food.

           David nods back. Everyone looks at their plates.

                                 SHANNON
                        Where are you from, Mercedes?

                                 MERCEDES
                        Paranaque, in Manila. It’s not such a 
                        nice place.

                                 FENNELL
                        Yeah, I’ve been there. It’s, uh-

           He shakes his head, repulsed by the memory.

                                 MERCEDES
                        I dance in the club with my sister. It’s 
                        not such a nice club, but the other club 
                        say I look too young. So I dance in this 
                        club. And all of the men, they try and 
                        talk to me. They say, “Such a pretty 
                        girl, so graceful.” But I say, “Shoo, 
                        fly. Go away. You have no money.”

           She giggles. Everyone stares at her.

                                 MERCEDES (CONT’D)
                        But then one night, Larry come into the 
                        club, and he have lots of money, and he 
                        talk to me. He ask, “do I still have my 
                        cherry?” And I say yes. And he say, “can 
                        I have?” And I say, “we have to ask my 
                        family, silly.”

                                 GABBY
                        Excuse me.

           Gabby gets up and walks out of the room. Kaelani whispers 
           something in Junior’s ear, and he runs out after her.
                                 MERCEDES
                        So, we go to the chicken restaurant, and 
                        my mother and my father is there. And 
                        they say, “Mercedes, did you make money 
                        tonight?” And Larry say, “I would like 
                        to buy her cherry.” And then, 
                        they...they say yes. Okay.
                         (pauses)
                        So, we go to the hotel. And Larry and 
                        me, we go to the bedroom. And Mommy and 
                        Daddy, they wait on the couch.

           Mercedes stops speaking; she stares into space.

           Then, Kaelani stands, walks over to her, and kisses the top 
           of her head. She puts two hands on her shoulders.

                                 MERCEDES (CONT’D)
                        I get pregnant, but still I dance in the 
                        club with my sister. It make me look 
                        older, they say. I see Larry next time 
                        he’s in Manila, and he say he love me. 
                        He say he going to marry me. He say he 
                        going to take care of everything.
                         (pauses)
                        And then, he die.

           Julie walks over to Mercedes and puts her head in her lap.

           INT. DAVID LUJAN’S HOUSE, BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

           David lays in bed with Gabby, sleeping. The phone on the 
           night stand rings, and he answers-

                                 DAVID (ON PHONE)
                        Hello?
                         (listens-)
                        You’re kidding. Yes, goddammit! Yes!

           He hangs up, and jumps out of bed. Gabby sits up, as he pulls 
           a suitcase out of the closet.

                                 GABBY
                        What’s going on?

                                 DAVID
                        They found a mole. We’ve got a mole!

           Gabby furrows her brow, then falls back on her pillow.
           INT. DAVID LUJAN’S HOUSE, GUEST ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Kaelani, Mercedes, and Julie doze in a sort of pig-pile with 
           their respective offspring. David tiptoes into the room, 
           picks up a sleeping Junior, and shakes Kaelani awake.

                                 DAVID
                        You ever been to California?

           Kaelani rubs her eyes. Then, she smiles.

           EXT. GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE - MORNING

           Kaelani gazes out of a taxi as it drives over the landmark.

                                 JUNIOR (PRE-LAP)
                        I still don’t get it, though.

           INT. TAXI - SAME

           David struggles to explain a complex concept to Junior.

                                 DAVID
                        Well, you and your father share the same 
                        genetic, uh...the same, you know, DNA...

           Kaelani rolls her eyes.

                                 KAELANI
                        Baby, your daddy was stupid, okay?

                                 JUNIOR
                        Okay.

                                 KAELANI
                        He was stupid, and he liked to crash 
                        things: cars, motorcycles, airplanes. 
                        The dummy would crash anything he could 
                        get his hands on, and he’d end up really 
                        hurt, so he’d always have to go to the 
                        doctor.

                                 JUNIOR
                        In California?

                                 KAELANI
                        In California.

                                 JUNIOR
                        Why?

                                 KAELANI
                        ‘Cause that’s where rich people go to 
                        the doctor.
           Junior nods. Makes sense.

                                 KAELANI (CONT’D)
                        Anyway, the last time your dad got hurt, 
                        they noticed a mole on his face.

                                 JUNIOR
                        What’s a mole?

                                 KAELANI
                        It’s like an ugly little dot the color 
                        of a poop. And sometimes, it can make 
                        you sick, so the doctors cut the mole 
                        off and put it in the refrigerator.

                                 JUNIOR
                        Really? Why?

                                 KAELANI
                        People do crazy things. Why’d you put 
                        potato chips in the microwave?

                                 JUNIOR
                        To make french fries.

                                 KAELANI
                        That mole is all we got left of your dad 
                        now. And because you two got the same-

                        DAVID
                                                    KAELANI
           -genes-
                                          -blood-

           Kaelani looks at David, puts a finger over her lips-

                                 KAELANI (CONT’D)
                        -they can use it to prove you came from 
                        him. Understand?

           Junior nods, again. David smiles.

           INT. UC-DAVIES MEDICAL CENTER, EXAMINATION ROOM - DAY

           Kaelani holds Junior’s hand, as a NURSE draws his blood.

                                 NURSE
                        Such a brave boy. Just a bit more, and 
                        you get a special treat.

           She whips an ORANGE LOLLIPOP out of her pocket.

                                 JUNIOR
                         (shakes his head)
                        Sorry, I don’t do orange.
           INT. UC-DAVIES MEDICAL CENTER, CONFERENCE ROOM - SAME

           Lujan sits opposite five sharply-dressed LAWYERS, silent. A 
           PATHOLOGIST enters in a lab coat, carrying a MEDICAL SAMPLE 
           in a container the size of a thimble.

                                 PATHOLOGIST
                        Hey, hi, sorry I’m late. Dad duty. I had 
                        to take my son to football practice.

           He walks around the table, shaking every hand.

                                 PATHOLOGIST (CONT’D)
                        I hear we’ve got our blood work done, so 
                        if there aren’t any objections-
                         (holds up sample)
                        -I’m going to throw this sucker in a 
                        petrie dish and get cracking on the 
                        RFLP?

                                 DAVID
                        Could I have a look at the sample, real 
                        quick?

           The pathologist glances at the opposing lawyers. They nod.

           Lujan takes the sample container, squints to read the label 
           on the side of it. He frowns, then opens up a file on the 
           table in front of him.

                                 LAWYER #1
                        Is something wrong?

                                 DAVID
                        This file I’m looking at, it’s Larry 
                        Hillblom’s original pathology report, 
                        and it states that his tissue sample 
                        number is DMC-69775.

           David holds up the sample he’s just been handed-

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        This is sample number DMC-69755.

           He slides the file and sample over to the pathologist, who 
           dutifully inspects them.

                                 PATHOLOGIST
                        Huh. That’s...huh. I’ll be right back.

           He grabs the sample and exits.

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:
           TITLE CARD: Thirty Minutes Later...

           David, joined now by Kaelani and Junior, continues to stare 
           down the five opposing attorneys.

           Suddenly, the pathologist breezes into the room, and slaps a 
           new medical sample down on the table!

                                 PATHOLOGIST (CONT’D)
                        Heeeeeeeeeeeere’s Larry!

           A quiet moment. Lujan buttons his blazer.

                                 DAVID
                        Did the kid at least get a lolli out of 
                        the deal?

                                 JUNIOR
                        They only had orange.

                                 DAVID
                        Motherfuckers.

                                 KAELANI
                         (to Junior)
                        Don’t say that word.

                                 PATHOLOGIST
                         (re: sample)
                        I can assure you we’ve found the correct-

                                 DAVID
                        What you’ve found is a reason for the 
                        court to toss any genetic evidence we 
                        take from this facility.

                                 PATHOLOGIST
                        I’m not sure I understand.

                                 DAVID
                        Tell your son it was 4th and Goal, and 
                        you fumbled the mole. He’ll explain.

           He walks to the door; Kaelani and Junior follow. On the way 
           out, he pauses, and looks back into the conference room.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Remind me, how many hundreds of millions 
                        did Larry Hillblom leave this hospital? 
                        Several, right? More than several?
                         (pauses)
                        A pay day like that, I’d imagine you’d 
                        do all sorts of sleazy shit not to lose. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        I’d imagine money like that could make a 
                        good man lick the bottom of the bowl.

           The pathologist gulps, looks away.

           INT. UC-DAVIES MEDICAL CENTER, HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           As David walks to the elevator, a RECEPTIONIST stops him.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Mr. Lujan? You’ve got a call.

           He steps over to her desk, picks up the phone-

                                 DAVID
                        Hello? Hey, CeCe.
                         (listens-)
                        WHAT?!

                                                     SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. CNMI SENATE, VIEWING GALLERY - AFTERNOON

           A free-standing sign reads: “Quiet! Senate In Session.”

           Two benches face a window, which looks into a SENATE HEARING 
           ROOM. On one bench, Donnici, Waechter, and Inos sit together; 
           on the other, Cecilia sits beside Randy Fennell.

           INT. CNMI SENATE - SAME

           NINE SENATORS huddle around a table in a cramped, sweltering 
           room. Seated at the head, a LEADER addresses the body.

                                 SENATE LEADER
                        The chamber will now vote on HB-147, 
                        commonly known as the “Hillblom Bill,” 
                        which passed the House this morning with 
                        a bipartisan majority. All in favor, say 
                        “aye.” All against, say “nay.”

           She looks at the first SENATOR to her right- 

                                 SENATE LEADER (CONT’D)
                        Senator Sablan?

                                 SENATOR SABLAN
                        Aye.

           She looks at-

                                 SENATE LEADER
                        Senator Puno?
                                 SENATOR PUNO
                        Aye.

           She looks at-

                                 SENATE LEADER
                        Senator Villanueva?

                                 SENATOR VILLANUEVA
                        Nay.

                                                           CUT TO:

           EXT. CNMI LEGISLATURE - MOMENTS LATER

           A familiar Jeep speeds up the street and skids to a halt in 
           front of the legislature, just as Waechter and Donnici exit 
           toward a waiting Mercedes.

           Lujan hops out of his car, as Cecilia leaves the building. He 
           raises his eyebrows at her, desperate for good news. 

           She shakes her head. None to be found.

           His jaw hardens. His posture sinks. 

           And then, he strides up behind Waechter, spins him around, 
           and CLOCKS HIM ACROSS THE FACE!

           He pounces on him and continues punching-

                                 DAVID
                        HOW CAN YOU DO THIS?! HOW CAN YOU DO 
                        THIS TO US?!

           Waechter doesn’t fight back. He takes the beating.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        HOW CAN YOU DO THIS TO US?!

                                 WAECHTER
                        I don’t know.

           Finally, Donnici pulls David off of Waechter, and throws him 
           into the dirt. When he rolls over, Fennell stands above him-

                                 FENNELL
                         (to Cecilia)
                        I’ve got him. Take his car.

           Cecilia jumps into the Jeep. Fennell pulls David to his feet.
           INT. “DIRTY LARRY’S” BAR & GRILL - EVENING

           Paper towels wrapped around his bloody knuckles, Lujan drinks 
           with Fennell at Hillblom’s beachfront restaurant.

                                 FENNELL
                        I’m just going to come out and say it: 
                        you’ve got to do something about the 
                        temper.

                                 DAVID
                        I don’t have a temper.

                                 FENNELL
                        Tae-bo, rollerblade, freebase-

                                 DAVID
                        I don’t have a temper.

           Fennell raises his eyebrows. David sighs.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        A good man goes to prison for...I don’t 
                        know, vehicular manslaughter. He didn’t 
                        mean to kill anybody, but he was drunk, 
                        and now he’s got to do real time. So, 
                        they throw him in gen-pop, with a celly 
                        serving decades for armed robbery, a 
                        mean SOB. And every day for a year, he 
                        gets beaten and raped in his own bed.
                         (pauses)
                        So, he makes a shiv out of a toothbrush, 
                        and one sticky summer night, he jams it 
                        in his cellmate’s carotid. Then, he does 
                        it eleven more times, for peace of mind. 
                        Now this good man’s a stone-cold killer.

           Josephine enters, sits down at the bar.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Heya, JoJo! Where you been, girl?!

           He turns back to Fennell, who looks extremely disturbed.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        It is rational to respond irrationally 
                        to irrational things. Any lawyer worth 
                        his degree should understand that.

                                 FENNELL
                        Rational, maybe. Doesn’t make it smart.

                                 DAVID
                        I don’t have a temper, kid.
           Lujan finishes his drink. A beat, then-

                                 FENNELL
                        So, is the guy still in prison, or-?

                                 DAVID
                        What? No. I made that guy up.

                                 JOSEPHINE (O.S.)
                        May I sit with you?

           Josephine stands above them, holding her usual glass of wine.

                                 DAVID
                        Of course.

           David pulls up a chair, and she sits.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        How’s it been, lately?

                                 JOSEPHINE
                         (shrugs)
                        You know. It’s a big house.

                                 DAVID
                        And how are they treating you?

                                 JOSEPHINE
                        They don’t return my phone calls.

                                 DAVID
                        Well, that’s not good, Jo. Doesn’t sound 
                        like they’ve got your best interests at 
                        heart.

           She takes a long sip of her wine.

                                 JOSEPHINE
                        The boy from Palau is Larry’s son.

                                 DAVID
                        We think so, yeah.

                                 JOSEPHINE
                        I know so.

           Fennell leans forward, excited. Lujan motions for calm.

                                 JOSEPHINE (CONT’D)
                        Larry used to make jokes. He’d call the 
                        boy his “dirty little secret.” I think 
                        he told a lot of jokes to a lot of 
                        people, to be honest. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JOSEPHINE (CONT’D)
                        He wasn’t very good at keeping secrets.
                         (pauses)
                        Neither am I.

           OFF Lujan and Fennell’s puzzled faces...

           INT. LARRY’S MANSION, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Josephine flips on the lights and walks into the kitchen, 
           leaving the men alone in the doorway.

           She returns with a FLASHLIGHT, and leads them out to-

           EXT. LARRY’S MANSION, POOL - CONTINUOUS

           She shines the light behind a pool heater, pulls out the 
           SHOVEL tucked beneath it, and leads them around the pool. 
           They head into the tropical foliage behind the house.

           EXT. LARRY’S MANSION, TROPICAL FOREST AREA - SAME

           Josephine guides them through dense flora, past coconut trees 
           and sugar cane, all the way to a CLEARING that looks meddled 
           with, somehow. Displaced rocks. Torn grass. Dirt piles.

           She hands Fennell the light, makes him shine it on a patch of 
           earth, and begins to dig with the shovel. It’s not long until 
           she hits something; she reaches into the ground and pulls up 
           a GARBAGE BAG.

           She rips it open and pours out its contents: shorts, tee-
           shirts, underwear. LARRY’S MISSING CLOTHING.

                                 JOSEPHINE
                        They said, “burn his things. Burn 
                        everything.” But what if he came back? 
                        What if Larry came back?

           As tears course down Josephine’s cheeks-

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:

           LATER THAT NIGHT.

           HOT LIGHTS have been erected in the trees. A BULLDOZER digs 
           up garbage bags, carpets, mattresses, so on and so forth.

           Judge Castro watches in pajamas, a scowl on his face. David 
           sidles up beside him, yawns.

                                 DAVID
                        You about as tired as I am, Judge?
                                 JUDGE CASTRO
                        Getting there, David. I am getting 
                        there.

           INT. CNMI SUPERIOR COURTHOUSE - THE NEXT DAY

           Lujan sits beside Fennell on his usual side of the court; 
           none of their clients are present. Opposite them, Waechter, 
           sporting a fresh black eye, sits with Donnici and his team.

                                 JUDGE CASTRO
                        Therefore, it is my decision to expel 
                        Nicholas Waechter, Peter Donnici, and 
                        the Carlsmith-Ball Firm from the matter 
                        of the estate of Larry Hillblom pending 
                        further investigation, due to suspicion 
                        of criminal and illicit behavior.

           He bangs his gavel, hard. The room begins to rustle.

           Donnici stands, looking, surprisingly, like he doesn’t care 
           about the ruling in the slightest. Lujan stays in his seat, 
           staring at a newspaper laid out before him... 

           HEADLINE: “Governor Tenorio Signs Hillblom Bill Into Law.”

                                 WAECHTER
                        I didn’t want this.

           Lujan looks up. Waechter stands in front of him.

                                 DAVID
                        You got a bridge to sell me, too?

           Waechter points at the words “HILLBLOM BILL” in the paper-

                                 WAECHTER
                        I mean, that. I didn’t want that.
                         (pauses)
                        You can’t just change the rules when 
                        they don’t suit you. It’s cheating.

                                 DAVID
                        It’s parenting.

                                 WAECHTER
                        I don’t see the-

                                 DAVID
                        The kids were misbehaving, so you put 
                        them to bed early.

           He stands, shoves the newspaper in his briefcase.
                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        And here I thought we’d developed a kind 
                        of...grudging respect.

                                 WAECHTER
                        I think we have.

                                 DAVID
                        Yeah? Would you ever have pulled this 
                        shit in Kansas? Michigan? California?

           No reply. Lujan nods.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry about your eye.

           He walks out of court.

           INT. DAVID LUJAN’S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - EVENING

           Shannon sits in her Catholic School uniform, blouse tied-up 
           over her midriff. Kaelani, Julie, and Mercedes dance around a 
           boombox bumping Quad City DJ’s “C’mon, Ride It (The Train.)” 

           They put make-up on Shannon’s face, scrunchies and clips in 
           her hair: it’s an old-fashioned ‘90’s MAKE-OVER PARTY.

                                 JULIE
                        God, you’re pretty. Isn’t she pretty?

                                 MERCEDES
                        So pretty. Like a fashion model.

                                 KAELANI
                        How do you feel about pigtails?

                                 SHANNON
                        I’ve never tried them...

                                 KAELANI
                        You would be the hottest bitch on Saipan 
                        with pigtails, no question. All the boys 
                        are gonna grab at them, but-

                                 JULIE
                        She’ll be fine. I’ll teach her my move.

                                 SHANNON
                        What move?

                                 JULIE
                        Oh, it’s crazy easy. First, you laugh.

           She giggles, then walks up to Mercedes-
                                 JULIE (CONT’D)
                        Then, you go like this: “big strong man, 
                        big strong man.”

           She caresses Mercedes’ arms, as if she’s turned on-

                                 JULIE (CONT’D)
                        Then, you look in their eyes, and...KNEE 
                        TO DICK! KNEE TO DICK! KNEE TO DICK!

           She mimes kneeing Mercedes in the crotch, and EVERYONE BURSTS 
           OUT LAUGHING. And that’s when...

           Gabby enters through the front door, holding bags of take-
           out. Kaelani rushes over to take the bags, exposing Shannon, 
           who’s gussied up like, well...

                                 GABBY
                        What’s going on here?

                                 SHANNON
                        The girls were giving me a make-over.

           Gabby looks her up and down-

                                 GABBY
                        No more make-overs.

                                 SHANNON
                        We were just having fun-

                                 GABBY
                        Shannon, you look like a whore.

           Uncomfortable silence. Suddenly-

                                 JUNIOR (O.S.)
                        Mom, look! I’m a horse!

           Junior clops through the room wearing high-heels on his hands 
           and feet, whinnying. His timing is inopportune.

           And that’s when David shuffles through the front door-

                                 DAVID
                        Can I, uh...can I get everyone in the 
                        living room for a second?

           The whole gang, babies included, collects in the living room, 
           draping themselves across couches and chairs. David gets up 
           in front of them, looking gut-punched. Sad.
                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        The Hillblom Bill became the Hillblom 
                        Law today. You can thank the governor 
                        for that. It’s, uh...it’s a piece of 
                        shit, and I plan on appealing it in 
                        court. But that’ll be a war, not a 
                        battle. It could take years.

           He glances around at their faces-

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        What I’m saying is, the bad guys won. I 
                        fought as hard as I could, but it...it 
                        wasn’t enough. And I am so sorry.
                         (choked up)
                        I’m going to go take a shower.

           He walks off. Junior tugs on Kaelani’s sleeve.

                                 JUNIOR
                        Are we the good guys, Mom?

                                 KAELANI
                        Yes. We’re the good guys.

                                 JUNIOR
                        And we lost?

                                 KAELANI
                        I guess we did.

                                 JUNIOR
                        What do we do now?

           She leans over and kisses the top of his head.

                                 KAELANI
                        We go back to what we came from.

           Julie and Mercedes stare blankly into space.

                                                     CUT TO BLACK.

                        I’m sorry, but when are we going to 
                        start calling these women what they 
                        really are? Gold-diggers.

           INT. DHL CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           A REPORTER interviews Donnici at corporate headquarters.
           TITLE CARD: “Dateline: NBC” - November, 1996.

                                 DONNICI
                        We’ve now wasted years re-hashing their 
                        baseless accusations in court, and they 
                        are farther from the money than they’ve 
                        ever been. And meanwhile, a good man’s 
                        name and reputation have been trashed.

                                 DATELINE REPORTER
                        But is it possible that Larry Hillblom 
                        had sex with Kaelani Kinney?

                                 DONNICI
                        Well, anything’s possible...

                                 DATELINE REPORTER
                        Do you believe that Larry Hillblom had 
                        sex with Kaelani Kinney?

           Donnici sighs, then shrugs.

                                 DONNICI
                        She doesn’t really seem like his type.

           EXT. COASTLINE, PALAU - DAY

           The reporter walks along the beach, addressing the camera.

                                 DATELINE REPORTER
                        We may never know the truth behind the 
                        allegations against Hillblom, despite 
                        the work of attorneys David Lujan-

           SHOT: An OLD PHOTO of Lujan, in a floral print shirt, holding 
           a tropical drink and a cigar.

                                 DATELINE REPORTER (CONT’D)
                        -and Randy Fennell, neither of whom 
                        could be reached for comment. All that 
                        he left behind was a tangled web of odd 
                        investments and real estate holdings; 
                        and, of course, DHL Worldwide Express, 
                        the multi-national shipping corporation 
                        that remains his legacy.

           The reporter stops walking, peers out at the ocean.

                                 DATELINE REPORTER (CONT’D)
                        What we do know is that the lives of 
                        those touched by the Hillblom fiasco 
                        have been forever changed.
           EXT. GRANDMA NAOKO’S HOUSE, PALAU - DAY

           The reporter sits with Kaelani on the porch of tiny, run-down 
           shack, while Junior plays with a GameBoy beside her.

                                 DATELINE REPORTER (V.O.)
                        Take Kaelani Kinney, who lives with her 
                        mother and child in this one-bedroom 
                        home on the island of Palau.

           The reporter leans in close, voice dripping empathy.

                                 DATELINE REPORTER (CONT’D)
                        Do you think that you and your son are 
                        treated differently because of your 
                        association with Larry?

                                 KAELANI
                        People are cruel, yes. They say nasty 
                        things. They call Junior “mutt” or “rice 
                        cracker.” I just wish for someone to 
                        accept him.

           INT. UMBRELLA CLUB, MANILA - NIGHT

           A bikini bar in a bad part of town. Mercedes sits at a table 
           in next-to-no-clothes, as GIRLS dance for tips behind her.

                                 DATELINE REPORTER (V.O.)
                        Mercedes Feliciano, who is just shy of 
                        sixteen years old, has been drawn back 
                        into a life she thought she’d escaped. 
                        You can find her dancing for tips five 
                        nights a week at clubs in Manila. She 
                        works to support her parents, she says, 
                        who stay at home to care for her infant 
                        daughter.

           The reporter sits opposite Mercedes.

                                 DATELINE REPORTER (CONT’D)
                        You said that Mr. Hillblom had a special 
                        name for you?

                                 MERCEDES
                        He called me “the Benz,” yes.

                                 DATELINE REPORTER
                        As in, Mercedes Benz? Mercedes, “the 
                        Benz?”

                                 MERCEDES
                        He would say, “tonight, I’m going to 
                        take the Benz for a ride.”
           She giggles, showing off her braces. A quiet beat.

                                 MERCEDES (CONT’D)
                        He said he loved me.

           INT. DAVID LUJAN’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           David sits on his couch, alone, a bourbon in his hand and the 
           bottle at his feet. He stares at his television, miserable.

           EXT. LUJAN’S OFFICE - MORNING

           David climbs out of his Jeep, hungover, and lurches into...

           INT. LUJAN’S OFFICE, WAITING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Cecilia struggles to keep up with a flood of incoming phone 
           calls. THI BE (20, Vietnamese) sits patiently on the couch, 
           watching her son, NGUYEN BE LORY (3), chew pen caps.

           She stands when he enters; Cecilia looks up at him.

                                 CECILIA
                        David-

                                 THI BE
                        Mr. Lujan-

                                 DAVID
                         (re: child)
                        Oh, hell no.

                                 CECILIA
                        It’s been ringing off the hook.

                                 DAVID
                        No, no, no, no, no-

                                 THI BE
                        Please meet my son, Nguyen Be Lory.

                                 CECILIA
                        This “Dateline” thing: we’ve never dealt 
                        with this kind of publicity. I guess 
                        even Asian brothels get NBC.

           David speed-walks toward his office...

                                 CECILIA (CONT’D)
                        What do you want me to tell all the-?
                                 DAVID
                        Tell them, “no, no, no, no, no.”

           He slams the door.

           INT. LUJAN’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Lujan sits behind his desk, rubbing his temples. His office 
           door creaks open, and Thi Be enters, Be Lory in her arms.

                                 THI BE
                        I was a waitress at the Dalat Palace in 
                        Phan Thiet. Sixteen and a half years 
                        old.

                                 DAVID
                        Listen, I don’t want to hear it-

                                 THI BE
                        Larry Hillblom came, with men in black 
                        suits. But he wore no suit.

                                 DAVID
                        Please, stop.

                                 THI BE
                        When I gave him a drink, he touched my 
                        leg, and he whispered to me-

                                 DAVID
                        Will you shut the fuck up?!

           She does. David immediately regrets the outburst.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry. I just can’t...I’m sorry.
                         (re: her child)
                        Did Hillblom ever acknowledge that boy 
                        as his son, to you or anyone else?

           She shakes her head, “no.”

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Then there’s nothing I can do for you.

           Thi Be walks to Lujan’s desk, clears it with a swoop of her 
           arm, and plops her son down in front of him.

                                 THI BE
                        Look at his face. You tell me he don’t 
                        look like his father?

           David looks closely at Be Lory, then nods. Kid’s a Hillblom.
                                 THI BE (CONT’D)
                        So, we show him to the judge, yeah?

                                 DAVID
                        It’s a bit more complicated than-

                                 THI BE
                        Why?!

                                 DAVID
                        Because-

                                 THI BE
                        Because why?!

                                 DAVID
                        Because-!

           Suddenly, his eyes widen. He leans back, lost in a thought. 

                                 THI BE
                        Hello...? Yo!

                                 DAVID
                        Sorry, I was...do you have somewhere to 
                        stay for a day or two?

           A confused nod.

           EXT. GRANDMA NAOKO’S HOUSE, PALAU - MORNING

           David approaches the old shack, which seems deserted...until 
           Junior bursts out the door carrying a half-plucked chicken!

                                 DAVID
                        Whoa there, little man!

           He throws his arms around David. Then, FROM INSIDE-

                                 KAELANI (O.S.)
                        Damn it! Put the bird down before-!

           She steps on to the porch, spots Lujan. Her face lights up.

                                                           CUT TO:

           LATER.

           Kaelani and David sit on chairs outside the house, sipping 
           warm beers. Junior chases birds in a nearby chicken coop, 
           while GRANDMA NAOKO (60’s) watches him, chain-smoking.
                                 KAELANI (CONT’D)
                        They’re good for each other, my Mom and 
                        Junior. She keeps him in line, and he 
                        keeps her alive.

                                 DAVID
                        And what about you?

                                 KAELANI
                        They’re good for me, too.

                                 DAVID
                        Yeah. How are you getting by?

                                 KAELANI
                        I’m getting by.

                                 DAVID
                        How?

                                 KAELANI
                        Don’t ask me questions.

           A cold glance. He nods.

                                 DAVID
                        Well, I think I’ve found a way for 
                        Junior to win his case.

                                 KAELANI
                        Psssh. Shut up.

           She rolls her eyes, then...realizes he’s not kidding.

                                 KAELANI (CONT’D)
                        Shut the fuck up!

           Junior looks up at her, and she shouts-

                                 KAELANI (CONT’D)
                        I better not hear you say that-!
                         (pauses)
                        You know what, baby? You say whatever 
                        you want.

           She turns back to Lujan.

                                 KAELANI (CONT’D)
                        He sleeps on the floor. He bathes with a 
                        hose. He’s earned his shits and fucks.
                         (then-)
                        How are we going to win, David?
                                 DAVID
                        My dad was a judge back in Guam, and in 
                        the days before DNA, he used to decide 
                        these kind of cases with his eyes. You 
                        look alike? Congrats, you’re family.

           He mimes banging a gavel. She smiles.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        If the Hillblom Law bans DNA evidence, I 
                        would argue that the court has no choice 
                        but to go back to the old way of doing 
                        things. All we have to do is find a few 
                        childhood pictures of Larry, show a 
                        judge how much he looked like Junior, 
                        and we can “prove,” in the eyes of the 
                        law, who your son’s real father is.

           Kaelani’s lip trembles; she fights back tears.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Hey, this is good news.

                                 KAELANI
                        I know who his father is. You know who 
                        his father is. Everyone knows who his 
                        father is.

                                 DAVID
                        I understand if you’re afraid of the-

                                 KAELANI
                        I am not afraid of a damn thing.

           She looks at Junior, busy feeding his chickens.

                                 KAELANI (CONT’D)
                        He’s so beautiful, my boy. He should 
                        have been...wanted.
                         (pauses)
                        I pray we win. Winning is good. Money is 
                        good. But he should have been wanted. He 
                        should have had a daddy.

                                 JUNIOR (O.S.)
                        Have you seen my sisters?

           Junior skips over from the coop...

                                 DAVID
                        Soon, kiddo. And guess what? You’ve got 
                        a little brother now, too.
                                 JUNIOR
                        Does he play “Mario Kart”?

                                 DAVID
                        He’s three, so probably not yet. But 
                        I’ll bet you could teach him.

                                 KAELANI
                        What about the others? Julie, Mercedes? 
                        What’s going to happen to them?

           She’s genuinely concerned. David smiles, touched.

                                 DAVID
                        Well, the children are bound by blood, 
                        which makes you family. And a family 
                        takes care of its own, yeah?

           She nods. David looks back at the dilapidated house.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        I don’t suppose Grandma has a phone?

           EXT. DOWNTOWN SEATTLE - AFTERNOON

           A crummy office building next to a bunch of far nicer ones.

           TITLE CARD: Offices of Randy H. Fennell, Esq., Seattle.

           INT. FENNELL’S OFFICE - AFTERNOON

           Fennell clicks through JPEG’s of Pamela Anderson circa 1996 
           on his desktop. A SECRETARY yells at him from the next room.

                                 SECRETARY
                        You’ve got a collect call from Palau!

                                 FENNELL
                        Goddammit, Tiff! I said no more 
                        international-!

                                 SECRETARY
                        Palau is a U.S. territory!

                                 FENNELL
                        I should’ve never bought you Encarta!

                                 SECRETARY
                        It’s David Lujan. Should I tell him-?

           Fennell snaps up his phone, immediately-

                                 FENNELL
                        Counselor Lujan. What’s the good word?
                                 DAVID (ON PHONE) 
                        Litigation.

                                 FENNELL
                        Blow it out your ass!

           INTERCUT AS NECESSARY WITH:

           EXT. GAS STATION - SAME

           Lujan uses the pay phone outside of a beachside Exxon.

                                 FENNELL
                        Did they repeal the Hillblom Law?

                                 DAVID
                        No. But if Jo Nocasa will testify that 
                        Larry “openly and notoriously” 
                        acknowledged he had a son on Palau, it 
                        won’t matter.

                                 FENNELL
                        You mean?

                                 DAVID
                        I think I’ve found a loophole. I think 
                        I’ve found a way to win Junior’s case.
                         (then-)
                        I need you to rally the troops, okay? 
                        Round everyone up. Mares and calves.

                                 FENNELL
                        “Everyone”-everyone, or the original 
                        line-up?

                                 DAVID
                        What the hell are you talking about?

           INT. FENNELL’S OFFICE - SAME

           Fennell wrinkles his brow, confused.

                                 FENNELL
                        You haven’t been getting phone calls?

                                 DAVID
                        What phone calls?

                                 FENNELL
                        Ever since they said our names on NBC, 
                        I’ve been getting, like, fifty a day.

           He starts reading off of a legal pad on his desk...
                                 FENNELL (CONT’D)
                        I’ve got girls in Cambodia, Malaysia, 
                        Burma, Pagan...fucking Sumatra, if 
                        that’s even a place. All of them 
                        claiming Hillblom babies.

                                 DAVID
                        I’ve...I’ve been out of the office.

                                 FENNELL
                        I swear, this asshole was the Carmen 
                        Sandiego of pedophiles.

           EXT. GAS STATION - SAME

           David takes a moment to process this, then re-focuses.

                                 DAVID
                        We’ll cross that bridge when we come to 
                        it, okay? Right now, all I need you to 
                        do is find Mercedes, Julie, and-

                                 FENNELL
                        Why spend the dough? I thought this was 
                        all about winning Junior’s case?

                                 DAVID
                        Don’t you see? If we win one, we win 
                        them all.

           Silence, then-

                                 FENNELL
                        No, yeah, I definitely see that. But, 
                        maybe explain it a little-?

                                 DAVID
                        DNA.

                                 FENNELL
                        DNA isn’t admissable-

                                 DAVID
                        -in court, I know. It doesn’t mean we 
                        can’t do our own tests. If these kids 
                        are siblings, they’ll have matching DNA. 
                        That’s when this stops being a science 
                        issue, and starts being a logic issue.
                         (explains...)
                        If we can prove these kids are Junior’s 
                        brothers and sisters, and we can prove 
                        that Junior is Larry’s child, then-
                                 FENNELL
                        We can prove that they’re all Larry’s 
                        children. Holy shit, we have a case. We 
                        have a real fucking case.

                                 DAVID
                        Almost. There’s one more thing I need 
                        you to do.

           He smirks.

           EXT. MAIN STREET, KINGSBURG - DAY

           A small town street full of Swedish architecture, buttressed 
           by the local high school.

           TITLE CARD: Kingsburg, CA.

                                 FENNELL (PRE-LAP)
                        These are wonderful, thank you.

           INT. PRINCIPAL’S OFFICE - DAY

           Fennell sits across from a folksy HIGH SCHOOL PRINCIPAL, 
           rifling through a box of old photographs and yearbooks.

                                 PRINCIPAL
                        Take them, please. They’re just 
                        gathering dust.

           Fennell thumbs through a yearbook, finding Larry’s 8TH GRADE 
           CLASS PHOTO. It’s striking how much he resembles Junior.

                                 PRINCIPAL (CONT’D)
                        Was that an article or a book you said 
                        you were writing?

                                 FENNELL
                        A biography. A man, his life, his rise 
                        to success. American Dream, et cetera.

                                 PRINCIPAL
                        It’s not going to be about all of that 
                        junk on the news, is it?

                                 FENNELL
                        I don’t have any interest in that.

                                 PRINCIPAL
                        The Larry we knew here in Kingsburg was 
                        a real good kid. Odd, but very polite.

                                 FENNELL
                        Odd? How do you mean?
           The principal pauses, unsure if he should continue.

                                 PRINCIPAL
                        Well, he never really cared what people 
                        thought, or how they felt. He was only 
                        interested in...how they worked, I 
                        guess. He’d look at folks like a 
                        mechanic taking apart an engine.
                         (pauses)
                        He used to make up a new story about how 
                        his daddy died every couple of weeks and 
                        tell it to his classmates. “Pa was fried 
                        in the electric chair,” or “Pa was hit 
                        by a runaway train.” He had to be aware 
                        that all of the other kids knew he was 
                        lying, but...but I think that’s why he 
                        kept telling the stories. Because no 
                        matter how many he told, the children 
                        would listen, and offer condolences, and 
                        never cast a single doubt. He’d lost his 
                        dad, you know? How could they?

                                 FENNELL
                        His lying turned them all into liars.

           The principal nods, then shrugs-

                                 PRINCIPAL
                        Maybe that’s what it takes to make a 
                        million dollars. I wouldn’t know.

                                 FENNELL
                         (smiles)
                        Thanks for the stuff.

           He grabs the box of materials and heads toward the door.

                                 PRINCIPAL
                        You know, if you want the real scoop on 
                        Larry, you should probably just talk to 
                        his mother.

           He stops in place, turns-

                                 FENNELL
                        You know where his mother is?

                                 PRINCIPAL
                        Helen? Sure. She’s up at Horizons in 
                        Fresno, treating her arthritis.
           EXT. HORIZONS ELDERLY CARE FACILITY - DUSK

           Fennell hops out of his car, holding a CVS bag containing a 
           box of Q-Tips and a pack of zip-lock baggies.

           INT. HORIZONS ELDERLY CARE FACILITY, LOBBY - SAME

           Fennell bee-lines past reception, hoping to avoid detection.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Excuse me?!

           He freezes. The RECEPTIONIST nods at a clipboard.

                                 RECEPTIONIST (CONT’D)
                        Visitors have to sign in.

           He walks to her desk, takes a pen, and stares at the “Sign-In 
           Sheet” on the clipboard: Name, Resident Visiting, Relation To 
           Resident, Room Number. He doesn’t know what to write.

           A moment of thought, and then he has an idea; he begins to 
           flip backward through the pages of the clipboard, reading 
           over the names of the previous months’ visitors. It only 
           takes him a minute to find what he’s looking for...

           Peter Donnici visited a Helen Anderson two months earlier. 

           INT. HELEN ANDERSON’S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           HELEN ANDERSON (70’s) sits in a wheelchair, reading a romance 
           novel. Fennell enters, clears his throat, and she holds up 
           her index finger. Wait, I’m in the middle of something.

                                 FENNELL
                        Mrs. Anderson?

           The finger remains extended, until...she closes her book.

                                 FENNELL (CONT’D)
                        I’m Dr. Randy, the on-call periodontist. 
                        Just here to give your teeth a look-see.

                                 HELEN
                        I wear dentures.

                                 FENNELL
                        Well, you know what they say: “healthy 
                        gums, healthy, uh...”

           He mumbles unintelligibly, then pulls up a chair beside her.

                                 FENNELL (CONT’D)
                        If I can just get you to open wide-
                                 HELEN
                        Where’s your white coat?

                                 FENNELL
                        My coat? Dry-cleaner.

           He glances down at her hand, which inches uncomfortably close 
           to her EMERGENCY NURSE’S CALL BUTTON.

                                 HELEN
                        You know, in the past year, I’ve had 
                        more visitors than ever before. You’d 
                        think it’d be nice for a woman my age, 
                        but they’ve been awful. So bossy.

                                 FENNELL
                        I’m just a humble periodontist-

                                 HELEN
                        Bossy men in fancy suits, asking rude 
                        questions, telling me what I can say, 
                        where I can go, whom I’m allowed to 
                        speak with. Pricking my fingers with 
                        little needles. Oh, I’ve had nasty 
                        visitors, doctor.

                                 FENNELL
                        I promise, I’m not one of them.

           She looks him up and down.

                                 HELEN
                        No. Your suit is too cheap.

           She takes her hand away from the emergency call button.

                                 HELEN (CONT’D)
                        Be warned, they served garlic mashed 
                        potatoes at lunch.

           She leans back, and opens her mouth...

           Fennell pulls out a Q-Tip, swabs the inside of her cheek, and 
           quickly seals it inside a zip-lock bag!

                                 FENNELL
                        Ship-shape, Helen. You have a good one.

           He’s halfway out the door, when-

                                 HELEN
                        One last question, doctor?

           He turns. She’s staring right at him.
                                 HELEN (CONT’D)
                        What kind of son cuts his own mother out 
                        of his will?

           Fennell’s opens his mouth, shocked. Nothing comes out.

           EXT. DAVID LUJAN’S HOUSE, BEACH - MORNING

           David teaches Shannon to surf on a long board, while Junior 
           wades out into the ocean beside them. Kaelani and Gabby 
           nervously watch them from the back porch.

                                 KAELANI
                        Junior, too far! Come back in!

                                 GABBY
                        The tide’s too high, David! Enough!

           A beat, then-

                        KAELANI
                                                     GABBY
           Watch for jellyfish, baby!
                                          Shannon! Jellyfish!

           They trade a knowing smile; the bond of beleaguered moms.

                                 GABBY (CONT’D)
                        I haven’t been fair to you, have I?

                                 KAELANI
                        What? No. You’ve been so good to me.

                                 GABBY
                        Good, maybe. But not fair.
                         (then-)
                        When you hear that someone’s...done the 
                        things you’ve done for money, it’s hard-

                                 KAELANI
                        Oh, I see.

           An awkward beat.

                                 KAELANI (CONT’D)
                        It’s okay.

                                 GABBY
                        I don’t think it is, though.

                                 KAELANI
                        It’s okay. You can’t help it.
                         (pauses)
                        If you swat a fly, you don’t think about 
                        if you’ve hurt it. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 KAELANI (CONT'D)
                        You can’t feel it’s feelings, because if 
                        you did, it would be too much. You 
                        wouldn’t be able to live. You’d be 
                        crying all the time.

                                 GABBY
                        Because I’d hurt it so badly?

                                 KAELANI
                        Because there are so many flies.

           INSIDE THE HOUSE, a phone rings. Gabby gets up to answer it. 
           As Kaelani chases Junior into the water, Gabby leans out the 
           back door.

                                 GABBY
                        David! CeCe says to get your ass to the 
                        office, now!

           David wades out of the ocean.

           INT. LUJAN’S OFFICE - DAY

           All of the girls, all of their children, Randy Fennell and 
           Cecilia wait together. All told, there are eleven people 
           crammed into the small room.

           David enters, followed by Kaelani and Junior. He almost steps 
           on Mercedes, who’s changing her child’s diaper on the floor.

                                 DAVID
                        Nobody thought to crack a window?

           Kaelani gives a giddy hug to Julie; Junior kneels to tickle 
           Mercedes’ baby. David points at a box on his desk.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Is this...?

           Fennell nods. David digs through it.

                                 FENNELL
                        There’s something else.

                                 DAVID
                        DNA?

                                 FENNELL
                        Sort of. Well, yes. But...

           Fennell hands him a clipboard. David reads it, then puts a 
           hand over his mouth. His eyes well-up; he’s truly shaken.
                                 DAVID
                        My God. How did you-?

                                 FENNELL
                        It’s better you don’t know.

                                 KAELANI
                        David? What’s going on?

           He gathers himself, then turns to address the room...

                                 DAVID
                        I’ve just been handed a piece of paper 
                        that states with 99.999% accuracy that 
                        Junior Hillbroom is the son of Larry Lee 
                        Hillblom. Which means, barring the most 
                        unlikely of circumstances, every child 
                        in this room was fathered by Larry Lee 
                        Hillblom.
                         (pauses)
                        You are all family. And we can prove it.

           A hush, and then...

           AN EMOTIONAL OUTPOURING. Laughter. Tears. Jubilation.

           As the scene plays out, Fennell waves Lujan and Cecilia into-

           INT. LUJAN’S OFFICE, WAITING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           He shuts the door behind them, points at the clipboard.

                                 FENNELL
                        Look, I’m happy their happy, but you 
                        know as well as I do that those test 
                        results are not admissable in court.

                                 DAVID
                        Who says we’re going to court?

           David hands the clipboard to Cecilia-

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Fax these to Donnici.

           She puts the papers from the clipboard in a fax machine. A 
           quiet moment, as the fax goes out...

                                 FENNELL
                        You guys been watching this “Suddenly 
                        Susan”? Brooke Shields? Hysterical.

           Then, almost immediately, the PHONE RINGS-
                                 DAVID
                         (answering)
                        David Lujan’s office?

                                 DONNICI (ON PHONE)
                        What the hell is this?!

           INT. DHL HEADQUARTERS, DONNICI’S OFFICE - SAME

           He screams into his desk phone, clenching the fax.

                                 DAVID (ON PHONE)
                        It’s checkmate, Pete.

           Donnici chuckles. It’s not a pleasant chuckle.

                                 DAVID (ON PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        Pete?

                                 DONNICI
                        You arrogant...pig...fuck.

           He slams the receiver down.

           INT. LUJAN’S OFFICE, WAITING ROOM - SAME

           David hangs up, looks at Fennell and Cecilia.

                                 DAVID
                        I think we left things in a good place.

           They smile at him.

           INT. DHL HEADQUARTERS, WAECHTER’S OFFICE - SAME

           Nick Waechter packs up his briefcase for the day, as his WIFE 
           (40’s) chats with him from a nearby sofa.

                                 WAECHTER’S WIFE
                        I scheduled you a colonoscopy-

                                 WAECHTER
                        Can we eat first?

                                 WAECHTER’S WIFE
                        -for over the holidays. So I’m around to 
                        take care of you when you’re woozy.

           He pats his heart; she blows him a kiss. And suddenly-

           Donnici STORMS IN and SLAMS the fax down on Waechter’s desk. 
           Nick reads it, and flashes the faintest of smiles.
                                 WAECHTER
                        Honey, could you give us a second?

           Waechter’s wife exits. He turns to Donnici.

                                 WAECHTER (CONT’D)
                        It can’t be his mother, can it? Doesn’t 
                        she live in a cupboard, or something?

                                 DONNICI
                        I don’t know.

                                 WAECHTER
                        You think he got to one of the brothers?

                                 DONNICI
                        It doesn’t matter what I think. What are 
                        we thinking?

                                 WAECHTER
                        That they’ve got us by Larry’s balls.

           Donnici crumples the fax in his fist.

                                 DONNICI
                        This is inadmissable evidence-

                                 WAECHTER
                        Facts are facts. They don’t stop being 
                        facts just because you tell people to 
                        put their fingers in their ears.

                                 DONNICI
                        We took precautions against facts!

                                 WAECHTER
                        Think about the optics, here: big city 
                        lawyers screw a bunch of poor kids out 
                        of money they’re rightfully owed, using 
                        a legal loophole they invented 
                        themselves? What, you want to tie a girl 
                        to some train tracks next?

                                 DONNICI
                        It’s the Hillblom Law, not the Hillblom 
                        Loophole-

                                 WAECHTER
                        It’s an embarrassment, Pete. To us and 
                        everyone who had a hand in it. It’s a 
                        stiff, crusty sock under a teenage boy’s 
                        mattress, and it’s only a matter of time 
                        before it’s tossed and replaced.
                                 DONNICI
                        Which is why we’ve got to take advantage 
                        of it now!

                                 WAECHTER
                        And then what? You explain to a judge 
                        how four half-white kids from three 
                        Asian countries whose virgin mothers all 
                        got pregnant after sleeping with the 
                        same man could possibly have different 
                        fathers?

                                 DONNICI
                        I could make that case, yes.

                                 WAECHTER
                        Great. And after that, we’ll take on 
                        this Holocaust myth everyone’s talking 
                        about. Make ourselves some more friends.

           Donnici puts his head in his hands.

                                 DONNICI
                        They’re not supposed to do this.

                                 WAECHTER
                        Do what?

                                 DONNICI
                        Beat us.
                         (then-)
                        We’re up against whores and natives. 
                        Ankle-biters. A man who wears Hawaiian 
                        shirts to court. These people are not 
                        supposed to beat our people. They are 
                        not supposed to win.

           Waechter considers his point...

                                 WAECHTER
                        You’re right. Larry would be damn 
                        impressed.

           He takes his briefcase and walks out.

           EXT. DIAMOND HOTEL, SAIPAN - MORNING

           David hurries through the entrance of a brand new hotel.

           TITLE CARD: Hillblom Settlement Conference. July, 1997.

           INT. DIAMOND HOTEL, LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

           Cecilia meets him by the door, walks him toward the elevator.
                                 CECILIA
                        You’re late.

                                 DAVID
                        Gabs had car problems, and I had to drop 
                        Shannon off at...

           He stops dead in his tracks...!

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        What in God’s name-?

           The hotel lobby is packed with YOUNG WOMEN of numerous Asian 
           and Asian-Pacific backgrounds, some of whom are escorted by 
           LAWYERS, all of whom are caring for MIXED-RACE CHILDREN 
           between the ages of two and twelve years-old.

                                 CECILIA
                        New claimants.

                                 DAVID
                        New Hillbloms?!

                                 CECILIA
                        Just trying to get their hands in the 
                        cookie jar.

                                 DAVID
                        He...he couldn’t possibly be the father 
                        of all of them, could he?

                                 CECILIA
                        I told Pete Donnici to think of it as a 
                        DHL shareholders meeting. He didn’t seem 
                        to like that.

           David pecks her cheek, as they step into an elevator.

           INT. DIAMOND HOTEL, HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           The PENTHOUSE FLOOR is buzzing with ATTORNEYS and PARALEGALS, 
           who run in and out of doors like headless chickens. 

           Cecilia points out various rooms as they move past them...

                                 CECILIA
                        They put everyone in separate suites, to 
                        make things more...I don’t know, “Benny 
                        Hill”? The Medical Trust and their reps 
                        are in there. Josephine’s in there. The 
                        estate’s set up shop down there, and-

           She guides him into-
           INT. CLAIMANTS’ SUITE - CONTINUOUS

           Kaelani, Mercedes, and the other girls bounce on a king-sized 
           bed in a spacious hotel room, smacking each other with 
           pillows and generally having the time of their lives.

                                 CECILIA
                        -this is us.

           In the far corner, Fennell keeps watch over the three younger 
           Hillblom kids, as Junior snakes candy from the mini-bar.

           David taps Junior on the shoulder, whispers something in his 
           ear. He nods, then jumps to his feet and shouts-

                                 JUNIOR
                        LADIES AND GENTLEMEN! ATTENTION, PLEASE!

           The girls plop down on the edge of the bed.

                                 DAVID
                        Good morning.

                                 THE GIRLS (IN UNISON)
                        Good morning.

                                 DAVID
                        Big day. You all eat breakfast?

                                 THI BE
                        Julie drank my orange juice.

                                 JULIE
                        Yo, we’re snitching now?!

                                 THI BE
                        You don’t drink a Vietnamese bitch’s 
                        fruit juice! That’s a known rule!

                                 DAVID
                        Everyone, shut up. I want to talk.

           They pipe down. He takes a moment to look at them, proud.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        I don’t know what’s going to happen 
                        today. I hope you guys end up walking 
                        out of here with a lot of money, but you 
                        could just as easily leave with nothing 
                        but the clothes on your back and...the 
                        fifty pounds of make-up on your face.

                                 THE GIRLS (IN UNISON)
                        What-?! Fuck you! I look good, etc.!
                                 DAVID
                        What I want you to remember is this: the 
                        money is just a vehicle for a message. 
                        That you are worth something. That 
                        people like you are worth something. And-

           KNOCK-KNOCK. A YOUNG ATTORNEY appears in the doorway.

                                 YOUNG ATTORNEY
                        They’d like to speak with you, sir.

           David nods at the girls. To be continued.

           INT. ESTATE’S SUITE - CONTINUOUS

           A near-identical suite to that of the claimants, but this one 
           crawling with LAWYERS. Lujan enters to find Waechter and 
           Donnici standing at a table in the middle room.

                                 DAVID
                        Mr. Waechter. Mr. Donnici.

                                 WAECHTER
                        Can we get you anything? Water?

           He shakes his head, as they shake his hand. Everyone sits.

                                 DAVID
                        So, gentlemen: where do we stand?

                                 DONNICI
                        I suppose we stand at the crossroads of 
                        position and preference.

                                 DAVID
                        Oh?

                                 DONNICI
                        Our position remains that we are willing 
                        to take this matter before a judge. Our 
                        preference would be to settle and put 
                        the madness behind us.

                                 WAECHTER
                        Where do you stand, David?

                                 DAVID
                        At the crossroads of “cut the bullshit” 
                        and “make me an offer.”

           Waechter smirks. Donnici sneers.
                                 DONNICI
                        You should know that we are unwilling to 
                        give up equity in DHL or any of its 
                        subsidiaries.

                                 DAVID
                        I’m sorry, do you need me to explain 
                        what an offer is?

                                 DONNICI
                        That is non-negotiable.

                                 DAVID
                        Do you take toys away from your kids on 
                        Christmas?

           Donnici allows himself a calming breath. Then...

                                 DONNICI
                        $10 million dollars per child.

                                 DAVID
                        $150.

                                 DONNICI
                        What?

                                 DAVID
                        $150 million per child.

                                 DONNICI
                        Is that a joke?

                                 DAVID
                        Did you hear a rimshot?

           Donnici peers sideways at Waechter-

                                 WAECHTER
                        We are willing to go as high as $15 
                        million per child.

                                 DAVID
                        That’s great. Some wiggle room.

           Then, nothing.

                                 WAECHTER
                        Would you like to counter?

                                 DAVID
                        Holding firm at $150 million.
                                 WAECHTER
                        Why?

                                 DAVID
                        Because the law allows it.

                                 DONNICI
                        Mr. Lujan-

                                 DAVID
                        “Pig fuck,” please.

                                 DONNICI
                        Do you think I’m bluffing when I say I’m 
                        willing to take this to court?

                                 DAVID
                        Of course not.

                                 DONNICI
                        And your position is?

                                 DAVID
                        Go ahead.

                                 DONNICI
                        Go ahead?

                                 DAVID
                        Go. Ahead.

           They stare at him, in disbelief.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Look, I’ve got genetic evidence-

                                 DONNICI
                        Inadmissable genetic evidence-

                                 DAVID
                        I’ve got physical evidence, documentary 
                        evidence, witness testimony coming out 
                        of my ass. I’ve got you greedy sons-of-
                        bitches on everything short of corpse 
                        rape. I have four adorable children, and 
                        from the looks of the lobby, more to 
                        come; four young women who’ve endured a 
                        hotter hell than you could ever imagine. 
                        I have public sentiment, reason, logic, 
                        veracity, virtue, and God himself on my 
                        side: I think I can win over a judge.
                         (then-)
                        So, my position is, go ahead, 
                        motherfucker. Take me to court.
           Silence. Donnici burns with barely contained anger.

                                 DONNICI
                        Very well. I’d like to exercise my right 
                        to conduct depositions on your clients 
                        and their guardians prior to litigation.

                                 DAVID
                        Of course.

           Donnici stands, straightens his tie. David frowns.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        Wait, right now?

           Lujan meets eyes with Waechter. Donnici heads for the door.

           INT. CLAIMANTS’ SUITE - LATER

           Donnici and Mercedes sit across from each other at a table, a 
           telephone between them. Fennell sits with the other women and 
           children on the bed behind her.

           David holds a Bible, which Mercedes has placed her hand on. 
           OVER SPEAKERPHONE, a familiar voice...

                                 JUDGE CASTRO (ON PHONE)
                        ...you swear to tell the truth, the 
                        whole truth, and nothing but the truth, 
                        so help you God?

                                 MERCEDES
                        Yes.

                                 DAVID
                        Thanks, Alex.

           Lujan ends the call, puts the Bible away. As Donnici fiddles 
           with a tape recorder, Waechter kneels down beside him-

                                 WAECHTER
                        What are you doing?

                                 DONNICI
                        This whole case is predicated on the 
                        credibility of these girls. You take 
                        that away, they’ve got nothing. No case.

                                 WAECHTER
                        We arranged this conference to negotiate 
                        a settlement, Pete. That’s why we’re 
                        here. We don’t want to go back to court.

           Donnici places the recorder on the table, turns to Mercedes.
                                 DONNICI
                        Ms. Feliciano, when did you first begin 
                        to menstruate?

                                 DAVID
                        What?

                                 DONNICI
                        I want to know when she first began to 
                        menstruate.

                                 DAVID
                        You want to tell me how that’s relevant?

                                 DONNICI
                        I’m sorry, do we need to pause in order 
                        for Mr. Lujan to have “the talk” with 
                        his parents?

                                 DAVID
                        Do not take your problems with me out an 
                        innocent girl.

                                 DONNICI
                        She couldn’t have gotten pregnant prior 
                        to her first period. That’s how it’s 
                        relevant. Now-
                         (to Mercedes)
                        When did you first begin to menstruate?

           Mercedes turns to look at the other girls-

                                 MERCEDES
                        He means to bleed?

           They nod. She turns back.

                                 MERCEDES (CONT’D)
                        Thirteen.

                                 DONNICI
                        Thirteen. And you met Larry Hillblom 
                        when you were-?

                                 MERCEDES
                        Fourteen.

                                 DONNICI
                        Fourteen. And you had sex with him the 
                        first night you met?

           No answer. She looks distraught.
                                 DONNICI (CONT’D)
                        Ms. Feliciano, did you have sex with 
                        Larry Hillblom the night you met him?

                                 MERCEDES
                        Yes.

                                 DONNICI
                        Is that normal behavior for you?

                                 WAECHTER
                        Come on, Pete...

                                 DONNICI
                        To have sex with men the moment you meet 
                        them?

           David slaps his hand on the table-

                                 DAVID
                        That’s enough!

                                 DONNICI
                        Are you going to hit me, Mr. Lujan?

           David steps toward Donnici, who seems almost...excited.

                                 DONNICI (CONT’D)
                        Fair warning, I am a bit more litigious 
                        than my colleague, Mr. Waechter. But go 
                        ahead, take your shot.

                                 FENNELL (O.S.)
                        Lujan-!

           David looks at Fennell, who shakes his head, more serious 
           than we’ve ever seen him before. They talked about this.

           Donnici turns back to-

                                 DONNICI
                        Ms. Feliciano, would you consider it 
                        normal behavior for you to have-?

                                 KAELANI
                        This guy ain’t shit, Mercedes. I bet he 
                        couldn’t even get it up for your hot 
                        little ass.

                                 JULIE
                        With his fuckboy shoes and his two-inch 
                        dick!
                                 KAELANI
                        Just answer his stupid question and 
                        let’s go dancing, yeah?

           Mercedes laughs, looks at Donnici-

                                 MERCEDES
                        Sometimes, yes. I sleep with men the 
                        first night, if they pay enough money. 
                        But none before Larry. Larry was my 
                        first.

                                 DONNICI
                        And what do you remember about sex with 
                        Larry?

                                 DAVID
                        This is completely out of line!

                                 DONNICI
                         (to Lujan)
                        I am trying to depose a goddamn witness!

                                 DAVID
                        You are trying to slaughter the weakest 
                        of the herd!

           Donnici gets right up in Mercedes’ face.

                                 DONNICI
                        Was his penis circumcised?!

                                 DAVID
                         (to Waechter)
                        Will you control him?!

                                 WAECHTER
                        Pete, you can’t just brutalize them!

                                 DONNICI
                        If Larry was this girl’s first screw, 
                        don’t you think she’d remember his 
                        fucking cock?!

                                 WAECHTER
                        It’s not important!

                                 DONNICI
                         (to Mercedes)
                        Was Larry Hillblom circumcised?!

                                 DAVID
                        Enough!
           Mercedes turns to the girls, again. Julie makes a scissor 
           with her fingers.

                                 JULIE
                        Cut.

           She turns back to Donnici, nods. Donnici turns to look at 
           Lujan, his gaze violent.

                                 DONNICI
                        One last question, Ms. Feliciano. About 
                        shame. Do you feel no shame?

                                 DAVID
                        Fuck you. Mercedes, you don’t have to-

                                 MERCEDES
                        It’s okay.

           Somewhere on the other side of the room, a baby begins to 
           cry. Mercedes looks at Junior.

                                 MERCEDES (CONT’D)
                        Can you bring me Mercedita?

           Junior carefully removes the baby from her bassinet and hands 
           it to Mercedes, who kisses her, then looks up at Donnici.

                                 MERCEDES (CONT’D)
                        Have you met my daughter?

                                 DONNICI
                        No.

                                 MERCEDES
                        Would you like to hold her?

                                 DONNICI
                        No.

           She places Mercedita on the table between them...

                                 MERCEDES
                        Please.

           Donnici eyes the baby for what feels like an eternity, and 
           finally, takes her in his arms.

                                 MERCEDES (CONT’D)
                        Mr. Hillblom...Larry...he bought me from 
                        my family, and we made her. I cost 1,500 
                        pesos; $35 American dollars. I gave it 
                        to my daddy for gasoline.
           Donnici from the baby to her mother.

                                 MERCEDES (CONT’D)
                        You ask if I feel shame, and I say yes: 
                        every day, every time someone looks at 
                        me with their eyes. Here, now, when I 
                        sit with you, I feel so much shame, I 
                        could run away. I could die.
                         (pauses)
                        But I won’t. I will not run. I will not 
                        die. I will sit here and answer every 
                        question you ask. I will tell my truth, 
                        and I will be strong. For her.

           She points to her child.

                                 MERCEDES (CONT’D)
                        I will not let her have my shame.

           Donnici stares at Mercedes; she stares right back at him.

           Waechter touches his shoulder, and he hands Mercedes back her 
           daughter. He turns to Lujan.

                                 DONNICI
                        I’m going to discuss our terms with the 
                        Davies trust. We can pick up where we 
                        left off in a few hours.

           And he walks out of the suite.

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:

           LATER THAT EVENING.

           Lujan et. al. are flopped out around the room, exhausted and 
           tense. Some nap, some snack, some just stare at the ceiling. 

           The PHONE RINGS. Everyone snaps to attention.

                                 DAVID
                         (answering)
                        This is David Lujan.
                         (listens-)
                        Uh-huh...yes...pending what? Alright.
                         (listens-)
                        Yes. Yes, I think we do. Goodbye, now.

           He hangs up, falls backward on the bed. A tense moment.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        You guys probably want to know what that 
                        call was about, huh?
           HOWLS OF ANGER. Thi Be and Kaelani chuck pillows at him.

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        I just accepted a settlement offer on 
                        your behalf.

                                 FENNELL
                        What was the offer?

                                 DAVID
                        A percentage.

           David stands up and walks to a nearby dresser, upon which 
           rests a make-up kit and a large mirror. 

                                 DAVID (CONT’D)
                        A percentage of Larry’s billion dollar 
                        estate, to split amongst the family.

                                 KAELANI
                        What percentage?

           He picks up a tube of lipstick, and writes on the mirror:

           “60%” 

           AND EVERYONE LOSES THEIR MINDS. Shrieking. Crying. Hugging. 
           Kissing. Dancing on furniture.

           In the midst of it, David slips out the door by himself.

           INT. DIAMOND HOTEL, HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           He leans against a wall, his breath heavy. As he wipes his 
           eyes, he spots Nick Waechter, leaning over the top floor 
           balcony, staring at something.

           David makes an approach, leans against the railing, and sees 
           that Waechter’s gazing at the mob of women and children that 
           is still sprawled out in the lobby below.

                                 WAECHTER
                        It sort of reminds you of those old 
                        pictures of Ellis Island.

                                 DAVID
                        Give me your tired, your poor, your 
                        huddled masses yearning to breathe free.

                        DAVID (CONT’D)
           -The wretched refuse of your 
           teeming shore.
                                                   WAECHTER
                                          The wretched refuse of your 
                                          teeming shore.
                                 WAECHTER
                        I’m not sure this place was built to 
                        cater to “wretched refuse.”

                                 DAVID
                         (shrugs)
                        They had a room for Donnici.

           Waechter laughs. Then, he quiets.

                                 WAECHTER
                        You destroyed a man’s legacy. I know 
                        that shouldn’t bother me, but-

                                 DAVID
                        You give me too much credit. All I did 
                        was piss on his grave.

                                 WAECHTER
                        Isn’t that the same thing?

                                 DAVID
                        No. Piss dries.

                                 WAECHTER
                        It’s still hard, you know?

                                 DAVID
                        What is?

                                 WAECHTER
                        Seeing him as this monster. There are 
                        times I find myself wishing the truth 
                        had stayed buried. The truth still feels 
                        like a betrayal.

           Silence. Then-

                                 DAVID
                        Had you ever dealt with a will before?

                                 WAECHTER
                        Nope. First timer.

                                 DAVID
                        I interned for a firm that specialized 
                        in Elder Law when I was fresh out of 
                        college, so I used to deal with them 
                        every day. You want to know what’s 
                        strange about Larry’s?

                                 WAECHTER
                        What?
                                 DAVID
                        There’s no disinheritance clause.
                         (then-)
                        Larry knew he was Junior’s father. He 
                        knew Baby Mercedita was on the way. He 
                        had to suspect he might have more kids 
                        running around out there. And yet, this 
                        billionaire, this titan of industry, did 
                        absolutely nothing to stop them from 
                        going after his assets in the event of 
                        his death.

                                 WAECHTER
                        What are you saying?

                                 DAVID
                        I’m saying two simple sentences could 
                        have prevented all of this. Two 
                        sentences, dropped somewhere into his 
                        will, disinheriting “any illegitimate or 
                        unrecognized children,” and there never 
                        would have been a case. But those 
                        sentences didn’t exist; there was no 
                        disinheritance clause.
                         (pauses)
                        You’ve got to ask yourself why, don’t 
                        you? Why didn’t the genius think to 
                        protect his fortune?

           Waechter’s eyes widen with realization...

                                 WAECHTER
                        Because he didn’t want to give it away. 
                        He wanted someone to earn it.

           Lujan shrugs, pats him on the back-

                                 DAVID
                        You knew him better than I did.

                                 WAECHTER
                        He really was a monster, wasn’t he?

           David walks to the elevator, presses the call button-

                                 DAVID
                        Monsters don’t exist, Nick. I think 
                        you’re letting him off the hook too 
                        easy.

           He steps into the elevator, and he’s gone.
           EXT. GARAPAN VILLAGE - DAY

           The usual hustle and bustle of tourists and locals. Kaelani 
           and Junior sit by the dock, waiting for the water taxi.

                                 JUNIOR
                        Can we go Legoland?

                                 KAELANI
                        Not today.

                                 JUNIOR
                        Why not?

                                 KAELANI
                        Because we have to go pick up Grandma 
                        Naoko’s medicine.

                                 JUNIOR
                        Can I go buy, like, infinity Legos, and 
                        make my own Legoland?

                                 KAELANI
                        That’s stupid.

                                 JUNIOR
                        Can I buy a wolf?

                                 KAELANI
                        Hell no, you can’t buy a wolf-

                                 JUNIOR
                         (pouting)
                        I thought I was a millionaire, now!

                                 KAELANI
                        You are. But that doesn’t mean you can 
                        just do whatever you want.

                                 JUNIOR
                        What does it mean, then?

           It’s a big question, and Kaelani seems to grow increasingly 
           stressed as she ponders it, until... 

           Junior tugs on her sleeve, and points at a familiar fat man 
           wheeling a shaved ice cart into Garapan village.

                                 JUNIOR (CONT’D)
                        Can we get ices now, Mom?

           A quiet moment. And she smiles.
                                 KAELANI
                        Sure, baby. Sure, we can.

           And they walk off, hand-in-hand.

                                                           CUT TO:

           TITLE CARD: Junior Hillbroom, Mercedita Feliciano, Jellian 
           Cuartero, and Nguyen Be Lory were awarded just under $100 
           million apiece.

           TITLE CARD: The children paid $3 million to Josephine Nocasa. 
           She received nothing from the Hillblom estate.

           TITLE CARD: They also agreed to pay $4 million apiece to each 
           of Larry Hillblom’s “phantom children,” meaning those who, at 
           the time of the settlement, were unconfirmed by DNA testing.

           TITLE CARD: Together, the children purchased a $30 million 
           insurance policy, to be used in the event that any more 
           siblings came forward.

           TITLE CARD: Several have.

           TITLE CARD: David Lujan lives with his family in Guam. He 
           continues to practice law.

                                                    FADE TO BLACK.
