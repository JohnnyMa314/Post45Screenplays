           EXT. DIKE ROAD - NIGHT

           A pair of FINE LEATHER SHOES, soaking wet, SQUISH along a 
           gravel road. With each step, water seeps through the tongue, 
           reflecting the amber hues of a nearby porch light.

           Distant at first, the faint sounds of strained breathing grow 
           into loud gasps for air. Glimpses of an exquisitely tailored 
           suit drenched from head to toe. Water drips from the sleeve 
           past a dead, gold Rolex. 

           Beads of sweat fall from a masculine brow revealing SENATOR 
           TED KENNEDY, 37.

           EXT. LAWRENCE COTTAGE - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

           Ted stumbles toward a quaint, Martha’s Vineyard vacation 
           home, which would resemble an Edward Hopper painting if it 
           weren’t for the raucous party bursting from inside. 

           He lumbers over to an empty, WHITE PLYMOUTH VALIANT out 
           front. Opens the rear door and sits in the back seat. A 
           figure approaches, but Ted doesn’t look back.

                                 TED
                        Get me Joe Gargan. We got a problem.

           INT. TED KENNEDY’S SENATE OFFICE - THE PREVIOUS DAY

           A phone SLAMS down --

                                 TED
                        Get me Joe Gargan! We got a problem!

           A SECRETARY rushes to her desk and dials frantically. Ted’s 
           aide DUN GIFFORD, 30, peeks his head through the door. 

                                 GIFFORD
                        They’re ready for your interview, 
                        Senator.

                                 TED
                             (to secretary)
                        The second you have him, patch him 
                        through to me.

           Ted storms out of his office as Gifford trails behind.

           INT. SENATE HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           STAFFERS and CAMERA CREW add to the chaos as Ted plows ahead.

           DAVID BURKE, 33, Ted’s loyal chief of staff comes running up.
                                 DAVID BURKE
                        Just spoke with the Majority Leader.

           Ted scowls. Gifford hands him a sheet of paper with a 
           bulleted list of talking points.

                                 TED
                             (to Gifford)
                        When does this interview air?

                                 DAVID BURKE
                        Senator, you’re not going to like it.

                                 GIFFORD
                        Sunday. Just before Apollo 11 
                        starts its descent. 

                                 TED
                        And these are the talking points?

                                 DAVID BURKE
                        Senator. Your health care bill is 
                        making us enemies in the party 
                        leadership -- 

           Ted shoves the talking points in David Burke’s face. 

                                 TED
                        This is why we’re focused on national 
                        news. My name gives me a platform 
                        into every American home. I can speak 
                        directly to the people instead of 
                        waiting for the leadership to know 
                        shit from Shinola.

           Ted picks up a phone on a corner table, smashes a few buttons.

                                 TED (CONT’D)
                        Did you get Joe yet?!

                                 SECRETARY (V.O.)
                        He’s not answering.

                                 TED
                        Well, keep trying him!

           Ted slams the phone down and enters through a double doorway.

           INT. SENATE CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           A TV CREW with multiple cameras overrun the conference room.

           DICK DRAYNE, 31, Ted’s press secretary, catches up to him at 
           the entryway and guides him past the lights and cables. Ted 
           reviews the talking points with growing frustration.
                                 TED
                        What are they thinking I can say 
                        that’s remotely intelligent about 
                        the moon landing?

                                 DRAYNE
                        They just want you to talk about 
                        President Kennedy. I don’t think 
                        they’re expecting anything 
                        intelligent.

           Ted tosses the talking points aside.

                                 TED
                        My point exactly.

           They reach an empty chair across from an ABC REPORTER. Ted 
           shakes his hand.

                                 TED (CONT’D)
                        So, you’re the man they got to 
                        represent all three networks.

                                 ABC REPORTER
                        Well, I represent ABC. But this event 
                        is so historic that we’re licensing 
                        your interview out to the other two.

           Ted settles in while a MAKEUP GIRL powders his face and an 
           AUDIO TECH mics him up.

                                 TED
                        Good! I don’t get out of bed for less 
                        than two networks worth of coverage.

           The reporter and crew all force smiles and strained chuckles. 

                                 ABC REPORTER
                        Alright, I think we’re set. Let’s 
                        roll camera.

           The red lights of the cameras turn on, capturing Ted’s 
           signature politician smile.

                                 ABC REPORTER (CONT’D)
                        “We choose to go to the moon not 
                        because it is easy but because it is 
                        hard.” What does your brother’s 
                        promise to America mean to you?

                                 TED
                        Well, he always was someone who kept 
                        his promises.
                             (beat)
                        My brother committed his life to the 
                        idea that the United States was the 
                        beacon of democracy for the world.

                        And so too, for my family, I think 
                        he was a beacon. Someone we all 
                        looked up to, aspired to be, and 
                        ultimately hope to live up to.
                             (beat)
                        I know I sure did.

                                 ABC REPORTER
                        He said this mission would have, 
                        quote, “a great impact on the minds 
                        of men across the nation.”

                                 TED
                        I think my brother set the course 
                        for the whole nation in a way that 
                        we can never abandon. You see it in 
                        the space program, sure, but you can 
                        see it in the passage of the Civil 
                        Rights Act, the passage of the 
                        Immigration Act...even in my own 
                        life, I often ask, “What would Jack 
                        have me do?”
                             (beat)
                        Jack Kennedy cast a long shadow; and 
                        he still does. It’s one I walk in 
                        every day.

                                 ABC REPORTER
                        What’s it like walking in that shadow?

           Ted gives this question a moment of reflection before he 
           removes his lapel mic. Stands up.

                                 TED
                        I think you have what you need.

           INT. SENATE HALLWAY - DAY

           Ted exits the conference room and finds himself immediately 
           flanked on both sides by David Burke and Gifford.

                                 DAVID BURKE
                        I got Mansfield’s support on the 
                        health care bill.

                                 TED
                        Did we find Gargan, yet?

                                 DAVID BURKE
                        I’m not sure. I was more focused on 
                        salvaging our relationship with the 
                        Majority Leader.

                                 TED

           INT. TED KENNEDY’S SENATE OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Ted enters his office. His secretary shoots to her feet.

                                 SECRETARY
                        Joe Gargan is holding for you.

           Ted heads straight for his phone and picks it up.

                                 TED
                        Joey!

           EXT. SHIRETOWN INN - DAY

           JOE GARGAN, 39, Ted’s cousin, stands in a phone booth outside 
           a small, seaside hotel. 

           He slicks back a comb over hiding the early signs of a 
           receding hairline. This makes him stick out like a black 
           sheep at Kennedy family gatherings. Along with his glasses.

                                 GARGAN
                        What’s going on, Teddy? I’ve been 
                        on hold here for ten minutes.

           INTERCUT

           Ted leans back in his chair and gives a childlike shrug.

                                 TED
                        I really needed to talk to you.

           He puts his feet on the desk.

                                 GARGAN
                        Well, it must have been something 
                        pretty damn important.

           Gargan’s eyes roll; he knows it’s not.

                                 TED
                        The hotel on the Vineyard is 
                        overbooked.

                                 GARGAN
                        I just checked in. I’m holding the 
                        key to our room right here.

                                 TED
                        Not our hotel room. The girls! Mary 
                        Jo just called me.
                                 GARGAN
                        I’m sure she can find all of them 
                        another place. Mary Jo was the most 
                        resourceful of Bobby’s old 
                        secretaries.

                                 GARGAN
                        What do you want me to do? Slap an 
                        injunction on the desk clerk until 
                        he coughs up a room?

                                 GARGAN
                        I’ve still gotta rig the hull. The 
                        regatta is this afternoon --

                                 TED
                        I know when the race is. I’m 
                        sailing the damn boat with you.

                                 GARGAN
                        But what about the party?

                        There’s no party if the Boiler Room 
                        Girls aren’t there.

           Ted stands up from his chair. He grabs a FRAMED PHOTO sitting 
           on his desk: Ted, no older than thirteen, plays by the pool 
           with his brothers Jack and Bobby. 

           In the photo, Gargan lies on the ground and takes a punch in 
           the jaw from Bobby. All the Kennedy brothers appear to laugh 
           and smile. Ted especially.

                        can I count on you?

           Gargan grits his teeth.

                                 GARGAN
                        Yep. “Ole Joey’ll fix it.”
           EXT. MARTHA’S VINEYARD - EDGARTOWN - DAY

           As seen from above, a raven BLACK ‘67 OLDSMOBILE sedan 
           pierces through winding roads leading to a picturesque 
           seaside vacation town filled with brightly colored houses.

           Even more brightly colored sails fill the harbor as the car 
           reaches the ferry landing.

           INT. OLDSMOBILE - DAY

           A shadow engulfs Ted, who sits in the backseat, wearing 
           reading glasses, reviewing a piece of legislation.

           A New York Times newspaper rests on the seat next to him. 

           The date reads: "FRIDAY, JULY 18TH, 1969". 

           The headline reads: 

           - "APOLLO COASTS ON TOWARD MOON"

           EXT. CHAPPAQUIDDICK ISLAND - DAY

           Ted’s car rolls off the ferry with great caution. There is 
           little sign of civilization, except back across the bay. 
           Until --

           EXT. LAWRENCE COTTAGE - DAY

           TED’S DRIVER, 63, opens the rear passenger door. He unloads 
           the luggage and a case of beer. Ted, ever the man of the 
           people, grabs his own box of assorted hard liquor.

           INT. LAWRENCE COTTAGE - DAY

           Hands place bottles (and more bottles) on an entryway table. 
           This must be a party for dozens of people, or at least one 
           hell of a rager for any fewer.

           INT. LAWRENCE COTTAGE - BEDROOM - DAY

           Ted catches a glimpse of himself in the mirror as he changes 
           into a bathing suit. He turns around more fully revealing a 
           BACK BRACE. A damaged man.

           EXT. DIKE BRIDGE - DAY

           The car bounces along an unpaved road, jostling the two men 
           inside.
           It drives towards the beach across a rickety, single-lane 
           bridge with no guardrail. DIKE BRIDGE.

           Ted opens his door and takes his first step into the sand.

           EXT. BEACH - DAY

           Scattered tourists line the narrow beach.  

           ESTHER NEWBERG, 26, wears a fashionable bikini and rubs 
           tanning lotion on the back of her more modest, but more eye-
           catching, blonde friend, MARY JO KOPECHNE, 28.

           Mary Jo lays on her stomach looking over her shoulder at 
           Esther. Behind her, Gargan and another man, RAY LAROSA, 41, 
           cavort with FOUR YOUNG WOMEN in the water. Wearing a divers 
           mask and snorkel, the fit LaRosa dives back under the surface.

                                 ESTHER
                        I still can’t believe you stayed up 
                        all night by yourself working on 
                        Bobby’s Vietnam speech.

                                 MARY JO
                        I had company.

           Esther raises an eyebrow. 

                                 ESTHER
                        I hadn’t heard this part.

                                 MARY JO
                        Not the whole night, of course. 

           Mary Jo turns back and looks out over the ocean.

                                 MARY JO (CONT’D)
                        I was just trying to make sense of 
                        all of Sorensen and Burke’s notes. 
                        So finally, I just call Burke and 
                        see if he can’t explain himself. 
                        And that’s when he tells me, “All 
                        that stuff comes straight from Ted. 
                        Why don’t you go ask him yourself?”

           Ted spots the girls from afar, starts to stroll up behind them.

                                 MARY JO (CONT’D)
                        And would you believe it? It’s past 
                        two in the morning, and there’s 
                        Teddy...in his office...answering 
                        letters from mothers, wives, and 
                        widows begging him to put an end to 
                        the war.
           Ted steps lightly, trying not to intrude on the girls' 
           conversation. He can't help but eavesdrop.

                                 MARY JO (CONT’D)
                        So I ask him, “Senator. What did 
                        you mean when you said this war 
                        made you think, ‘What has happened 
                        to America?’” 
                             (beat)
                        And then he looks up at me...with a 
                        lump in his throat...and he says --

                                 TED
                        Revealing state secrets is an act 
                        of treason, you know.

           Mary Jo spins around. She’s caught off guard by Ted but 
           quickly recovers. 

                                 MARY JO
                        Well, if the state secret is that 
                        Ted Kennedy has a heart, then I’m 
                        guilty as charged.

           Ted CHUCKLES and offers a conciliatory shrug. Mary Jo gets up 
           and embraces him with a warm hug. A very warm hug.

                                 ESTHER
                        How’re the kids, Senator?

           Ted clinches his jaw and speaks through gritted teeth.

                                 TED
                        Fine. Just fine. Thanks for asking, 
                        Esta’.

                                 ESTHER
                        And your wife?

                                 TED
                        At home on bedrest, I’m afraid. 
                        Doctor’s orders. Say, wouldn’t you 
                        like to go for a swim with the 
                        other girls?

                                 ESTHER
                        Mary Jo, want to come along?

                                 MARY JO
                        I...
                             (glances at Ted)
                        I actually can’t swim.

                                 ESTHER
                        Suit yourself. Good luck in the 
                        race this afternoon, Senator.
           Esther shoots Ted a glib smile and heads for the water, 
           joining Gargan and her friends. Mary Jo snickers as Ted lays 
           down on his stomach next to her.

                                 TED
                        That was a hell of time working on 
                        Bobby’s campaign together.
                             (beat)
                        So, why haven’t you found your next 
                        race yet?

           Ted flashes her a signature Kennedy smile. Mary Jo looks away 
           and Ted's smile fades quickly.

                                 MARY JO
                        It’s never going to be the same.

                                 TED
                        I know.
                             (beat)
                        The offer I made still stands. Come 
                        to Washington. Work on my staff.

                                 MARY JO
                        I’ve got too many memories there.

                                 TED
                        We can make new ones.

                                 MARY JO
                        I can’t work on another 
                        presidential campaign.

                                 TED
                        I don’t know that you have to.

           Mary Jo sets her head on Ted’s shoulder but continues to 
           stare out into the distance.  

                                 TED (CONT’D)
                        The race this afternoon...

           He puts his arm around her.

                                 TED (CONT’D)
                        I want you to know...I’m racing for 
                        Bobby.

           Mary Jo looks up at him and smiles.

           EXT. EDGARTOWN HARBOR - DAY

           A dozen sailboats navigate the choppy waters, circling the 
           marks in the Annual Edgartown Yacht Club Regatta. A row of 
           spectator boats filled with men in cotton suits and women in 
           fashionable dresses look on with great anticipation.
           A large swath of locals hold signs reading, “KENNEDY #1”, 
           “KENNEDY TO VICTORY”, and “AMERICA NEEDS TED”.

           The bow of the Victura crashes through the waves. Ted 
           skippers the 26-foot sloop, with Gargan and PAUL MARKHAM, 39, 
           and HOWIE HALL, 12, as his crew.  

                                 TED
                        Ready to jibe!

                                 GARGAN/MARKHAM
                        Ready!

           They approach the reach mark with great speed.

                                 TED
                        Jibing!

           Ted pulls the tiller towards him and quickly ducks as the 
           boom swings over his head. Gargan and Markham pull ropes and 
           tie knots in expert harmony, as the Victura makes a perfectly 
           executed turn.

           Ted peers around the main sail -- No other boats in front of 
           him, the leeward mark is in his sights. He looks behind him. 

           The Victura has a comfortable lead, but Ted remains uneasy.

           Ted squeezes the tiller so tightly the blood rushes to his 
           hands. He takes a swig from his beer and makes eye contact 
           with no one as he barks out more orders.

                                 GARGAN
                        Teddy, we should let down the 
                        spinnaker.

           Gargan and Markham untie a knot and begin to lower an 
           auxiliary sail.

                                 TED
                        Stop right there. I don't wanna 
                        rest on our laurels, goddammit. I 
                        want a clear win.

                                 GARGAN
                        It’s too big a risk. We’ll need 
                        some drag if we’re going to turn 
                        the mark clean as we go windward.

                                 TED
                        This boat’s been in my family 
                        longer than I have. If anyone knows 
                        how she turns, it’s me.

           Ted glares at Gargan. His grip tightens on the tiller. 

           Gargan reluctantly pulls the rope. 
           The spinnaker goes back up and fills with more wind, nearly 
           whipping the rope from Gargan’s hand. 

           He leans back with all of his weight in order to secure the 
           sail. The Victura punches through the choppy water with 
           newfound vigor. 

           From overhead Ted’s boat speeds past the midpoint of the two 
           marks, just as his competitors begin the turn behind him.

           Gargan and Markham move port side, jump the rail and lean all 
           the way off the boat with their bodies parallel to the water, 
           straining to keep the sail under control. The waves crash 
           into them, but their concentration never breaks. 

           Gargan sees a knot unraveling. Just as it loses its hold, 
           Gargan swings up and grabs it with his other hand. He expertly 
           ties the knot and looks to see the mark just ahead.

           He turns back to see Ted polishing off his beer with a big 
           smile on his face and starting the turn.

                                 GARGAN
                        We’re coming in too fast. We need 
                        to drop the spinnaker.

                                 TED
                        It’s fine, Joey. Nothing to it.

                                 GARGAN
                        Our approach is all wrong. We 
                        should’ve dropped the sail 100 
                        yards back.

           Ted grabs the tiller with both hands, putting all of his 
           weight into it. The bow heads directly for the mark.

                                 GARGAN (CONT’D)
                        Ted!

           The boat slams into the buoy, which scrapes along the port 
           side of the hull. Gargan jostles wildly from the impact. 

           Markham loses his toe hold. SLAMS his knee against the rail.

           Ted slips and falls to the floor. Gargan jumps off the rails 
           and into the cockpit, taking control of the tiller.

                                 GARGAN (CONT’D)
                             (to Markham)
                        Take down the sail and let’s swing 
                        the jib port side.

                                 MARKHAM
                        Let the kid take care of this one. 
                        I can’t move my goddamn knee!
           Ted watches in humiliation as another boat passes by them. It 
           turns the mark with ease. The skipper, ROSS RICHARDS, and his 
           first mate, STAN MOORE, give Ted a mocking salute.

           EXT. EDGARTOWN HARBOR CHANNEL - SUNSET

           The Chappaquiddick ferry drifts across the water. Ted stands 
           outside of his car nursing a drink. His eyes are fixed on the 
           docked sailboats across the empty harbor.

           EXT. LAWRENCE COTTAGE - NIGHT

           The quaint bungalow barely contains the muffled sounds of a 
           raucous party. 

           A RED LIGHT from the volunteer fire house across the street 
           glows brightly, casting a red haze over the front lawn. 

           Kennedy's Oldsmobile creeps towards the entrance without a 
           sound just as Markham stumbles out the front door. Trailing 
           somewhat seductively behind him, MARYELLEN and NANCE LYONS, 
           27 & 26, laugh amongst themselves.

                                 MARKHAM
                        I know you two can keep a secret 
                        'cause you’re sisters. Sisters are 
                        great secret keepers.

           Markham takes off his wedding ring and opens his front breast 
           pocket. He hobbles backwards on his injured knee and fumbles 
           the gold band, which CLINKS down the wooden porch.

                                 MARKHAM (CONT’D)
                        Oh, shit.

           The rear passenger door opens. Ted's fine leather shoes step 
           down onto the gravel next to the ring. He picks it up with 
           his free hand and holds a scotch on the rocks in the other. 
           Strolls over and gives the ring to Nance.

                                 TED
                        I trust you ladies to keep this 
                        safer than the U.S. Attorney, here.

           Ted steps past the Lyons sisters, who exchange a look of 
           quiet satisfaction at the shoulders they've just rubbed.

           INT. LAWRENCE COTTAGE - MOMENTS LATER

           Ted enters the foyer revealing an even more boisterous party 
           than it appeared from outside. He surveys the room with a 
           quiet reticence at odds with his surroundings.
           Esther turns the knob on the radio, making the music louder. 
           She saunters past two girls her age flirting with a much 
           older man as she makes her way to the main room. 

           Esther hops on top of the coffee table, joining a woman in a 
           mod mini dress and flashy, gold chain belt with her back 
           facing Ted. The two women dance without reserve, enjoying 
           their place at the center of attention. 

           Esther catches a glimpse of Ted looking their direction.

                                 ESTHER
                        Care to join us, Senator?

           The other woman on the table spins around revealing Mary Jo, 
           equally stunning as before but with an elegance and ease 
           previously unseen. Ted locks eyes with her, magnetized.

                                 ESTHER (CONT’D)
                        C'mon, Teddy. You should be used to 
                        losing races by now. Have some fun.

                        It's not every year that my crew 
                        finds a way to snatch defeat from 
                        the jaws of victory.

                                 MARY JO
                        Well, the captain's the leader.

                                 TED
                        Right. I lead. They listen.

           Mary Jo stops dancing.

                                 MARY JO
                        Aren't more races won by leaders 
                        who inspire their team?
                             (beat)
                        I don't know. I'm new to sailing.

           Ted flashes a sly but appreciative smile. Gargan walks up to 
           Mary Jo with a tray full of hors d'oeuvres.

                                 GARGAN
                        Oh, don't worry. Ted knows I find 
                        his insults very inspiring. Plus, 
                        if he couldn't insult me, he'd have 
                        kicked me off the team years ago.

                                 TED
                        Joey, you’re family! I could never 
                        kick my cousin off the team. 
                             (beat)  
                        My dad would never allow it!

           Ted gives a loud, hearty laugh and slaps Gargan on the back. 
           The girls laugh too but only to be polite.

                                 GARGAN
                        Well, he wouldn’t keep me around if 
                        you were a better sailor.

                                 TED
                        I’ll drink to that!

           Ted grabs Gargan and gives him an overly enthusiastic side 
           hug as he swings back his drink.

                                 GARGAN
                        As long as we're raising glasses, 
                        we ought to raise a few more for 
                        the Boiler Room Girls.

                                 TED
                        Quite right!

           Ted steps up on the coffee table with Mary Jo and Esther. 
           Puts his arms around both.

                                 TED (CONT’D)

                        this too!

           Gargan turns down the radio. The Lyons sisters saunter in. 
           Markham hobbles behind with his shirt now untucked.

                        name. Joey Gargan and I don't share 
                        a name. We share a lifetime bond.

                        thought we gave you a name like 
                        that because we put all the 
                        pressure in the world on you. And

                        had such a fire in your bellies... 
                        it burned so hot, wanting to live

                        you've proven yourselves more than 
                        worthy.

                             (raises glass)
                        To family.

           Ted takes a big long drink. The room erupts into loud cheers.

                                 MARKHAM
                        And to Teddy! To the White House in 
                        '72!

           THUNDEROUS APPLAUSE. Twice as loud. Ted doesn't react. 
           Markham’s words reverberate as Ted stares with an all-
           consuming focus into his glass. 

           The SOUND NEARLY DROPS OUT. Ted’s fixation intensifies as the 
           cheers become muffled --

           INT. LAWRENCE COTTAGE - LATER

           Ted remains motionless, still staring into his glass. The first 
           audible sound is the familiar yet haunting instrumental opening 
           of the popular Frank Sinatra song playing on the radio.

                                 FRANK SINATRA (V.O.)
                        And now, the end is here / And so I 
                        face the final curtain / My friend, 
                        I'll say it clear

           The SOUND COMES BACK INTO FOCUS as Ted finally looks away 
           from the glass.

           He surveys a much more chaotic party than was last seen. 
           Knocked over lamps cast ominous shadows along the wall. The 
           table of liquor covered in mostly empty, overturned bottles. 
           A May-December couple sucks face in the corner.
                                 TED
                        Paul, turn it up, will ya?

           Markham turns up the volume. Ted, quietly revels in this 
           song, singing it quietly into his drink.

                                 TED (CONT’D)
                        “Regrets, I've had a few / But then 
                        again, too few to mention / I did 
                        what I had to do and saw it through 
                        without exemption”

           As the song builds so does the bluster with which Ted sings it.

                                 TED (CONT’D)
                        "I planned each charted course, 
                        each careful step along the byway
                        And more, much more than this, I 
                        did it my way"

           Ted circles the room, passing by nearly every guest, grabbing 
           Gargan and Mary Jo particularly. When he grabs them, its 
           obvious he's singing this song from the deepest and darkest 
           place in his soul. Then the horn section comes in.

                                 TED (CONT’D)
                        "Yes, there were times, I'm sure 
                        you knew / When I bit off more than 
                        I could chew"

           Ted sings with absolute gusto as he stands at the center of 
           everyone's attention. Though he performs entirely for 
           himself.

                                 TED (CONT’D)
                        “But through it all, when there was 
                        doubt / I ate it up and spit it out
                        I faced it all and I stood tall and 
                        did it my way”

           Ted hits the crescendo with the force of an opera singer. Out 
           of breath, he nearly collapses into a nearby chair. The room 
           erupts into a polite applause.

           Markham comes up behind Ted and pats him on the shoulder.

                                 MARKHAM
                        That was great, Ted! Are you even 
                        sure you want to be President?

           Ted continues to face forward as Markham smiles, oblivious.

                                 TED
                        Well...I sure as hell don’t want to 
                        get my ass shot off.
           INT. LAWRENCE COTTAGE - LATER

           Ted sits alone on the couch, the party in full swing around 
           him. He tosses back the last few drops in his glass. Ted gets 
           up and spots Gargan in conversation with Mary Jo, who laughs 
           hysterically.

                                 GARGAN
                        You should come up for a Red Sox 
                        game. We could get Ethel and the 
                        whole family together. They’d love 
                        to see you again.

                                 MARY JO
                        You just want me there to babysit 
                        those eleven kids of hers.

                                 GARGAN
                        Yastrzemski’s on fire. Can you 
                        blame me?

                                 MARY JO
                        I’ve been offered the chance to run 
                        a mayoral campaign in Jersey City. 
                        If I’m coming all the way up to 
                        Boston, I’m watching Yastrzemski.

                                 GARGAN
                        A girl who re-wrote speeches by the 
                        great Ted Sorenson shouldn’t be 
                        wasting her time on mayoral 
                        campaigns --

           Ted walks over and pulls Mary Jo gently away by the hand, 
           cutting Gargan off mid-sentence.

                                 TED
                        Want to step away with me, dear?

                        Sure. Want to go for a walk?

                        How about we go for a drive?

           Mary Jo smiles. As they exit, she grabs a silk scarf from her 
           purse on the entryway table and follows Ted out the door.

           EXT. LAWRENCE COTTAGE - MOMENTS LATER

           The gravel crunches beneath Ted’s shoes as he steps into the 
           driver’s seat.  

           The V8 engine roars to life. The car idles for a moment 
           before it pulls out of the driveway and into the darkness.
           INT. EDGARTOWN POLICE STATION - DAY

           A pair of rubber flip flops SLAP against cheap linoleum tile. 
           The pace quickens as the flopping echoes through the hall. 

           Blood drips from the man's big toe. A weathered SECRETARY, 
           mid-50s, startles as he approaches. 

                                 MAN (O.S.)
                        Hold all my calls.

           The man pushes through a door with a sign that reads: "Chief 
           of Police Dominick Arena". 

           INT. CHIEF ARENA'S OFFICE - DAY

           A small, wood-paneled room with bright fluorescent lighting.

           Ted sits behind the chief's desk, looking like he's dressed 
           for a photo shoot with his sailboat. Every hair in its place 
           and a white sweater tied around his neck. 

           Markham stands by Ted's side in the ruffled suit from last 
           night, unkempt hair and bloodshot eyes.

                                 TED
                        Good morning, Chief.

           CHIEF DOMINICK ARENA, mid-40s, stands in the doorway wearing 
           a wet, DARK-PLAID BATHING SUIT. His police shirt is 
           unbuttoned revealing a damp, white undershirt.

                                 CHIEF ARENA
                        Senator.

                                 CHIEF ARENA
                        Go ahead.

           Ted reads from a sheet of paper filled with scribbled 
           handwriting.

                                 TED
                        “On July 18, 1969, at approximately

           EXT. CHAPPAQUIDDICK ISLAND - SCHOOL ROAD - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

           From overhead, Ted’s Oldsmobile cruises along a paved street. 
           The headlights pierce through pitch black darkness. The brake 
           lamps ignite, casting a red haze over the brush behind them.
                                 TED (V.O.)
                        “I was driving my car on Main 
                        Street on my way to get the ferry 
                        back to Edgartown.”

           The car creeps towards an intersection. A paved road curves 
           slightly to the left. A dirt path juts off to the right.

                                 TED (V.O.)
                        “I was unfamiliar with the road and 
                        turned right onto Dike Road instead 
                        of bearing hard left on Main Street.”

           The car makes a methodical hard right turn, rolling off the 
           pavement and onto the unpaved dirt of Dike Road.  

           The headlights pass over a sign reading "FERRY" with an arrow 
           pointing back the opposite direction. 

           INT. OLDSMOBILE - DIKE ROAD - CONTINUOUS

           Ted sits behind the wheel with his hands at ten and two.

                                 TED (V.O.)
                        “There was one passenger with me.”

           Mary Jo sits on the far side of the bench seat, a polite 
           stranger. This behavior is in stark contrast with what has 
           come before.

           EXT. CHAPPAQUIDDICK ISLAND - DIKE BRIDGE - NIGHT

           The Oldsmobile rolls steadily down Dike Road. 

           The car turns slightly past the dense treeline revealing 
           Poucha Pond. Despite its name, as seen here, the current 
           rushes like a raging river. 

           Tires kick up dirt as the car starts to roll down a slight 
           hill. It rapidly picks up speed as it approaches Dike Bridge.

           IN SLOW MOTION --

           The Senator and Mary Jo have a perfunctory conversation. The 
           hood of the car crosses over the bridge...

           Tires punch up against the edge of the bridge's wooden slats. 

           Ted flashes his signature politician smile to Mary Jo. Both 
           completely unaware. 

           A loose board rattles. The surrounding planks flex. The car 
           lumbers over Dike Bridge.

           BACK TO REAL TIME. A series of horrifying, visceral moments:
           - Ted's foot SLAMS on the brakes.
           - Rubber burns tire tracks into the wood.
           - Mary Jo SCREAMS in terror.
           - The car launches off the bridge, flying through the air.
           - The weight of the engine pulls the car into a forward roll.
           - Mary Jo SLAMS her head against the windshield.
           - Ted squeezes his eyes shut, bracing for impact.
           - The car flips upside down as it crashes.
           - Water surges through the air.
           - Bubbles rise to the surface as the car sinks below. 

           The current flows over the remains of the Oldsmobile for one 
           more extended beat.

                                 TED (V.O.)
                        “I attempted to open the door and 
                        window of the car but have no 
                        recollection of how I got out.”

           The only thing out of place in this serene summer coastline 
           is the ghostly visage of headlights creeping below sea level.

           Ted BURSTS to the surface. GASPING for air.

           His body is immediately ripped away from the car by a rush of 
           water. He pushes through it, kicks his legs and pulls forward.

           Ted nears the shoreline. He stands up, still waist deep in 
           the water. Immediately, he grabs his back, in severe agony. 

           He scans the surroundings, uncertain of his bearings.  A look 
           of dread washes over his face as he sees the headlamps.

                                 TED
                        Mary Jo! MARY JO! MARY JO!

           Ted dives headfirst back into the water. With every stroke, 
           he winces in pain but inches closer to the submerged vehicle.

                                 TED (CONT’D)
                        Mary! Mary Jo! Can you hear me?!

           Ted swims to the middle of the pond surrounded by complete 
           darkness. He splashes frantically around the lights below 
           him. His hand suddenly finds a grasp. The rear wheel well.

           Holding himself in place, Ted feels around for a door handle.

                                 TED (CONT’D)
                        HELP! HELP! SOMEONE PLEASE!

           His fingers strain to hold on. The current pushes Ted with 
           such great force he must let go. Undeterred, he dives down.

           UNDERWATER 
           Ted plunges into the darkness. He moves around the perimeter 
           of the car, but can't see his own hands in front of his face. 

           He finds a door handle. Pulls it as hard as he can. Nothing 
           budges. The strain on his face masks his sheer desperation.

           SURFACE 

           Ted rushes back above water, coughing and fighting for air.

                                 TED (CONT’D)
                        Please. Please. God. No.

           Ted takes a giant breath and dives down again.

           UNDERWATER 

           Ted circles the car. He struggles through the darkness to 
           find a way inside. Out of breath, he returns to the surface.

                                 TED (V.O.)
                        “I...repeatedly dove down...in an 
                        attempt to see if the passenger was 
                        still in the car.”

           Ted reenters view and continues searching for an entry point. 
           He bangs on the window, but underwater his fists can't break 
           the glass. He resurfaces again.

           He dives down once more with no clear objective.

                                 TED (V.O.)
                        “I was unsuccessful in the attempt.”

           EXT. POUCHA POND BEACH - NIGHT

           Ted trudges up the beachhead. Every step through the water 
           and deep sand, a struggle. Exhausted, he collapses.

           Ted sits up and buries his head in his knees. After a long 
           silence, he lifts his eyes and peers out to the water. He can 
           barely process what is happening, let alone what will happen.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. POUCHA POND BEACH - LATER

           Ted still sits on the beach. His breathing now returned to 
           normal. His hair no longer wet, his body no longer cold.

           He just sits there. Staring. For a long beat.

           An uncomfortably long beat.
           EXT. CHAPPAQUIDDICK ISLAND - DIKE ROAD - NIGHT

           A pair of fine leather shoes, soaking wet, SQUISH along a 
           gravel road. With each step, water seeps through the tongue. 

           The entire area surrounding Ted is dark and desolate. There 
           is NO AMBER HUE, in contrast with what was seen before. 

                                 TED (V.O.)
                        “I recall walking back to where my 
                        friends were eating.”

           EXT. LAWRENCE COTTAGE - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

           Ted approaches Lawrence Cottage, resembling the peaceful 
           beauty of an Edward Hopper painting. Through a window, all 
           the party guests enjoy a nice steak dinner with large glasses 
           of water in front of their plates.

           Ted walks over to an empty, white Plymouth Valiant. Opens one 
           of the back doors and takes a seat.  

           IN THE CAR

           Ted looks at his watch. Taps it a few times. It's dead. 

           He looks up to the dash. An ornate analog in-dash clock reads 
           12:20 AM. A shadow passes in front of the dashboard. 

           Ted turns to see Ray LaRosa standing outside.

                                 TED
                        Get me Joe Gargan. We got a problem.

           EXT. CHAPPAQUIDDICK ISLAND - SCHOOL ROAD - NIGHT

           The Plymouth Valiant races towards the intersection where the 
           paved road continues along a curve.

                                 TED (V.O.)
                        “I then asked someone to bring me 
                        back to Edgartown.”

           EXT. CHAPPAQUIDDICK ISLAND - FERRY LANDING - NIGHT

           The quiet city lights of Edgartown shine across the harbor, 
           blocked by a metal gate with a sign reading: “FERRY CLOSED”.

           The Valiant, with open doors, sits parked in front of the 
           blocked ferry entrance. An argument ensues. Gargan shoves 
           Markham to the side and gets inches from Ted's face.
                                 GARGAN
                        There’s no two ways about it! You 
                        have to report this to the police. 
                        You. Not me.

           Ted barely listens. Practically waving Gargan off.

                                 TED
                        Alright. I’m tired of listening to 
                        you. I’ll take care of it.

           He hops over the gate and walks toward the water.

                                 GARGAN
                        So you’re going to report it?

                                 TED
                             (without looking back)
                        I’ll take care of it.

           Ted leaps into the water, splashing into the flowing current.

           Gargan and Markham exchange shocked looks of confusion. They 
           stand baffled and motionless as Ted recedes into the dark.

           EXT. EDGARTOWN HARBOR CHANNEL - NIGHT

           Ted struggles to keep himself moving forward. With each breath, 
           he heaves in all the air he can. He’s only halfway to shore.

           EXT. EDGARTOWN COASTLINE STREET - LATER

           Ted strains as he climbs up the shoreline to an empty street.

                                 TED (V.O.)
                        “I remember walking around for a 
                        period of time and then going back 
                        to my hotel room.”

           EXT. SHIRETOWN INN - LATER

           Ted trudges up the stairs towards the entrance.

           A MONTAGE OF EXTREMELY QUICK CUTS --

           - IN THE STAIRWELL, Ted takes out his key.
           - IN TED’S ROOM, he peels off his soaking wet clothes.
           - IN THE CLOSET, Ted grabs pants, dress shirt and jacket.
           - IN THE COURTYARD, a HOTEL CLERK passes by Ted.

                                 TED
                        Do you have the time?
                                 HOTEL CLERK
                        Oh. Sure. It’s...uh...2:25.

               - BACK IN TED’S ROOM, Ted removes his dry clothes.
               - IN THE BATHROOM, Ted showers, warm water rolling over him. 
               - IN TED’S ROOM, he collapses in his bed, the phone right in 
                 front of his face. He shuts his eyes.
               - MORNING. Sunlight fills the room. Ted turns over. AWAKE.
               - OVER BRUNCH, Ted laughs with fellow socialites.
               - OUTSIDE AT FERRY LANDING, Ted speaks into a pay phone.
               - ON THE FERRY, the wind blows through Ted’s hair.
               - AT THE POLICE STATION, Ted pulls open the door.

           END MONTAGE.

           INT. CHIEF ARENA'S OFFICE - PRESENT

           Behind the chief’s desk, Ted pauses. Sets down the paper he’s 
           been reading from and looks directly into Chief Arena's eyes.

                                 TED
                        “When I fully realized what 
                        happened this morning, I 
                        immediately contacted the police.”

           Chief Arena takes a long beat, his brain racing and yet 
           slowly processing all this information.

                                 CHIEF ARENA
                        Well, I’m glad you’re okay, Senator.
           EXT. LAWRENCE COTTAGE - NIGHT

           The gravel crunches beneath Ted’s feet as he steps into the 
           driver’s seat. The V8 engine roars to life. The Oldsmobile 
           idles and pulls out of the driveway and into the darkness.

           EXT. CHAPPAQUIDDICK ISLAND - SCHOOL ROAD - NIGHT

           From overhead, Ted’s Oldsmobile cruises along a paved street. 
           The brake lamps ignite, casting a red haze over the brush.

           This time, far from the intersection, the car turns left onto 
           a dirt path leading into a secluded wooded field.

           INT. LAWRENCE COTTAGE - NIGHT

           The raucous party remains in full swing as “Sweet Cherry 
           Wine” by Tommy James and the Shondells blares on the radio. 
           All the girls dance sensually with their partners. 

           Gargan pours a drink at the wet bar. He sees CRICKET KEOUGH, 
           23, in a corner by herself, nursing an empty glass. 

           He takes a deep breath, fixes his comb over, and walks as 
           confidently as he can over to her. Hands her the drink.

                                 GARGAN
                        Thought you looked a little thirsty.

                                 CRICKET
                        Thanks.

           Cricket takes a sip. His confidence bolstered, Gargan goes 
           with a more direct approach and puts his arm around her side.

                                 GARGAN
                        So...is this your first time in 
                        Martha’s Vineyard?

           Cricket gives a polite, uncertain smile to the older 
           gentleman she knows mostly as “the host of the party”.

                                 CRICKET
                        Yeah, I’ve always dreamt of coming 
                        here. What about you? Is this your 
                        first time here too?

           Gargan can’t hide his befuddlement at this absurd question.

                                 GARGAN
                        No...actually, I’ve been sailing in 
                        the race with Teddy for years.

                                 CRICKET
                        Oh, wow. Did you know Bobby too?
                                 GARGAN
                        Uh. Yes. He’s actually the one who 
                        taught me and Teddy how to sail.

           Her eyes widen not recognizing Gargan’s patronizing tone.

                                 CRICKET
                        Wow. I’ll bet he was a great sailor.

                                 GARGAN
                        You know, he actually wasn’t a 
                        great sailor.

                                 CRICKET
                             (incredulous)
                        Really?

                                 GARGAN
                        It’s okay, I can say that kind of 
                        thing. We were brothers.

           Cricket rolls her eyes.

                                 CRICKET
                        Nice try.

           He slouches, crestfallen.

                                 GARGAN
                        ...I’m adopted.

                                 CRICKET
                        Guess that explains why you don’t 
                        have that trademark Kennedy charm?

           EXT. CHAPPAQUIDDICK ISLAND - FIELD - NIGHT

           Mary Jo’s naked body writhes into frame. She runs her hands 
           down Ted’s chest and up along her own as the sensations rise 
           to a climax. 

           She rolls off Ted, and they stare up at the sky. Rolling 
           black clouds block whatever stars there might be beyond the 
           trees surrounding them.

                                 MARY JO
                        Should we go back to the party now?

                                 TED
                        Not just yet.

           EXT. CHAPPAQUIDDICK ISLAND - FIELD - LATER

           From the roadway, the car blocks the view of Ted and Mary Jo. 
           The moment now passed, Mary Jo fastens her light blue bra. 
           Ted refastens his back brace.

                                 MARY JO
                        Do you know how long you’ll have to 
                        wear that for?

                                 TED
                        It might be for my whole life. I 
                        don’t really know.

                                 MARY JO
                        That seems like a long time.

                                 TED
                        Well, for surviving a plane crash, 
                        I’d call it a fair trade-off.

           Ted slips his arm through his shirt. Mary Jo slips into her 
           blouse but pauses. She gazes at Ted, who buttons up, unaware.

                                 MARY JO
                        You know that I think you’re funny.

                                 TED
                        Good.

                                 MARY JO
                        I don’t know if you do...but I want 
                        you to know that you don’t have to 
                        feel like you need to make a joke 
                        out of everything with me.

                                 TED
                        Well, I appreciate the option.

                                 MARY JO
                        Why do you?

                                 TED
                        “Why do I” what?

                                 MARY JO
                        Make a joke out of everything.

           Ted reaches his top button and looks Mary Jo in the eye.

                                 TED
                        I lead a serious life. I don't want 
                        everything in my life to be serious.

                                 MARY JO
                        That's not a choice most people 
                        feel like they have to make.

           Ted turns his back as he stuffs himself into his blazer.
                                 TED
                        My dad told me..."You can have a 
                        serious life or a non-serious life, 
                        Teddy. I’ll still love you whichever 
                        choice you make. But if you decide 
                        to have a non-serious life, I won’t 
                        have much time for you."

                                 MARY JO
                        Sorry. I can't believe he'd say that.

                                 TED
                        It's okay.
                             (beat) 
                        I was just a kid.

           Mary Jo looks at him stunned, trying not to seem horrified. 
           Ted misses this completely as he turns toward her. With a 
           huge grin, he runs his hands down both her sides, making his 
           way to her uncovered lower half. Unamused, she rolls away.

                                 TED (CONT’D)
                        Are you getting what you want out 
                        of this?

                                 MARY JO
                        Yes, actually, I am.

                                 TED
                        And what is that exactly?

                                 MARY JO
                        I get to see things you don't want 
                        me to see.

           Ted raises an eyebrow, concerned.

                                 MARY JO (CONT’D)
                        Plus, you know, I'm the envy of all 
                        my girlfriends ever since I told 
                        them I've been sleeping with one of 
                        the Kennedys.

           Ted clinches his jaw to contain his rage.

                                 MARY JO (CONT’D)
                        What? You're the only one who can 
                        make a joke, Teddy?

           Ted grins even wider. He grabs her by the waist and runs his 
           hands towards the sides of her chest. Mary Jo laughs.

                                 TED
                             (smiling)
                        Well, what kind of a joke is that?
                                 MARY JO
                        Well, what kind of a question is, 
                        "Are you getting what you want out 
                        of this?"

           Mary Jo playfully pushes him away.

                                 TED
                        A serious one! You told me to be 
                        serious!

                                 MARY JO
                        Well, I seriously enjoy spending 
                        time with you, Senator. I don't 
                        think that should be any mystery. 
                        Practically, the whole country 
                        loves you.

                                 TED
                        They love the name.

                                 MARY JO
                        Maybe.

                                 TED
                             (hurt)
                        Thanks.

                                 MARY JO
                        No, seriously. You might be right.

                                 TED
                        I heard you the first time.

                                 MARY JO
                        You asked me if I was getting what 
                        I want out of this.

                                 TED
                        And you said some shit about seeing 
                        things you're not supposed to!

                                 MARY JO
                        And that's what I like about you. 
                        You're more than just a name. 
                        You're a man...you're willing to 
                        show me that the life you've chosen 
                        isn't easy.

                                 TED
                        The path that you’re on isn’t 
                        always the path that you choose.

                                 MARY JO
                        What's stopping you from choosing 
                        for yourself?
           Ted gives this question some hard thought. He stands up and 
           grabs a beer from the backseat. Cracks it open. Takes a sip.

                                 TED
                        Did you know I went to Harvard?

                                 MARY JO
                             (sarcastic)
                        No.

                                 TED
                        Did you know I got expelled?

                                 MARY JO
                        No!

           Ted sits back down, elbows on his knees, facing Mary Jo.

                                 TED
                        Yeah. Well, I did. I had this 
                        Spanish exam. And, you know...I 
                        don't speak Spanish. But my buddy 
                        Warren O'Donnell, his roommate 
                        spoke Spanish real well. So I 
                        tossed him a few bucks and had him 
                        take the test for me.

                                 MARY JO
                        And you got caught?

                                 TED
                        No. He got caught! 

           Mary Jo smiles but tries not to encourage Ted further.

                                 TED (CONT’D)
                        Either way, we both get called down 
                        to the dean’s office, and before I 
                        even had a chance to get myself out 
                        of it...we were both expelled.

                                 MARY JO
                        So what did you do?

                                 TED
                        Well, that’s the whole choice thing 
                        we were talking about.

                                 MARY JO
                        Right.

                                 TED
                        So, then I went to my father. And I 
                        tell him, “Dad, I’ve screwed up. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 TED (CONT'D)
                        But I’ve already come up with the 
                        solution.” And I tell him I’m going 
                        to Notre Dame, and I’ll be able to 
                        keep playing football and Joey’s 
                        there, and he’ll keep me on the 
                        straight and narrow.

           Mary Jo’s face goes sullen, knowing where this may be headed.

                                 TED (CONT’D)
                        He doesn’t respond to any of this. 
                        He doesn’t look at me. The first 
                        words out of his mouth are: “The 
                        dean called about an hour ago. The 
                        next call I had was with Fort Dix. 
                        You’re in the army, son. They’re 
                        expecting you tomorrow at oh eight 
                        hundred.”

           Ted laughs.

                                 MARY JO
                        That’s not funny. That’s cruel.

                                 TED
                        That’s Camelot. 

           They continue to stare into each other’s eyes but now with an 
           uncertain tension.

                                 MARY JO
                        You ready to go back to the party?

                                 TED
                        I’d rather go for a walk on the 
                        beach with you.

                                 MARY JO
                        I’d like that. 

           Mary Jo stands up, nude from the waist down. She quickly 
           grabs her pants and slides each leg into them as she walks, 
           not bothering with underwear.

           Ted follows behind closely, fastening his belt buckle as he 
           hops into the driver’s seat.

           The tires spin as Ted guns the accelerator. The car swerves 
           onto the main road, leaving the field deserted except for a 
           few empty beer bottles.

           EXT. CHAPPAQUIDDICK ISLAND - SCHOOL ROAD - NIGHT

           From overhead, Ted’s Oldsmobile cruises along a paved street. 
           The headlights pierce through pitch black darkness. The brake 
           lamps ignite, casting a red haze over the brush behind them.
           This time, instead of taking a right turn, the car continues 
           straight. Headlights from a nearby POLICE CRUISER shine onto 
           Ted and Mary Jo as they pass through the intersection. 

           They don’t seem to notice. Ted SLAMS on his brakes.

                                 TED
                        Shit!

                                 MARY JO
                        What?

                                 TED
                        I missed the turn!

           The police cruiser continues along the main road, driving in 
           the opposite direction of Ted’s car. The driver, DEPUTY 
           SHERIFF “HUCK” LOOK, 40, looks in his rear view mirror. 

           The dopey smile on his face disappears as he notices the 
           Oldsmobile stopped behind a cloud of dirt.

           Sheriff Look pulls over to the side of the road. He steps out 
           and fumbles with his hat. He walks towards the car.

                                 SHERIFF LOOK
                        You folks having some car trouble?

           The reverse lights come on. Sheriff Look reacts, puzzled.

           Suddenly the car GUNS IT BACKWARDS, barrelling towards the 
           sheriff. Ted gives the wheel a hard turn to the left.

           The black sedan takes off forward towards the fateful dirt 
           road. Sheriff Look, dumbfounded, only catches a glimpse of 
           two shadows in the front seat, the license plate, and an 
           elaborate, floral decoupaged LUNCH PAIL on the rear dash.

           The headlights pass over a sign reading "FERRY" with an arrow 
           pointing back the opposite direction. Beneath the sign, Look 
           stands in the intersection, uncertain of what he just witnessed.

           INT. OLDSMOBILE - DIKE ROAD - CONTINUOUS

           The seats rattle as Ted speeds down the bumpy road. Mary Jo 
           turns around to see Sheriff Look staring back.

                                 MARY JO
                        I think that was a policeman back 
                        there, Teddy.

                                 TED
                        I don’t stop for the police.

           Ted turns off the headlights. The car is now surrounded by 
           nothing but darkness.
                                 MARY JO
                        Ted, what are you doing?

                                 TED
                        Hang on. We’re losing him.

           Ted looks into his rear view mirror. Sheriff Look disappears 
           into the black distance.

           The car continues bouncing wildly as Ted speeds down the now 
           invisible dirt road. Mary Jo tenses up.

                                 MARY JO
                        Teddy, come on. You can’t see.

                                 TED
                        We’re almost home free. 

           Mary Jo looks through the windshield. Not even the hood of 
           the car is visible. 

           BAM. 

           The car jolts upwards.

                                 MARY JO
                             (scared)
                        Ted.

                                 TED
                        All right, all right, I hear ya.

           Ted flicks back on the headlights. Blinding. Their eyes 
           adjust. The headlights pass over a small cottage with an 
           amber porch light to the right. DIKE HOUSE.

           Ted’s focus returns to the road. He leans back into his seat. 
           Holds the wheel with one hand and rests his arm on the open 
           window frame. His bleary eyes glance down at Mary Jo as she 
           curls up close to him.

           Ted looks back to the road and stares out. The background 
           becomes even more of a blur as the car picks up speed. 
           Staring. A look of contentment crosses his face. Staring.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. CHAPPAQUIDDICK ISLAND - DIKE BRIDGE - CONTINUOUS

           The car leaps off Dike Bridge in a horrific forward roll and 
           crashes upside down into the water. It slowly sinks below the 
           surface.

           The ripples drift away returning the pond to an eerie silence.
           INT. OLDSMOBILE - UNDERWATER - CONTINUOUS

           Mary Jo hangs upside down by her seatbelt, unconscious. She 
           bleeds from a gash on her forehead. Water rushes in from all 
           sides around her. 

           The CRACKS on the windshield continue to splinter, expanding 
           until the glass gives way. 

           A SURGE OF WATER SPILLS INWARD. 

           Within seconds Mary Jo's head is completely submerged. The 
           water chokes her back to life. 

           Mary Jo flails wildly, turning towards the empty driver's 
           seat. She glimpses Ted’s legs escape out the window.

           UNDERWATER MARY JO SCREAMS. 

           She frantically tears at her seatbelt. Somehow, it unclasps.

           The car still upside down, Mary Jo turns over and heads 
           towards the floor to keep herself upright. She pushes to the 
           back seat to find the last remaining air pocket. She’s waist 
           deep.

           She coughs up a fistful of water from deep in her lungs. She 
           HYPERVENTILATES unable to fully catch her breath. 

           BELOW THE SURFACE

           Mary Jo’s bare feet hover just above shards of razor sharp 
           glass.

           Unaware, she puts all her weight on her feet for the first 
           time. The glass pierces deep into her skin.

           BACK ON MARY JO

           She SCREAMS and retracts both her feet in pain. She squeezes 
           both knees into her chest and holds back fresh tears.

                                 MARY JO
                        Ted!

           EXT. POUCHA POND BEACH - NIGHT

           Ted sits on the beachhead with his chin resting on his knees, 
           staring out. He doesn't move.

           INT. OLDSMOBILE - UNDERWATER - NIGHT

           Mary Jo braces herself against the rear passenger window. She 
           grabs the door handle and pulls with all her strength. 
           Nothing budges.
           She wades over to the rear driver’s side and grabs the other 
           handle. The door CREAKS as she tries to force her way out. 
           Still nothing.

                                 MARY JO
                        TED!

           Mary Jo pulls herself into the front seat. Here, she’s neck 
           deep in water. Her two sandals and a FLORAL LUNCH PAIL float 
           past her, but she remains focused on an escape. 

           She feels beneath her for the passenger door handle. Grabs on 
           to something and pulls as hard as she can.

           Her hands slip from the handle. Bright red from exertion. She 
           looks around, trapped.

                                 MARY JO (CONT’D)
                        TED!!!

           EXT. POUCHA POND BEACH - NIGHT

           The beach is empty and silent. Ted is gone.

           INT. OLDSMOBILE - UNDERWATER - NIGHT

           Mary Jo resurfaces in the back seat, pinching her nose. With 
           her other hand she holds the two sandals. 

           She shivers as she puts on her right sandal. The other floats 
           away in front of her. She stands with her full weight on the 
           car for the first time. 

           It CREAKS loudly, then settles.

           Mary Jo's eyes dart around with concern. She presses against 
           the edge and tries to slow her breathing below a panic.

           EXT. DIKE ROAD - NIGHT

           A pair of fine leather shoes, soaking wet, SQUISH along a 
           gravel road. With each step, water seeps through the tongue, 
           reflecting the amber hues of a nearby porch light.

           Ted slows his gait. A bright light illuminates his face.  

           He looks over towards it, squinting. A “WELCOME” mat sits 
           below the front door of the Dike House.  

           He turns back towards the road and continues out of frame. 

           Everything around the Dike House remains still as the sound 
           of Ted’s squishing shoes recedes into the distance.
           EXT. LAWRENCE COTTAGE - NIGHT

           Ted stumbles toward the cottage. Empty beer bottles litter 
           the lawn. The music from inside is muffled but booms loudly. 

           Ray LaRosa holds back Cricket Keough’s hair as she dry heaves 
           into the bushes.

           Ted lumbers over to the empty, white Plymouth Valiant out 
           front. Opens the rear door and sits in the back seat facing 
           forward. Ted SLAMS the door shut. 

           LaRosa looks up. Lets go of Cricket’s hair and goes towards 
           the car to investigate.

           IN THE CAR

           Ted looks at his watch. Taps it a few times. It's dead.  

           He looks up to the dash. The dashboard has a radio but no 
           clock. Where previously an ornate analogue in-dash clock read 
           12:20 AM there is only wood paneling. LaRosa’s shadow passes 
           in front of the dashboard.

                                 TED
                        Get me Joe Gargan. We got a problem.

                                 LAROSA
                        Sure, Teddy. What’s the trouble?

                                 TED
                        Just get him.

           LaRosa drops his smile, caught off guard by Ted’s cold 
           demeanor. He hustles back towards the cottage and enters. Ted 
           sits in stone silence, not moving a muscle.

           After a minute, LaRosa re-emerges with Gargan and the two 
           approach the car. Ted continues staring forward, dripping wet.

                                 GARGAN
                        What happened to you?

                                 TED
                             (to LaRosa)
                        You better get Paul, too.

           LaRosa runs back towards the cottage. Gargan stands over the 
           window. Ted still doesn’t look up.

                                 GARGAN
                        C’mon. Tell me what’s the big idea.

           Ted looks Gargan straight in the eye for the first time.

                                 TED
                        I’m not going to be president.
           INT. OLDSMOBILE - UNDERWATER - NIGHT

           Mary Jo holds the floral lunch pail. She unclasps the lock and 
           opens the lid with great anticipation. It’s a WOMAN’S PURSE.

           Mary Jo’s face sulks. She immediately rummages through the 
           purse hoping to find something...anything useful. She tosses 
           aside a hairbrush, which floats away. She digs deeper as --

           The HEADLIGHTS GO OUT. DARKNESS.

           The lights flicker illuminating a deeply concerned Mary Jo. 
           They snap back on for one more hopeful beat.

           EXT. CHAPPAQUIDDICK ISLAND - DIKE BRIDGE - NIGHT

           From above, the wreck glows below the surface. The 
           surrounding waters are dark reflecting the pale moon.

           The headlights flicker off. The car vanishes like a ghost.

           INT. OLDSMOBILE - UNDERWATER - NIGHT

           A chilling, unexplained CREAK comes from the car’s frame.

           Barely visible by the faintest glimmer of moonlight, Mary 
           Jo’s breath quickens to a fever pitch.

           INT. VALIANT - DIKE ROAD - NIGHT

           Gargan hunches over the steering wheel. Hands at ten and two. 
           He glances at Ted in the rear view mirror.

                                 GARGAN
                        Ted. Where the hell are we going?

                                 TED
                        The car has gone off the bridge. 
                        Down by the beach. 
                             (beat)
                        Mary Jo is in it.

           Markham looks to Gargan for how to react. Gargan just steps 
           on the gas. There’s nothing to say.

           The car barrels down the road, everyone in total silence.

           EXT. DIKE BRIDGE - NIGHT

           The Valiant slowly rolls over the bridge. Gargan and Markham 
           rubberneck, searching the surrounding waters for the crash 
           site. They see nothing out of the ordinary.
           Ted continues to stare ahead, unengaged.

                                 GARGAN
                        Where the hell is it?

                                 TED
                        It's down there.

           The Valiant reaches the other side of the bridge, onto a man-
           made peninsula with reinforced wooden sides.

           Gargan turns the car around. The headlights shine across the 
           water and onto the Dike House, the amber hues still visible.

           Gargan and Markham's shadowy figures emerge from the vehicle. 
           They step in front of the car, their silhouettes between the 
           two head beams. 

           They both look down to scan the murky water eight feet below. 

           Markham first catches a glimpse of the car's shadowy visage 
           underneath the surface.

                                 MARKHAM
                        Holy God.

           Markham hobbles with great vigor to the water’s edge, 
           prepared to dive in for a heroic rescue. He's more than a 
           little drunk and his knee injury hinders him immensely.

           Gargan ably grabs Markham by the tail of his sport coat.

                                 MARKHAM (CONT’D)
                        We gotta save her!

                                 GARGAN
                        Paul, we don’t know how this could 
                        play out. Going back to the party 
                        in soaking wet clothes limits our 
                        options.

           Gargan starts to unbutton his dress shirt. Markham follows.

           EXT. DIKE BRIDGE - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

           The current flows at a slow pace, in stark contrast to the 
           raging river seen before. 

           Markham overlooks this from the water’s edge, silhouetted by 
           the headlights and wearing only his underwear. Gargan, now 
           shirtless, unfastens his belt and removes his pants.

           Markham, determined, takes a flying leap off the peninsula. 
           He crashes into the water with a drunken belly flop.
           Gargan’s head snaps up with concern. He sprints into action 
           and takes a running jump. He flies over Markham and lands 
           much closer to the car.

           Gargan cuts through the channel. He arrives at the submerged 
           vehicle not knowing where to start. Far behind him, Markham 
           flops around with big splashes making little headway.

           Gargan steadies himself on the back tire. He stretches his 
           arm below the surface for a door handle. It’s out of reach.

           He takes a deep breath, pushes off the car and dives below.

           UNDERWATER

           Gargan scales the wreckage towards the front driver’s side. 
           He presses his feet against the side of the vehicle and pulls 
           back on the door handle with all his strength.

           It doesn’t budge.

           INT. OLDSMOBILE - UNDERWATER - NIGHT

           Mary Jo sits in the corner shivering. The metal frame of the 
           car gives off a low CREAK. Mary Jo looks up with her first 
           bit of optimism.

                                 MARY JO
                        Hello? Hello?!

           EXT. POUCHA POND - UNDERWATER - NIGHT

           Gargan, desperate and running low on air, yanks the handle 
           back and forth in rapid succession. With all his strength and 
           body weight, he snaps back. The metal door dimples but stays 
           locked in place.

           Frustrated but not finished, Gargan climbs toward the surface.

           EXT. DIKE BRIDGE - NIGHT

           Gargan emerges, gasping for air. He steadies himself on the 
           car and tries to catch his breath.

           Behind him, Markham only just arrives at the car.  

           Markham dog paddles over to the first thing he sees and grabs 
           the rear tire. It spins out from beneath his hands, and he 
           fumbles to pull himself back up again and again.

                                 GARGAN
                        Just sit there, Paul. I can’t save 
                        us both.
           Markham hops up onto the rear bumper, his head spinning.

           INT. OLDSMOBILE - UNDERWATER

           The car rumbles and sinks lower into the pond. The water 
           level rises around Mary Jo, but she doesn’t notice as she 
           pounds against the floorboard.

                                 MARY JO
                        Help! Can anyone hear me?!

           EXT. DIKE BRIDGE - NIGHT

           Gargan swims across to the passenger side. The only sounds he 
           hears are of the waves crashing in the distance and Ted 
           muttering to himself from the peninsula above.

           Ted rests his head against the hood of the Valiant, in front 
           of the headlights. A shadowed figure with a halo.

                                 TED
                             (muttering)
                        ...how could this happen to me...

           Gargan’s hand runs across another door handle. He presses the 
           button and strains with all the force he can muster. His 
           hands slip and he splashes backwards.

                                 GARGAN
                        Goddammit.

           Ted looks up, out into the water. 

                                 TED
                        If she’s not out of the car by now, 
                        she’s already dead!

                                 GARGAN
                        Maybe we’d know for sure if I had 
                        some help down here!

           Ted waves him off. Gargan grows angry and more determined. He 
           takes a deep breath and plunges below.

           UNDERWATER

           Gargan dives head first this time. He can barely see anything 
           in front of him beyond the murky black. He grabs the front 
           passenger window frame. 

           Shards of glass poke from every edge he isn’t touching.

           He pulls himself in. 
           The razor sharp points rip into Gargan’s arms, chest, and 
           back. He struggles to go backwards, but the glass only tears 
           in deeper.

           INT. OLDSMOBILE - UNDERWATER - NIGHT

           Mary Jo slams her fists against the floorboard. The car CREAKS 
           again, and she doubles her effort in a moment of hope and 
           desperation.

                                 MARY JO
                        HELP! HELP!!! PLEASE!

           Behind her, splashes can be seen behind the front seat.

           BELOW THE WATER

           Gargan tries to wrestle himself out of the window, panicking 
           as he loses oxygen. He uses all his strength to propel 
           himself out one last time. He pushes through as a large shard 
           of glass cuts further along his back.

           EXT. POUCHA POND - UNDERWATER - NIGHT

           Gargan dislodges his torso and races away from the car with 
           his last breath.

           A trail of blood follows him back up to the surface.

           INT. OLDSMOBILE - UNDERWATER - NIGHT

           The CREAKING stops and Mary Jo pauses. She looks back down. 
           The water level has risen to her chest.

           She steadies herself and tries to slow her breathing.

           EXT. POUCHA POND BEACH - NIGHT

           Gargan climbs out of the water and up the beachhead. Blood 
           drips from the gashes across his arm, back, and chest. 
           Markham limps close behind in tremendous pain. They both look 
           like they’ve had the shit kicked out of them.

           Gargan hangs his head. Defeated.

           He looks back out over the water one last time. He turns back.

           The two men walk over the bridge towards the Valiant. The 
           headlights still shine out over the water, but this time 
           neither wants to look. Hope replaced with despair.

           Gargan keeps his eyes locked on Ted. 
           The Senator hasn't moved an inch. He rests comfortably 
           against the bumper.

                                 TED
                        You guys gotta get me back to 
                        Edgartown.

           Gargan walks right past Ted in disgust. He offers no response 
           as he gathers up his clothes.

           Ted sits and glowers as the two men get dressed behind him.

           INT. OLDSMOBILE - UNDERWATER - NIGHT

           Mary Jo takes long, deliberate breaths, squeezing her eyes 
           shut tight. Suddenly, they snap open.

           She has an idea.

           Mary Jo rushes forward, takes a deep breath, and pushes 
           herself underwater.

           She reemerges in the front seat, where the water level is up 
           to her neck. Looking for leverage, she presses her arms 
           against the car.

           UNDERWATER

           Her legs extend as far as they can. Her feet press up against 
           the steering wheel.

           ABOVE WATER

           Mary Jo pushes her arms harder against the car. 

           The horn HONKS loudly.

           Mary Jo's face lights up. The tension broken, she manages to 
           let out a laugh as she honks over and over. She presses as 
           hard as she can and just lays on the horn.

           EXT. POUCHA POND BEACH - NIGHT

           From high above, the muffled horn echoes through the pond and 
           out across the beach. 

           The entire area is desolate. The Valiant is long gone. 

           The night sky reflects over the serene, calm current as the 
           honking takes on a frantic, staccato rhythm. 

           The muffled sound becomes deeper as the horn takes on water 
           and begins to malfunction. 
           It sputters and peters out in a slow death.

           INT. OLDSMOBILE - UNDERWATER - NIGHT

           The horn gives off one last wail that rings out with finality.

           Mary Jo's face turns dour. Her hopefulness and optimism now 
           replaced with a looming terror as the water rises around her.

           INT. VALIANT - CHAPPAQUIDDICK ROAD - NIGHT

           Gargan and Markham ride in the front seat, their clothes 
           soaked from the inside. They stare ahead blankly with a 
           silent discomfort. In the back, Ted MUMBLES to himself.

                                 GARGAN
                        You’ve got to make a report of the 
                        accident immediately, Ted.

           Ted jolts upright, alert and focused.

                                 TED
                        Are you fucking crazy? One of you 
                        needs to report it. Say you were 
                        driving.

                                 GARGAN
                        But you said you were driving.

                                 TED
                        We can’t exactly have the guy 
                        reporting a car accident be 
                        intoxicated.

                                 MARKHAM
                        That rules me out.

                                 TED
                        He’s got a point. I’m going to need 
                        your help, Joey. In a big way.

           Gargan SLAMS on the brakes.

           EXT. CHAPPAQUIDDICK ISLAND - FERRY LANDING - NIGHT

           The Valiant skids to a stop several yards away from a metal 
           gate with a sign reading: “FERRY CLOSED”.

           Gargan throws open his door and gets out ready for a fight. 
           He opens Ted’s door. 

                                 TED
                        I say Joey, what’s the big idea?
                                 GARGAN
                        The big idea?! When a person’s 
                        killed in an accident, the D.A. is 
                        required to file charges. You’re 
                        trying to put me on the hook for 
                        manslaughter!

           Ted slowly climbs out of the car. Gargan stands his ground 
           not offering Ted any breathing room.

                                 TED
                        No. You got it all wrong. I’m 
                        trying to get myself off the hook 
                        for manslaughter.

           Gargan steps forward, getting right into Ted’s face.

                                 GARGAN
                        How is that better?!

                                 TED
                        You’re not drunk. You don’t have a 
                        mark on your driving record.
                             (beat)
                        You’re not a Kennedy.

           This cuts into Gargan, deeper than Ted knows.

                                 GARGAN
                        So, because my last name isn’t 
                        automatically front page news you 
                        think I should confess to a crime I 
                        didn’t commit.

                                 TED
                        Listen, with you it’s not a crime. 
                        It’s not news. It’s a car accident. 
                        It goes away before it ever becomes 
                        a story.

           Gargan looks closely into Ted’s eyes. He considers this.

                                 TED (CONT’D)
                        Whaddaya, say? Ole Joey’ll fix it?

           Gargan seethes with rage at this question. 

                                 GARGAN
                        Ted. I’ve got too much to lose. Not 
                        as much as you, but enough to matter.

           Gargan walks away in contempt. Ted tries to chase after him 
           but stumbles, catching himself on the open door.

                                 TED
                        Okay, okay. What if we just say 
                        Mary Jo was driving? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 TED (CONT'D)
                        You call it in and say that you 
                        just found the whole thing.

                                 GARGAN
                        Christ, Ted. I can’t file a false 
                        police report!

           Ted hoists himself back up on the Valiant door.

                                 TED
                        Why the hell not?

                                 GARGAN
                        I’m a goddamn lawyer, remember? I 
                        could get disbarred.

                                 MARKHAM
                             (drunk, mumbling)
                        Joey’s right, Senator.

                                 TED
                             (to Gargan)
                        It’s not like this is the first 
                        time I’m asking you to bear false 
                        witness. Don’t get all high and 
                        mighty on me.

                                 GARGAN
                        This is different.

                                 TED
                        How?

                                 GARGAN
                        There could be real witnesses! 
                        Jeeze! We weren’t exactly quiet 
                        down there.

                                 TED
                        I didn’t hear you screaming for help.

                                 GARGAN
                        That’s not the fucking point!

                                 MARKHAM
                        Joey’s right, Senator.

                                 GARGAN
                        Do we even know if Mary Jo has a 
                        license? Do we even know if she can 
                        DRIVE?

                                 TED
                        I hadn’t thought of that.
                                 GARGAN
                        Exactly. And there’s a million 
                        other things I can’t think of now 
                        either because you put me in the 
                        middle of this shit storm. 
                             (beat)
                        The only advice I can give you, and 
                        I give it to you not as your friend, 
                        not as your family, but as your 
                        lawyer...you’ve got to report this 
                        thing and you’ve got to do it now.

                                 MARKHAM
                        Joey’s right, Senator.

                                 GARGAN
                        See! And now you’ve got the U.S. 
                        Attorney of Massachusetts saying 
                        the same thing.

           Ted pushes Gargan to the side and climbs over the metal gate.

                                 TED
                        Alright, alright. I’ll report it. 
                        Jeeze.

           Ted staggers towards a cheap fifteen foot boat with a motor 
           attached. He attempts to untie it from a tangled rope.

                                 GARGAN
                        Whose boat is that, Ted?

                                 TED
                        What the hell does it matter? I 
                        need you guys to take me back to 
                        Edgartown if I’m gonna call the 
                        police, don’t I?

           Ted struggles with the knots, not making much progress.

                                 GARGAN
                        Here, let me help.

                                 TED
                        Thanks, Joey.

           Ted pats Gargan on the back. Markham hurries over and takes 
           cautious steps into the boat. He gives the motor a couple of 
           quick tugs as Ted and Gargan untie the last knot and hop in. 

           The boat motors away from the island. As it recedes into the 
           distance, a nearby pay phone is revealed in the foreground 
           right next to the Valiant.
           INT. OLDSMOBILE - UNDERWATER - NIGHT

           Mary Jo presses against the sides of the backseat; the water 
           level has now risen up to her neck. She stretches her body 
           just to keep her head above water.

                                 MARY JO
                        Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord 
                        is with thee. Blessed art thou 
                        amongst women, and blessed is the 
                        fruit of thy womb, Jesus.

           Mary Jo pauses, unable to continue for a moment. Her eyes 
           well up, but she forces her emotions back down to finish.

                                 MARY JO (CONT’D)
                        Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for 
                        us sinners, now and at the hour of 
                        our death. Amen.

           Mary Jo gives a deep breath and does the sign of the cross. 
           She stands strong.

                                 MARY JO (CONT’D)
                        Hail Mary, full of grace...

           EXT. EDGARTOWN HARBOR CHANNEL - NIGHT

           From overhead, the light at the front of the boat enters 
           frame. The three men sit in silence as the boat quietly 
           motors through the harbor.

           Ted whimpers in self pity, holding back a torrent of emotion.

           Gargan keeps his focus on navigating, while Markham avoids 
           eye contact with the Senator.

           Ted bursts into undignified tears. His sobs break the silence.

           INT. OLDSMOBILE - UNDERWATER - NIGHT

           Mary Jo’s heart races. Her breathing steadies and her resolve 
           strengthens with each word of her prayer.

                                 MARY JO
                        Our Father, Who art in heaven, 
                        Hallowed be Thy Name; Thy kingdom 
                        come, Thy will be done...

           EXT. EDGARTOWN FERRY LANDING - NIGHT

           Ted wipes the last tear away from his eye. The boat nears the 
           sleepy harbor. A large yacht can be seen in the distance.
                                 TED
                        Do you think my dad can fix this?

           The yacht's cabin light turns on, illuminating the nearby 
           water. Gargan kills the motor, and the boat drifts slowly 
           towards the shore. He signals to Markham to kill the light.

                                 TED (CONT’D)
                        Well, do you?

                                 GARGAN
                        I don't know, Ted.

           The boat floats up to the shoreline. Ted stands up, unsteady.

                                 TED
                        I just don't know, Joey. I don't 
                        know how this happens. I don't know 
                        how this happens to me. Maybe there 
                        really is a curse hanging over this 
                        family.

                                 GARGAN
                        You're going to survive.

           Ted gets out of the boat.

                                 TED
                        But does it have to be like this?

                                 GARGAN
                        This is the only way it can be.
                             (beat)
                        Just give your mother a call first. 
                        Don’t make her learn about another 
                        Kennedy tragedy on the news. 

           Ted closes his eyes and nods. He knows Gargan's right. Ted 
           slowly starts to turn and walk away.

                                 GARGAN (CONT’D)
                        So you'll report it?

                                 TED
                        I'll take care of it.

           Ted shoves the front end of the boat back into the water. The 
           boat starts to turn, but Gargan keeps his eyes locked on the 
           Senator. Ted turns and walks away, disappearing into the fog.

           INT. SHIRETOWN INN - TED'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           The keys jangle as the door opens and Ted stumbles in. He 
           staggers towards the closet, shedding his clothes.
           He grabs a fresh pair of pants and shirt, then heads to the 
           bathroom. He looks into the mirror and combs his hair. Not 
           satisfied till every hair is in place.

           EXT. SHIRETOWN INN - NIGHT

           Ted, wearing a fresh sport coat and tie, enters the phone 
           booth outside the hotel. He shuts the door, attempting to 
           make as little noise as possible.

           He takes a deep breath before picking up the receiver. He 
           drops in a dime and dials.

           The phone rings. Rings.

           A woman's voice answers, half asleep.

                                 WOMAN (V.O.)
                        Hello?

                                 TED
                        I need to speak with my father.

                                 WOMAN (V.O.)
                        Ted?

                                 TED
                        Now, Ann.

           Ted taps his foot impatiently. He looks down and sees a 
           cockroach scurrying about underneath him. He stops tapping 
           his foot. The cockroach crawls underneath the door jam and 
           escapes into the night.

                                 WOMAN (V.O)
                        Okay, Ted, I have Joe for you.

           The line goes quiet. Strained breathing can be heard coming 
           from the other end.

                                 TED
                        Dad...

           Ted stops himself. He presses his head against the pay phone 
           with nervous tension as he searches for the right words.

                                 TED (CONT’D)
                        Sorry to be calling so late. I've 
                        gotten myself into the deepest kind

           Ted shuts his eyes and nods. He knows he's right. He looks up.

           INT. SHIRETOWN INN - COURTYARD - LATER

           Ted leans against the wall, waiting at the bottom of the 
           steps leading to his room. It appears he’s been standing 
           there for some time when a HOTEL CLERK passes through.

                                 TED
                        Excuse me. There's a loud party 
                        going on upstairs. Do you have the 
                        time?

                                 HOTEL CLERK
                        Oh. Sure. It’s...uh...2:25.

           Ted buttons his sport coat and tucks in his tie.  The hotel 
           clerk stares at him confused.

                                 TED
                        I'm having trouble sleeping.

                        Oh. Sorry. I didn't realize you 
                        were trying to sleep. I'll look 
                        into that right away, Senator.

           INT. OLDSMOBILE - UNDERWATER - NIGHT

           Mary Jo shivers, submerged up to her chin. She breathes with 
           quick, short bursts. Not due to panic, the oxygen runs low.

           She looks around, sure she needs to make a move. Mary Jo 
           takes the deepest breath she can. 

           She dives below.

           BELOW THE WATER

           Mary Jo heads straight for the rear passenger window. She 
           paddles forward through the opening.

           Her slim upper torso slides through the window with ease. 
           SNAG.

           She jerks backwards and stalls. She’s caught on something.

           The gold chain around her waist is snagged on to a long, 
           sharp piece of glass. She can't see this. 

           SHE THRASHES. 

           Her limbs convulse as she attempts to free herself. Her eyes 
           burst open as she feels her lungs collapsing.

           Mary Jo reverses course. 

           The chain loosens, freeing her as she reenters the car. 

           ABOVE THE WATER

           Mary Jo explodes back above the surface. She GASPS a piercing 
           wail of a lifesaving breath.

           Her face contorts in terror, sure she can't do that again.

           INT. SHIRETOWN INN - TED’S HOTEL BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Ted stands in the shower. He leans back with his eyes closed 
           letting the warm water roll over him.

           INT. OLDSMOBILE - UNDERWATER - NIGHT

           Mary Jo leans back to get her mouth fully into the air pocket 
           above her. The gap between the water level and the car has 
           narrowed considerably.

           INTERCUT

               - IN THE BATHROOM, TED brushes his teeth with great care.
               - MARY JO slips from her perch. She strains just to keep her 
                 mouth above water.
               - IN TED’S ROOM, he folds clothes with meticulous precision.
               - MARY JO’s breath quickens, unable to get enough oxygen to 
                 last more than a moment.
               - TED buttons up the last button of his silk pajamas.
               - MARY JO pushes herself up toward the floorboard as the 
                 water rises slightly.
               - IN BED, Ted crawls under the covers and turns off the lamp. 
                 The phone right in front of his face.
               - MARY JO faces upward coughing as water starts to fill the 
                 last remaining pocket of air.
               - TED sleeps peacefully.
           EXT. POUCHA POND - DAWN

           The sun makes its earliest peak above the horizon. Dike 
           Bridge remains covered in nightshade.

           INT. OLDSMOBILE - UNDERWATER - DAWN

           Mary Jo makes incredibly quick, strained wheezing noises in 
           the smallest air pocket yet. Less than an inch of space 
           exists between the floorboard and the water. Her purple lips 
           press against the fabric.

           Mary Jo moans as she struggles to pull air into her lungs. 
           Her eyes grow wide, a disturbing bloodshot red.

           The car goes silent. Still.

           Dark. 

           Mary Jo is dead.

           INT. OLDSMOBILE - UNDERWATER- DAY

           Sun shines brightly in from the windshield revealing for the 
           first time a full view of Mary Jo’s body, bathed in 
           chiaroscuro light. 

           Rigor mortis has set in; she remains in the same contorted 
           position as when she gasped her last breath.

           Her hair drifts in front of her face as the rest of the scene 
           remains still.

           EXT. POUCHA POND - DAY

           A blue Ford station wagon sits parked on the man-made 
           peninsula across Dike Bridge. Nearby, MR. SAMUEL, mid 40s, 
           and his son, DONNIE, 8, dangle their legs off the side of the 
           bridge, fishing rods in hand. 

           Mr. Samuel looks over at his son beaming with pride. Donnie 
           turns to his dad with a smile, but a glint of light hits him 
           right in the eye.

           Donnie turns to the light reflection behind him. He stands up 
           and walks over to investigate.

           He looks deep into Poucha Pond but still only sees a shadowy, 
           dark shape with a light reflecting off the metallic surface.

                                 DONNIE
                        Dad! Come look!
           Mr. Samuel strolls up and leans over to see.

           The visage of the submerged Oldsmobile becomes immediately 
           clear to him.

           He jolts up. Deep concern in his face.

           In one continuous take, he runs down the bridge. Pumping his 
           arms to gain speed as he goes up the road to Dike House. He 
           arrives out of breath at the “WELCOME” mat. Desperate knocks 
           at the door.

                                 MR. SAMUEL
                        There's been an accident off the 
                        bridge. I need to call the police, 
                        right away.

           As the door opens, the amber porch light turns off.

           INT. SHIRETOWN INN - PATIO - DAY

           At this early hour, the Shiretown Inn patio has few patrons. 

           Fine linens and place settings surround Ted as busboys 
           prepare for the most elegant brunch in Martha's Vineyard. 

           Ted leans back into his chair. He flaps the sides of his New 
           York Times and puts his feet up on the table.

           The date reads: "SATURDAY, JULY 19TH, 1969".

           The front page headlines read: 

           - "NIXON PROPOSES U.S. AID IN BIRTH CONTROL"
           - "MOSCOW SAYS THAT LUNA 15 WON'T BE IN APOLLO'S WAY"

           EXT. DIKE BRIDGE - DAY

           Overlooking the submerged wreckage, the father and son lean 
           over Dike Bridge joined by a few other locals. Behind them, a 
           police cruiser door pops open.

           Chief Arena walks up and looks out over the water.

                                 CHIEF ARENA
                        So, that's the car there?

                        Survey the damage.

           The locals shoot Arena incredulous looks.

                        Well...does anyone have a bathing 
                        suit I can borrow?

           EXT. SHIRETOWN INN - DAY

           Ted enters the phone booth outside the hotel. The street 
           bustles with locals and seaside tourists. He shuts the door.

           Ted pulls out a pocket-sized address book. He flips past the 
           well-worn leather cover and straight to the middle. He scans 
           his finger across a couple of names. Each name has an 
           accompanying descriptor.

           His finger taps on the desired entry:

           "Ted Sorensen - Speechwriter, lawyer - ‘My intellectual blood 
           bank’ - Jack"

           Ted drops a dime and dials. The phone rings. His eyes dart 
           back and forth at the many passersby.

           RING.

           One of the tourists makes eye contact with Ted.

           RING.

           The tourist grabs his wife and points in Ted's direction. 
           They smile and wave with excitement at this chance encounter 
           with a public figure.

           Ted tightens his grip on the phone and grits his teeth.

                                 SORENSEN (V.O.)
                        This is Ted Sorensen.

                        needs someone with your legal and 
                        public relation skills.

           Small beads of sweat have formed at Ted's brow. He cranes his

           Sunlight beams pierce through a crack in the curtains, 
           illuminating a littered room filled with empty beer bottles.

           Gargan sleeps, passed out with his face pressed against the 
           floor. Above him, Markham lays sprawled out fully dressed on 
           the couch.

           SIREN.

           Gargan jolts up. Markham snores as Gargan stumbles over to 
           the window and pulls open the curtain.

           A small fire engine tears out of the volunteer fire house 
           across the street and races past the cottage.

           Gargan looks at his watch.

                                 GARGAN
                        Shit.

           EXT. DIKE BRIDGE - DAY

           Chief Arena sits on the edge of the bumper in a dark-plaid 
           swimsuit and a diver's mask, stripped of whatever dignity his 
           uniform offered him.

           Squad cars and the fire engine move through the growing 
           crowd. Near the shore, Sheriff Look stands holding the radio 
           out the window of his cruiser.

                                 SHERIFF LOOK
                        Dive team’s here, Chief.

           Arena spins around to see JOHN FARRAR, mid-30s, a solitary 
           athletic man in full scuba gear, stepping off the fire engine.
                                 ARENA
                        “Team” implies more than one 
                        person, Deputy.

           Farrar pulls the scuba cap over his head and shouts back. 

                                 FARRAR
                        Don’t you worry. If there's anyone 
                        down there, I'll have 'em up in ten 
                        minutes.

           He pulls down his mask and jumps in. From above the bridge, 
           onlookers watch as he enters the car through the driver’s 
           side window.

           The chief looks around, feeling useless. He barks out to his 
           squad car.

                                 CHIEF ARENA
                        What's taking so long to find out 
                        whose damn car this is?!

           Sheriff Look pulls his head out from the passenger window.

                                 SHERIFF LOOK

           There's a quick knock against the glass. Ted spins around. 

           Stan Moore stands waving with his friend Ross Richards. The 
           two men who beat Ted in the race yesterday dress in identical

           An officer in the front of the crowd steps away, revealing 
           Gargan and Markham. Gargan seethes.

                                 GARGAN
                        He didn’t report it, the son of a 
                        bitch.

           Gargan storms off towards the Valiant.

           INT. SHIRETOWN INN - PATIO - DAY

           The dining hall bustles with activity around Ted, who stares 
           off with a vacant, groused look.

           Sitting across from him, Stan holds court at the table, which 
           also includes Ross Richards and MARILYN RICHARDS, who feigns 
           interest beneath a luxurious hat.

                                 STAN MOORE
                        ...so that's when I shove the guy.

           From Ted's POV, Gargan and Markham walk past the entrance of 
           the patio restaurant. They both appear to catch a glimpse of 
           Ted as they pass out of view. Ted gives a deep look of 
           concern, having been potentially spotted.

                                 STAN MOORE (CONT’D)
                        And he's so drunk...he stumbles 
                        eight feet back right through the 
                        terrace. POW!

           Gargan and Markham return back to the entryway. Gargan locks 
           eyes with Ted and stomps into the main dining area.

           Ted slumps in his chair. They definitely spotted him. 

           Amongst the many finely-attired diners, Gargan and Markham’s 
           wrinkled clothes, sweaty hair, and bleary eyes make them 
           stick out like unwelcome guests.

                                 STAN MOORE (CONT’D)
                        And, would you believe it? This guy 
                        falls ass backwards right in front 
                        of a security guard!

           Gargan's face boils bright red. His eyes remain locked on Ted 
           as he approaches the table. Markham limps slowly behind. He 
           squints and rubs his head, hungover.

           Ted's eyes drift up to Gargan, who hovers over the table. 
           Stan only just takes notice.

                                 STAN MOORE (CONT’D)
                        Oh, hey! Joey! You're going to want 
                        to hear this!
                                 MARILYN RICHARDS
                        No. You really don't. This is my 
                        third time not wanting to hear it.

           Gargan doesn't acknowledge anyone else at the table. He 
           continues staring daggers into Ted.

                                 GARGAN
                        Ted. I need to speak with you in 
                        your room. Right. Now.

           Ted settles into his chair. Leans way back, relaxed.

                                 TED
                        C'mon, Joey. Don't be rude. The 
                        Richards --

                                 GARGAN
                        TED. I need to speak with you. It's 
                        a matter of some importance.

                                 TED
                        Okay, okay. Let me pay the...

                                 GARGAN
                        Now Ted. I'd like to see you. 
                        Right. Now.

           Gargan has attracted the attention of most of the diners now. 
           He huffs and puffs with a combination of rage and exhaustion.

           INT. OLDSMOBILE - UNDERWATER - DAY

           The hair floats above Mary Jo's dead body, bathed in 
           chiaroscuro light, in the same contorted position.

           From below, Farrar enters the crime scene. He grabs a hold of 
           Mary Jo's waist to pull her out, but she doesn't budge. He 
           goes to pry away her hands. They are both gripped deep into 
           the back passenger seat.

           With some effort, he frees her corpse. It starts to float. 
           Farrar pulls her buoyant remains back down with him.

           He exits the car and pulls her out the window with ease...at 
           least at first --

           SNAG. 

           Mary Jo's body jerks to a full stop. Farrar looks back. Sees 
           the gold chain around her waist caught on the same long shard 
           of glass.

           He quickly floats back and releases the chain. Hand over 
           hand, he swiftly extracts the rest of her body.
           EXT. DIKE BRIDGE - DAY

           From the view of the bridge, the body surfaces out of the 
           water, face down. Farrar follows shortly thereafter. The 
           crowd of onlookers at the bridge GASP, horrified at the 
           sight. Parents cover their children's eyes.

           Chief Arena looks on with a cold, dumbfounded intensity.

                                 CHIEF ARENA
                        Do you recognize her? Is it one of 
                        the Kennedy clan?

                                 FARRAR
                        I wouldn't know.

           Off his annoyed look, Farrar flips the body over to have it 
           ID'd, revealing Mary Jo's face. Her bloodshot eyes and purple 
           extremities are the stuff of nightmares. From the shore, 
           Sheriff Look and a few bystanders turn away out of respect.

                                 CHIEF ARENA
                        I don't recognize her. It's not one 
                        of the clan. Thank God.

                                 SHERIFF LOOK
                        What to now, Chief?

                                 CHIEF ARENA
                        We ought to handle this thing by 
                        the book. Get me someone from the 
                        D.M.V. Get me the coroner and the 
                        medical examiner. And somebody, 
                        please, get me Senator Ted Kennedy.

           INT. SHIRETOWN INN - TED'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY

           Markham slams the door behind him. He locks the dead bolt. 
           Gargan paces the room with pounding footsteps. He towers 
           above Ted, who sits on the end of his bed staring up at him.

                                 GARGAN
                        What the fuck is going on?!

                                 TED
                        Now, just wait a minute here, Joey.

                                 GARGAN
                        You were supposed to report the 
                        fucking accident!

           Ted demurs with a petulant look.

                                 MARKHAM
                        Joey's right, Senator.
                                 GARGAN
                        What happened last night?

           Ted gives a childlike shrug of non-remorse, as he reclines 
           back on the bed. 

                                 TED
                        I didn't report it.

           Gargan explodes.

                                 GARGAN
                        What ON EARTH would make you think 
                        that was a good idea?

           Ted offers little more than a passive shrug.

                                 GARGAN (CONT’D)
                        We're ALL in real trouble now. How 
                        could you let this much time go by 
                        without saying a word?

                                 TED
                        Did the police arrive at the 
                        cottage last night?

                                 GARGAN
                        No.

                                 TED
                        Well, don't you think they'd have 
                        gotten there within the hour if I 
                        had reported it?

           Gargan drops his guard, thrown off by this question.

                                 GARGAN
                        I guess. But --

           Ted sits back up.

                                 TED
                        I thought this matter had been 
                        handled, Joey. I thought I could 
                        count on you. 

           Ted roars to his feet and wags a finger in Gargan's face.

                                 TED (CONT’D)
                        The moment the police didn't arrive 
                        at the cottage you should’ve known.
                             (beat)
                        It was your responsibility to alert 
                        the authorities. 

           Ted walks past Gargan and stares out through the French doors 
           leading out onto his balcony. 
                                 GARGAN
                        Ted, I don't see how you can say --

                                 TED
                        You completely bungled this, Joey. 
                        Now I have to deal with this myself.

                                 GARGAN
                        We’re all three implicated now. You 
                        can’t just go off and pull this 
                        John Wayne shit. They’re treating 
                        this like a crime. For Chrissakes, 
                        there’s a dead girl out there.

           Ted turns to face Gargan, who speaks with a sobering intensity.

                                 GARGAN (CONT’D)
                        I'm not going to sugar coat this. 
                        The situation is worse now than it 
                        was before. None of us need to lose 
                        our jobs over this. Our families. 
                        You can protect Paul and me...and 
                        yourself...if you just do what you 
                        know is right.

           Gargan puts an arm on Ted's shoulder. Ted looks down and gives 
           this sincere thought. He puts an arm on Gargan's shoulder.

                                 TED
                        Okay. I'll report it.

           Ted pulls Joey in for a cathartic embrace.

                                 TED (CONT’D)
                        I'm going to have to say Mary Jo 
                        was driving, though.

           Gargan topples back out of the embrace in shock.

                                 GARGAN
                        TED. You can’t -- 

                                 TED
                        Joey. I love you...you know that.
                             (beat)
                        But we both know what’s at stake 
                        here.  

           Ted strolls past a speechless Gargan and a "too hungover to 
           care" Markham and opens the front door.

                                 TED (CONT’D)
                        Now, c'mon. I need to get to a pay 
                        phone I can use without people 
                        breathing down my neck. 
           EXT. DIKE BRIDGE - DAY

           A black hearse rolls down the gravel road toward a group of 
           growing spectators. Behind them, glimpses of Mary Jo’s body 
           can be seen on a gurney.

           She doesn’t lay flat. Stiff with rigor mortis, her arms remain 
           outstretched towards the sky, her hands frozen in semi-claws.

           She looks anything but peaceful. 

           The gurney arrives at a man holding a small bag of medical 
           tools. Associate Medical Examiner, DR. DONALD MILLS, late 
           20s, waits impatiently.

                                 DR. MILLS
                        Let's wrap this up. I've got a 
                        patient going into labor right now.

                                 CHIEF ARENA
                        I haven't dealt with many 
                        fatalities thus far. You just tell 
                        me what's proper. I mean, you're 
                        the medical examiner.

           Stepping out of the hearse, EUGENE FRIEH, late 50s, local 
           undertaker and local curmudgeon, walks up ready to protest 
           the chief's statement.

                                 EUGENE FRIEH
                        Associate Medical Examiner.

                                 CHIEF ARENA
                        What?

                                 EUGENE FRIEH
                        Dr. Nevins is the resident medical 
                        examiner. Mills here is just the 
                        associate.

                                 DR. MILLS
                        Yeah. Well, Dr. Nevins has the day 
                        off. And I'm very busy. So let's 
                        get this examination underway. Is 
                        that okay with you, Eugene?

                                 EUGENE FRIEH
                        Of course.

           The four men huddle around the body, forming a perimeter that 
           blocks her view from the crowd. Dr. Mills starts by examining 
           a cut on Mary Jo's head; he moves his hands through her hair 
           looking for any other contusions. He looks up at Farrar.

                                 DR. MILLS
                        You said you found her completely 
                        submerged, right?
                                 FARRAR
                        Yes, that's right.

                                 DR. MILLS
                        Well, this seems to be a pretty 
                        open and shut case. Drowning.
                             (beat)
                        Eugene, take her down and start the 
                        embalming process --

                                 EUGENE FRIEH
                        If we're calling it a drowning, 
                        shouldn't we at least check her 
                        lungs first?

                                 DR. MILLS
                        I didn't realize that undertakers 
                        had medical degrees...

           Chief Arena looks on, not realizing what he’s gotten into.

                                 EUGENE FRIEH
                        I don't...but I've seen enough dead 
                        bodies to have my suspicions. 

           Dr. Mills scowls at Eugene and then turns back to the body. 
           He moves his hands down to Mary Jo's chest. Undoes her blouse 
           revealing her blue brassiere.

           He places his hands on the flat part of her breast bone and 
           presses down. Water spills from Mary Jo's lips.

                                 DR. MILLS
                        There. Are you satisfied?

                                 EUGENE FRIEH
                        She's been submerged for hours. A 
                        teaspoon of water in her mouth 
                        means nothing.

           Dr. Mills strains as he does several more chest compressions. 
           Hardly any more water pours out. Farrar is overcome by a sad 
           realization.

                                 FARRAR
                        Dear God. I could’ve had her out of 
                        that car twenty five minutes after 
                        I got the call. But no one called.

           Chief Arena looks back at the crowd, hoping none of them can 
           see he’s in over his head. The doctor grows frustrated as his 
           diagnosis comes into question.

                                 DR. MILLS
                        Turn her over.
           The men flip the body over with great respect. Dr. Mills 
           performs a forceful "chest compression" just above the small 
           of Mary Jo's back. A handful of water pours forth.

                                  DR. MILLS (CONT’D)
                        Water. Deep in the lungs. Just as I 
                        suspected.

                                 EUGENE FRIEH
                        Couldn't that have been from her 
                        stomach?

           Dr. Mills grows incensed at the second guessing. 

                                 DR. MILLS
                        Fine. Flip her over again. I’ll 
                        press on her abdomen and prove it.

           The men flip Mary Jo on her back. Her high waisted pants 
           cover her naval. Dr. Mills unbuttons them and gives them a 
           quick tug exposing her pubic area. He raises an eyebrow.

                                 DR. MILLS (CONT’D)
                        No panties?

           Arena wanting to protect the girl’s modesty and prevent the 
           situation from spiraling out of control puts his arms in 
           front of Frieh and the doctor.

                                 CHIEF ARENA
                        Eugene, I appreciate ya, but let's 
                        leave the medical diagnoses to the 
                        medical professionals. Okay?

                                 DR. MILLS
                        Thank you. Now if you could start 
                        prepping her for the embalming, 
                        like I said Eugene.

                                 EUGENE FRIEH
                        Whatever you say.

                                 CHIEF ARENA
                             (to Eugene)
                        I’ll be coming by shortly. We still 
                        need to ID the poor girl. I may 
                        have Senator Kennedy with me.

                                 DR. MILLS
                        Kennedy?

                                 CHIEF ARENA
                        Yeah. That's his car in the pond.

                                 DR. MILLS
                        Cancel the embalming. 
                             (to Chief Arena)

                        factors and personalities involved 
                        here, I would prefer we had the 
                        District Attorney weigh in on this.

           EXT. CHAPPAQUIDDICK - FERRY HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           As the Chappaquiddick ferry recedes into the distance, the 
           previously seen nearby pay phone sits in the foreground. This 
           time Ted rushes towards it. 

           He picks up the receiver and flips through his weathered 
           book. He creases it open to an entry reading:

           "David Burke - Chief of Staff - "Reliable, doesn't seek the 
           spotlight" - Jack"

           Ted scans his fingers down a few telephone numbers until he 
           reaches one listed as "Home". He dials.

           Ted drops a dime into the pay phone. RING.

           The line picks up. Ted doesn’t wait for a greeting.

                                 TED
                        David. We have a situation over here 
                        on Chappaquiddick.

                                 DAVID BURKE (V.O.)
                        Ted? What kind of situation?

                                 TED
                        There's a firestorm coming your 
                        way. You need to be ready for it.

           David Burke waits patiently for instruction. Then realizes 
           Ted is done talking.

                                 DAVID BURKE (V.O.)
                        Okay, but I’d be more ready if I 
                        knew what this was all about.

                                 TED
                        The situation is...my car was in an 
                        accident...I'm going to say that I 
                        wasn't the one driving.

           Ted turns and looks towards the road leading to the ferry. 
           The black hearse waits for the arrival of the next ferry. The 
           rear passenger window shade is up. 
           A sheet covers Mary Jo's body, but it’s unmistakable what he’s 
           looking at. Ted can barely breathe. He just stares in its 
           direction.

           The SOUND NEARLY DROPS OUT. Ted’s fixation on the hearse 
           intensifies as David Burke’s voice becomes muffled --

                                 DAVID BURKE (V.O.)
                             (muffled)
                        Well...were you driving, Ted?
                             (beat)
                        Ted?

           Ted gives a long hard look into the hearse. The sight of it 
           has nearly turned him to stone.

                                 DAVID BURKE (V.O.)
                             (nearly inaudible)
                        Ted? Ted? Ted, can you hear me?

           The hearse drives out of Ted’s field of view and the SOUND 
           COMES BACK INTO FOCUS --

           Ted looks back at the phone, still shaken.

                                 TED
                        That's all you need to know for now.

           Ted hangs up the receiver.

           EXT. CHAPPAQUIDDICK ISLAND - FERRY LANDING - DAY

           Ted staggers over to Markham and Gargan, in as much of a daze 
           as moments after the accident. He tries to compose himself 
           and speak with the authority of a leader but struggles.

                                 TED
                        Alright, I’m headed back to town. 
                        Gargan, don’t upset the girls. 
                        Don’t let them get involved.

                                 GARGAN
                        Of course.

                                 TED
                        Okay. Good. Paul, why don't you --

                                 GARGAN
                        Paul. Go with Ted. Run interference. 
                        Make sure he doesn't talk to anyone 
                        else.

           Behind them a new, empty ferry arrives.
           EXT. FERRY - DAY

           The ferry drifts across the water toward Edgartown. Ted and 
           Markham stand at the ferry's edge, wind blowing through their 
           hair. A few other ferry patrons mill about behind them. A 
           couple of men whisper and point at Ted.

                                 MAN
                        He doesn’t look like he was in an 
                        accident...

           EXT. EDGARTOWN FERRY LANDING - CONTINUOUS

           The ferry approaches the dock. Suddenly, Ted pushes through 
           the crowd of people and leaps over the rail onto the landing. 
           Everyone looks on, shocked and dumbfounded.

           He books it up the street towards town.

           The gate slowly starts to open. Markham tries to speed walk 
           through the pain in order to catch up.

           Ted turns the heads of every pedestrian he passes as he jogs 
           up the street. Markham falls further behind.

                                 MARKHAM
                        Ted! Wait up!

           A local newspaper PHOTOGRAPHER approaches Ted. The senator 
           avoids eye contact as they cross paths.

                                 PHOTOGRAPHER
                        Senator!

           Ted doesn't look back. A flashbulb goes off. A camera shutter 
           snaps. Ted continues racing forward.

           EXT. EDGARTOWN POLICE STATION - DAY

           Ted hustles up the steps headed for the front door. He 
           reaches for the handle just as --

           The front door swings open. JAMES RESTON, 59, a grizzled New 
           York Times reporter, exits and spots Ted immediately.

                                 RESTON
                        Senator. I heard you were in an 
                        accident this morning.

                                 TED
                        James. You’re a long ways from New 
                        York, aren’t you?

                                 RESTON
                        On vacation. Thanks.
                                 TED
                        Well, I’ll let you get back to it.

                                 RESTON
                        So, any truth to that story?

                                 TED
                        Automobile accidents? Is the Times 
                        putting all their Pulitzer winners 
                        on the local traffic reports beat?

           Markham hobbles up the steps. He pushes Ted inside.

                                 RESTON
                        Just me I hope.

           Markham slams the door. Reston flips his notebook closed.

           INT. EDGARTOWN POLICE STATION - DAY

           Ted’s canvas boat shoes glide along the cheap linoleum tile. 

           EXT. DIKE BRIDGE - DAY

           A tow truck pulls a chain attached to the submerged Oldsmobile.

           The side door reads in hand-painted letters: “You Wreck ‘Em - 
           We Fetch ‘Em”. The wheels spin as the tow truck drags the car 
           out of the water, releasing a large air bubble.

           Chief Arena looks around with confused frustration. He dashes 
           over to his squad car and yanks the radio receiver towards him.

                                 CHIEF ARENA
                        Can somebody tell me why we haven’t 
                        found Senator Kennedy yet!?

                                 SECRETARY (V.O.)
                        He’s right here at the station, 
                        Chief.

           Chief Arena shoots the radio an incredulous look.

                                 CHIEF ARENA
                        Well, tell him to get his ass down here!

           The radio crackles before the other end of the line goes 
           silent for a moment.

                                 SECRETARY (V.O.)
                        Uh...the Senator would prefer that 
                        you come to him.

           Chief Arena stares, caught off guard by the gall of this 
           request. Water still drips from his bathing suit.
           INT. CHIEF ARENA’S OFFICE - DAY

           Markham shuts the door. He turns to Ted, who rests his feet 
           on the desk.

                                 MARKHAM
                        The Chief is on his way.

                                 TED
                        Good. Thanks Paul. That’ll be fine.

           Ted takes his feet off the desk and leans in towards Markham. 
           Out of his peripheral, the chief’s phone glares back at Ted. 
           He lifts the entire phone and pulls it directly in front of 
           him before picking up the receiver.

                                 TED (CONT’D)
                        If you could just give me a 
                        moment...

                                 MARKHAM
                        Sure thing, Ted.

           Markham steps out, leaving Ted completely alone.

           Ted stares back at the phone, hovering his unsteady finger 
           over the “0” key. The dial tone rings out until --

           A loud, pulsing OFF-HOOK TONE screeches from the handset.

           Ted startles at the sudden sound. He hangs up the receiver. 
           He takes a deep breath and tries again.

           His trembling finger moves swiftly to hit the “0”.

                                 OPERATOR (V.O.)
                        Directory Assistance. How may I 
                        direct your call?

           Ted picks up a nearby pencil and starts doodling on a pad of 
           paper.

                                 TED

                        I'm unsure of the spelling.

           Ted draws wavy lines and shades them. It's a doodle of a 
           sailboat in choppy waters.

                                 OPERATOR (V.O.)
                        I’ll connect you.

           Ted puts his head in his free hand and closes his eyes.

           RING. RING.
           The line picks up. Ted squeezes his eyes shut tighter. He 
           shakes with tension.

                                 MRS. KOPECHNE (V.O.)
                              (cheery)
                        Hello.

           Ted exhales and slowly opens his eyes. He hesitates.

                        Yes, it is.

                                 TED

                        the store at the moment. 

           Mrs. Kopechne’s voice cracks with prescient concern.

                                 MRS. KOPECHNE (V.O.)
                        Can I take a message for him?

           The swell in her voice pierces through Ted. He swivels his 
           chair around to face the wall, away from the door.

                                 TED
                        Mrs. Kopechne. Mary Jo...was in an 
                        accident.

                                 MRS. KOPECHNE (V.O.)
                        Was it in a car?

           Ted hangs his head in shame. He can barely get out the next 
           words.

                                 TED
                        It was an automobile accident.

           Gwen, afraid what this could mean, audibly clutches the 
           handset tighter. Ted’s voice remains steady. Ted’s voice 
           remains calm. Tears slowly start to roll down his face.

                                 TED (CONT’D)
                        Mary Jo was returning to take a 
                        ferry back to the mainland...when 
                        the accident occurred.

                                 MRS. KOPECHNE (V.O.)
                        Was my daughter killed, Senator?
           Ted keeps his eyes open and his trembling chin up. He won’t 
           allow himself to hide from this.

                                 TED
                        Yes.

           Silence. Not a sound comes from the other end of the call. 
           Ted closes his eyes once more.

                                 TED (CONT’D)

                        family with dignity...grace --

           A loud CRASH from the other end of the line. Loud, 
           uncontrollable SOBS from Mrs. Kopechne. Each one drills 
           deeper and deeper into Ted. He shudders as --

           CLICK.

           The line goes dead. Ted stares holding the phone to his ear 
           in complete stunned shock. He’s barely present. A beat. A 
           long, uncomfortable beat.

           A loud, pulsing OFF-HOOK TONE screeches from the handset.

           Ted snaps back to life. He warily hangs up the phone.

           He slowly begins to circle the sailboat on his pad of paper. 
           Again and again. Finally, he puts the pencil down before he 
           picks up the receiver. 

           He dials the phone with no hesitation. His face exudes a 
           somberness that seems to admit defeat.

           RING. RING.

                                 WOMAN (V.O.)
                        Hello. Kennedy Residence.

                        resting...I’m not sure --

                                 WOMAN (V.O.)
                        One moment.

           Ted waits on the line. His pulse quickens as the anxiety of 
           this moment weighs on him. 
           Commotion can be heard faintly from the other line. Ted grabs 
           his wrinkled collar and presses it into a fine crease. He 
           sits up straight at full attention, ignoring that his posture 
           will go unseen during the call.

                                 WOMAN (V.O.)
                        Ted. You’re on with Joe.

                                 TED
                        Dad. I’m at the police station.

           The other line is quiet except for the sound of Joseph 
           Kennedy straining with each breath.

                                 TED (CONT’D)
                        Dad. I’m telling you this...I’m 
                        telling you this because I wanted 
                        to let you know...I’m going to 
                        explain what happened. I’m going to 
                        tell them I was driving.

                                 JOSEPH KENNEDY

                                 TED
                        I will protect myself. But I’m 
                        going to do what’s right...and 
                        that’s tell the truth.

                                 JOSEPH KENNEDY
                        ...Alibi...

           Ted winces. The vein in his neck throbs. This one word 
           increases the pressure on him insurmountably.

                                 TED
                        I’m not going to be the one defined 
                        by my flaws.

           An unsettling silence exudes the other end of the line. The 
           sound of a low rustle moves slowly. Then faster, back and 
           forth, as an eraser grazes against a chalkboard.

                                 TED (CONT’D)

                        one...and Joe Jr. was the favorite one.

                        I’ll tell you...the one who got in 
                        the most trouble.

                        the only son you've got left.

           Through the receiver, chalk scrapes across the chalkboard.
                                 TED (CONT’D)
                        I’m the one making this decision. 
                        I’m the one.

           The phone line clatters as the handset is passed off.

                                 WOMAN (V.O.)
                        He’s writing something. He says.

                        “You’re the head of the family now.”

           Ted can’t process the enormity of this statement. The Kennedy 
           legacy rests on his shoulders. He lets the phone move away 
           from his ear as he sinks to the desk.

                                 TED
                        Goodbye, Ann.

           He gently places the receiver back into its cradle. Ted looks 
           deeply at the phone, hoping for answers.

           He turns back to the drawing of the sailboat. He picks up the 
           pencil and scratches it out, tearing a hole in the paper. 

           He picks up the phone as he stands. Ted dials with confidence.

           RING.

                        David filled me in.

                                 TED
                        We’ve made mistakes here. I need you

                        sure we handle everything going 
                        forward with the utmost integrity.

           Ted bites his lower lip in an empathetic manner.

                        I understand.

           Ted points as he speaks. He paces behind the desk with 
           excitement as he barks his orders.

                                 TED
                        We need to make sure this poor 
                        girl’s body gets to her family

                        Sure. But there may be a delay if 
                        they want to perform an autopsy.

           Ted slams his open palm down on the desk.

                                 TED
                        Why do you think I want it out of

                        No. I mean...yes. I mean I think I --

           Ted tosses the receiver into its cradle. CLICK. He saunters 
           around the desk and opens the door.

                                 TED
                        Paul. I need you.

           Markham stands up and hurries into the chief’s office. Ted 
           shuts the door behind him.

                                 TED (CONT’D)
                        I need you to help me come up with 
                        a written statement. I’m going to 
                        say I was driving. But I don’t want 
                        to drag you and Joey into this any 
                        more than I already have. So we’re 
                        just going to leave that part out. 
                        And any part that could hurt my 
                        position with the police or the 
                        public. We're gonna leave that out 
                        too. Can you do that?

           Markham looks at Ted with saucers for eyes. A nearly 
           impossible task.

           INT. LAWRENCE COTTAGE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           The front door BURSTS open. Light floods into the living 
           room. Esther and Nance Lyons squint their eyes, set down 
           their coffee. Gargan barges past them CLAPPING his hands.

           He moves to every closed door in the house and opens them.

           CLAP. CLAP. CLAP.

           From one of the bedrooms emerges Suzy Tannenbaum and Cricket 
           Keough, still in PJ’s. Gargan points at them.

           Everyone stares at him completely baffled.

                                 GARGAN
                        You two. Get dressed. Get packed.

           He goes into the kitchen and pulls out two trash cans.

                                 GARGAN
                        This garbage can here is for

                        THIS one is for everything else. 
                        Every bottle. Every can --

           The Boiler Room Girls grab their bags. LaRosa and Ted’s 
           driver toss assorted items into their respective trash cans. 
           Only Esther defiantly stands her ground, refusing to help. 

                                 ESTHER
                        Joey, will you just tell us what’s 
                        going on, already? No bullshit.

           Nance Lyons stands at the entryway putting her handbag over 
           her shoulder. She picks up Mary Jo’s purse.

                                 NANCE
                        And where’s Mary Jo? I haven’t seen 
                        her since last night.

           Gargan lowers the two trash cans. He can’t keep up the facade 
           of control any longer.
                                 GARGAN

                        and into Poucha Pond last night...

           Gargan hesitates. His head spins with emotion and lawyer 
           platitudes. He blurts out an answer to fill the silence.

           The group murmurs with deep concern. They look at their feet 
           unsure what to say next. Nance Lyons pipes up with helpful 
           optimism.

           The door to the Chief’s office swings open. Out steps Arena 
           proudly holding up Ted’s handwritten statement. He hands it 
           to his secretary.

                                 CHIEF ARENA
                        Have this typed up for me.

           Behind him, Ted and Markham shuffle out the door. Ted puts 
           his hand on Chief Arena’s shoulder.

                                 TED
                        Chief, you mind not letting any

                        get the all clear from my lawyer?

                        No problem, Senator. I understand.

           Kennedy puts his arm around Arena and ushers him away from 
           the secretary for a more private conversation.

                                 TED
                        Now, don’t you think it’s in 
                        everyone’s best interest if I get 
                        back home to Hyannis Port right away?

           A smile crawls across Chief Arena’s face. He turns to Ted 
           with great eagerness.

                                 CHIEF ARENA
                        You know...I’ve got a friend who’s a 
                        pilot. He'll get you there in no time.

           Ted shakes the Chief’s hand, gives him the signature 
           politician’s smile.

                        That sounds fine, officer. Just fine.

                                 CHIEF ARENA
                        Please let me know if there’s 
                        anything else I can do.

                        No, sir. You’re doing a bang up job 
                        here, Dominick. A bang up job.

           EXT. LAWRENCE COTTAGE - DAY

           The Valiant has left the driveway and the cottage lawn has 
           been combed of any trash.

           INT. LAWRENCE COTTAGE - DAY

           Sunlight beams pour through drawn curtains, illuminating a 
           sparkling clean room. 

           All the signs of the chaos from last night have miraculously 
           disappeared. Lamps turned upright, beds all made.

           In the center of the kitchen, sits one trash can. Inside: 

           Six bottles of Coca-Cola and an empty bag of chips.

           INT. KATAMA SHORES INN - THE BOILER ROOM GIRLS’ ROOM - DAY

           The only cheap motel in Edgartown. The Boiler Room Girls pack 
           their clothes and toiletries into their bags. Gargan sits on 
           the nightstand, supervising. 

           Cricket enters with a look of confusion and concern.

                                 CRICKET
                        Joey, I just went to Mary Jo’s 
                        room. She’s not there.

                                 GARGAN
                        I know. Girls. You better sit down.

           Everyone in the room falls into a hushed silence. The girls 
           all sit on the two queen beds. Gargan stands at the front of 
           the room, sweaty, exhausted, and disheveled.

                                 GARGAN (CONT’D)
                        As I said before, the Senator’s car 
                        was in an accident. It went off the 
                        bridge sometime after he and Mary 
                        Jo left the party.
           The tension mounts as the girls hang on Gargan's every word. 
           Nance Lyons squeezes a pillow for comfort. 

           Gargan pauses. Worn down. Uncertain.

                                 GARGAN (CONT’D)
                        I want you to know that every single 
                        effort possible was made to save her.

           Cricket, Suzy, and Nance burst into uncontrollable tears.

                                 MARYELLEN
                        Mary Jo!

           Gargan looks uncomfortable at the sight of the four women 
           sobbing. Then he catches a glimpse of Esther. She’s not 
           crying. She waits patiently staring back at Gargan.

                                 ESTHER
                        Okay. So what do we do now? 
                             (beat) 
                        What needs to be done to help the 
                        Senator?

           Gargan is taken aback. It takes him a moment to recover.

                                 GARGAN
                        You should get off the island as 
                        soon as possible. No one knows that 
                        any of you are here. So go home and 
                        keep quiet. The best thing that 
                        could happen for you is to never 
                        see each other, or me, ever again.

           The girls look at each other with hesitant resignation. 
           Cricket lets out a whimper, unable to keep up appearances. 
           Esther continues to look on with a harsh, cold intensity.

                                 GARGAN (CONT’D)
                        Let’s remember what Ted said last 
                        night: We’re family. We have to 
                        protect each other like family.

           EXT. HYANNIS PORT - KENNEDY COMPOUND - DAY

           The wrought iron gate opens and a black sedan passes through, 
           revealing a sprawling white, Cape Cod waterfront property.

           The car pulls around the circular driveway and stops in front 
           of a flagpole. Ted steps out. 

           The American flag flaps in the wind, dwarfing the senator 
           below as he gazes at his childhood home. He straightens his 
           collar before taking a step towards the entrance.
           INT. KENNEDY COMPOUND - ENTRYWAY - DAY

           The front door cracks open. Ted slips inside and shuts the 
           door behind him. The entryway returns to a dark and imposing 
           set of wooden bookcases and stained oak floors.

           He takes a few steps forward towards a large staircase. Each 
           step Ted takes echoes deep into the corridors around him --

           A door CREAKS as it swings open down the hall. Carrying a tea 
           tray, ANN GARGAN, early 30s, the shapely but serious-minded 
           sister of Joe Gargan and nurse to Joseph Kennedy, Sr., 
           startles when she sees Ted.

                                 ANN
                        Oh. Ted. Your father wasn’t 
                        expecting you so soon.

           This is unmistakably the voice that was on the phone with 
           Ted’s father before.

                                 TED
                        How is he holding up, Ann?

                                 ANN
                        Uncle Joe is rather emotional. But 
                        physically, he’s doing better.

           Ted takes the first step up on to the stairs.

           Ann takes two quick steps up the stairs in front of him. She 
           puts a sympathetic hand on his hand. Her eyes well up, 
           knowing what is coming.

                                 ANN (CONT’D)
                        Wait here. He’d prefer to come to 
                        you.

           She climbs the staircase and disappears behind the banisters. 

           Ted stands, left alone in the dark entryway once more.

           From above, the distant SQUEAK of a wheelchair rolling grows 
           louder. Each rotation of the wheel creates an extended 
           squeal. Ted looks up.

           Lording over him at the top of the staircase, a pair of fine 
           leather shoes sit comfortably in the footrests of the 
           wheelchair. They descend slowly down the stairs toward Ted. 

           Ted, stiff as a board, looks up with his face frozen.

           JOSEPH P. KENNEDY, SR., 80, glowers from his wheelchair, 
           staring down his son. Ann assists Joseph Kennedy down the 
           stairs using a mechanical chair stair lift device. He slumps, 
           a weathered shell of a man after suffering several strokes. 
           The left side of his face droops. The wrinkled skin and liver 
           spots on his face partially obscured by his owl glasses.

           He cannot speak clearly, but his every grunt and breath is 
           felt with commanding authority.

           Ted steps forward and gives his father a kiss on the forehead. 
           Joseph Kennedy stares past his son, offering no emotion.

                                 TED
                        I’m glad to see you, Dad. You’re 
                        looking better.
                             (beat) 
                        I want to tell you again how 
                        sincerely sorry I am that I ever 
                        let a thing like this happen.

           Joseph Kennedy responds with one quick, short grunt. It 
           doesn’t sound supportive.

                                 TED (CONT’D)
                        I want to reassure you that I have 
                        this situation, terrible as it is, 
                        under my complete control. I have my 
                        staff split off in every direction 
                        ensuring that we’re not up at night 
                        worrying about surprises. Dun’s 
                        looking after the --

           Joseph Kennedy shakes his head.

                                 TED (CONT’D)
                        I'm sorry that I got us into this. 
                        But if you trust me, I'm confident 
                        I can get us out.
                             (beat)
                        I believe what we did was right.

                                 JOSEPH KENNEDY
                        ...Ann...

           Joseph Kennedy pulls out a piece of paper with scribbled 
           handwriting. Ann takes it from him and looks directly into 
           Ted’s eyes.

                                 ANN
                        Your father would like to tell you:
                             (reading)
                        “You've lost my confidence. Do as I 
                        say and never lose it again. 
                        Otherwise it will be a nearly 
                        impossible task to restore it.”

           These words hit Ted right in the gut. He slumps over, 
           crestfallen. Joseph Kennedy wheels himself down the hall. 
           The squeaks of the wheelchair recede into the distance as Ted 
           absorbs the shock.

           Ann leans closer to Ted, speaking in hushed tones.

                                 ANN (CONT’D)
                        Your dad really does love you. He 
                        hasn’t been this active since 
                        before Bobby died.

           Joseph Kennedy grunts. Ann looks up and sees him sitting in 
           front of a closed door. She dashes across the room and turns 
           the handle. She pushes it open revealing a room filled with 
           blinding sunlight.

                                 ANN (CONT’D)
                        Ted, you’ll want to see this.

           Ann grabs Joseph Kennedy’s chair and wheels him through.

           Ted ponders this for a moment. Then shuffles towards them, 
           afraid of what will come next.

           INT. KENNEDY COMPOUND - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Ted enters the cozy, family living room. It has been overrun 
           with an all star line-up of former cabinet members and top 
           Kennedy advisors, past and present. Where Ted once celebrated 
           Christmas and birthdays, he now observes a command central 
           for all strategy devoted to Chappaquiddick. 

           Ted stands next to his proud father who sports a smug smile of 
           satisfaction as the country’s greatest minds try to find a seat 
           amidst the floral curtains, low ceilings, and bay windows.

           The BRAIN TRUST includes:

               - ROBERT MCNAMARA, 53, former Secretary of Defense; he frowns 
                 with his hand dug deep into his face.
               - Ted Sorensen, who looks in his element now that he’s with 
                 Washington’s elite rather than his rambunctious boys.
               - BURKE MARSHALL, 46, former Assistant US Attorney General 
                 and current Senior Vice President at IBM.
               - SARGENT SHRIVER, 53, Joseph Kennedy’s son-in-law and US 
                 Ambassador to France; he puts a well worn wooden rosary in 
                 his front jacket pocket with the cross still hanging out.
               - STEPHEN SMITH, 41, another Kennedy son-in-law, Bobby’s 1968 
                 campaign manager, and financial manager of the Kennedy 
                 fortune; he stubs out one cigarette while lighting another.
               - JOHN CULVER, 36, US Congressman from Iowa.
               - JOHN TUNNEY, 35, US Congressman from California.
               - David Burke, the low man on the totem pole; he is merely 
                 the administrative aide to Senator Ted Kennedy.
               - Several other men from various parts of the Kennedy machine.

           Ann Gargan drags over a chair, which she offers to McNamara. 
           He sits down under a painting of a battleship sailing through 
           choppy waters. Sorensen looks over at him.

                                 SORENSEN
                        Well, Bob, you handled the missile 
                        crisis and Vietnam. Now let’s see 
                        what you can do with this one.

           Ted puts his hands in his pockets with a defiant glare. He 
           looks down at his father. 

                                 TED
                        Looks like you’re still the man 
                        with all the influence.

           Ted steps forward to the center of the room.

                                 TED (CONT’D)
                        Gentlemen, I appreciate you making

                        However, I hope you understand that 
                        I prefer to handle this with my own 
                        team, since it’s my political

           McNamara shoots to his feet and charges towards Ted. He 
           points a bullish, decisive finger in Ted’s face.

                                 MCNAMARA
                        That’s just the half of it! You’re 
                        also in serious legal trouble, son.

           Ted looks back towards where his father was sitting. Joseph 
           Kennedy is gone. The SQUEAK of his wheelchair can be heard 
           faintly receding away. Ted looks down at his shoes, no choice 
           but to take this verbal assault.

                        manslaughter. If there’s even a 
                        whisper that you weren’t as clean 
                        as Mother Teresa, you’re getting

                        information you’ve already admitted 
                        that we need to make sure people 
                        forget.

           McNamara turns to the group, changing his focus from berating 
           Ted to inspiring the troops.

                                 MCNAMARA (CONT’D)

                             (beat)
                        A dead girl’s body holds a lot of 
                        secrets. Those secrets can be the 
                        difference between guilt and 
                        innocence. So we need to be in 
                        control of them. The only way we 
                        can do that is if we’re in control 
                        of the body.

           Ted struts up to McNamara. He’s already thought of this.

                                 TED
                        I have my staffer, Dun Gifford, 
                        waiting at the funeral home now. 
                        That girl isn't going anywhere but 
                        back home to New Jersey without us 
                        knowing about it.

           McNamara scoffs in Ted’s face.
                                 MCNAMARA
                        Having some gopher in a three piece 
                        suit sitting on his hands in a 
                        LOBBY isn't getting us anywhere! 
                        There are explicit procedures that 
                        must be followed in order to move a 
                        body across state lines. Do you 
                        know...has the death certificate 
                        even been signed yet?

           Ted deflates; there’s no good way to answer this.

                                 TED
                        I don't know.

           INT. EDGARTOWN FUNERAL HOME - DAY

           Dun Gifford flips through a magazine in the drab lobby of the 
           local mortuary. He wears a three piece suit.

           On the side table next to him sits a telephone.

           RING.

           Dun looks around, confused. He answers.

                                 GIFFORD
                        Hello?

           INT. KENNEDY COMPOUND - ENTRYWAY - DAY

           Ted uses the phone on the corner table by the staircase. He 
           hunches over trying not to be heard by his father’s advisors.

                                 TED
                        We’re in this thing deeper than I 
                        thought. I need you to get the death 
                        certificate signed as soon as fucking 
                        possible. Do whatever it takes.

                                 GIFFORD (V.O.)
                        Uh...I’ll look into --

                        Hyannis as soon as it’s done.

           Ted drops the phone back into the cradle. He storms back 
           towards the war room and swings the door open.
           INT. KENNEDY COMPOUND - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Ted enters with his head held high and his chest puffed out.

                                 TED
                        It’s as good as done. Just waiting 
                        on word back.

           McNamara holds a legal binder. His finger firmly presses 
           against the page.

           He turns back towards the group.

           INT. DR. MILL’S OFFICE - DAY

           Gifford sits in a brightly lit doctor’s waiting room. The 
           door reads: “Dr. Donald Mills - Family Medicine & Associate 
           Medical Examiner”.

                        ...the medical examiner who 
                        inspected the body at the scene.

           Gifford sits next to a PREGNANT WOMAN doing Lamaze exercises. 

           The exam room door opens. A NURSE steps out. Gifford puts his 
           hand on top of the pregnant woman’s shoulder as he stands.

                                 GIFFORD
                        I need to go first.

           A series of quick cuts: 

               - Gifford waves the death certificate in Dr. Mills’s face.
               - Dr. Mills jots his signature onto the death certificate.
               - As Gifford exits, he tips his hat to the pregnant woman.
               - Gifford bursts into the funeral parlor and waves the death 
                 certificate in Frieh’s face. Mary Jo’s body lays on the 
                 table in front of them, a sheet covering all but her face.

           INT. KENNEDY COMPOUND - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Ted enters from the door. He shoots McNamara a strong thumbs 
           up and goes to sit in a chair in the corner.

           McNamara SNAPS the book shut. All the advisors nod with 
           satisfaction.

                        To my second point...

           Ted settles into his chair, confident things are starting to 
           go his way. McNamara turns back to the group.

                                 MCNAMARA (CONT’D)
                        We need to parse through the 
                        unknowns of this case to determine 
                        if we’ve got any liabilities hiding 
                        in the trees.

                        What evidence could be used against 
                        Ted to prove he acted negligently?

                                 TED
                        Why are we just assuming that I 
                        acted negligently?

                                 STEPHEN SMITH
                        There’s a dead body in the 
                        Edgartown morgue that suggests it’s 
                        a possibility.

           Ted shoots out of his chair, unable to take this “advice” 
           anymore. He turns away from the group as he shouts at them.

                                 TED
                        There were no witnesses! There’s no 
                        evidence. What proof could there 
                        even be?

           From behind Ted, Sorensen rubs his temple in frustration.

                                 SORENSEN
                        Ted. Were your headlights working?

                                 SARGENT SHRIVER
                        Were you wearing your safety belts?

           Ted doesn’t flinch at any of this. He doesn’t react at all. 
           The questions ping-pong around the room behind him.

                                 STEPHEN SMITH
                        Was there enough tread on your tires?

                                 MCNAMARA
                        Was your license in good standing?
           A look of absolute dread immediately falls over Ted’s face. 
           If anyone could see him they’d stop right there.

                                 JOHN CULVER
                        Did your tires leave skid marks?

                                 JOHN TUNNEY
                        Could they determine how fast you 
                        were going?

           Ted’s face turns white.

                                 TED
                        My license is expired.

                                 SORENSEN
                        Your license is expired?!

           Ted looks back over his shoulder at the group.

                                 TED
                        Do you think that could be a 
                        problem? How is that negligent?

           Half the room buries their faces in their hands.

                                 MCNAMARA
                        Any time you get behind the wheel 
                        of an automobile you’re in breach 
                        of the law. I’d say that’s pretty 
                        negligent.

           The room murmurs with distress at this revelation. In the 
           corner, Burke Marshall removes his glasses and speaks with 
           great authority.

                                 BURKE MARSHALL
                        Who knows the department of motor 
                        vehicles inspector over there in 
                        Martha’s Vineyard?

                                 SARGENT SHRIVER
                        What’s that got to do with 
                        anything?

                                 BURKE MARSHALL
                        It’s a fatal. You’ve got to have a 
                        D.M.V. inspector make a report in 
                        addition to the police. That’s our 
                        key guy right there for any 
                        reckless driving charge.

           Sargent Shriver and McNamara exchange impressed glances.

                                 SORENSEN
                        And that’s why this guy’s the best 
                        lawyer in a room full of lawyers.
                                 BURKE MARSHALL
                        Let’s stay focused...what kind of 
                        government connections do we have 
                        in Martha’s Vineyard?

                                 STEPHEN SMITH
                        Joe Greelish runs the Hyannis D.M.V.  
                        We can have him run it through his 
                        connections in Edgartown for a price.

           Ted pours himself a drink at the bar cart in the corner.

                                 TED
                        Let’s have Gifford talk to him.

           McNamara throws his hands up.

                                 MCNAMARA
                        Dammit, Ted. This can’t be 
                        connected to you!

           Ted rubs his forehead as he looks up at the ceiling, reeling 
           from this latest beating.

                                 STEPHEN SMITH
                        I know just the guy.

           INT. HYANNIS DMV HEADQUARTERS - DAY

           A FIGURE in a black suit holding a black leather messenger 
           bag walks past endless rows of desks manned by bored 
           government workers. 

           The figure approaches a much larger desk at the end of the 
           long passageway. A name plate sits on the edge: “Joseph 
           Greelish - Head of Hyannis Department of Motor Vehicles”. 

           The frail JOE GREELISH, mid-40s, looks up and flinches at the 
           sight of the man in the black suit. The figure opens his bag.

                                 STEPHEN SMITH (V.O.)
                        His name’s James Steele.

           JAMES STEELE, 42, looks up from under his hat, the florescent 
           light from above hitting only half his face. He pulls out a 
           manila envelope.

                                 STEPHEN SMITH (V.O.)
                        He worked as an advance man for Jack 
                        on the ‘60 campaign. Off the books.

           Steele drops the envelope into Greelish’s INBOX. He turns and 
           proceeds back down the corridor having never made eye contact.

                                 STEPHEN SMITH (V.O.)
                        He liked it better that way.
           Greelish opens the envelope and finds three items: A pair of 
           Boston Red Sox tickets, a pair of hundred dollar bills, and a 
           completed drivers license renewal form for Mr. Edward Kennedy.

           Greelish slips the money into a drawer and locks it.

           He creeps back down past the endless rows of desks, stopping 
           at the first empty one. He looks over his shoulder before he 
           wedges the completed form into the middle of a stack of 
           papers inside the INBOX.

           A series of quick cuts: 

               - The renewal papers get stamped with a loud THUNK. The form 
                 reads: “Edward M. Kennedy. License Valid from: 2/22/1968 
                 thru 2/22/1978”
               - The stamped form gets set on top of another INBOX. 
               - A new license with a Ted Kennedy photo gets spit out from a 
                 lamination machine.

           INT. REGISTRY RECORDS ROOM - DAY

           Greelish pushes open a door that reads “Registry Records 
           Room”. Behind a single front desk is a fastidious CLERK, 60s. 
           Behind him, rows upon rows of alphabetized filing cabinets.

           Greelish places the Red Sox tickets into the clerk’s INBOX. 
           The two men exchange a knowing look, and the clerk exits with 
           his tickets.

           A filing cabinet labeled “K” flies open. Greelish dives in 
           and pulls out a document stamped “EXPIRED” in bold red. He 
           tears it in half and stuffs it in his jacket pocket.

           INT. KENNEDY COMPOUND - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           A thick cloud of smoke fills the room. It creates a haze, 
           which hard beams of sunlight cut through. McNamara paces 
           while everyone else sits.

                                 MCNAMARA
                        Alright. We've sidestepped the 
                        immediate land mines. Now we can 
                        look back at the heart of the 
                        problem. The information you've 
                        already communicated to the 
                        police...in your own words...in 
                        plain English...paints the most 
                        damning picture of negligent 
                        behavior in this entire incident.

                        You left the scene of an accident! 
                        And nary a word was heard from you 
                        for nine hours.
           Ted squirms. Not willing to take this much longer.

                                 MCNAMARA (CONT’D)
                        That's on the record. There's no 
                        changing that.

           Ted shoots up out of his chair. Heads straight for the door.

                                 TED
                        I'm going to get some air.

           No one in the room pays this much attention except McNamara.

                                 MCNAMARA
                        Ted. We kind of need your help on 
                        this.

           Ted pauses with his hand pressed against the door.

                                 TED
                        You guys were brought in by my 
                        father to solve a problem. Solve it.

           Ted storms out of the room. The door shuts with a resounding 
           THUD.

           EXT. KENNEDY COMPOUND - LATER

           A red kite whips in the wind over a vast ocean. Below, 
           holding the spool, the Senator stands motionless. He stares 
           not up, but out, into the sea. 

           The kite shoots downward almost clipping the water. Ted 
           doesn't react, apathetic. A sudden gust of wind saves it, 
           pulling it back up safely skyward, despite the lack of 
           intervention from the man holding the string.

           Back at the compound, the black sedan pulls into the circular 
           driveway. Stephen Smith storms away from Ted, passing in 
           front of the vehicle as he trudges up the steps to the house. 
           The rear doors pop open. Gargan and Markham step out. 

                                 GARGAN
                        Steve. What's going on?

           Without looking back, Smith opens the front door of the house 
           and stomps inside. Markham chases after him. 

                                 STEPHEN SMITH
                        You talk to him. See if you can't 
                        convince him to help himself.

           Smith slams the door behind him. Gargan turns and sees Ted 
           flying his kite by the shore. From this distance, Ted looks 
           less like a man and more like a boy.
           With the massive Kennedy compound looming in the background, 
           Gargan marches over to Ted.

           Gargan takes one last step forward and stands next to him. 
           Ted glances out of the corner of his eye. Long silent pause.

                                 GARGAN
                        You want to take the boat out?

                                 TED
                        Maybe we’ll go out tomorrow.

           Beat.

                                 TED (CONT’D)
                        I’ve been giving it a lot of 
                        thought. You were right. 
                             (beat)
                        We should have dropped the 
                        spinnaker.

           Gargan shakes his head and gives a half smile.

                                 GARGAN
                        I've only ever had your best 
                        interests at heart.

           Gargan kicks a small pebble, and it skips into the water. He 
           looks back at the compound and then to Ted.

                                 GARGAN (CONT’D)
                        Seems like they want you back 
                        inside.

                                 TED
                        Those guys only have their best 
                        interests at heart.

           Gargan turns to Ted, staring him down now.

                                 GARGAN
                        I can't let you do this to 
                        yourself.

                                 TED
                        Do what?

                                 GARGAN
                        Self-destruct.

           Ted swings the kite away from Gargan and takes a couple of 
           steps with it.

                                 GARGAN (CONT’D)
                        No one else is saying it...maybe 
                        they just haven't seen it...

                                 GARGAN (CONT’D)
                        But you've been on this path since 
                        Bobby died.

                                 TED
                        The expectations for your whole 
                        life didn't change the moment he 
                        hit the ground.

                                 GARGAN
                        There were never any expectations 
                        for me.

                                 TED
                        Yes there were. There always were. 
                        I've needed you...I need you to 
                        protect me.

           Gargan looks back down at the ground, drawing the courage to 
           say what he came to say. 

                                 TED (CONT’D)
                        You're the only brother I have 
                        left, Joe.

                                 GARGAN
                        This has to be the end of my 
                        involvement. I wish “ole Joey” 
                        could fix it, but I can’t.

                                 TED
                        Do you wish you'd never jumped in 
                        the water?

                                 GARGAN
                        Of course not.

           Gargan waits for some sort of response.

                                 GARGAN (CONT’D)
                        Do you regret saying you were

           INT. KENNEDY COMPOUND - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           All the king's men have crowded to one side of the room. On 
           the opposite side, DR. WATT, the Kennedy family physician, 
           sits in a folding chair looking overwhelmed.

           David Burke tops off Sorensen’s cup of coffee. Markham stands 
           in the corner nursing a hard drink. The rest of the men pour 
           over documents with fingers pressed firmly against their 
           foreheads.
                                 MCNAMARA
                        What's the cut off for the national 
                        papers?

                                 SORENSEN
                        On a Saturday? Five P.M. Why?

           The door cracks open and Ted slinks into the war room. No one 
           pays him much mind. He sits and tries to catch up to speed.

                                 MCNAMARA
                        A story like this could dominate the 
                        headlines for a week. It would take 
                        nothing short of a man walking on 
                        the moon to keep this off the front 
                        page. Fortunately for us, Ted's big 
                        brother arranged for just that.

                                 SORENSEN
                        If we can keep a tight lid on this 
                        for a couple more hours, then we’ll 
                        be able to actually develop a 
                        decent P.R. strategy.

           Ted slumps down deep into his chair. 

                                 STEPHEN SMITH
                        By the time the papers have room for 
                        Ted, they'll all be printing exactly 
                        what we want them to.

           Burke Marshall stands and strides over behind Dr. Watt.

                                 BURKE MARSHALL
                        That after a thorough examination, 
                        Ted’s doctor here deduced he had 
                        suffered a concussion and was in a 
                        state of shock.

                                 DR. WATT
                        But I haven’t even examined the 
                        patient yet.

                                 STEPHEN SMITH
                        That won’t be necessary.

           Sargent Shriver gives Sorensen a congratulatory slap on the 
           back. He wipes the sweat from his brow.

                                 SARGENT SHRIVER
                        There’s nothing left to do but run 
                        out the clock, gentlemen. Come five 
                        P.M., we'll be back out in front of 
                        the problem.

           The group all practically breathes a sigh of relief. All 
           except for Ted.
                                 TED
                        The New York Times already has the 
                        story.

                                 TED
                        On my way out of the station. I ran 
                        into a reporter. He seemed to know 
                        I'd been involved in an accident.

                                 SORENSEN
                        Who was it, Ted? What was his name?

                                 TED
                        James Reston.

                                 MCNAMARA
                        RESTON!?

                                 SORENSEN
                        He's their chief political 
                        correspondent and the executive 
                        editor!

                                 STEPHEN SMITH
                        How could you not have mentioned 
                        that?!

           Ted gives a childlike shrug of non-remorse. 

                                 TED
                        I was in a state of shock.

                                 SORENSEN 
                        AWWWW...BULLSHIT TED!

                                 MCNAMARA
                        We need to get someone over to the 
                        Kopechne’s A-S-A-P! Someone's gotta 
                        run interference with any press 
                        before one of her parents says 
                        something that totally sinks us.

           The room heaves with tension.

                                 TED
                        They’re in New Jersey. Someone 
                        oughta get over there quick.

           David Burke takes a loud sip from his coffee. The brain trust 
           collectively shoots him a dirty look.

                                 MCNAMARA
                             (to David Burke)
                        Why are you still here?
           David Burke hops up and slips into his sport coat as he races 
           out the door.

           McNamara fires back at the rest of the group. Pointing his 
           fingers in people's faces as he barks out orders.

                                 MCNAMARA (CONT’D)
                        Markham. Get the Chief on the line. 
                        Don’t let that written statement get 
                        released to the press. The New York 
                        Times may have this, but let’s see 
                        if we can’t keep it an exclusive.

           Markham doesn't hesitate. He hustles into the kitchen.

           McNamara swings around to Ted.

                                 MCNAMARA (CONT’D)
                        Ted. Get your press secretary to feed 
                        a leak to the Times. Let them know 
                        that you’ve been diagnosed with a 
                        very serious concussion. That should 
                        explain why you've been behaving like 
                        a mental patient of late.

           Ted hoists himself out of his chair. He rolls his eyes.

                        got you on a prescription for all 
                        the pain.

           INT. KENNEDY COMPOUND - KITCHEN - DAY

           Markham peeks into the war room. McNamara and the others pump 
           the doctor for more information on Ted’s “condition”. Markham 
           spins away from the door as the chief answers.

                                 CHIEF ARENA (V.O.)
                        “On July 18, 1969, at approximate --”

                        Chief. Thank God, I reached you. 
                        Could I ask you to hold back that 
                        statement a little longer?

           INT. EDGARTOWN POLICE STATION - CORRIDOR - DAY

           Chief Arena stands in the hallway, holding a typewritten copy 
           of Ted’s statement. A handful of reporters crowd in front and 
           SHOUT as they scribble in their notebooks as fast as possible.
                                 CHIEF ARENA

                        reporters here.

           INT. KENNEDY COMPOUND - ENTRYWAY - DAY

           Ted grits his teeth and holds the phone to his ear. He 
           clinches his other hand into a tight fist.

                                 TED
                        Now remember, Dick, this is an

                        it. We’re just trying to make sure 
                        this doesn't spin out of control

           INT. SENATE CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Dick Drayne clutches the handset of a multi-line telephone. A 
           JANITOR dusts a nearby table. Ted’s voice booms out of the 
           receiver audibly throughout the room.

                                 TED (V.O.)
                        ...or an AFFAIR, God forbid!

           Dick Drayne leaps up and shoos the janitor out the door.

                                 TED (V.O.)
                        And throw in something about me 
                        being on sedatives too. Make it 
                        sound traumatic.

           Ted hangs up. “Line 1” goes dark as “Line 2” starts to light 
           up. Dick Drayne presses it.

                                 RESTON (V.O.)
                        This is James Reston of The New

                                 DICK DRAYNE
                        James. I was just about to call 
                        you. It’s a terrible thing about 
                        this accident. The Senator has 
                        suffered a serious concussion. 
                             (beat)
                        His physician has him on sedatives 
                        just so he can manage the pain.

           “Line 3” and “Line 4” fire on. Suddenly, the whole 
           switchboard lights up like a Christmas tree. 
           Drayne gets a lump in his throat.

                                 RESTON (V.O.)
                             (incredulous)
                        Sedatives? With a concussion?

           Ted strolls into the war room with his head held high. The 
           entire brain trust hang their heads in defeat. Ted doesn't 
           take any notice.

                                 TED
                        It's done.

                        He read your written statement to

                        The story will be hitting the wire 
                        any minute. It's going to be on the

                        Air tight, huh?

           McNamara pulls out a copy of the written statement and 
           references it as he speaks.

                                 MCNAMARA (CONT’D)

           Ted darts over to a multi-line phone. He hits a button and 
           puts the call on speaker.

                                 TED

                        Well, according to Reston, you 
                        don't give sedatives to a patient 
                        who's had a concussion! It could 
                        kill them!

           Ted grimaces, Drayne's words deliver a final crushing blow.

           The windows of the war room overlook a peaceful sunset across 
           the harbor. The men inside hardly move. The flurry of 
           activity now slowed to a vanquished standstill.

           INT. KENNEDY COMPOUND - DINING ROOM - MORNING

           Ted sets the newspaper on the table in front of him. 

           The date reads: "SUNDAY, JULY 20TH, 1969".

           Ted leans back into his chair. He flaps the sides of his New 
           York Times and puts his feet up on the table.

           Ted scowls with boiling frustration as he flips another page. 
           The front page headlines read: 

           - "ASTRONAUTS SWING INTO MOON ORBIT IN PREPARATION FOR 
                 TODAY'S LANDING"
           - "WOMAN PASSENGER KILLED, KENNEDY ESCAPES IN CRASH”

           Ann Gargan steps out on to the front porch holding a tray of 
           coffee and pastries. Receding down the porch, the entire 
           brain trust sits reading the same New York Times. The 
           headline "WOMAN PASSENGER KILLED" creates a recursive optical 
           effect, all lined in a row along the veranda.

           Sorensen peeks out from behind his paper and glances at Ann. 
           He then turns his gaze towards the front gate of the compound.

           EXT. KENNEDY COMPOUND - GATE - DAY

           A throng of REPORTERS mill around the wrought iron gate. A 
           photographer with a large telephoto lens pushes his way to 
           the front and sets up a tripod.

           EXT. KENNEDY COMPOUND - PORCH - DAY

           The brain trust sits, unmoved, still reading the paper. 
           McNamara steps out of the front door. He slumps back into his 
           chair and shakes his newspaper.

                                 MCNAMARA

                        So much for controlling the press.

           Arena enters his office, shutting the door behind him. He 
           turns to see James Steele holding his black leather messenger 
           bag, his hat casts a dark shadow over his face.

           James Steele takes off his hat, revealing a clean cut, 
           handsome man with a cold, intellectual disposition. He 
           extends a friendly hand to the Chief.

                                 JAMES STEELE
                        James Steele, special prosecutor

                        needed someone with a little more 
                        objectivity.

           The Chief breathes a sigh of relief and shakes his hand.

           Joseph Kennedy and Ann Gargan’s faces are lit by nothing but 
           the glow of the TV screen. Joseph Sr. sits in his wheelchair, 
           dressed in a robe with a quilt draped across his lap. Ann 
           sits next to him sipping a cup of hot tea.

           A dozen or more children, including Bobby's eight, spread out

           including Ted’s mother ROSE KENNEDY, 78, Bobby’s widow ETHEL,

           Ted looks down at his son. Teddy Jr. absorbs this information 
           with an eager smile. Ted turns back to the TV, glum.

                        because they are easy, but because 
                        they are hard.

           Teddy Jr. turns to his father with eyes full of wonder.

           Mr. and Mrs. Kopechne peer out. Unmoved.

           David Burke strolls in from the kitchen holding a hot tea. He 
           hands it to Mrs. Kopechne who accepts it graciously, but with 
           a vacant look.

           On the TV screen, a chyron "ARMSTRONG ON MOON" is superimposed 
           on top of the moon landing footage.
           The neighborhood erupts into loud, joyous CHEERS. Sounds of 
           elation from the world outside makes the Kopechne’s home feel

           KNOCKS at the door.

           Mrs. Kopechne starts to stand, but David Burke puts a 
           comforting hand on her shoulder.

                        Don't worry. I'll get it.

           He treads over and answers the door. A NEIGHBOR stands

           breakroom. The Chief is particularly transfixed.

                                 ARMSTRONG (V.O.)
                        That's one small step for man...one 
                        giant leap for mankind.

                                 CHIEF ARENA
                        Well, I’ll be damned. I never 
                        thought I’d see the day.

                                 JAMES STEELE
                        I’m going to grab another beer. You 
                        want one?

           Arena doesn’t look up.

                                 CHIEF ARENA
                        Sure.
           Steele walks down the corridor, past a refrigerator and into 
           another room. He picks up a phone.

           INT. DINIS HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           A telephone on a living room side table rings loudly over the 
           sounds of the moon landing. A pastel portrait of JFK hangs on 
           the wall, alongside pictures of FDR, and Churchill, all 
           inside old, ornate picture frames. The wrinkled hand of MRS. 
           DINIS, 80s, reaches over and picks it up.

                                 MRS. DINIS
                        Hello?

                                 JAMES STEELE (V.O.)
                        Hello. I'd like to speak to District 
                        Attorney Edmund Dinis, please.

                                 MRS. DINIS
                        My son can't come to the phone --

           DISTRICT ATTORNEY EDMUND DINIS, 44, a handsome Latino 
           firebrand, yanks the phone away from his mother.

                                 EDMUND DINIS
                        This is Dinis. Who is this?

           INTERCUT

                                 JAMES STEELE
                        This is Steele. I'm down here in 
                        Edgartown with Chief Arena. He's 
                        been relying pretty heavily on my 
                        expertise with how to proceed.

                                 EDMUND DINIS
                        That's good. He could use some 
                        expertise.

                                 JAMES STEELE
                        I think the chief would feel more 
                        comfortable if I was assigned to 
                        the case as special prosecutor. 
                        Says he'd prefer someone more 
                        objective to --

                                 EDMUND DINIS
                        Fine by me.

                                 JAMES STEELE
                        Oh? Great. I'm glad you agree --

                                 EDMUND DINIS
                        As far as I understand it...we 
                        don’t really have the evidence to 
                        build a case. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 EDMUND DINIS (CONT'D)
                        We don’t have an autopsy report. 
                        The girl's already been embalmed. 
                        He's got an impeccable driving 
                        record. And for God sakes the guy 
                        had a concussion.

                                 JAMES STEELE
                        You're very wise, sir.

                                 EDMUND DINIS
                        Now, look. If you really are as 
                        friendly with the Kennedys as you 
                        say...pass along a message for me.

                                 JAMES STEELE
                        What's that?

                                 EDMUND DINIS
                        From me, through you, to Ted...and 
                        no one else...I won't touch this 
                        case unless Ted wants me to.

           INT. KENNEDY COMPOUND - DINING ROOM - DAY

           Ted sets the newspaper on the table in front of him. 

           The date reads: "MONDAY, JULY 21ST, 1969".

           Ted leans back into his chair. He flaps the sides of his New 
           York Times and puts his feet up on the table.

           Ted smiles broadly as he flips another page of his paper. 

           The front page headlines read: 

           - "MEN WALK ON MOON / ASTRONAUTS LAND ON PLAIN”

           The entire cover is filled with moon landing stories.

           INT. KENNEDY COMPOUND - GARGAN’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Ted studies himself in front of a full length mirror. He 
           wears a black suit and makes one last adjustment to his neck 
           tie. He cinches it close to a large neck brace.

           Ted pulls the brace above his collar to make it more prominent.

           In the background, Gargan sits on the bed reading from The 
           Boston Globe (with headlines also completely dominated by the 
           moon landing). He looks over his paper towards Ted.

                                 GARGAN
                        What're you doing over there?
                                 TED
                        What does it look like I'm doing?

                                 GARGAN
                        Well whatever it is, it looks 
                        ridiculous.

           Ted offers a huge grin.

                                 TED
                        I'm winning back the sympathies of 
                        my constituents.

           Gargan playfully grabs at the neck brace, but Ted equally 
           playfully slaps his hand away.

                                 GARGAN
                        Take that thing off.

                                 TED
                        Why? I wanna show the boys 
                        downstairs. I think it's going to 
                        really play.

                                 GARGAN
                             (skeptical)
                        They're the brightest minds in 
                        Washington --

           Gargan snatches at the brace again, but Ted hops out of reach.

                                 TED
                        Not for them! It's just gotta play 
                        for the assholes shoving cameras in 
                        my face.

                                 GARGAN
                        It looks fake.

                                 TED
                        It's as real as can be. It's a real 
                        neck brace.

           Gargan hooks onto the neck brace with one hand. Ted fights 
           back with an even tighter grip. The two men struggle in a tug 
           of war that quickly escalates beyond the playful.

                                 GARGAN
                        Well, it looks fake on you!

                                 TED
                        That's just because you know me!

           Gargan overpowers Ted, and they both drop to the ground. No 
           longer playing, Gargan digs his fingers under the collar. 
           Tries to rip it off Ted's throat. Ted holds on for dear life.
                                 GARGAN
                        Take it off, now!

                                 TED
                             (strained)
                        They're gonna write about how I'm a 
                        two time survivor. People will 
                        think I'm one of the victims.

                                 GARGAN
                        You're not a fucking victim!

           Gargan rips the neck brace away from Ted and throws it on the 
           ground. Not taking the assault lightly anymore, Ted pushes 
           Gargan off of him.

           They stand up. Catch their breath. Barely making eye contact.

           Ted stumbles over and picks the neck brace up off the floor. 
           He shoots a glare over his shoulder.

                                 TED
                        I'm going to ask Dad what he thinks.

           Ted stomps out of the room. Gargan tucks his shirt back in 
           and tries to regain his composure.

                                 TED (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        What do you all think of me wearing 
                        this to the funeral? We might be able 
                        to gain some sympathy.

                                 BRAIN TRUST (O.S.)
                        It looks phony. / You look like a 
                        putz! / Jack would never want to be 
                        photographed in his crutches! / Now 
                        it looks like you have three chins, 
                        you fat S.O.B.!

           Alarmed, Gargan creeps down the hallway towards the voices.

           INT. KENNEDY COMPOUND - JOSEPH KENNEDY'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Gargan arrives at the open doorway to find the entire brain 
           trust in a semicircle around Joseph Kennedy in bed. Ted 
           stands in front, caught off guard by their verbal attack.

                                 MCNAMARA
                        You’re going to seem weak in front 
                        of the Russians! 

           Gargan furrows his brow. His jaw hangs loose, stunned.

                                 TED
                        AH, TO HELL WITH YOU GUYS! IT'S MY 
                        LIFE! I'M DOING IT!
           Ted clips Gargan’s shoulder as he walks out.

           INT. TOWN CAR - DAY

           A shadow engulfs Ted, who rides in the backseat of a 
           luxurious white town car. His wife, JOAN KENNEDY, 32, sits as 
           far away as possible.

           Ted’s collar is undone. His tie is loose. He's wearing the 
           damn neck brace. 

           He reads from his New York Times. 

           The date reads: "TUESDAY, JULY 22ND, 1969". 

           The cover is filled with moon landing related stories. There 
           is no mention of Kennedy or Chappaquiddick.

           Ted sets down his paper and turns to his wife. She looks 
           elegant, dressed in a white, mod peacoat but more prominently 
           wearing a seething scowl.

                                 TED
                        Thanks for doing this, Joany.

                                 JOAN
                        Go fuck yourself, Teddy.

           INT. ST. VINCENT'S ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH - CONTINUOUS

           Organ music quietly echoes through the large sanctuary. Gwen 
           and Joseph Kopechne tend to a somber line of people offering 
           their condolences. David Burke ushers the queue along.

           The Boiler Room Girls squeeze into the cramped pews, filled 
           with MOURNERS and WELL WISHERS paying their respects.

           David Burke walks the last person in line to their seat, 
           leaving the Kopechnes alone. Gargan then steps up to the 
           grieving couple, hat in hand.

                                 GARGAN
                        Mr. and Mrs. Kopechne. I’m Joe 
                        Gargan. 

           The Kopechnes react puzzled.

                                 GARGAN (CONT’D)
                        You may not know me. I was a good 
                        friend of your daughter.

                                 MR. KOPECHNE
                        I'm glad. We're grateful to see how 
                        many lives she touched.
                                 GARGAN
                        I don't know how to say what I want 
                        to say...I feel for you both very 
                        deeply. I lost my family...my 
                        parents...when I was young. I can 
                        only imagine how much worse this is.
                             (beat)
                        I need to tell you...I needed to 
                        tell you both...I did everything I 
                        could for her.

           Gwen Kopechne offers little more than a glossy, hazed look. 
           Joseph Kopechne puts a concluding hand on Gargan's shoulder.

                                 MR. KOPECHNE
                        She appreciated all her friends very 
                        much. She was a very grateful girl.

                                 GARGAN
                        I tried to save her, Mr. Kopechne. 
                        I did everything I could.

                                 MR. KOPECHNE
                             (not paying attention)
                        What did you say your name was again?

           The front doors of the church swing open. Ted enters hand in 
           hand with Joan. The tumult of the reporters behind them 
           reverberates throughout the holy place. 

           Mrs. Kopechne tugs on her husband’s jacket.

                                 MRS. KOPECHNE
                        Dear, the Senator has arrived.

                                 MR. KOPECHNE
                        Excuse us, son.

           Mary Jo’s parents push past Gargan and beeline towards Ted.

                                 MR. KOPECHNE (CONT’D)
                        Senator. Thank you so much. Thank you 
                        for trying to save our daughter.

                                 TED
                        I'm so sorry for your loss.

           Mrs. Kopechne shakes Ted’s hand with great reverence. Gargan 
           stands yards away but still overhears, dismayed.

                                 MRS. KOPECHNE
                        Your family meant so much to her.

           Ted hugs the tearful Mrs. Kopechne. This stings Gargan.

                                 TED
                        Sorry for your loss. I can't imagine.
                                 MRS. KOPECHNE
                        If anyone understands tragedy, it's 
                        you Senator.

                                 MR. KOPECHNE
                        We both deeply appreciate that 
                        you're here. We know how much you 
                        must have sacrificed.

                                 TED
                        Thank you. Again, I’m sorry for 
                        your loss.

           Ted notices Gargan standing in earshot, arms crossed.

           Ted turns back and clasps both of the Kopechnes’ hands in one 
           final show of support. He then grabs Joan and they make a 
           break towards the pews, blowing past Gargan.

           INT. ST. VINCENT'S ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH - LATER

           Behind the altar, a PRIEST holds up the communion host. In 
           front, Mary Jo’s body rests in an open casket wearing a blue 
           peignoir.

           Ted squirms in his second row seat. His eyes locked on the 
           full view of Mary Jo, her body unsettling yet peaceful.

                                 PRIEST
                        This is the Lamb of God, who takes 
                        away the sins of the world.

           Ted turns his neck as far he can to look at the congregation 
           behind him. Everyone chokes back their emotions. 

           The Boiler Room Girls can’t mask their sadness any longer and 
           start to sob. But not Esther. She’s not crying. She holds a 
           cold gaze on the casket.

           Ted turns back to Mary Jo. He and Esther stay silent as --

                                 ALL
                        Lord, I am not worthy to receive 
                        you, but only say the word and I 
                        shall be healed.

           Ted remains silent. Fixed on Mary Jo.

           A CANTOR plays the piano. The dulcet tones of her voice fill 
           the church with “Ave Maria”. 

           The front and second rows stand up to receive communion. Ted 
           remains seated, lost in a trance. Joan grows impatient, 
           forcing Ted to snap back. He stands and follows the crowd.
           Behind Ted, Gargan wipes tears from his eyes as they approach 
           the priest handing out the host. 

           Ted steps up to receive communion.

                                 PRIEST
                        The body of Christ.

                                 TED
                        Amen.

           The priest puts the wafer in the Senator’s mouth. Ted steps 
           aside and does the sign of the cross as he kneels in front of 
           Mary Jo’s casket. 

           He stays kneeled. Looking up at the altar. At Mary Jo. Her 
           hands clasped around a crystal rosary.

                                 PRIEST
                             (to Gargan)
                        The body of Christ.

           The SOUND NEARLY DROPS OUT. Ted’s fixation on Mary Jo 
           intensifies as the priest’s voice becomes muffled --

           Ted remains motionless. He looks completely blank as he 
           studies Mary Jo’s face. The corner of her lips has a crack in 
           her makeup. The skin underneath is a deathly purple.

                                 ESTHER (O.S.)
                             (nearly inaudible)
                        Ted. Ted. Ted...

           EXT. ST. VINCENT'S ROMAN CATHOLIC CHURCH - COURTYARD - LATER

           Ted walks out a side exit of the church into a lush 
           courtyard, reporters behind the church gates clamor to berate 
           him. The Kopechnes stand to the side, surrounded by well-
           wishers who are again being handled by David Burke.  

                                 ESTHER (O.S.)
                             (muffled)
                        Ted.

           The SOUND COMES BACK INTO FOCUS as Ted glances back to see 
           Esther sidling up next to him.

                                 ESTHER (CONT’D)
                        You were up there a long time.

                                 TED
                        I was just lost in my thoughts.

           Ted turns away, but Esther steps back up next to him.
                                 ESTHER
                        How’s your wife?

                                 TED
                        She’s okay.

                                 ESTHER
                        No, really. I’m curious.

                                 TED
                        Well, tragedy has a way of defining 
                        people. 

                                 ESTHER
                        How’s that?

                                 TED
                        It can split them in two. On the one 
                        hand, you got someone like 
                        Jackie...she goes out and practically 
                        becomes an ambassador...keeping the 
                        family legacy handed down to her 
                        alive. And on the other hand, a 
                        tragedy like this cripples some 
                        people. Reduces them until they curl 
                        up in a ball, afraid or incapable of 
                        dealing with their feelings.
                             (beat)
                        Joany’s more the latter.

                                 ESTHER
                        And which one are you, Senator?

                                 TED
                        I think I’ve run out of feelings at 
                        this point.

                                 ESTHER
                        Well...I believe there’s a third 
                        kind of person. The kind of person 
                        who defines their own legacy in the 
                        face of tragedy.

                                 TED
                        My chance to define my own legacy

                                 ESTHER
                        Ted. Look at Mr. and Mrs. Kopechne.

           Ted looks over at the Kopechnes. Mrs. Kopechne dabs a few 
           tears from behind her dark sunglasses.

                                 ESTHER (CONT’D)
                        They don’t blame you. Why should 
                        America?
           Ted lets this sink in.

           EXT. HYANNIS AIRPORT - DAY

           Ted climbs down the stairs of his private jet inside a small 
           hanger. Reporters flood the entrance, ready to pounce with 
           questions.

           INT. KENNEDY COMPOUND - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           A New York Times newspaper comes flopping down in the center 
           of the coffee table. 

           The date reads: "WEDNESDAY, JULY 23RD, 1969". 

           The front page headlines read: 

           - “ASTRONAUTS COASTING HOMEWARD”
           - “3 KENNEDYS ATTEND FUNERAL FOR DROWNED SECRETARY”

           EXT. HYANNIS AIRPORT - DAY

           Ted pushes through a sea of microphones and cameras. 
           Reporters jockey for position as they lob questions at him.

                        there? / What about these rumors 
                        that Ms. Kopechne was pregnant? / 
                        Do you think there really is a 
                        Kennedy curse?

           Sorensen throws another paper on top of the other. The brain 
           trust all huddle around the coffee table.

           Ted scowls as he stomps the last few steps to his car. The 
           reporters questions starting to get to him.

           A particularly plucky female reporter, LIZ TROTTA, 32, breaks 
           to the front of the pack.
                                 LIZ TROTTA
                        What effect do you think this will

           INT. KENNEDY COMPOUND - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           The stack of papers sits three high. Suddenly, another lands  
           on top with a THUD.

                        craning around to see who was 
                        behind him at the funeral...”

           EXT. HYANNIS AIRPORT - DAY

           Ted steps into the back seat of his car. He stops midway with 
           his face inches from Liz Trotta’s face. He fumes.

                                 TED
                        I’ll make a statement at the 
                        appropriate time!

           INT. KENNEDY COMPOUND - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Another paper plops down on the growing stack in front of 
           Ted, who stares daggers back up at Sorensen.

                                 SORENSEN
                        That’s from the Boston Globe. Did you 
                        wanna hear from the New York Times?

                                 TED
                        That’s enough. I get it.

           Ted stands up and tamps his rage down to a simmer.

                                 TED (CONT’D)
                        The neck brace was a mistake. I see

                        But this country has a deep 
                        connection to the Kennedy name. And 
                        that’s a valuable fucking thing. 
                        You can’t let that just go to 
                        waste. We need to remind the 
                        American people what this family 
                        has been through and how much more 
                        we have left to achieve.

           Gargan stands in the corner clutching a twisted newspaper. He 
           furrows his brow with scorn.

                        It’s actually not a bad idea. The 
                        networks will donate the time if it’s 
                        part of their news coverage. We can 
                        frame the national conversation the 
                        way we want it framed.

                        look sympathetic.

                                 STEPHEN SMITH

                        It ends with an appeal. To the 
                        voters. The people who elected me. 
                        We’re going to remind them that 
                        this family perseveres.

           Ted paces back and forth like a general.

                        have a true compass, and we follow 
                        it.

           The men of the brain trust start to nod, impressed by Ted’s 
           command. Gargan twists the newspaper tighter.

                        Joey did everything we could to 
                        save that girl and prove there 
                        wasn’t a curse hanging over all the 
                        Kennedys.

           Sargent Shriver and Stephen Smith get up on their feet, 
           roused. McNamara pats Ted on the back.
                                 MCNAMARA
                        We’ve got a winner there. Sorensen 
                        can dress that speech up, and you 
                        come out of this thing unscathed. 
                        Hell, he might even be able to make 
                        you more electable.

           Gargan seethes. He pushes past Smith and Shriver. He throws 
           the newspaper onto the top of the stack at the center of the 
           room. It unfurls revealing the headlines: 

           - “TEDDY ESCAPES, BLONDE DROWNS”
           - “JERSEY GIRL CRASH VICTIM” 

           The front of the paper is dominated by a full page photo of 
           Mary Jo, which stares back up at Ted.

                                 GARGAN
                        Should we really have Ted play the

                        damn well how this mess got started 
                        in the first place.

                        we’ve come up with that has a 
                        chance of saving Ted. We need to 
                        all get behind it.

                                 GARGAN
                        These theatrics aren’t going to 
                        hold up in a court of law.

                                 MCNAMARA
                        He’s right. We need to make sure 
                        this case is closed before talking 
                        to the press.

           Gargan stares at McNamara sideways, confused at this sudden 
           turn of the conversation.

                                 STEPHEN SMITH
                        The hearing’s not til Monday.

                                 SORENSEN
                        We need that moved up A-S-A-P. 
                        We’ll never survive the weekend.

                                 STEPHEN SMITH
                        I’ll contact Steele and see to it.

           Gargan can’t keep listening to this. He marches towards the 
           door, glaring at Ted as he passes in front of him.
                                 MCNAMARA
                        Make sure we’ve got a solid plea 
                        deal in place first.

           Gargan shuts the door behind him.

           INT. KENNEDY COMPOUND - ENTRYWAY - DAY

           Gargan starts up the staircase. The door to the war room 
           CREAKS as it opens. Ted stands there.

                                 TED
                        Joey. Wait.

           Gargan turns back around to Ted, who pulls the door closed.

                                 TED (CONT’D)
                        Joey. I meant it before. I need you 
                        with me on this.

           Gargan looks down at Ted.

                                 GARGAN
                        I meant what I said before too. I 
                        can’t go any further. I’m packing my 
                        bags. I’ll be gone tomorrow.

                                 TED
                        Joey. This is your family too. 
                        Start acting like it.

           Ted throws the door open behind him as he re-enters the war 
           room. He SLAMS it shut.

           EXT. EDGARTOWN WOODS - NIGHT

           The bright lights of Edgartown shimmer behind the thick trees.

           A silhouette leans against a lone stump as two men approach. 
           They step into the moonlight revealing James Steele and Chief 
           Arena.

                                 STEELE
                        It’s done. The hearing’s been moved 
                        to Friday morning.

           The man leaning against the stump stands upright into the 
           light -- Paul Markham.

                                 MARKHAM
                        Good. The Senator will be there. He 
                        is prepared to plead guilty to 
                        leaving the scene.
                                 STEELE
                        I’ll then recommend he get the 
                        minimum sentence.

                                 CHIEF ARENA
                        And then that sentence will be 
                        immediately suspended.

                                 MARKHAM
                        Thank you, Chief. The Kennedy 
                        family greatly appreciates your 
                        assistance.

           INT. KENNEDY COMPOUND - TED’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Ted stares out the window holding a glass with ice cubes. He 
           grinds a cube between his teeth.

           OUTSIDE

           A large picket sign reads: “CAN YOU BUY JUSTICE?”

           At the gates of the Kennedy compound, reporters have been 
           joined by a group PROTESTERS. They each wave handmade signs:

           - “SWIM! DON’T RUN! ‘72”
           - “TALK TO THE PRESS TED”
           - “WHAT REALLY HAPPENED ON THE ISLAND?”

           AT THE WINDOW

           Ted chomps through a final piece of ice. He storms out of the 
           room and sets the empty glass on top of a newspaper.

           The date reads: "THURSDAY, JULY 24TH, 1969".

           The front page headlines read: 

           - “APOLLO 11 TO SPLASH DOWN TODAY”
           - “PRESIDENT IS OFF TO WELCOME CREW”

           IN THE HALLWAY

           Ted marches past his father’s bedroom. He peers inside 
           through the open doorway as he passes. 

           The entire brain trust stands in a semicircle around Joseph 
           Kennedy again. Their eyes track Ted as he exits view.

           Ted hustles down the stairs now with a big kid grin.

           INT. KENNEDY COMPOUND - KITCHEN - DAY

           The Kennedy children sit at the table with their breakfast.
           Ted saunters into the kitchen and peeks inside the fridge. He 
           lifts his head up from behind the door and looks back at the 
           children with an even bigger smile.

                                 TED
                        How’d you kids like to help out 
                        your Uncle Ted here with a big 
                        problem I’m having?

                                 KIDS
                        Yeah! / Sure, Uncle Teddy!

                                 TED
                        Great!

           He shuts the door revealing he’s holding a carton of eggs.

                                 TED (CONT’D)
                        There’s some folks outside with 
                        signs saying some not so nice 
                        things about me.

           The kids nod with understanding.

                                 TED (CONT’D)
                        Would you kids mind letting ‘em 
                        know how us Kennedys feel about 
                        that?!

                                 KIDS
                        YEAH!

                                 TED
                        Well okay, then!

           Ted hands an egg to each of the many children. He beams with 
           particular pride when he hands Teddy Jr. his egg. He tousles 
           his son’s hair as he sends him on his way.

           He hands the last egg to a spry, precocious girl, KERRY 
           KENNEDY, 9. She curtsies as she exits, revealing the cutest 
           and smallest of all the children yet.

           CHRISTOPHER KENNEDY, 6, stands in overalls with rosy cheeks 
           and big saucer eyes looking up at Ted.

                                 CHRISTOPHER
                        Can I have an egg, Uncle Ted?

                                 TED
                        Oh...I’m all out, son.

           Christopher’s face droops. He knows how to lay it on thick.

                                 TED (CONT’D)
                        Let me see what else we can find.
           Ted opens the fridge back up and rummages around a bit.

                                 TED (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Here we go!

           Ted comes back out from behind the fridge door holding a 
           watermelon. Christopher holds both hands out. Ted gives it to 
           Christopher, and the boy nearly topples over.

                                 CHRISTOPHER
                        Thanks, Uncle Teddy!

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           EXT. HYANNIS PORT - KENNEDY COMPOUND GATE - DAY

           An egg SMASHES against one of the protester’s face. The scene 
           quickly becomes chaotic; eggs seem to come from all 
           directions. Yolk splatters across their clothes and faces, as 
           the protesters try to use their signs for cover.

           The assault seems to subside for a moment and one of the 
           protesters holds down his sign to survey the damage --

           SPLAT.

           A watermelon explodes on top of the protester’s head. 
           Christopher smiles as broadly as his rosy cheeks allow.

           INT. KENNEDY COMPOUND - TED’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Ted slaps his knee, leaning against the window. He laughs 
           hysterically at the mess he’s made. Ted holds a football with 
           his one hand and wipes away tears with the other.

           SQUEAK. SQUEAK.

           He turns around to see Joseph Kennedy being pushed inside the 
           bedroom by Ann Gargan. The father looks up at his son with a 
           furious intensity. Ted’s smile disappears instantly. He 
           stands at attention.

                                 TED
                        Dad.

                                 ANN
                        Your father wanted to speak with you.

           Ted looks at his dad, waiting for him to speak. Joe remains 
           silent. The two men stare at each other so long it's almost 
           unbearable.

                                 TED
                        Dad. I was just trying to blow off 
                        a little steam --
           Joseph Kennedy GRUNTS. It sounds like he's attempting to say 
           a word, but it's difficult to decipher.

                                 TED (CONT’D)
                        What is it dad?

           Joseph Kennedy HUFFS. Ted walks towards him, leans forward. 

           SLAP.

           With all the force in his body, Joseph Kennedy slaps his son. 
           Ted looks at him stunned and ashamed. A handprint still 
           stings across his face.

           Ted looks back at Ann. With as much dignity as he can muster --

                                 TED (CONT’D)
                        Ann, I need you to leave us. It is 
                        very rare these days that I'm alone 
                        with my father, and the things I need 
                        to say to him I need to say alone.

           Ann leaves, gently closing the door behind her.

           Silence.

           Ted and his dad stare at each other for a long beat. An 
           uncomfortably long beat.

                                 TED (CONT’D)
                        Dad, did you know that I never 
                        wanted to be President? 
                             (beat)
                        Does that even matter to you?

           Ted sets the football down. Joseph Kennedy doesn’t react.

                                 TED (CONT’D)
                        I want to make you proud. It’s all 
                        I’ve ever wanted. But you’ve never 
                        been interested in me. Not until now.
                             (beat)
                        And this. This is the moment you 
                        finally show you care?

           Ted gestures towards the window. Joseph Kennedy doesn’t react.

                                 TED (CONT’D)
                        I’ve spent my whole life chasing 
                        your dreams for you. Just like Joe 
                        Jr. Just like Jack. Just like Bobby. 
                        And look what happened to them.

           With each name Ted steps closer and closer to his father. 

           He stands over him. Joseph Kennedy looks up at his son. His 
           frail blue eyes draw Ted in closer. Ted kneels to eye level.
                                 TED (CONT’D)
                        They were great men. But they 
                        weren’t great because of who you 
                        were. They were great because of 
                        who they were. 
                             (beat)
                        I want to be a great man. I just 
                        don’t know who I am.

           A tear rolls down Ted’s face. His father puts a hand on his 
           son’s shoulders. He leans towards him.

                                 JOSEPH KENNEDY
                        ...You’ll...

           Ted leans closer. His head resting against his father’s, 
           completely vulnerable.

                                 JOSEPH KENNEDY (CONT’D)
                        ...You’ll never...be...great...

           Ted pulls his father into a full embrace. He weeps into his 
           shoulder. Joseph Kennedy stares ahead not betraying any emotion.

           Ted holds his father tighter.

           He stands up. He exhales all the air from his lungs. Ted 
           wipes his eyes and adjusts his shirt. Without looking back at 
           his father, he walks out the door. Joseph Kennedy sits alone.

           INT. KENNEDY COMPOUND - GARGAN’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Gargan yanks clothes out of a drawer and stuffs them into one 
           of his open suitcases. Ted bursts into the room.

                                 TED
                        Joey. I need you.

           Gargan SNAPS a suitcase shut. He moves on to the next one.

                                 GARGAN
                        If it's about that statement, Ted, 
                        I want nothing to do with it.

                                 TED
                        It's the opposite. 

           Gargan turns away from his luggage and looks Ted in the eye.

                                 TED (CONT’D)
                        I need you to write me a resignation.

           Gargan reacts stunned. He chokes out his next words.

                                 GARGAN
                        I'll take care of it.
                                 TED
                        Thank you. This’ll be the last time.

           Ted offers a handshake. Gargan accepts, sealing the promise.

                                 GARGAN
                        I'm proud of you.

           Ted breaks away. He walks back over to the open door.

                                 TED
                        Thanks. Just don't tell anyone else 
                        how proud you are.

           Ted slams the door behind him.

           INT. TOWN CAR - DAY

           A shadow engulfs Ted, who sits in the backseat, as reporters 
           swarm around him.

           A New York Times newspaper rests on the seat next to him. 

           The date reads: "FRIDAY, JULY 25TH, 1969". 

           The headlines read: 

           - "ASTRONAUTS BACK FROM MOON; BEGIN 18 DAYS IN QUARANTINE"
           - "KENNEDY TO ENTER COURT PLEA TODAY”

           INT. EDGARTOWN DISTRICT COURT - DAY

           Ted sits in a nearly empty courtroom. JUDGE BOYLE eyes him 
           over. He looks from the defense where Ted sits with a LEGAL 
           TEAM of about eight men, over to the prosecution which is 
           just James Steele. Chief Arena stands on the ready.

                                 JUDGE BOYLE
                        How does the defendant plead?

                                 TED
                        Guilty.

                                 STEELE
                        The prosecution recommends the 
                        minimum sentence be offered.

                                 JUDGE BOYLE
                        Proceed.

                                 KENNEDY LAWYER
                        We ask that any sentence that the 
                        court imposes be suspended.
                                 STEELE
                        The ends of justice would best be 
                        served were the defendant given a 
                        suspended sentence.

                                 JUDGE BOYLE
                        The sentence is suspended.

           Judge Boyle SLAMS his gavel down.

           EXT. EDGARTOWN DISTRICT COURT - DAY

           Ted stands at a podium with a microphone on the court steps. 
           A throng of reporters hurl questions, while a crowd of locals 
           contribute a cacophonous mix of CHEERS and BOOS.

                                 TED
                        I have made my plea. I have requested 
                        time on the networks tonight to speak 
                        to the people of Massachusetts and 
                        the nation. Your questions will all 
                        be answered then...

           EXT. HYANNIS PORT - KENNEDY COMPOUND GATE - DUSK

           The black sedan passes through the wrought iron gate where 
           news vans park along the driveway. Cables run all the way up 
           the steps and through the doors of the sprawling compound. 

           INT. KENNEDY COMPOUND - ENTRYWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Ted follows the path of the cables with his eyes. They lead 
           past the staircase to a closed set of double doors. Ted 
           swings them both open.

           INT. KENNEDY COMPOUND - STUDY - CONTINUOUS

           A flurry of activity. Staffers and NEWS CREW hustle about the 
           Kennedy family study, which has been converted into the set 
           for tonight’s live broadcast.

           Ted brushes past David Burke as he steps into the light. Ted 
           spins around to catch a glance of all the people and equipment.

                                 DAVID BURKE
                        Let me run through the blocking 
                        we’ve come up with.

                                 TED
                        Did you run this all by Sorensen?
           David Burke leads him over to the center of the desk where 
           the lights have all been positioned. Ted sits on top of the 
           desk facing away from two heavy duty broadcast cameras.

                                 DAVID BURKE
                        This whole thing is Sorensen’s 
                        baby. I think we’ve got a real 
                        winner here.

                                 TED
                        If you say so.

           Burke hands Ted a small stack of papers.

                                 DAVID BURKE
                        Do you want a few minutes to review 
                        this draft?

                                 TED
                        I can read fine, David. Just tell 
                        me what to do for the cameras.

           David Burke steps away from the desk and waves his arms.

                                 DAVID BURKE
                        Alright, folks! I know you have some 
                        work still left to do. But the 
                        Senator needs a moment. If I could 
                        have all the crew just wait outside.

           The crew shuffles out the door, in no hurry. Gifford moseys 
           up to Ted and David Burke, ready for a meeting of the minds.

                                 DAVID BURKE (CONT’D)
                        Dun. Wait outside the door. We’ll 
                        tell you when to bring them back in.

           Gifford deflates and slinks out of the room. He shuts the 
           door behind him, leaving the room in a calm silence.

                                 DAVID BURKE (CONT’D)
                        So, for the first half of the speech, 
                        we felt it would seem more stately... 
                        more proper for you to be reading.

           David Burke points from the camera at the center of the room 
           to the one near the entrance.

                                 DAVID BURKE (CONT’D)
                        Camera One here is our wide. Camera 
                        Two is our close-up. Here in 
                        paragraph three when you start in on 
                        the accident. That’s where we felt 
                        you should turn, and we’ll cut for 
                        the close-up.
                                 TED
                        Why’s that?

                                 DAVID BURKE
                        More sympathy. More power. Gives the 
                        viewer a sense you’re in control.

           Ted nods. He looks down at his feet as David Burke continues.

                                 DAVID BURKE (CONT’D)
                        Then halfway through, we have you 
                        make a direct appeal to the voters. 
                             (beat)
                        And we think to get them to really 
                        want to write in, mail letters, and 
                        show their support for you and the 
                        family...you should look straight 
                        into camera, set the papers down, 
                        and just talk from the heart.

                                 TED
                        David, I’m not off book on this 
                        thing.

                                 DAVID BURKE
                        No, no...we’ll have cue cards. 
                        They’re being done right now.

           Ted nods. Staring down at his shoes. A pair of fine leather 
           shoes. He slips them off. They both land on the hardwood 
           floor with a THUD.

                                 TED
                        Okay. I’m ready.

           INT. KENNEDY COMPOUND - ENTRYWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Gifford stands guard in front of the study. The door behind 
           him opens just a crack and David Burke peeks out.

                                 DAVID BURKE
                        We’re ready.

           INT. KENNEDY COMPOUND - STUDY - CONTINUOUS

           The news crew and staffers trudge back in. They scurry about 
           making last minute adjustments CALLED OUT by a FLOOR PRODUCER.

           Ted sits at the desk focused on reviewing Sorensen’s speech. 

           Gargan enters. He pushes through the confusion and heads 
           towards Ted. As he approaches, he notices Ted’s shoes strewn 
           about the floor. He steps over them to lean in close.
                                 GARGAN
                        Ted. I’ve got it. I’ve got it, 
                        right here.

                                 TED
                        Oh. Thanks, Joey. I really 
                        appreciate that.

           Gargan pulls the resignation out from his sport coat pocket. 
           He smooths out the crease down the middle. Sets it right on 
           top of Sorensen’s speech. Ted keeps his eyes fixed on Gargan.

                                 GARGAN
                        Well...you wanna look it over?

                                 TED
                        I’ve been thinking...

           Gargan looks over his glasses back at Ted.

                                 TED (CONT’D)
                        Joey. Do we both not have flaws?

                                 GARGAN
                        Of course we do. We all do. 

                                 TED
                        Right. I thought that myself --

                                 GARGAN
                        What’s right is what’s here in 
                        front of you.

                                 TED
                        I don’t know what’s right anymore.

                                 GARGAN
                        Ted. I didn’t tell you before...but 
                        I agree...the Kennedys do have a 
                        true compass. And, it’s because you 
                        followed yours that we’re here in 
                        the first place. 
                             (beat)
                        You told the police you were 
                        driving. You told the truth. You 
                        had me write this resignation.

                                 TED
                        Sorensen's speech --

                                 GARGAN
                        It’s a lie! I was there. He made it 
                        up. Every word. All the thoughts 
                        and emotions. I was there.
                             (beat)
                        I’ve been there, with you...the 
                        whole time.
                                 TED
                        It may give me a chance...for a new 
                        beginning.

                                 GARGAN
                        Bullshit, Ted.

           Ted takes a deep breath. He considers his next words carefully.

                                 TED
                        You have flaws, Joey. We all do. 
                        You said so yourself.
                             (beat)
                        Moses had a temper. Peter betrayed 
                        Jesus. I have Chappaquiddick.

                                 GARGAN
                        Moses having a temper never made 
                        him leave a girl at the bottom of 
                        the Red Sea.

                                 FLOOR PRODUCER
                        We still don’t have anyone to hold 
                        the cue cards!

           Ted shoots up. 

                                 TED
                        Ole Joey’ll fix it! He’d be a great 
                        cue card holder. Wouldn’t cha Joey?

           Ted deftly grabs the resignation speech and stuffs it back 
           into Gargan’s sport coat. 

           Gargan seethes. 

                                 FLOOR PRODUCER
                        And we’re live in 10, 9...

           The Floor Producer drags Gargan away from Ted.

                                 FLOOR PRODUCER (CONT’D)
                        8, 7, 6...

           He sets Gargan below the main camera and shoves the cue cards 
           into his arms. Gargan stoops down and scowls back up at Ted.

                                 FLOOR PRODUCER (CONT’D)
                        5, 4...

           The producer holds up three fingers, finishes the countdown.

           Ted looks down at Gargan. He straightens up the papers of 
           Sorensen’s speech. He’s won. He’s ready to begin.
           TED’S BROADCAST IMAGE FILLS THE SCREEN

           Ted holds a stack of papers in his hands and looks directly 
           in the camera.

                                 TED
                        My fellow citizens: I have

                        to the people of Massachusetts 
                        about the tragedy which happened 
                        last Friday evening. Prior to my 
                        appearance in court it would have 
                        been improper for me to comment on 
                        these matters. But tonight I am 
                        free to tell you what happened and 
                        to say what it means to me.

           INT. KENNEDY COMPOUND - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           McNamara, Sorensen, and the brain trust crowd around the TV. 
           Ted turns to Camera Two. The close up.

                                 TED (V.O.)
                        On Chappaquiddick Island, I attended 
                        a cook-out I had helped sponsor for 
                        a devoted group of Kennedy campaign 
                        secretaries. When I left the party, 
                        I was accompanied by one of these 
                        girls, Miss Mary Jo Kopechne.

           They watch with the same intensity that they would rooting 
           for the Boston Red Sox.

           INT. KOPECHNE HOME - CONTINUOUS

           The Kopechnes sit in their matching recliners facing the TV.

                                 TED (V.O.)
                        Mary Jo was one of the most devoted 
                        members of the staff of Senator 
                        Robert Kennedy. She worked for him 
                        for four years and was broken up over 
                        his death. For this reason, and 
                        because she was such a gentle, kind, 
                        and idealistic person, all of us 
                        tried to help her feel that she still 
                        had a home with the Kennedy family.

           The Kopechnes share the first smile they’ve had in a week.

           Chief Arena drives his police cruiser down a desolate main 
           street of Edgartown. Ted’s speech plays through the radio.
                                 TED (V.O.)
                        There is no truth, no truth 
                        whatever, to the widely circulated 
                        suspicions of immoral conduct that 
                        have been leveled at my behavior 
                        and hers regarding that evening. 
                        Nor was I driving under the

           all glow in unison with the same flicker of the TV screens.

           INT. SENATE CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Dick Drayne is glued to the TV. He sits on pins and needles 
           through each and every one of Ted’s words. 

                                 TED (V.O.)
                        I made immediate and repeated 
                        efforts to save Mary Jo by diving 
                        into the strong and murky current, 
                        but succeeded only in increasing my 
                        state of utter exhaustion and 
                        alarm. Although my doctors informed 
                        me that I suffered a cerebral 
                        concussion, as well as shock, I do 
                        not seek to escape responsibility 
                        for my actions after lying 
                        exhausted in the grass for an 
                        undetermined time...

           Markham stands in the back corner of the war room. He looks 
           down at his glass of whiskey.

                        ...I walked back to the cottage 
                        where the party was being held and 
                        requested the help of two friends, 
                        my cousin, Joseph Gargan, and Paul 
                        Markham. Their strenuous efforts, 
                        undertaken at some risk to their 
                        own lives, also proved futile. All 
                        kinds of scrambled thoughts were 
                        reflected in the various 
                        inexplicable, inconsistent, and 
                        inconclusive things I said and did, 
                        including such questions as whether 
                        some awful curse did actually hang 
                        over all the Kennedys, whether 
                        there was some justifiable reason 
                        for me to doubt what had happened 
                        and to delay my report.

           Markham takes a slug from his drink. Walks out of the room.

                        This last week has been an 
                        agonizing one for me and for the 
                        members of my family. And the grief 
                        we feel over the loss of a 
                        wonderful friend will remain with 
                        us the rest of our lives.

           Ted turns back to Camera One. The camera cuts to the new wide 
           angle as Ted puts down his papers and “speaks from the heart” 
           as he looks directly into camera.

                        These events, the publicity, 
                        innuendo, and whispers which have 
                        surrounded them and my admission of 
                        guilt this morning raises the 
                        question in my mind of whether my 
                        standing among the people of my 
                        State has been so impaired that I 
                        should resign my seat in the United 
                        States Senate.

           Gargan stares daggers straight through Ted as he flips to the

                        For this reason, I would understand 
                        full well why some might think it 
                        right for me to resign.

           Gargan turns away in disgust.

           TED’S BROADCAST IMAGE FILLS THE SCREEN

           Ted looks directly into the camera. His eyes staring straight 
           back at you.

                        And so I ask you tonight, the 
                        people of Massachusetts, to think 
                        this through with me. In facing 
                        this decision, I seek your advice 
                        and opinion. In making it, I seek 
                        your prayers -- for this is a 
                        decision that I will have finally 
                        to make on my own. Thank you and 
                        good night.

                                                              FADE OUT.

           Over black:

           Ted Kennedy went on to serve forty more years as Senator 
           after a massive outpouring of support. Known as “The Lion of 
           the Senate,” he became the fourth longest serving Senator in 
           U.S. history.

           Joseph Kennedy suffered from the last in a series of strokes 
           on November 18, 1969. He died in his Hyannis Port home...just 
           four months after Chappaquiddick. Ted Kennedy felt his 
           actions may have shortened his father’s life.

           Joseph Gargan became estranged from the Kennedy family. He 
           has retired into private life.

           In 1980, Ted sought to defeat incumbent President Carter for 
           the Democratic Presidential Nomination... 

           ...He was unsuccessful.

           THE END.
