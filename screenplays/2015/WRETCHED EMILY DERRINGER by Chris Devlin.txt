           EXT. STREET - NIGHT

           Holdenfield, Pennsylvania - 1960

           A town deserted.

           The shops are all closed, the doors are all locked, the 
           lights are all out.

           EMILY DERRINGER (13) walks down the street wheeling her 
           BICYCLE beside her and her SATCHEL dangling off her shoulder.

           She’s all alone. Until -

           Her shadow looms as HEADLIGHTS shine against her back.

           She turns, shielding her eyes from the brightness.

           A CADILLAC slows to a crawl as it pulls up beside her.

           FATHER BELL (60s) leans over from the driver’s side.

                                 FATHER BELL
                        Is that little Emily Derringer I 
                        see?

           She keeps walking.

           He follows.

                                 FATHER BELL (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing out there in the 
                        dark?

           She points to the rusted NAIL jutting from her front TIRE.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        My bike got a flat.

                                 FATHER BELL
                        Let me give you a lift then.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        That’s all right. I’m almost home.

                                 FATHER BELL
                        Nonsense. I insist.

           Emily stops walking. She looks around.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        I don’t know...
                                 FATHER BELL
                        Sweetie, it’s too dangerous for a 
                        little girl to be out by herself.

           He smiles, revealing a set of crooked yellow teeth.

           He pops the TRUNK.

                                 FATHER BELL (CONT’D)
                        Get in.

           She scans her surroundings one more time.

           Nobody else in sight.

           Deep breath. 

           She wheels her bike to the trunk. Puts it inside.

           Bell opens the passenger side door.

           She hesitates.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        If it’s all the same to you, I 
                        think I’ll sit in back.

           He pats the seat.

                                 FATHER BELL
                        I won’t bite.

           Silence.

                                 FATHER BELL (CONT’D)
                        Suit yourself then.

           INT. CADILLAC

           Emily climbs in and sits directly behind Bell.

           He adjusts the REARVIEW to get a better look.

                                 FATHER BELL
                        Tell me Emily - what’s a sweet 
                        little thing like you doing out at 
                        this hour?

           She pats her satchel.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        Tomorrow’s the first day of school. 
                        I was buying supplies.
                                 FATHER BELL
                        You shouldn’t be out after dark. 
                        Not these days.

           He stares back at her. Grins.

                                 FATHER BELL (CONT’D)
                        You’ve heard about the murders, 
                        haven’t you?

           Emily gulps at the mention of the word.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        Only a little. From what the other 
                        kids say. Ma and Pa don’t talk 
                        about those things around me - they 
                        think I’ll scare.

           She looks ahead.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER (CONT’D)
                        You can take the right here.

           Bell turns right, but his eyes stay fixed on Emily.

                                 FATHER BELL
                        They’re right to worry. “The Misfit 
                        Butcher” - that’s what the papers 
                        are calling him. Grisly stuff.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        Turn left.

           He does.

                                 FATHER BELL
                        He’s taken five victims this Summer 
                        alone. Anyone could be next.
                             (beat)
                        Even little girls.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        Another right.

                                 FATHER BELL
                        So you understand why I couldn’t 
                        leave you wandering by yourself 
                        where any old maniac could snatch 
                        you. That would be...

           He trails off as he finally turns his attention back to the 
           road.

           They’ve driven into an ALLEY. 
           A dead end.

                                 FATHER BELL (CONT’D)
                        Wait.

           He looks around.

           As Emily opens her satchel.

                                 FATHER BELL (CONT’D)
                        Where are we?

           A BLADE wraps around his neck.

           Behind him - Emily grasps the handles of the WIRE SAW.

           She pulls as hard as she can.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        Where no one will see us.

           She digs her feet into the back of his seat, wrenches it back 
           and forth cutting deeper and deeper into this throat, until -

           She severs his HEAD from his shoulders.

           Blood sprays from his throat, splashing against the 
           windshield.

           Emily wipes the dripping mess from her eyes. Looks down at 
           her stained dress.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER (CONT’D)
                        Nuts.

           And now Ladies & Gentlemen - in a perfect world - this is 
           where Phil Phillips croons “Sea of Love.”

                                       MAIN TITLE:

                               THE WRETCHED EMILY DERRINGER

           EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT

           Emily crawls out of the car and over to a group of TRASH 
           CANS.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER (V.O.)
                        Dear Diary - the night went 
                        splendidly.

           From behind the trash cans she retrieves a new BICYCLE TIRE 
           and a canister of GASOLINE.
                                                                     LATER

           Emily attaches the new tire to her bike, throws the old one 
           in the backseat.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER (V.O.)
                        Indeed, I’m tempted to throw 
                        modesty to the wind and declare the 
                        mutilation of Father Bell my best 
                        work to date.

                                                                     LATER

           She opens the door to the Cadillac. 

           Bell’s body slumps over, hitting the ground with a soft thud.

           She readies the wire saw. Pulls it taut.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER (V.O.)
                        Despite the ample competition.

           INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE LOBBY, FLASHBACK - MORNING

           A RECEPTIONIST enters the Doctor’s office, turning on all the 
           lights.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER (V.O.)
                        There’s of course Dr. Sorensen.

           After taking off her coat, she sees the door to the EXAMINING 
           ROOM is ajar.

           INT. EXAMINING ROOM, FLASHBACK

           The Receptionist pushes the door open, looks inside.

           She screams.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER (V.O.)
                        Like me, he learned that actually 
                        no - tetanus shots hurt quite a 
                        lot, thank you very much. 

           DR. SORENSEN lays dead on the EXAMINING TABLE.

           Hundreds of HYPODERMIC NEEDLES protrude from his body.
           INT. MOVIE THEATER, FLASHBACK - NIGHT

           An elderly CUSTODIAN absentmindedly sweeps popcorn in a 
           vacant theater.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER (V.O.)
                        And silencing Chatty Kathy 
                        Beauregard was particularly 
                        satisfying. 

           He looks down when his BROOM hits something.

           A woman’s FOOT. He looks up to see -

           KATHY BEAUREGARD (40s) siting dead in her chair, her arms 
           skewered to the armrests with KNIVES.

           Her mouth is sown shut.

           A CLOTHESPIN is clipped over her nose.

           EXT. ALLEY

           Emily - soaked in blood - closes the TRUNK.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER (V.O.)
                        But a man of God?

           She wipes her hands.

           INT. CADILLAC

           Emily drives the car, barely able to see over the STEERING 
           WHEEL.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER (V.O.)
                        That should get the citizens of 
                        Holdenfield, Pennsylvania shaking 
                        in their boots.

           EXT. TOWN SQUARE - NIGHT

           A large OAK TREE grows from the center of Town Square, 
           directly in front of TOWN HALL.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER (V.O.)
                        Not that the hypocrite didn’t 
                        deserve it.

           The CADILLAC pulls up in front.
           INT. CADILLAC

           Emily’s about to open the door - 

           Then stops.

           Sinks down in her seat, out of sight.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER (V.O.)
                        While I’m certainly no expert on 
                        the Bible, I’m pretty sure a Priest 
                        shouldn’t be driving a Cadillac.

           A POLICE CAR drives by.

           After a moment, she peeks up again.

           Coast is clear.

           EXT. TOWN SQUARE

           Emily douses the car with GASOLINE

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        And who knows? Maybe now that he’s 
                        gone, we’ll get some good books 
                        back in the library. I’ve heard 
                        good things about Naked Lunch.

           When it’s soaked, she stands back. Lights a MATCH.

                                                                     LATER

           FIRE TRUCKS roar to the scene.

           The Cadillac is ablaze. Smoke pours into the sky.

           FIREFIGHTERS leap from the trucks.

           They all let out a collective gasp.

           See the TREE, illuminated in the dark by the flames.

           Hung from its branches are Bell’s SEVERED REMAINS.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER (V.O.)
                        Yes Diary - it’s been a magical 
                        Summer.

           They glow like Christmas ornaments.
           INT. EMILY’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Sitting in bed, Emily closes her DIARY.

           She places it on her BEDSIDE TABLE next to her ALARM CLOCK.

           She pulls the BUTTERFLY SHEETS up to her chin.

           Closes her eyes. Smiles.

                                                              NEXT MORNING

           The alarm clock shrieks.

           Her eyes shoot open.

           The smile’s gone.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER (V.O.)
                        Too bad it has to end.

           EXT. DERRINGER’S FRONT YARD - MORNING

           The DERRINGER’S HOUSE - like every other home on the block. 

           White PICKET FENCE. Immaculately green LAWN. AMERICAN FLAG 
           hanging by the door.

           A NEWSPAPER lands on the grass.

           INT. DERRINGER’S KITCHEN - MORNING

                             THE MISFIT BUTCHER KILLS AGAIN!

           So boasts the front page of the HOLDENFIELD BUGLE.

           It’s read by DAVID DERRINGER (40) as he smokes his pipe at 
           the KITCHEN TABLE.

                                 DAVID DERRINGER
                        Horrifying. Truly horrifying.

           JUDY DERRINGER (30s, puts June Cleaver to shame) slaves over 
           the STOVE, scrambling EGGS and cooking BACON to perfection.

                                 JUDY DERRINGER
                        What’s that, dear?

                                 DAVID DERRINGER
                        Kennedy’s up in the polls. He could 
                        win this thing, Judy.
           She places a PLATE in front of him. Goes for a kiss.

           He moves his head away.

                                 DAVID DERRINGER (CONT’D)
                        This country’s going to Hell and 
                        the American people are weaving the 
                        handbasket.

           Defeated, she goes back to the stove.

                                 JUDY DERRINGER
                        Eat your breakfast, dear. You’ll 
                        feel better.

                                 DAVID DERRINGER
                        It’s the children I’m worried 
                        about.

                                 JUDY DERRINGER
                        Speaking of, where is our little 
                        darling?

           INT. EMILY’S BEDROOM

           Dressed to the nines, Emily stands in front of her MIRROR.

           She scrutinizes her reflection.

           She smoothes out her dress.

           Adjusts the RIBBON in her hair.

           Sighs. She’s a harsh critic.

                                 JUDY DERRINGER (O.S.)
                             (Shouting from down 
                              stairs)
                        Emily! Breakfast!

           She’s about to head down, but catches something in the 
           mirror.

           BLOOD - just a spot - below her ear.

           She licks her finger. Wipes it away.

           INT. DERRINGER’S KITCHEN

           Trudging into the kitchen, Emily instantly brightens when she 
           sees the front page.
                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        It made the paper already?

           She hangs her SATCHEL off the back of her chair and takes a 
           seat across from her father.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER (CONT’D)
                        Can I see?

           He absentmindedly hands her the front page.

           But Judy intercepts.

                                 JUDY DERRINGER
                        Absolutely not.

           She places a plate piled high with BACON in front of Emily.

                                 JUDY DERRINGER (CONT’D)
                        That’s not appropriate for 
                        children. 

           Disgusted, Emily grabs the lone piece of TOAST and shoves the 
           rest away.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        I’m not a child. I’m thirteen. You 
                        know - a teenager?

           Judy’s not listening. Her focus is still on the paper.

                                 JUDY DERRINGER
                        That poor Father Bell. 

           She shoves it in front of David’s face.

           It depicts a cartoonishly evil “Artist’s Rendering” of The 
           Misfit - a scruffy, rat-like hermit with drooling fangs.

                                 JUDY DERRINGER (CONT’D)
                        To think, David - a man like that 
                        roaming our streets. Goodness, the 
                        whole thing gives me the willies.

           Shaking her head, she tosses the paper into the TRASH.

           Notices Emily’s untouched plate.

                                 JUDY DERRINGER (CONT’D)
                        Aren’t you hungry dear?

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        We’ve been over this. I do not eat 
                        meat.
                                 JUDY DERRINGER
                        Don’t be silly. Everyone likes 
                        bacon.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        I’m not everyone. And I don’t think 
                        I’m crazy for thinking a poor, 
                        innocent animal should not have to 
                        die to feed some...person.

           David looks at his watch.

                                 DAVID DERRINGER
                        Shouldn’t you be getting to school?

           Emily gets up, slings the satchel over her shoulder.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        And then sometimes, I envy swine.

           Judy takes the plate, dumps the bacon on David’s.

           She washes it in the sink.

                                 JUDY DERRINGER
                        Don’t be like that. First day of 
                        Middle School? That’s when you meet 
                        all your new friends.

           Emily doesn’t dignify that with a response.

           Instead, while nobody’s looking, she opens the trash can.

           She grabs the paper and stuffs it in her satchel.

           EXT. FRONT PORCH

           Emily opens the front door.

           CRASH.

           GLASS shatters and MILK splashes at Emily’s feet, soaking her 
           Mary Janes.

           The dropped MILK CRATE lays overturned on the porch.

           The MILK MAN - GARRET BLUESTONE (30) - clasps at his heart.

                                 GARRET BLUESTONE
                        Oh my goodness.

           He starts picking up the broken glass.
                                 GARRET BLUESTONE (CONT’D)
                        I am so very sorry. 

                                 JUDY DERRINGER (O.S.)
                        What was that?

           Judy comes swiftly to investigate the noise.

                                 GARRET BLUESTONE
                        It’s my fault, ma’am. I was making 
                        my deliveries when your daughter 
                        gave me a start.

           When she sees Garret - with his boyishly handsome face and 
           sheepish smile - Judy melts.

           She leans flirtatiously against the door frame.

                                 JUDY DERRINGER
                        Oh my, my - who do we have here?

           Emily looks at her mother with horror.

           Garret stands, takes off his hat, and shakes her hand.

                                 GARRET BLUESTONE
                        The name’s Garret Bluestone, ma’am. 
                        I’ll be your new Milk Man.

           This immediatly strikes Emily as odd.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        What happened to Mr. Gregory?

                                 GARRET BLUESTONE
                        I’m afraid his mother took a turn. 
                        Had to leave town to care for her, 
                        the poor fella.

                                 JUDY DERRINGER
                        Well it is a pleasure to have you 
                        in his stead.
                             (beat)
                        Isn’t it Emily?

           Emily pushes past Bluestone.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        I’m going to be late.

           After she’s gone.

                                 JUDY DERRINGER
                        Daughters.
           Garret smiles.

           EXT. MIDDLE SCHOOL - MORNING

           Hordes of students congregate outside the large, brick 
           SCHOOLHOUSE.

           Emily sits stationary on her bike, bracing herself.

           She’d be more comfortable facing a cloud of mustard gas.

           INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY

           A sea of students in various states of puberty roam the 
           hallways.

           Emily forces her way through the crowd, getting pushed and 
           shoved as if she’s not even there.

           She clenches a SCRAP of PAPER designating her LOCKER NUMBER 
           as she catches snippets of passing conversations.

           Talk of the Misfit is on everyone’s lips.

           This alone brings a smile to her face.

           But then she sees her LOCKER, and the smile disappears.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        No...

           She checks the piece of paper again. This can’t be right.

           But it is. #248

           Standing at #249 is PEPPER DEVONSHIRE (13).

           She’s blonde, she’s beautiful, she’s the fucking worst.

           She’s flanked on all sides by her adoring subjects, a pack of 
           PREPPY GIRLS trying to match their leader’s style and grace, 
           but to no avail. There can be only one Pepper Devonshire.

           Emily trudges towards the inevitable.

           And is forced to stand awkwardly outside their group.

                                 PEPPER DEVONSHIRE
                        The last night there, we watched 
                        the sunset and ate lobster rolls on 
                        his father’s yacht. 
           They let out a collective “Awwwwe.”

                                 ADORING SUBJECT 1
                        You’re so lucky, Pepper.

                                 PEPPER DEVONSHIRE
                        I know, isn’t it the most? I’m 
                        telling you girls, the boys here 
                        have nothing on the boys in 
                        Nantucket. I can’t wait to go back.

           Emily can’t take it anymore.

           She squeezes past them to her locker.

                                 PEPPER DEVONSHIRE (CONT’D)
                        Um, excuse me?

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        You’re excused.

                                 PEPPER DEVONSHIRE
                        We were having a private 
                        conversation.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        Then have it privately. You’re 
                        blocking my locker.

           Pepper looks aghast.

                                 PEPPER DEVONSHIRE
                        Um...what?

                                 ADORING SUBJECT 1
                        Oh no.

                                 ADORING SUBJECT 2
                        I think lockers go alphabetically. 
                        Devonshire.
                             (Sneers at Emily)
                        And Derringer.

           The BELL rings.

                                 PEPPER DEVONSHIRE
                        Oh my God, you’re telling me I have 
                        to spend the whole school year with 
                        my locker next to Emily “The Pig” 
                        Derringer?

           She leads her girls away.
                                 PEPPER DEVONSHIRE (CONT’D)
                        Somebody kill me.

           As the hallway empties, Emily stands alone at her locker.

           Seething.

           She reaches into her satchel.

           Grabs a BUTCHER KNIFE.

           Starts after Pepper -

           But stops herself.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        Not yet...

           She puts the knife back in the satchel.

           Returns to her locker.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER (V.O.)
                        Pepper Devonshire. The scourge of 
                        Holdenfield Township.

           INT. MATH CLASS - DAY

           A stuffy old MATH TEACHER drones on in front of a BLACKBOARD 
           covered in algebra problems.

           Sitting at the very back of the class, Emily scrawls 
           furiously in her DIARY.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER (V.O.)
                        Of all the residents of this town, 
                        none is more repugnant, more 
                        abhorrent, more vile, loathsome, 
                        and foul than she.

           A SPITBALL hits Emily’s neck.

           She frantically looks for the culprit.

           A group of BOYS on the other side of the room stifle their 
           laughter.

           INT. GYMNASIUM - DAY

           Wearing GYM CLOTHES, Emily hovers around the wall of the gym.

           She’s avoiding the DODGEBALLS torpedoing through the air. 
                                 EMILY DERRINGER (V.O.)
                        A narcissist since diapers, being 
                        the first in our class to grow tits 
                        only exasperated the problem. 

           She watches Pepper - at the other side of the room - flirting 
           with two OLDER BOYS.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER (V.O.)
                        Now she thinks she’s Jayne 
                        Mansfield and the rest of the 
                        student body is all too willing to 
                        play along.

           Emily takes a dodgeball to the face.

           INT. CAFETERIA - DAY

           LUNCH TRAY in hand, Emily navigates the unruly cafeteria.

           She passes table after table of happy students.

           No seats.

           She spots Pepper holding sway over several tables - all the 
           boys and girls enraptured by her every utterance.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER (V.O.)
                        She will be my masterpiece. The 
                        Grand Guignol crescendo to my 
                        oeuvre.

           She takes a seat at an EMPTY TABLE tucked away in the corner.

           INT. AMERICAN LITERATURE - DAY

           Pepper sits at the front of the class, brushing her hair to a 
           captivated audience.

           Emily walks in the door.

           Pepper sneers at her before turning away.

           Emily takes a seat at the very back.

           She scribbles in her diary.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER (V.O.)
                        Her death will be brutal. It will 
                        be public. It will be my proudest 
                        moment. A demise worthy of her -
           The door opens.

           Emily stops writing - looks up.

           Her jaw drops.

           MR. GOODWIN (30s) is skinny, bookish, and bespectacled.

           He’s the most perfect specimen Emily has ever laid eyes on.

           Time slows down as he walks to the head of the classroom and 
           smiles at his students.

                                 MR. GOODWIN
                        Good afternoon and welcome to your 
                        final class of the day, American 
                        Literature.

           He turns to the chalkboard. 

                                 MR. GOODWIN (CONT’D)
                        My name is Mister...

           Emily mouths the word as he writes.

                      EMILY DERRINGER
                                                      MR. GOODWIN
                 (Whispering)
                                              Goodwin.
           Goodwin.

           And with that, Emily is on cloud nine.

           Goodwin’s still speaking, but all Emily hears is the music in 
           her head.

           It’s not until the WHOLE CLASS is staring at her that the 
           spell is broken.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        Huh?

           Everyone laughs.

           Goodwin smiles gently.

                                 MR. GOODWIN
                        I presume you are Miss Derringer?

           She goes red. Nods.

                                 MR. GOODWIN (CONT’D)
                        Excellent.

           He goes on. Emily sinks into her chair.
           Pepper looks back at her. Mouths the word “Freak.”

                                 MR. GOODWIN (CONT’D)
                        Pepper Devonshire?

           Pepper spins right around and beams.

                                 PEPPER DEVONSHIRE
                        Present!

                                 MR. GOODWIN
                        Thank you, Pepper.

           Emily scowls. She goes back to her diary.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER (V.O.)
                        She’s. Fucking. Dead.

                                                                     LATER

           Goodwin distributes a stack of BOOKS to the class.

                                 MR. GOODWIN
                        As this is a literature class, we 
                        will be reading. A lot.

           Groans. Goodwin takes it in stride.

                                 MR. GOODWIN (CONT’D)
                        I know I’m competing for your 
                        attention against the handsome 
                        likes of Dick Clarke and Nick 
                        Adams, so I want to start the year 
                        off with a writer I know will grab 
                        you.

           Emily gets her BOOK - its cover a portrait of a bizarre, 
           mustachioed man.

                                 MR. GOODWIN (CONT’D)
                        Edgar Allan Poe. Now -

                                 PEPPER DEVONSHIRE
                        Excuse me.

           Emily shoots daggers at the back of Pepper’s head.

           Goodwin stops. He raises an eyebrow at Pepper.

                                 MR. GOODWIN
                        ...Yes?
                                 PEPPER DEVONSHIRE
                        I’m looking at some of these titles 
                        - “Murders in the Rue Morgue,” 
                        “Masque of the Red Death” - are 
                        these scary stories?

                                 MR. GOODWIN
                        The scariest.

                                 PEPPER DEVONSHIRE
                        Well, um, did you know there’s a 
                        killer on the loose?

                                 MR. GOODWIN
                        I’ve heard mention of that, yes.

                                 PEPPER DEVONSHIRE
                        Don’t you think this is a little 
                        inappropriate then?

                                 MR. GOODWIN
                        On the contrary. I believe reading 
                        a master of the macabre like Poe is 
                        incredibly appropriate for the 
                        times we find ourselves in.

           He addresses the rest of the class.

                                 MR. GOODWIN (CONT’D)
                        We mustn’t turn away like shrinking 
                        violets when confronted with evil, 
                        but stare back into the darkness, 
                        face it head on. To try and 
                        comprehend the incomprehensible, to 
                        make sense of the senseless.

           Back to Pepper, who stares sulking with her arms crossed.

                                 MR. GOODWIN (CONT’D)
                        And do please raise your hand next 
                        time.

           He looks back to Emily, who is hanging onto his every word.

           He smiles.

           Her heart stops.

           INT. ICE CREAM PARLOUR - EVENING

           A BOOTH is filled to capacity with a group of KIDS seemingly 
           having the time of their lives. 
           The parlour echoes with their laughter.

           Emily - sitting at the COUNTER and sipping from a CHOCOLATE 
           MALT -  watches them behind her from a MIRROR on the wall, 
           her eyes just peering above the pages of her BOOK.

           NANCY PACKER (50s) - SODA JERK and owner of the place - 
           sidles over to her while drying a glass.

                                 NANCY PACKER
                        What are you reading?

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        “The Pit and the Pendulum.” It’s 
                        really good. I’m getting a lot of 
                        fantastic ideas.

                                 NANCY PACKER
                        That for school?

           Emily can’t help but smile.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        Mr. Goodwin’s class.

                                 NANCY PACKER
                        I know that look. Goodwin, huh? 
                        Yeah, he’s a cutie. Though a little 
                        too skinny for my tastes.

           Emily scowls. Buries her face back in the book.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        He’s perfect.

           Nancy smiles, until her attention turns elsewhere.

                                 NANCY PACKER
                        Ugh, this guy. Been here for hours, 
                        hasn’t ordered anything but coffee.

           She picks up the COFFEE POT.

           Emily watches as she approaches a BOOTH in the back corner 
           where -

           GARRET BLUESTONE sits, staring down at the table.

           Emily frowns. He seems different now. Agitated. Worried.

           He doesn’t even glance up as Nancy refills his MUG.

           Instead, he appears to mumble to himself.
           Concentrating on his hands underneath the table.

           Emily leans over, attempts to see what he’s doing when -

           The BELL above the door rings.

           Followed by PEPPER’s awful cackle.

           She and her lackeys spill inside.

           Emily immediately goes back to her book, attempts to be 
           conspicuous.

           It doesn’t work.

                                 PEPPER DEVONSHIRE
                        Oh look, The Pig’s here.

           They all laugh.

           Nancy returns to the counter as a chorus of pig noises echo 
           throughout the shop.

           Emily glumly finishes her malt, pretending she doesn’t care.

           Nancy notices.

                                 NANCY PACKER
                        Can I get you another, hun?

           Emily packs up her things.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        I should go.

           She starts counting her MONEY.

                                 NANCY PACKER
                        Nah, this one’s on the house.

           Emily eyes her suspiciously.

           Nancy shrugs, smiles.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        ...Okay.

           She hops off her stool, heads to the door.

           Then remembers.

           Stops, looks over at Garret still sitting at the booth.

           She bends down, pretends to adjust her sock.
           Looks over at Garret.

           Underneath the table, he grinds a POCKET KNIFE into his hand.

                                                                     LATER

           It’s dark.

           The shop is empty except for Nancy -

           And Garret.

           He stares at his reflection on the stale coffee’s surface.

           Nancy turns off the lights.

                                 NANCY PACKER
                        Closing time, buddy. Hit the road.

           He snaps out of his daze.

                                 GARRET BLUESTONE
                        Oh, yes - sorry.

           He grabs a NAPKIN, sticks it to his bloody palm.

           Nancy shakes her head as he shuffles past her out the door.

           She immediately locks it behind him. 

           Breathes a sigh of relief.

           EXT. MAIN STREET

           The brisk air kicks up as Garret exits the shop.

           He stares at the ground as he walks.

           His breathing gets heavier. He grits his teeth.

           He balls up his fist and smashes it repeatedly against his 
           forehead.

                                 GARRET BLUESTONE
                        No! No! No! No!

           INT. ICE CREAM PARLOUR

           Nancy wipes down the counter when she hears -

           A KNOCK.
           She looks up to see Garret silhouetted behind the glass door.

           She lets out an aggravated sigh before walking over.

           She doesn’t open it.

                                 NANCY PACKER
                        What do you want?

           His body trembles and his voice shakes.

                                 GARRET BLUESTONE
                        I left my jacket on the seat.

           She looks over to his booth.

           No jacket.

                                 NANCY PACKER
                        It’s not there. Night.

           She turns away.

                                 GARRET BLUESTONE
                        Please! I’m sure of it. Look again. 
                        It’s so cold and I have a very long 
                        walk ahead of me.

           Nancy stares into his pleading eyes.

           She shakes her head, but walks back to the booth anyway.

           Upon closer inspection - it’s there. Bundled up on the seat.

           She grabs it, stomps back to the door.

           Unlocks it.

                                 NANCY PACKER
                        Here. Now please don’t darken my 
                        door --

           He kicks the door open.

           It slams into her face. She hits the ground hard.

           Blood gushes from her nose as she looks up in total shock at -

           Garret standing above her.

           His eyes are wild, his teeth are clenched.

           Tears stream down his face, he claws at his hair.
                                 GARRET BLUESTONE
                        I don’t want to, I don’t want to, I 
                        don’t want to...

           But he gets closer.

           And closer.

           And closer.

           INT. CAFETERIA - DAY

           SPLAT.

           BOLOGNA hits the lunch table as Emily removes it from her 
           SANDWICH.

           She examines her disappointing meal of mayo and bread before 
           taking a bite.

           A JOCK approaches her table, grabs a CHAIR.

                                 JOCK
                        Is anybody using this?

           Her mouth full, he doesn’t wait for an answer before taking 
           it.

           Then, one-by-one, VARIOUS STUDENTS carry off all the 
           remaining chairs and bring them to their own crowded tables.

           Emily stares dead-eyed debating how insulted to feel.

           Takes another bite.

           As she chews, she doesn’t notice the CHEERLEADER rush into 
           the cafeteria and deliver news to her table of friends.

           Gradually, the volume of the room rises until Emily is forced 
           to acknowledge the roar of students anxiously spreading 
           information to one another.

           A wave of children form a mass exodus out of the cafeteria as 
           the ADULTS try in vain to corral them.

           A BOY rushes past Emily’s table.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        Hey!

           He stops.
                                 EMILY DERRINGER (CONT’D)
                        What’s going on?

                                 BOY
                        The Misfit killed the ice cream 
                        lady!

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        What? But that’s impo--

           But he’s already gone.

           Emily attempts to wrap her mind around this.

           She can’t. She gets up from her table and joins the crowd.

           EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY

           Mortified ONLOOKERS surround the ICE CREAM PARLOUR.

           Emily manages to squeeze her way to the front.

           She sees Nancy’s CORPSE draped in a WHITE SHEET being wheeled 
           away.

           The windows of the shop are sprayed red. 

           The crowd is buzzing. Everyone speaks in hushed tones about 
           The Misfit.

           Emily looks around in disbelief - could they really believe 
           this is her work?

           Then she sees him.

           Garret. Slowly driving past the crowd in his MILK TRUCK.

           His face is as white as his vehicle.

                                 CONCERNED CITIZEN (PRE-LAP)
                        We have got to do something!

           INT. TOWN HALL - EVENING

           A MAN stands up amongst a crowd of CITIZENS.

           The Town Hall is packed to the brim. It appears the whole 
           town has turned up.
                                 CONCERNED CITIZEN
                        Two murders in as many days? He’s 
                        never done that before! How long 
                        before he kills us all?

           His outburst is met with angered agreement from the horde.

           THE MAYOR tries in vain to quell the uproar, while an 
           embarrassed POLICE FORCE stands awkwardly behind him. 

                                 THE MAYOR
                        Ladies and Gentlemen, I assure you 
                        our boys are working day and night 
                        to catch this killer and bring him 
                        to justice.

           An ANGRY WOMAN bolts up.

                                 ANGRY WOMAN
                        Things are getting worse! Nancy 
                        Packer’s death was The Misfit’s 
                        most brutal yet!

           Emily sits arms crossed between Judy and David.

           This is torture.

                                 THE MAYOR
                        I understand your concern, and we 
                        have been taking measures. We will 
                        be instituting a curfew --

           A PANICKED MAN stands.

                                 PANICKED MAN
                        I heard he had his way with her. 
                        You know - biblically.

                                 SCARED WOMAN
                        I heard he drank her blood!

           Emily can’t take any more.

           She jumps up in her seat.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        Excuse me!

           The crowd goes silent.

           David and Judy stare at her in shock.

                                 THE MAYOR
                        ...Yes?
                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        Does anyone think Nancy Packer was 
                        not killed by The Misfit?

           Crickets.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER (CONT’D)
                        I mean, when The Misfit kills 
                        someone, it’s done with finesse. 
                        With a sense of showmanship. 
                        Packer? That was amateur hour.

                                 LUCINDA GRANT (O.S.)
                        Little girl?

           Emily turns to see LUCINDA GRANT (38). She’d be a trophy wife 
           if she wasn’t already a widow.

                                 LUCINDA GRANT (CONT’D)
                        Are you really suggesting there are 
                        two murderers in this town?

           She chortles. The rest of the crowd joins her.

           Emily glowers at the bitch until a mortified Judy pulls her 
           back down to her seat.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER (V.O.)
                        Dear Diary - the Widow Lucinda 
                        Grant is now at the top of my list.

           Lucinda addresses the crowd.

                                 LUCINDA GRANT
                        As all of you know, my late husband 
                        was Mayor, so I think my opinion on 
                        the matter is of some 
                        significance...

           She keeps speaking, but Emily’s too furious to listen.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER (V.O.)
                        That heart disease got to her man 
                        before I ever could is still one of 
                        my bigger regrets. 

           Next to Lucinda is her son, HAROLD (20), his mouth covered in 
           chocolate.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        Now it’s just her and that imbecile 
                        son.
           Enthusiastic, Harold tries to stand, but Lucinda - not 
           missing a beat - shoves him back down with a palm to the 
           face.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER (V.O.)
                        She’ll be a most prized addition.

           She starts paying attention again as Lucinda wraps it up.

                                 LUCINDA GRANT
                        ...with the can-do spirit that won 
                        the war in Europe!

           Whatever she said, it got the crowd going. She’s met with 
           thunderous applause.

           Emily stews. 

           EXT. TOWN SQUARE

           The meeting lets out.

           Flanked by her parents, Emily sulks all the way down the Town 
           Hall Steps.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER (V.O.)
                        In the mean time, I have business 
                        to attend to.

                                 JUDY DERRINGER
                        Oh, Mr. Bluestone!

           Emily snaps out of her trance to see her mother waving down -

           Garret Bluestone, walking amongst the crowd.

           The split-second look on his face betrays how little he wants 
           to be spoken to, but he swiftly hides it behind a goofy 
           smile.

                                 GARRET BLUESTONE
                        Why hello there!

           Judy pulls Emily and David over to Garret.

                                 JUDY DERRINGER
                        Honey, this is Mr. Bluestone - our 
                        new Milk Man.

                                 DAVID DERRINGER
                        Ah yes, the one who spilled all 
                        over my porch the other day.
                                 GARRET BLUESTONE
                        Oh, I’m so sorry about -

                                 DAVID DERRINGER
                        Nonsense. Put her there.

           He puts out his hand.

           Garret looks at it, then warily offers his own.

           David grabs it, shakes it forcefully.

           Garret winces in pain.

           Pulls his hand back.

           Emily eyes the BANDAGE stuck to his palm.

                                 JUDY DERRINGER
                        Garret, what happened?

                                 GARRET BLUESTONE
                        Just me being silly. Cut it on a 
                        broken bottle. You’ve seen how 
                        clumsy I am.

                                 DAVID DERRINGER
                        That so? Well then tell me - how 
                        are you covered on accident 
                        insurance?

           As David throws his arm around Garret and proceeds to pitch 
           him on insurance, Emily hangs back.

           She keeps her eyes firmly on Garret.

           He looks back at her.

           The gears in her head turn.

           EXT. OUTSKIRTS OF TOWN - NIGHT

           A dirt trail leads up to a lonely, decrepit HOUSE and TOOL 
           SHED atop a hill.

           INT. GARRET’S HOUSE, KITCHEN

           The kitchen is filthy, covered in dust and spiderwebs.

           Garret - wearing only his briefs - turns on the sink FAUCET.
           The pipes groan before spitting a thick, brown liquid that 
           eventually turns to water.

           He fills a TEA KETTLE.

           He then turns to the STOVE, turns on the GAS.

           With a long MATCH, he lights the FLAME, places the pot on 
           top.

           Then - a KNOCK at the FRONT DOOR.

           He jumps. Stares at the door. Waits.

           Nothing.

           Warily, he approaches the door.

           Hesitates. Opens it.

           Met with nothing but a cold gust of wind.

           Darkness there, and nothing more.

           A sigh of relief. He’s about to close the door, when -

           He notices a NOTE pinned to it.

           He rips it off. Reads.

           The blood drains from his face.

           EXT. THE WOODS - DAY

           Mud sucks to Garret’s shoes as he trudges through the thick 
           WOODS.

           Despite the cool air, he’s sweating. Jumps at any sound.

           Finally, he comes across the rotting remains of a TREE HOUSE.

           He removes the crumpled note from his pocket, double checks 
           it.

           He’s in the right spot.

                                 GARRET BLUESTONE
                        Hello?

           Only the wind through the trees. Then -

                                 EMILY DERRINGER (O.S.)
                        Naughty boy, Garret.
           He jumps.

                                 GARRET BLUESTONE
                        Who said that?

                                 EMILY DERRINGER (O.S.)
                        You’ve been up to no good.

           Emily peers out from the tree house.

           Garret’s eyes go wide, but he hides behind a smile.

                                 GARRET BLUESTONE
                        Little girl --

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        Emily.

                                 GARRET BLUESTONE
                        Emily - I don’t know what you’re 
                        talking about.

           She jumps, hitting the ground with a splat.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        It was you.

           She creeps towards him slowly, menacingly.

           He gulps.

                                 GARRET BLUESTONE
                        Again, I’m afraid I --

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        You were at the shop the night 
                        Nancy Packer was murdered.

           Closer.

                                 GARRET BLUESTONE
                        I was. I enjoy a coffee after work. 
                        That doesn’t mean I...what exactly 
                        are you implying?

           Closer.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        According to the paper, her tongue 
                        was ripped out of her head.

           Closer.
                                 GARRET BLUESTONE
                        If you’re saying I was the one 
                        who...I can assure you --

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        The same tongue you have buried in 
                        your shed.

           He goes pale, much to her delight.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER (CONT’D)
                        If you’re going to take trophies, 
                        invest in a better lock.

           Reveling in sadistic glee, she turns and moseys away, leaving 
           him shaking in his boots. 

                                 EMILY DERRINGER (CONT’D)
                        I recognized something off about 
                        you, Bluestone. Then again, I 
                        thought you were just some run-of-
                        the-mill pervert - going to nudie-
                        cuties with holes in your pockets, 
                        that sort of thing.
                             (beat)
                        But murder? That --

           She spins to face him.

           Freezes.

           The barrel of a HANDGUN is aimed right at her face.

           Was not expecting that.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing?

           The gun shakes in Garret’s hand, tears run down his cheeks.

                                 GARRET BLUESTONE
                        I’m so sorry.

           He cocks the hammer.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        Whoa! No, no, wait a second!

           She backs away, but Garret follows.

           He’s losing it, can barely contain his sobs.

                                 GARRET BLUESTONE
                        I am so, so sorry.
                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        Garret, put the gun down. You don’t 
                        need to do this. You don’t want to 
                        hurt me.

                                 GARRET BLUESTONE
                        I don’t want to hurt anybody!

           He’s having a full-blown meltdown, but the gun stays fixed on 
           Emily.

                                 GARRET BLUESTONE (CONT’D)
                        For God’s sake, do you think I want 
                        to be like this? I can’t help it! 
                        Maggots eat at my brain and my eyes 
                        go hot and suddenly I’m home and 
                        I’ve got that poor lady’s tongue in 
                        my pocket! 
                             (wipes his tears)
                        And I was doing so good!

           He regains some composure - steadies his aim.

                                 GARRET BLUESTONE (CONT’D)
                        And I’m not The Misfit! Not like 
                        everyone says. I swear I didn’t 
                        kill those other people! How could 
                        I? I only just got here!

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        Garret - listen to me.

                                 GARRET BLUESTONE
                        But I can’t start over. No, not 
                        again, not again.

           He aims between her eyes.

                                 GARRET BLUESTONE (CONT’D)
                        Forgive me.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        Garret! Calm down for one fucking 
                        minute and listen to me. I’m not 
                        going to tell anyone.

           He trembles, doesn’t believe her.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER (CONT’D)
                        And you’re not The Misfit. That I 
                        know for sure.

           The look in her eye says it all.
           It finally registers. He lowers the gun.

                                 GARRET BLUESTONE
                        ...You?

           She nods.

                                 GARRET BLUESTONE (CONT’D)
                        But...

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        So believe me when I tell you your 
                        secret is safe. 

                                 GARRET BLUESTONE
                        I don’t understand, why bring me 
                        out here?

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        Because you and I need to have a 
                        conversation. 
                             (beat)
                        I have a reputation in this town. A 
                        reputation that was - until very 
                        recently - immaculate. I was proud 
                        of that reputation, Garret, and you 
                        stained it.

           She steps forward - even at half his size, she’s 
           intimidating.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER (CONT’D)
                        So I’m only going to say this once: 
                        Leave.

           They stare into each other’s eyes. Then -

                                 GARRET BLUESTONE
                        I can’t do that.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        Garret.

                                 GARRET BLUESTONE
                        I can’t. Do you realize how many 
                        times I’ve uprooted myself over the 
                        years? How many times I’ve started 
                        over?

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        Not my concern.
                                 GARRET BLUESTONE
                        I have a job here. A home. It’s 
                        when I don’t, when I’ve got nowhere 
                        to go, nowhere to be, no 
                        distractions...that’s when things 
                        get bad.

           He wipes his remaining tears.

                                 GARRET BLUESTONE (CONT’D)
                        This was a relapse, that’s all. 
                        Growing pains. I promise it won’t 
                        happen again.

           Emily searches for reassurance in his eyes.

                                 GARRET BLUESTONE (CONT’D)
                        I’m begging you.

           She looks at the gun in his hand.

           Only she seems to be aware of the uneven power dynamic.

           Takes what she can get.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        I have your word?

                                 GARRET BLUESTONE
                        Cross my heart and hope to die.

           She stares him down. Is she really going to do this?

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        Fine. It does not happen again.

           She turns. Walks away.

           Garret stands there, still in shock. He watches as she’s 
           about to disappear into the woods, when -

                                 GARRET BLUESTONE
                        Why didn’t you kill me?

           She stops in her tracks.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        What?

                                 GARRET BLUESTONE
                        If you are who you say you are - if 
                        you are really The Misfit - why go 
                        through all this trouble? Why not 
                        just kill me?
           The question catches her off guard. Yeah, why didn’t she?

           She has to think a moment.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        I’ve never met anyone with the 
                        same...proclivities. I guess I was 
                        curious.

           And with that, she takes her leave.

           But the question still lingers in her mind.

                                 PEPPER DEVONSHIRE (PRE-LAP)
                        It’s about guilt, obviously

           INT. AMERICAN LITERATURE - DAY

           Mr. Goodwin leans against his desk, looking at a Pepper.

                                 MR. GOODWIN
                        Okay. Go on.

                                 PEPPER DEVONSHIRE
                        That’s it. Guilt. That’s why he 
                        hears the heart beat. He feels bad 
                        about killing the old man.

           Emily - in back - rolls her eyes.

           Goodwin nods, unsatisfied with the answer. 

           He scans the rest of the class. He lands on -

                                 MR. GOODWIN
                        Emily.

           Her heart skips a beat.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        Yes?

                                 MR. GOODWIN
                        Pepper believes “The Tell-Tale 
                        Heart” is about guilt. Would you 
                        agree?

           Reveling in the chance to disagree.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        No. I would not.

           He grins.
                                 MR. GOODWIN
                        You have the floor.

           She opens her book.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        I mean, the narrator doesn’t sound 
                        particularly guilt-ridden. She just 
                        wants us to believe she’s not 
                        crazy.

                                 MR. GOODWIN
                        She?

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        What?

                                 MR. GOODWIN
                        You said “she” wants us to believe 
                        “she’s” not crazy.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        Did I? Oh, um --

           Fuck.

                                 MR. GOODWIN
                        That’s interesting. I never thought 
                        of it that way, but yes - the 
                        narrator could be a woman. No 
                        gender is ever specified. Very 
                        interesting, Emily. Please 
                        continue.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        ...Okay.

           Close call.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER (CONT’D)
                        Anyway, it says right here: “Object 
                        there was none. Passion there was 
                        none.” She - or he - admits there 
                        was no reason to kill the old man. 
                        It was a completely irrational act. 
                        Is it then any surprise that the 
                        narrator would hallucinate a heart 
                        beat?

                                 MR. GOODWIN
                        So it’s not about morality, it’s 
                        about insanity?
                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        Yes, that’s the downfall. Now, in 
                        “The Cask of Amontillado” -

                                 MR. GOODWIN
                        Reading ahead, I see.

           She blushes, but continues.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        Montresor gets away with it because 
                        he acts rationally. Fortunato - 
                        unlike the Old Man - deserved to be 
                        punished.

                                 MR. GOODWIN
                        Well, only if you believe Montresor 
                        is a reliable narrator. He claims 
                        to have suffered “a thousand 
                        injuries” at Fortunato’s hand, but 
                        we don’t know that. You’re taking 
                        the word of a man who thinks 
                        nothing of imprisoning his friend 
                        behind a wall.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        Yes, but --

                                 MR. GOODWIN
                        To me, that he acts with such 
                        conviction - that he never once 
                        questions his sanity - well, to me 
                        that makes him the craziest of all.

           Emily tries to formulate a response, but is interrupted by -

           The BELL.

           The whole class gathers their things and heads to the door.

                                 MR. GOODWIN (CONT’D)
                        Ah the bell, “What a world of 
                        merriment its melody foretells.” 
                        “Amontillado.”  I want you all to 
                        read it tonight so you too can be 
                        party to this discussion.
                             (beat)
                        Emily?

           Emily stops packing.

                                 MR. GOODWIN (CONT’D)
                        Could you stay for a minute?
           She nods and waits for everyone to leave the room.

           When it’s just the two of them, she approaches his desk.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        Yes, Mr. Goodwin?

                                 MR. GOODWIN
                        I have a feeling, Emily, that 
                        there’s more to you than meets the 
                        eye. I think you have a secret.

           Uh oh. She gulps.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        You do?

                                 MR. GOODWIN
                        Yep. A deep, dark secret that you 
                        don’t think anyone could possibly 
                        know...but I do.

           Her mouth is arid, she can’t speak. 

                                 MR. GOODWIN (CONT’D)
                        I think you...are a secret party 
                        animal.

           Her relief quickly turns to confusion.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        Huh?

           He laughs.

                                 MR. GOODWIN
                        I’ll explain. With all 
                        the...unpleasantness that’s been 
                        going on, the Mayor has made the 
                        not entirely unreasonable decision 
                        to cancel trick-or-treating this 
                        Halloween.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        Okay.

                                 MR. GOODWIN
                        So, instead, the school board wants 
                        to host a party in the gymnasium - 
                        a sort of “safe alternative,” you 
                        understand? And I’m the schmuck 
                        they chose to organize the damn 
                        thing.
                             (beat)
                                 (MORE)
                                 MR. GOODWIN (CONT'D)
                        Fortunately, they said I could 
                        enlist some students to help. 
                        That’s where you come in.

           She’s still a little flabbergasted.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        Thank you, but I really don’t know 
                        anything about parties. 

                                 MR. GOODWIN
                        Neither do I. That’s what I told 
                        them, but they insisted so now I’m 
                        trying to rope in a fellow weirdo. 
                        What do you say?

           His smile melts her like butter. Her cheeks go red and she 
           can’t help but smile back.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        Halloween is my favorite holiday.
                             (beat)
                        I’ll do it.

                                 MR. GOODWIN
                        Excellent. We’ll start meeting 
                        after school every Friday in the 
                        gym. Start thinking of ideas, all 
                        right?

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        All right.

           She practically floats out of the room.

           INT. GYMNASIUM - DAY

           Emily sits on the BLEACHERS, her DIARY open on her lap. It’s 
           pages are filled with party ideas.

           She taps her foot impatiently, until -

           The door to the gym opens.

           Goodwin walks in wheeling a portable CHALK BOARD.

           She beams. But her smile evaporates when she sees who is with 
           him.

           Pepper. Fucking. Devonshire.

           Goodwin looks up at Emily, waves.
           Emily waves back, but is barely able to shroud her fury.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        I didn’t know Pepper was going to 
                        be here.

                                 PEPPER DEVONSHIRE
                        Why wouldn’t I be here?

                                 MR. GOODWIN
                        Pepper very graciously offered her 
                        services when she heard about our 
                        undertaking. And because she has 
                        the most school spirit of anyone I 
                        know --

                                 PEPPER DEVONSHIRE
                        I actually get invited to parties. 
                        Why are you here?

           Either Goodwin is oblivious to their mutual contempt, or he’s 
           ignoring it.

           He picks up a piece of CHALK and goes to the board.

                                 MR. GOODWIN
                        So, ideas - what have we got?

           Pepper confidently unveils her notebook, but Emily beats her 
           to it.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        I have a few.

                                 MR. GOODWIN
                        Excellent, Emily - let’s hear them.

           Emily shoots Pepper a victorious grin, then opens her diary.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        I think it would be fun to turn the 
                        whole gymnasium into a graveyard 
                        scene. All the tombs could have the 
                        names of different students and 
                        faculty, and -

                                 PEPPER DEVONSHIRE
                        Ew! What is wrong with you? Why 
                        would we ever do something like 
                        that?

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        Because it’s Halloween?
                                 MR. GOODWIN
                        Unfortunately Emily, I’m afraid 
                        Pepper’s right. What with The 
                        Misfit and all, the higher ups have 
                        made it clear they want a wholesome 
                        affair. Less “Day of the Dead,” 
                        more “Fall Harvest,” you 
                        understand?

                                 PEPPER DEVONSHIRE
                        Yeah, creep.

           That does it.

           Emily grips her pencil tight -

           And STABS it into Pepper’s JUGULAR.

           BLOOD soaks Goodwin as she plunges it over and over into 
           Pepper’s soft flesh.

           Except...No she doesn’t.

                                                               END FANTASY

           No, Emily simply sits on the bleachers, imagining Pepper’s 
           doom.

           But then...a change.

           A small, genuine smiles creeps up on Emily, and she sends it 
           Pepper’s way.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        You’re absolutely right. We need to 
                        be sensitive. Of course.

           She rips out the pages of ideas.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER (CONT’D)
                        How about bobbing for apples?

                                 MR. GOODWIN
                        Perfect.

           As Goodwin writes “Bobbing for Apples” on the board, Emily 
           opens to a fresh page.

           At the very top, she writes:

                                “PEPPER DIES ON HALLOWEEN”
           EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY

           Emily rides her bike down sunny Main Street.

           Dead LEAVES dance in the wind.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER (V.O.)
                        Diary - there’s nothing quite like 
                        the feeling of inspiration.

           INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY

           Pepper puts her books in her locker.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER (V.O.)
                        Of course. Halloween.

           She closes the door -

           To find Emily staring at her. Smiling.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER (V.O.)
                        The perfect setting for my 
                        masterwork.

           INT. GYMNASIUM - DAY

           Goodwin and Pepper cut construction paper leaves.

           Above their heads, Emily watches from the RAFTERS.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER (O.S.)
                        For the first time, my public will 
                        be treated to a live performance.

           EXT. DERRINGER’S FRONT YARD - MORNING

           As Emily wheels her bike down the driveway -

           A NEWSPAPER lands at her feet.

                        “TOWN TERRIFIED AS MISFIT STILL AT LARGE”

                                 EMILY DERRINGER (V.O.)
                        My only concern now is living up to 
                        the impossibly high expectations 
                        I’ve created for myself.
           INT. HARDWARE STORE - DAY

           Emily peruses the GARDENING TOOLS section with a spool of 
           ROPE slung over her shoulder.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER (V.O.)
                        But that’s why we have preparation.

           She stops when she sees a SCYTHE hanging on the wall.

           She reaches for it, but it’s just out of grasp.

           Tippy-toes. No dice.

                                 HAROLD GRANT (O.S.)
                        Help?

           Emily turns to see Harold Grant standing there with a big, 
           goofy smile on his face.

           He’s licking a LOLLIPOP the size of his head.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        Um. Sure. 

           Rather than grab the scythe himself, Harold picks Emily up 
           off the ground.

           She gets the scythe, he puts her back down.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER (CONT’D)
                        Thank you.

           He thrusts the lollipop at her.

                                 HAROLD GRANT
                        Lolly?

           It glistens with saliva.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        Rain check.

           They stand there a while. Then -

                                 HAROLD GRANT
                        Okay. Bye.

           And with that, Harold continues on his way leaving Emily 
           alone in the aisle.

           She runs her finger against the blade, unsure of what to make 
           of this interaction.
           INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

           Emily walks into the kitchen lugging a heavy DUFFLE BAG.

           As per usual, David is hidden behind the PAPER, Judy is 
           slaving over the stove.

           Emily removes the lone piece of toast off her plate of 
           sausage, then heads back out.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        Bye.

           David grunts.

                                 JUDY DERRINGER
                        By dear, be home by four.

           Emily stops.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        What? Why?

                                 JUDY DERRINGER
                        The party.

           Not registering.

                                 JUDY DERRINGER (CONT’D)
                        Emily, I’ve been telling you this 
                        for weeks. We’re having a party 
                        tonight for all your father’s 
                        clients.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        Why do I need to be there?

                                 DAVID DERRINGER
                        Because people want to buy 
                        insurance from a family man.

                                 JUDY DERRINGER
                        We want to make a good impression.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        But I’ve got Halloween Planning 
                        after school. Can’t I be your prop 
                        when that’s over?

                                 JUDY DERRINGER
                        I need you to help get things 
                        ready. Your teacher will 
                        understand.
                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        But--

                                 DAVID DERRINGER
                        No “buts” young lady.

           Emily fumes. She stamps her feet.

           No reaction from her parents.

           In a huff, she drags her duffle bag of deadly weapons out the 
           door.

           INT. GYMNASIUM - DAY

           Emily sits in the bleachers stuffing STRAW into a STOCKING 
           and molding into the shape of a SCARECROW’S HEAD.

           Meanwhile, Goodwin is crucifying a straw-filled flannel COAT 
           and Pepper decorates a hat.

           Emily looks up at the CLOCK on the wall. It’s almost 4.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        Mr. Goodwin?

                                 MR. GOODWIN
                        Emily - it’s been almost two months 
                        now. You can call me Tom.
                             (beat)
                        Outside of class.

           She blushes.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        Tom - I have to leave early today.

                                 MR. GOODWIN
                        Shucks - I was planning on taking 
                        you girls out for burgers after 
                        this.

           No.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        Oh, well, I mean --

                                 MR. GOODWIN
                        Looks like it’s you and me, Pepper.

                                 PEPPER DEVONSHIRE
                        Splendid, Tom.
           Emily’s heart is breaking.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        I think, though, that--

                                 MR. GOODWIN
                        Dratz. 

           Goodwin motions to his scarecrow.

                                 MR. GOODWIN (CONT’D)
                        I left the pants in my car. I’ll be 
                        right back.

           He leaves. And then there were two.

           They work in silence, but the tension is palpable. 

                                 PEPPER DEVONSHIRE
                        Why would you get burgers, anyway? 
                        I thought you didn’t eat meat.

           Emily stops what she’s doing.

           Okay, so they’re doing this.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        I suppose I have you to thank for 
                        that.

                                 PEPPER DEVONSHIRE
                        It was a pig roast. What did you 
                        expect?

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        I don’t know - I was nine. I had no 
                        idea where ham came from, but I did 
                        not expect to see some poor piglet 
                        stuck through with a spit. It was 
                        horrifying.

                                 PEPPER DEVONSHIRE
                        You didn’t have to freak out about 
                        it. You ruined my birthday party.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        You laughed at me. You were my 
                        friend.

                                 PEPPER DEVONSHIRE
                        Yeah, your only friend. “The 
                        Gruesome Twosome”
                             (beat)
                                 (MORE)
                                 PEPPER DEVONSHIRE (CONT'D)
                        But I wasn’t you, Emily - I didn’t 
                        like everyone hating me all the 
                        time.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        I--

                                 PEPPER DEVONSHIRE
                        It was my birthday. The other kids 
                        were finally starting to treat me 
                        like one of them - like I wasn’t an 
                        outcast, and you know what? It was 
                        nice.
                             (beat)
                        But then you start screaming and 
                        crying because of a pig on a 
                        barbecue. What was I supposed to 
                        do? People laughed, and for the 
                        first time I didn’t want them 
                        laughing at me, too. So I chose a 
                        side.

           Emily stares at her, trying to formulate the words. Finally -

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        Well you really opened my eyes that 
                        day. Between you and the pig, I saw 
                        how ugly humanity can be. Thank you 
                        for that.

           Silence.

           They go back to work.

                                 PEPPER DEVONSHIRE
                        It’s not like I didn’t feel bad 
                        afterwards.

           Emily opens her mouth to say something -

           When Goodwin returns with the PANTS.

           Emily stands.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        I have to go.

           She passes Goodwin, who then looks to Pepper.

           She shrugs.
           INT. DERRINGER FAMILY ROOM - EVENING

           Drunk ADULTS cha-cha to the Martin Denny record playing on 
           the STEREO.

           Emily sits arms crossed in the corner of the room.

           She watches as her mother schmoozes with guests - a giant, 
           plastic smile plastered on her face.

           While listening to a BOORISH MAN speak way too closely, Judy 
           looks over to Emily.

           She snaps her fingers, waves Emily over.

           With a heavy sigh, Emily joins her mother.

                                 JUDY DERRINGER
                             (Whispering)
                        Would it kill you to socialize?

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        Kill me? No.

           Judy turns to the Man.

                                 JUDY DERRINGER
                        This is our Emily. Emily - Mr. 
                        Doddsworth.

                                 DODDSWORTH
                        What a little cutie she is.

           Emily winces at the alcohol on his breath.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        Pleasure.

                                 JUDY DERRINGER
                        Why don’t you get Mr. Doddsworth 
                        another drink?

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        Whiskey?

                                 DODDSWORTH
                        She’s got a good eye, this one.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        A better nose. Excuse me.

           Emily worms her way through the forest of bodies to the BAR.

           She picks up an empty GLASS. Spits in it.
           Pours a drink.

                                 LUCINDA GRANT (O.S.)
                        I know you.

           Emily looks over to see Lucinda Grant standing next to her 
           holding a giant glass of RED WINE.

           She takes a swig, downing half the glass. 

           As she goes to refill -

                                 LUCINDA GRANT (CONT’D)
                        You’re the little opinionated one, 
                        aren’t you?

           She takes another drink and leans down close.

                                 LUCINDA GRANT (CONT’D)
                        Want my advice?

           She jabs at Emily with the glass, the swishing wine 
           precariously close to spilling.

                                 LUCINDA GRANT (CONT’D)
                        You’ll never nab a husband if 
                        you’re always flapping your trap. 
                        Little girls should be seen and not 
                        heard. 

           She takes another self-satisfied sip.

           Emily looks up at her. Grins.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        Thank you Ms. Grant. I can assure 
                        you, you will neither see me nor 
                        hear me when I come for you.

                                 LUCINDA GRANT
                        What --

           The FRONT DOOR opens.

                                 DAVID DERRINGER (O.S.)
                        Look who I found.

           Mr. Derringer stands in the door frame with a paper BAG of 
           newly purchased LIQUOR under one arm.

           His other arm is thrown around the shoulder of -

           Garret Bluestone. He’s never looked this uncomfortable.
           Judy’s thrilled.

                                 JUDY DERRINGER (O.S.)
                        Garret!

           Emily spins.

           Seeing Garret - his sheepish face - she jumps backwards -

           Smashing into Lucinda.

           Red wine spills all over Emily.

           Everyone looks over.

                                 JUDY DERRINGER (CONT’D)
                        Emily!

           Lucinda surveys the damage - she barely has a drop on her. 
           But that’s enough.

                                 LUCINDA GRANT
                        Oh, you stupid brat.

           Soaked, Emily looks around in disbelief.

           She hightails it out of there.

           INT. DERRINGER’S KITCHEN

           Emily marches to the PANTRY, grabs SALT, goes to the SINK.

           She removes her dress, leaving only her SLIP.

           She holds the dress under the tap and soaks it in cold water.

           She angrily scrubs.

           She doesn’t realize Garret is standing at the kitchen door.

           He knocks on the wall. She turns, sees him, then turns back.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        Why are you here?

           He doesn’t move.

                                 GARRET BLUESTONE
                        Your father saw me at the liquor 
                        store. Said he was restocking for a 
                        party. Insisted I come.
                             (beat)
                        He was very aggressive.
           She keeps scrubbing, pretending he’s not there.

                                 GARRET BLUESTONE (CONT’D)
                        And, well - I thought we could 
                        talk.

           He approaches. Slowly.

                                 GARRET BLUESTONE (CONT’D)
                        I always use peroxide.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        Peroxide bleaches fabrics. A salt 
                        paste works fine.

                                 GARRET BLUESTONE
                        Yes, but --

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        I know how to deal with red stains.

           Garret backs off.

                                 GARRET BLUESTONE
                        I don’t want there to be any 
                        hostility between us, Emily. We 
                        should stick together.

           Scrubs harder.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        Oh, and why’s that?

           Scrubs harder.

                                 GARRET BLUESTONE
                        Because...

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        What? You want to be friends? Is 
                        that it? Listen - I don’t have 
                        friends and I don’t want friends - 
                        I don’t need a friend.

           Her scrubbing is futile.

           She throws her dress down.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER (CONT’D)
                        Shit!

           She stomps out of the kitchen.

           Garret picks the sopping dress up off the floor.
                                 LUCINDA GRANT (O.S.)
                        Garret, is it?

           Garret turns to see Lucinda leaning against the wall.

           She bats her eyelashes.

           He gulps.

           INT. EMILY’S BEDROOM - EVENING

           Emily slams her bedroom door closed.

           She goes to her bed, sits on her butterfly bedsheets.

           Lifts up the mattress, removes her DIARY.

           Starts scribbling.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER (V.O.)
                        Dear Diary - I think I’ve laid low 
                        long enough. Time to relieve a 
                        little stress. 

           INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Wearing a fresh outfit, Emily tiptoes out of her room.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER (V.O.)
                        After all, I wouldn’t want to be 
                        rusty on Halloween.

           She peers into her parent’s BEDROOM.

           Judy lays snoring on top of the bed, David is passed out on 
           the floor.

           EXT. THE GRANT HOUSE - NIGHT

           Emily rides her bike past a “GRANT” adorned MAILBOX. 

                                 EMILY DERRINGER (V.O.)
                        And I know just how to flex my 
                        muscles.

           She rides up the long driveway leading to Grant’s large 
           HOUSE.
           INT. THE GRANT HOUSE, FOYER

           The LOCK is picked.

           The HANDLE turns, the FRONT DOOR opens.

           Emily creeps inside, greeted by the sound of music playing 
           from another room.

           Following it, she tip toes down the -

                                                                   HALLWAY

           Past various paintings, sculptures, and ornamental vases into 
           the -

                                                               DINING ROOM

           Slinking past the long TABLE and velvet-lined CHAIRS.

           The music gets louder and louder and she approaches the  -

                                                                    LOUNGE

           Before her - the back of a large cushioned CHAIR.

           Only Lucinda’s HAND - gripping a MARTINI GLASS - can be seen.

           The RECORD PLAYER blares, obscuring the creak of the 
           floorboards that groan with Emily’s every step.

           An eager grin spreads over Emily’s face as she delicately 
           removes the BUTCHER KNIFE from her SATCHEL.

           As she raises the knife above her head -

           The music stops. The record’s over.

           She watches as the NEEDLE rises and returns to its post.

           Takes another step -

           Slips.

           Crashes to the floor. The whole room quakes.

           She looks down.

           A PUDDLE. It’s red.

           She looks over to Lucinda. 

           Her DEAD BODY slumps over to the floor.
           Her JAW has been torn from her face.

           Emily fights against the floor’s slick surface to scramble to 
           her feet.

                                 HAROLD GRANT (O.S.)
                        Mommy?

           Panic in Emily’s eyes as she looks to the doorway to see -

           Harold walking in, yawning and rubbing his eyes.

                                 HAROLD GRANT (CONT’D)
                        I heard a loud -

           He stops.

           Sees his mother.

           Sees Emily.

           Sees blood.

                                 HAROLD GRANT (CONT’D)
                        Gosh...

           He turns. Runs.

           With no time to think, instinct kicks in.

           Emily hurls the knife.

           The blade plunges into the back of his neck.

           He flies forward. Hits the ground hard.

           Emily stands tense and grimacing as poor Harold lays 
           twitching on the floor.

           This was not how things were supposed to happen.

           She cautiously approaches his convulsing body and takes hold 
           of the knife’s handle.

           She readies herself. Then -

           Wrenches the blade. Back. Forth. Jerks it out.

           The twitching abruptly ends.

           She takes in the whole gruesome scene.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        Shit.
           EXT. WINDING ROAD - NIGHT

           Soaked in Lucinda and Harold’s blood, Emily furiously pumps 
           the pedals of her bike.

           She races down the secluded road, lit only by moonlight.

           EXT. GARRET’S YARD - NIGHT

           Garret - stripped to his underwear - trembles as he pours 
           LIGHTER FLUID over an already raging FIRE of BLOODY CLOTHES.

           He doesn’t realize Emily is speeding down the dirt road 
           towards him until -

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        Bluestone!

           He drops the lighter fluid when he sees her. He backs away.

                                 GARRET BLUESTONE
                        I’m sorry!

           Emily flies off the bike, storms over to Garret wielding the 
           knife.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        You gave me your word, Garret! Your 
                        word! 

                                 GARRET BLUESTONE
                        It wasn’t my fault! I just wanted 
                        her to leave me alone. But she was 
                        drunk! She said I needed to drive 
                        her home! And the next thing I 
                        know...

           The tears start pouring.

           He stops trying to get away. He collapses to his knees.

                                 GARRET BLUESTONE (CONT’D)
                        I don’t want to be like this 
                        anymore!

           Emily remains unfazed.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        No. That’s not good enough, not 
                        this time. Lucinda was mine! 
                        Because of you, I had to kill her 
                        son. He...
           She tries to find the words.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER (CONT’D)
                        He...

           She’s racking her brain. Finally -

                                 EMILY DERRINGER (CONT’D)
                        He didn’t deserve that.

           Garret stops his sobbing. He lifts his head.

                                 GARRET BLUESTONE
                        What?
                             (beat)
                        Emily - none of them deserve it.

           Before she can respond -

                                 GARRET BLUESTONE (CONT’D)
                        Christ - is that what you think? 
                        That there’s something riotous in 
                        all of this? No. You and I? We’re 
                        monsters. If anyone deserves death, 
                        it’s us.

           And for just a second, something clicks in Emily’s brain.

           But she buries it fast.

           She points the knife at him.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        This isn’t over.

           She jabs at him one more time for emphasis, then storms off 
           to her bike.

           Garret watches as she rides off.

           He wipes his tears.

           INT. GYMNASIUM - DAY

           Emily sits on the bleachers with her DIARY open atop her lap.

           She’s written “DEAR DIARY” at the top of the page, but 
           nothing else. 

           The tip of the pen rests at the ready, but the words aren’t 
           coming.

           Her trance is broken when Goodwin and Pepper walk in. 
           Both carry stacks of BOXES.

           As they set them down -

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        What are those?

                                 MR. GOODWIN
                        Board games. Pepper and I thought 
                        we could set up a table in the 
                        back.

           Pepper picks one up.

                                 PEPPER DEVONSHIRE
                        Oh, this would be perfect.

           She flips it around.

           A OUIJA BOARD.

           Goodwin chuckles.

                                 MR. GOODWIN
                        A Ouija Board might be too “occult” 
                        for this town’s sensibilities.
                             (beat)
                        However...

           He takes it from her and examines it himself.

                                 MR. GOODWIN (CONT’D)
                        That doesn’t mean we can’t take it 
                        for a spin. Emily?  What do you 
                        say?

           Emily’s still miles away.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        Huh?  Oh, um...

                                 PEPPER DEVONSHIRE
                        She’s too scared.

                                 MR. GOODWIN
                        Come on, it’ll be a rowdy dow.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        Fine. Okay.

                                                                     LATER

           Emily and Pepper sit with the Ouija Board between them while 
           Goodwin improves the ambiance by shutting off the lights.
                                 MR. GOODWIN
                        Perfect.

           He sits down and joins them.

           He rests his hand on the PLANCHETTE. Pepper follows his lead. 
           Emily is hesitant, but gives in.

                                 MR. GOODWIN (CONT’D)
                        Well, what should we ask?

                                 PEPPER DEVONSHIRE
                        Ask if there’s anyone here with us. 
                        Like a spook or a spectre.

           Goodwin smiles, then closes his eyes. The girls follow suit.

                                 MR. GOODWIN
                        Spirits - are there any of you with 
                        us today?

           Nothing for a few pregnant moments, then -

           The planchette drifts towards “YES.”

                                 PEPPER DEVONSHIRE
                        I just got chills.

                                 MR. GOODWIN
                        Spirit - have you been deceased 
                        long?

           “No.”

                                 MR. GOODWIN (CONT’D)
                        So it was a recent death?

           “Yes.”

                                 MR. GOODWIN (CONT’D)
                        Did you die peacefully?

           “NO.”

                                 MR. GOODWIN (CONT’D)
                        Spirit - how did you leave this 
                        mortal coil?

           Emily watches with horror as the planchette spells out -

           “M-U-R-D-E-R”

                                 PEPPER DEVONSHIRE
                        Spooky.
           Goodwin’s having a blast, doesn’t notice Emily’s revulsion.

           He goes in for the kill.

                                 MR. GOODWIN
                        Spirit - is the killer with us in 
                        this room?

           As the planchette makes a deliberate line towards “YES” -

           Emily flips the board.

                                 PEPPER DEVONSHIRE
                        What the fuck?

                                 MR. GOODWIN
                        Pepper.

           Emily jumps to her feet and beelines it towards her things at 
           the bleachers.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        This is stupid. There’s no such 
                        thing as ghosts.

           Goodwin instantly regrets the last few minutes.

                                 MR. GOODWIN
                        No Emily, of course not. It’s just 
                        a stupid parlour trick. I’m sorry.

                                 PEPPER DEVONSHIRE
                        Yeah, stop being such a baby.

           He gives Pepper a scolding look then places his hand 
           reassuringly on Emily’s shoulder.

                                 MR. GOODWIN
                        I promise, it’s just us in here. 
                        There aren’t any spirits. There’s 
                        no killer.

           Emily looks him in the eye. 

           How wrong he is.

           She breaks away. Shoves her diary into her satchel and storms 
           out the door.

           Goodwin stands there rattled. Finally he turns to Pepper.

                                 MR. GOODWIN (CONT’D)
                        Just to be safe, let’s not have 
                        Clue either.
           INT. DERRINGER’S KITCHEN - EVENING

           Emily pushes her food around her plate as David and Judy eat 
           their dinner in silence.

           Then -

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        There’s no God, right?

           David chokes on his food.

                                 JUDY DERRINGER
                        What?

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        God. He’s not real, is he?  And 
                        Heaven and Hell - they’re all just 
                        made up?

                                 DAVID DERRINGER
                        See Judy, this kind of thing is 
                        only going to get worse with a 
                        Catholic in the White House.

                                 JUDY DERRINGER
                        Of course there’s a God, honey.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        Then why do we only go to church on 
                        Christmas and Easter?

           The parents exchange looks - Judy takes this one.

                                 JUDY DERRINGER
                        Because your father works hard all 
                        week and likes to sleep in on 
                        Sundays. 

                                 DAVID DERRINGER
                        God understands.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        Fine then. God’s real. What about 
                        Good and Evil?

                                 JUDY DERRINGER
                        How do you mean?

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        Is something “good” only because 
                        God says it is, or is “good” good 
                        inherently?  
                                 (MORE)
                                 EMILY DERRINGER (CONT'D)
                        Is “evil” nothing more than the 
                        breaking of an arbitrary rule?

                                 JUDY DERRINGER
                        Why are you--

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        And why does God get to decide 
                        what’s good and bad? Because he’s 
                        “in charge?” What does that even 
                        mean? What if you disagree with 
                        him? Isn’t it worse to not follow 
                        your conscience? He says “Thou 
                        Shalt Not Kill” but don’t some 
                        people deserve to die? Don’t we 
                        fight wars based on that principle? 
                        Doesn’t God kill people all the 
                        time? 

                                 JUDY DERRINGER
                        Yes, but --

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        And what if God isn’t real? It 
                        makes a lot more sense that he’s 
                        not, doesn’t it? Does that posit 
                        existence is meaningless?  If life 
                        has no purpose, than how can 
                        morality exist?  How can something 
                        be right or wrong, when Existence 
                        is a cold, uncaring void? How can 
                        any action be objectively better or 
                        worse than another when in the end, 
                        we’re all going to rot, the Sun’s 
                        going to explode, and any trace 
                        that we were ever here will cease 
                        to exist?

           She looks to her parents, but they stare dumbfounded at each 
           other.

           Finally -

                                 JUDY DERRINGER
                        Eat your meatloaf, dear.

           They go back to shoving food in their mouths, a little more 
           urgently now.

           Emily sighs, shoves her plate away, and leaves the table.
           INT. EMILY’S BEDROOM 

           Emily walks into her room and softly closes the door behind 
           her. She then sits on her bed.

           After several moments accompanied only by the sound of her 
           ticking clock, Emily pulls back her butterfly bedsheets 
           revealing her DIARY.

           She opens it, and begins writing.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER (V.O.)
                        Dear Diary...

           EXT. DERRINGER’S BACK YARD - NIGHT

           FIRE rages within Mr. Derringer’s BARBECUE.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER (V.O.)
                        Goodbye.

           Emily drops the diary into the flame and watches as the pages 
           burn.

           She wipes away a tear. 

           As the paper turns to ash, Emily reaches into her pocket.

           She pulls out a NICKEL.

           INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT

           A young POLICE OFFICER sits at his desk filling out paper 
           work.

           His PHONE rings. He answers.

                                 OFFICER
                        Holdenfield Police Department.
                             (Listening)
                        Could you repeat that, Sir?  Your 
                        voice is a little muffled.
                             (Listening)
                        What?

           This call just got urgent. He grabs a pen.

                                 OFFICER (CONT’D)
                        Say that again...
           EXT. PHONE BOOTH - NIGHT

           Emily - holding a RAG to her mouth - hangs up the PHONE.

           The deed is done.

           EXT. GARRET’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           The peaceful stillness of Garret’s yard is broken when two 
           POLICE CARS drive up the dirt trail.

           They park by the SHED.

           Four OFFICERS exit the vehicles - GUTTENBERG, WINSLOW, 
           BAILEY, and CATRALL.

                                 GUTTENBERG
                        We positive this isn’t a Halloween 
                        prank?

                                 BAILEY
                        Halloween’s tomorrow.

                                 GUTTENBERG
                        Mischief Night, then. Anonymous 
                        tip? That sounds too easy.

                                 WINSLOW
                        Legit or not, we have to check it 
                        out.

           INT. GARRET’S HOUSE, KITCHEN

           Garret fills a TEA KETTLE at the sink.

           Brings it to the STOVE. He turns on the GAS.

           Lights a MATCH -

           KNOCK KNOCK

           He DROPS the match. Looks to the door.

           Waits.

           KNOCK KNOCK KNOCK

                                 GARRET BLUESTONE
                        ...Hello?

                                 GUTTENBERG (O.S.)
                        Police. Open up.
           The color drains from Garret’s face.

           EXT. GARRET’S HOUSE, PORCH

           Guttenberg and Winslow wait as Garret unlocks multiple LOCKS.

           The door cracks open.

           A final LATCH remains. Garret peers out.

                                 GARRET BLUESTONE
                        How may I assist you, gentlemen?

                                 WINSLOW
                        You could open the door.

           He hesitates.

                                 GARRET BLUESTONE
                        Oh. Yes...

           He removes the chain.

                                                                      SHED

           Bailey and Catrall lean against their cars.

           Bailey whistles to himself, absentmindedly letting his eyes 
           wander.

           He looks down at his shoe. Notices something.

           A trail of RED DIRT.

           Leading to the SHED.

           He nudges Catrall.

                                                                     PORCH

           A bead of sweat crawls down Garret’s forehead.

                                 GARRET BLUESTONE (CONT’D)
                        But I don’t understand. I haven’t 
                        done anything.

                                 WINSLOW
                        Regardless, we’d like to bring you 
                        in and ask you a few questions.

                                 GARRET BLUESTONE
                        Am I under arrest?
                                 WINSLOW
                        No, but--

                                 GARRET BLUESTONE
                        So I don’t have to go with you.

           The officers exchange looks.

                                 GUTTENBERG
                        Don’t make this more difficult than 
                        it has to be.

                                                                      SHED

           Bailey and Catrall follow the red trail to the shed’s door.

           It’s slightly ajar.

           Bailey pushes it open.

           LUCINDA’S HEAD falls into his arms.

           They both scream.

                                                                     PORCH

           Winslow and Guttenberg look back.

           Garret takes his chance.

           He grabs the HANDGUN tucked behind his back.

           FIRES.

           Guttenberg’s face explodes.

           FIRES.

           Winslow’s chest bursts open.

           He slams the door closed.

           INT. GARRET’S HOUSE 

           He bolts the DEAD LOCK, chains the LATCH.

           A BULLET HOLE erupts through the wood, just missing his arm.

           He screams.

           Shoots back wildly.

                                                                      SHED
           Bailey and Catrall dive behind their cars.

           Fire back.

                                                                     HOUSE

           Garret slithers below the BULLETS flying through the house.

                                 GARRET BLUESTONE
                        No, no, no, no, no.

           Repeating the mantra, he reaches up to a set of drawers.

           He pulls it to the ground, spilling everything.

           He searches through the clutter until he finds -

           AMMUNITION.

                                 GARRET BLUESTONE (CONT’D)
                        Not again, not again, not again...

           He reloads.

           Shimmies to a WINDOW.

           Pops up. Fires.

                                                                      SHED

           Shots hit the cars.

           Catrall reaches inside, grabs the RADIO.

                                                                     HOUSE

           CLICK

           Garret ducks below to reload.

           Stops. 

           Sniffs.

           Looks to the kitchen.

           The GAS is still running.

           A BULLET flies by his head.

           Hits the STOVE.

                                     KA-FUCKING-BOOM
                                                                      SHED

           Catrall and Bailey hit the dirt.

           A FIRE rages from the remains of the kitchen.

           Swiftly consumes the rest of the house.

           And they watch it burn.

                                                                     LATER

           COPS, PARAMEDICS and the entire FIRE DEPARTMENT crowd around 
           the smoldering husk that was Garret’s home.

           Bodies are wheeled away.

           A FIREMAN searches through chard wood.

           He moves debris.

           Reveals the blackened SKELETON underneath.

                                 FIREMAN
                        I found him! 

           He spits on the skull.

           As a crowd forms around the fallen killer, nobody suspects 
           that off in the distance, somewhere in the trees -

           They’re being watched.

           INT. EMILY’S BEDROOM - MORNING

           The morning sun shines brightly on Emily’s face.

           She stares at the ceiling. Hasn’t slept a wink.

                                 JUDY DERRINGER (O.S.)
                             (From downstairs)
                        I don’t believe it!

           It starts.

           INT. KITCHEN

           David reads the paper in disbelief.

           Judy is having a full blown panic attack. 

           She hyperventilates as she pours MILK down the drain. 
                                 JUDY DERRINGER
                        He came here every morning, David! 
                        He knew where we lived. God, he was 
                        in our house!

                                 DAVID DERRINGER
                        I made him an old fashioned.

           Emily trudges into the kitchen.

                                 JUDY DERRINGER
                        Emily! You won’t believe it. You’ll 
                        never believe it.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        Bluestone was the The Misfit.

           She sits at the table.

                                 JUDY DERRINGER
                        Yes! I feel faint. David, I’m going 
                        to faint.

           She faints.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        Could you pass the butter?

           He does. Emily spreads it on her toast.

                                 DAVID DERRINGER
                        It’s a shame they killed him. Would 
                        have loved the chance to see him 
                        squirm at the end of a noose. 
                        That’s the American way.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        Wait. He’s dead?

                                 DAVID DERRINGER
                        Burnt crispy by the sound of it.

           She bites her TOAST, unsure how to feel about this 
           development.

           INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - MORNING

           The Hallway is plastered with decorations.

           BANNERS and POSTERS all say the same thing:

                              “SAFE HALLOWEEN PARTY TONIGHT”
           But no one cares about that. 

           No, everyone’s talking about The Milk Man.

           Emily walks with her eyes firmly on the ground.

           It’s impossible to ignore snippets of conversations, all 
           about Garret’s horrifying deeds.

           Emily’s dying inside.

           She gets to her locker where two GIRLS are whispering.

                                 GIRL 1
                        The Milk Man - that’s what they’re 
                        calling him now.

                                 GIRL 2
                        That’s so much better than The 
                        Misfit.

                                 GIRL 1
                        I know. My Daddy says he’s going to 
                        go down in history.

                                 GIRL 2
                        Of course. There’s never been a 
                        killer more diabolical than Garret 
                        Bluestone.

           Emily slams her locker closed.

           The two girls watch her stomp away.

           INT. GIRL’S BATHROOM - DAY

           Emily kneels in a STALL with her head in the TOILET.

           Her retching echoes through the bathroom.

           She spits. Flushes.

           Exits the stall.

           Freezes.

           Pepper is at the MIRROR applying lipstick.

           She grimaces looking back at Emily.

                                 PEPPER DEVONSHIRE
                        What’s your problem?
           Emily goes to the sink, washes her hands.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        The Misfit -
                             (sighs)
                        I mean The Milk Man. The things 
                        they say he did...

                                 PEPPER DEVONSHIRE
                        Ugh, I know. Like the way he cut up 
                        that man into chunks and hid them 
                        around town.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        Drawn and quartered.

                                 PEPPER DEVONSHIRE
                        Huh?

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        Drawn and quartered. It was really 
                        popular in Medieval England. The 
                        guy’s name was Henry King, so you 
                        know - a pretty clever reference.
                             (beat)
                        But anyway, yeah. Terrible.

           She dries her hands.

                                 PEPPER DEVONSHIRE
                        At least now everyone can stop 
                        thinking about all that scary 
                        stuff.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        Yeah. Just in time for Halloween.

           She goes to the door.

                                 PEPPER DEVONSHIRE
                        That’s right, tonight’s the big 
                        party.
                             (beat)
                        It’s been fun.

           Emily stops.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        What?

                                 PEPPER DEVONSHIRE
                        I mean working together. I didn’t 
                        hate spending time with you as much 
                        as I thought I would.  
           Emily is dumbfounded.

           Unable to respond, she walks out the door.

                                 MR. GOODWIN (PRE-LAP)
                        Death is inevitable.

           INT. AMERICAN LITERATURE - DAY

           Goodwin looks out at his pupils, holds his BOOK open.

                                 MR. GOODWIN
                        And it’s a fool’s errand to try and 
                        hide from it. 

           He moves across the room, crossing a blackboard reading:

                              “THE MASQUE OF THE RED DEATH”

                                 MR. GOODWIN (CONT’D)
                        Prospero believed that by shutting 
                        he and his guests in the abbey, 
                        they were free from the inevitable. 
                        But rather than create a sanctuary, 
                        he built his own tomb.

           He looks out over the bored, disinterested faces.

           Smiles. Closes his book.

                                 MR. GOODWIN (CONT’D)
                        You know, I think we’ve heard 
                        enough from our friend Mr. Poe.

           A smattering of applause breaks out.

                                 MR. GOODWIN (CONT’D)
                        Yeah yeah, well buckle up. Next up 
                        is Flannery O’Connor.

           Looks at the clock.

                                 MR. GOODWIN (CONT’D)
                        But I think she can wait until 
                        Monday.
                             (beat)
                        I’ll see you all tonight at our 
                        Halloween party, then? Pepper and 
                        Emily have cooked up something 
                        pretty special. I think you’ll be 
                        impressed.

           He winks at Emily.
           She forces a weak smile back.

           The BELL rings. The students gather their things and leave.

           As Pepper passes Goodwin -

                                 PEPPER DEVONSHIRE
                        See you tonight, Tom.

                                 MR. GOODWIN
                        Bye Pepper.

           He goes to his desk, packs his briefcase.

           Realizes Emily is still seated, slumped over on her desk.

                                 MR. GOODWIN (CONT’D)
                        Emily? You all right?

           She rouses herself.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        Yeah. Just tired.

                                 MR. GOODWIN
                        Well you better rest up - big 
                        night, after all.

           She hesitates.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        I’m not going.

                                 MR. GOODWIN
                        You’re kidding.

           She’s not.

                                 MR. GOODWIN (CONT’D)
                        That’s crazy. After all the work we 
                        put in? Don’t you want to enjoy it 
                        with all your friends?

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        Mr. Goodwin - I don’t have any 
                        friends.

                                 MR. GOODWIN
                        That’s not true.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        Yes. It is. 

           She stares down at her desk.
           Goodwin rests his hand on your shoulder.

                                 MR. GOODWIN
                        But I’m your friend.

           She looks up at his gentle smile.

                                 MR. GOODWIN (CONT’D)
                        Come for me.
                             (beat)
                        Please.

           She stops breathing. Can’t speak.

           She nods. “Okay.”

           And then, at the WINDOW -

           BLUESTONE.

           Covered in burns. Glaring at her.

           She SCREAMS - jumps from her desk.

                                 MR. GOODWIN (CONT’D)
                        Whoa!

           She hits the floor as Goodwin turns to the window.

           Nothing.

           He looks back at Emily terrified on the floor.

                                 MR. GOODWIN (CONT’D)
                        What happened?

           He helps her up.

           She has to catch her breath. She looks back at the window.

           Did she imagine it?

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        I thought I saw...I mean...

           Shakes her head.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER (CONT’D)
                        Nothing. I’m all right.

                                 MR. GOODWIN
                        Are you sure? You’re scaring me.
                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        Yes, yes I’m okay.

           Shaken and embarrassed, she gathers her things and darts out 
           of the classroom.

           Goodwin is left scratching his head.

           EXT. SCHOOL - DAY

           Emily stands outside the window to the classroom.

           She desperately searches around.

           Sees nothing.

           EXT. DERRINGER’S HOUSE - DAY

           A MILK TRUCK idles outside the Derringer’s home.

           The door to the truck opens...

           Shoes hit the pavement.

           They approach the front door...

           The front door opens.

           Judy SCREAMS.

           FRANK - the replacement Milkman - stumbles back horrified.

           When Judy sees who it is - that it isn’t Garret - she 
           immediately calms down.

           But is still pissed.

                                 JUDY DERRINGER
                        Frank!

                                 FRANK LEVINE
                        I’m sorry, Judy, sorry!  

                                 JUDY DERRINGER
                        Are you bonkers wearing that?

                                 FRANK LEVINE
                        It’s the uniform.

           He picks up the MILK CRATE sitting on the porch.
                                 FRANK LEVINE (CONT’D)
                        Just grabbing all the empties that 
                        didn’t get picked up this morning 
                        for - you know - obvious reasons.

                                 JUDY DERRINGER
                        You scared me half to death.

                                 FRANK LEVINE
                        Well until I find a new guy, you’re 
                        going to be seeing a lot of me.

                                 JUDY DERRINGER
                        Won’t Mr. Gregory be returning?

                                 FRANK LEVINE
                        Gregory? Unlikely. I haven’t heard 
                        from that guy in months.  

                                 JUDY DERRINGER
                        No?

                                 FRANK LEVINE
                        Bastard didn’t even bother to quit 
                        to my face. I show up to work and 
                        there’s a note pinned to the door 
                        saying he’s taken off. Didn’t even 
                        leave an address for his last pay 
                        check.

                                 JUDY DERRINGER
                        That’s...peculiar.

                                 FRANK LEVINE
                        You’re telling me.  Luckily - or so 
                        I thought at the time - Bluestone 
                        showed up that same day looking for 
                        work.  How’s that for a kick in the 
                        teeth? First guy’s a bum, second’s 
                        a lunatic.

           He starts to leave.

                                 FRANK LEVINE (CONT’D)
                        I oughta put an ad in the paper - 
                        seeking Nazi War Criminal for 
                        immediate employment.

           Judy watches Frank return to his truck as what he said 
           percolates in her mind.

           She’s about to put the pieces together, to reach a 
           conclusion...
           Then shrugs.

           INT. DERRINGER’S HOUSE

           Judy closes the door.

           Emily appears at the top of the stairs.  She’s holding a 
           BLACK JACKET.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        What was that?

                                 JUDY DERRINGER
                        Nothing.

           Emily lets this go.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        Where’s Dad’s old taxidermy stuff?

                                 JUDY DERRINGER
                        In the attic, why?

           INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - NIGHT

           A RAVEN.

           Dead, stuffed, and perched on Emily’s shoulder.

           She’s dressed in ornate black clothing, hair combed over to 
           the side, and a MUSTACHE drawn above her lip.

           She’s the spitting image of EDGAR ALLAN POE.

           She walks with purpose through the empty hall to a set of 
           closed doors.

           She readies herself.

           Pushes them open.

           INT. GYMNASIUM

           Emily takes in the sight of the PARTY.

           STUDENTS and FACULTY - all wearing COSTUMES - pack the gym. 
           They play the games, admire the decorations, and dance to the 
           music playing from the PA system.

           Despite their modest work-force, Goodwin, Pepper, and Emily 
           managed to pull it off.
           Emily scans the crowd before she spots who she’s looking for.

           Mr. Goodwin - dressed as MARK TWAIN - pours TWO CUPS of PUNCH 
           with his back to her.

           Emily sidles up behind him and patiently waits for him to 
           turn around.

           When he does, he jumps - startled by her unexpected presence.

                                 MR. GOODWIN
                        Emily? Is that you? Wow, you look 
                        fantastic.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        I hoped you would like it.

                                 MR. GOODWIN
                             (Gesturing to his own 
                              costume)
                        Clearly you know my taste. How 
                        about some punch?

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        Thank you.

           She reaches for one of the cups, but he jerks it away.

                                 MR. GOODWIN
                        Actually, these are spoken for. 

           Emily doesn’t have time to register this as odd before Pepper 
           - dressed as a COWGIRL - appears next to them and takes her 
           drink.

                                 PEPPER DEVONSHIRE
                        Thank you, Tom.

           Emily rolls her eyes as Goodwin pours another one.

           Pepper looks over Emily’s costume.

                                 PEPPER DEVONSHIRE (CONT’D)
                        Of course you dressed as a boy.

           Emily bites her tongue. Hard.

           Tries something different...

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        You look pretty, Pepper. I like 
                        your costume.

           Disarmed.
                                 PEPPER DEVONSHIRE
                        Oh, um. Thanks.
                             (beat)
                        You look good with a mustache is 
                        all I meant.

           She’ll take it.

           Goodwin turns back around.

                                 MR. GOODWIN
                        Well, we did it.

           He hands Emily her cup, then raises his own. The girls follow 
           suit.

                                 MR. GOODWIN (CONT’D)
                        To a successful party, and the two 
                        best girls I know. We make a 
                        fantastic team.

           They all drink.

           Though hidden behind the cup held to her lips, Emily smiles.

           INT. DERRINGER’S HALLWAY, UPSTAIRS - NIGHT

           Judy walks down the hallway holding a LAUNDRY BASKET. 

           As she’s about to descend the stairs, she hears a -

           THUMP coming from Emily’s room.

           She stops, turns towards Emily’s closed DOOR.

           She gently knocks.

                                 JUDY DERRINGER
                        I thought you left for the party 
                        already.

           No response.

                                 JUDY DERRINGER (CONT’D)
                        Emily?

           Judy puts the basket down. Then, upon readying herself -

           She opens the door...

           SCREAMS.
           INT. GYMNASIUM - NIGHT

           The party is in full swing.

           The dance floor is packed with MOVIE STARS, SPACE MEN, 
           MONSTERS, and all other sorts of costumes bopping to the 
           music blasting from the sound system.

           Emily watches it from the sidelines, in a row of unoccupied 
           chairs lining the wall.

           She sips her punch.

           The song ends.

           “Earth Angel” begins.

                                 MR. GOODWIN (O.S.)
                        May I have this dance?

           Emily looks up to see Goodwin standing above her with his 
           hand outstretched.

                                 MR. GOODWIN (CONT’D)
                        You can’t leave me stranded during 
                        a slow song. What would people 
                        think?

           Emily smiles.

           She takes his hand.

           He leads her to the center of the dance floor.

           He takes her other hand and the two sway to the music.

           It’s innocent - like a father and daughter - but to Emily?

           This is the most magical moment of her life.

                                 MR. GOODWIN (CONT’D)
                        Aren’t you glad you came?

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        I am. I mean, I definitely don’t 
                        fit in. Not like Pepper, anyway.

           She gestures over to Pepper surrounded by her adoring fans 
           and chugging her punch.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER (CONT’D)
                        But this is nice.
                                 MR. GOODWIN
                        You don’t want to be like Pepper.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        Why? Everyone else does.

                                 MR. GOODWIN
                        Kids flock to Pepper because she’s 
                        pretty, and she’s fun - because 
                        when they look at her, they see 
                        what they themselves want to be. 
                        But you know what they see when 
                        they look at you?

           What?

                                 MR. GOODWIN (CONT’D)
                        They see someone they could never 
                        be, no matter how hard they tried. 
                        Pepper’s aspirational - but you are 
                        exceptional.

           Emily doesn’t know what to say. So she doesn’t say anything.

           She hugs him. Hard. And he lets her.

           She needs this. She needs this a lot.

           And there underneath the lights, with the music playing and 
           her face buried in Tom’s silk vest -

           She’s not alone.

           But everything dies, and this moment is no different.

           Emily opens her eyes.

           And sees a GHOST.

           At the far end of the gym - standing in the doorway - is a 
           MAN draped in a sheet.

           A BUTTERFLY BEDSHEET.

           Her bedsheet.

           Reflexively, Emily pushes away from Goodwin.

                                 MR. GOODWIN (CONT’D)
                        Emily...?

           Two vacant eyes cut into the cloth watch her.

           Emily moves closer, tries to get a better look -
           But DANCERS block her, obscure the view.

           She pushes past them.

           The Ghost is gone.

           She spins around, her eyes dart in all directions.

           No sign.

           Goodwin - left stranded on the dance floor - watches baffled 
           as Emily darts out into the hallway. Then -

           Pepper stumbles over to him. 

           Practically falls into his arms.

           She looks up and smiles. Her mouth is stained red from punch.

                                 PEPPER DEVONSHIRE
                        Hello.

           Goodwin smiles back.

                                 MR. GOODWIN
                        Hi there.

           INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY

           Emily marches down the hallway. 

           She looks down every hall, inside every empty classroom, but 
           sees nothing.

           With every step, her desperation grows.

           Then, she turns the corner - 

           And stops.

           She slowly approaches her LOCKER. Processes what she’s 
           seeing.

           It’s coated in BLOOD.

           She turns around, scans the hallway one more time.

           No sign of anyone else. 

           She opens her locker. Inside -

           Her DIARY.
           It’s scorched beyond recognition.

           But it has been salvaged nonetheless.

           She clutches it to her chest.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        Welcome back.

           INT. SUPPLY CLOSET

           The door to the supply closet flies open and Emily bounds 
           inside.

           She heads immediately to the back and pushes aside a pile of 
           old BOXES.

           Unearthing her DUFFLE BAG.

           INT. GYMNASIUM

           Bag slung over her shoulder, Emily rushes back into the Gym 
           where the party is still in full effect.

           She scans the crowd.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                             (Calling out)
                        Mr. Goodwin?

           She goes in deeper. She grabs ZORRO’s arm.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER (CONT’D)
                        Have you seen Mr. Goodwin?

           He shakes her off. She moves on. Accosts a DOROTHY.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER (CONT’D)
                        Mr. Goodwin - do you know where he 
                        is?

           Dorothy shakes her head, goes back to speaking with a MUMMY.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER (CONT’D)
                             (Calling)
                        Tom!

           She searches all around, but it’s no use.

           He’s nowhere to be found.

           Doesn’t know what to do. But -
           An idea.

           She turns and heads for the door.

           INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY, AMERICAN LIT

           Emily tries the door to the American Literature classroom.

           Locked.

           She pounds the door.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        Mr. Goodwin!

           A SHADOW moves behind the door’s FROSTED GLASS WINDOW.

           He’s inside.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER (CONT’D)
                        Mr. Goodwin! Please open the door.

           She hears a muffled voice.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER (CONT’D)
                        Tom! Please!

           Finally, Goodwin opens the door a crack.

           She tries to push it open.

           But he stops it with his foot.

                                 MR. GOODWIN
                        Emily, what’s wrong?

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        He’s come back! He isn’t dead and 
                        now he’s back!

           Goodwin is distracted, only half listening

                                 MR. GOODWIN
                        Who’s back? What are you talking 
                        about?

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        I’m a bad person. I’ve done bad 
                        things, really bad things and now 
                        because of me it isn’t safe for you 
                        here.

           Goodwin doesn’t have time for this.
                                 MR. GOODWIN
                        Emily, go back to the party.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        No, you have to leave. Now!

           She shoves hard against the door.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER (CONT’D)
                        Why won’t you let me--

           She shoves with all her might.

           INT. AMERICAN LITERATURE

           She tumbles inside, falls to her knees.

           The duffle bag slides across the floor.

           Then, from the ground, she looks up at his DESK.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        Pepper?

           Pepper sits slumped in Goodwin’s desk chair.

           She’s barely cognizant. Her shirt is half open.

           Goodwin stands paralysed by the door.

                                 MR. GOODWIN
                        You need to leave, Emily.

           Emily slowly rises to her feet.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        What is...I don’t...

           Her voice cracks.

           The world shifts beneath her feet.

           Her eyes water.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER (CONT’D)
                        Pepper?

                                 MR. GOODWIN
                        I know what this might look like, 
                        but -
                             (beat)
                        Pepper was feeling sick, she asked 
                        if she could lay down.
                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        Pepper?

                                 MR. GOODWIN
                        Okay, calm down. Let’s just take a 
                        second. There’s no reason to get 
                        upset.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        She’s thirteen.

                                 MR. GOODWIN
                        Fourteen in January. And we can 
                        both admit she’s very mature for 
                        her age.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        You got her drunk.

                                 MR. GOODWIN
                        Hey now! That’s not fair. She asked 
                        me for liquor. I never ever would 
                        have suggested it myself.

           It’s all too much. Her shoulder’s sink.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        After everything you said to me...

                                 MR. GOODWIN
                        It’s all true. You’re a very 
                        special girl, Emily. And you’re my 
                        friend, remember that? We’re 
                        friends and friend’s don’t tattle. 
                        Please don’t tell anyone about 
                        this.

           She looks into his pathetic, pleading eyes.

           She shakes her head, unable to comprehend the betrayal.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                             (Whispering)
                        You were supposed to be different.

           She averts her eyes, can’t bare to look at him any longer.

           She stares at the ground.

           Finally, she wipes away her tears.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER (CONT’D)
                        I won’t tell.
           The relief on Goodwin’s face is revolting.

                                 MR. GOODWIN
                        No? You won’t? 

           She walks to her duffle bag.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        No one needs to know what happened 
                        here.

                                 MR. GOODWIN
                        Thank you! Thank you, thank you, 
                        thank you Emily. I promise, it will 
                        never happen again.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        Yeah. I’ve heard that before.

           She unzips it.

                                 MR. GOODWIN
                        What are you--

                                 EMILY DERRINGER
                        I had big plans for tonight, Mr. 
                        Goodwin. I abandoned them.
                             (beat)
                        You, however, have inspired me.

           INT. GYMNASIUM - NIGHT

           The Ghost in Butterfly Sheets wanders the Gym.

           Slowly, taking his time, he moves past the partiers enjoying 
           their festivities.

           Adults and Children alike, unaware that Death moves amongst 
           them.

           No one notices the KNIFE glistening in his BURNED HAND.

           Then, through the crowd, Garret sees his prey.

           The black jacket, the dark hair - Emily.

           Her back is turned to him.

           He glides like a spectre, raises his knife -

           The child turns around.

           A BOY, dressed as DRACULA.
           Garret stops himself. Then - 

           A SCREAM.

           Garret turns to see MARILYN MONROE shrieking and pointing to 
           the RAFTERS.

           Like everyone else in the Gym, he follows her gaze. 

           More screams.

           Up in the rafters -

           GOODWIN.

           A NOOSE around his neck.

           He’s pushed.

           The crowd erupts as Goodwin plummets.

           The ROPE snaps tight.

           Goodwin’s ENTRAILS spill from the GASH in his STOMACH.

           ORGANS rain down on the party.

           CHARLIE CHAPLAIN - his head submerged in the APPLE BOBBING 
           TANK - emerges from the water with Goodwin’s LIVER in his 
           mouth.

           The eviscerated body swings back and forth above the crowd as 
           a mass exodus hurdles towards the doors.

           The MUSIC cuts off.

           Emily’s voice bellows from the PA system.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER (O.S.)
                        Dear Holdenfield, I - The Misfit 
                        Butcher - have risen from the dead. 
                             (beat)
                        Garret - come find me.

           Garret - his eyes still focused on Goodwin’s corpse - rips 
           off the sheets.

           Burns cover his whole body. 

           A deformed shell of his former self.

           And though there’s fury in his eyes and revenge in his heart -

           He almost looks frightened.
           INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY

           Garret storms through the Halls, pushing against the current 
           of PEOPLE swarming to leave.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER (O.S.)
                        I must admit, Bluestone - you are 
                        certainly full of surprises.

           The Halls are empty now, save for a few stragglers who rush 
           past Garret.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        I’m pleased to see you embracing 
                        some theatricality. A vast 
                        improvement over your usual modus 
                        operandi. 

           He kicks open a classroom door.

           Empty.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        And faking your death? Very 
                        impressive.

           He opens a closet.

           Finds nothing.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Or did you? Are you actually a 
                        ghost here to haunt me from beyond 
                        the grave?

           His search is getting more and more frantic, Emily’s taunts 
           stoking the fire.

                                 EMILY DERRINGER (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        No, that I won’t buy. Not boring 
                        ole Garret Bluestone the 
                        neighborhood Milk Man.

           He can’t find her. But then -

           Of course.

           He changes direction.

           INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY, AMERICAN LIT

           His target in sight, he makes a dash for the American Lit 
           room.
                                 EMILY DERRINGER (O.S.)
                        Will you please hurry it up? 

           He kicks the door open.

           Emily goes silent.

           Bingo.

           INT. AMERICAN LITERATURE

           He surveys the empty classroom, rubs his thumb against the 
           blade.

           A THUMP.

           It came from the CLOSET at the back of the room.

                                 GARRET BLUESTONE
                        I didn’t want this, Emily.

           He approaches the door.

                                 GARRET BLUESTONE (CONT’D)
                        But you couldn’t let me be. Now I 
                        have nothing left, nothing to hold 
                        on to.

           Closer.

                                 GARRET BLUESTONE (CONT’D)
                        I’ve never liked killing anyone. 
                        Every death was a nightmare.

           Closer.

                                 GARRET BLUESTONE (CONT’D)
                        But for the first time, here with 
                        you...

           He grabs the KNOB.

                                 GARRET BLUESTONE (CONT’D)
                        I might enjoy this.

           Opens the door.

           PEPPER - bound and gagged. Terrified.

           A WIRE’s tripped.

           An AXE swings at his head.
           Garret dodges it.

           Emily pounces from behind. Swings the SCYTHE.

           Garret spins. Elbows her in the face.

           The scythe cuts across his chest as Emily falls backwards.

           He cries out in pain, drops the KNIFE.

           It lands by Pepper.

           Emily scrambles backwards as Garret recovers.

           He lunges.

           Lands on top of her.

           Wraps his fingers around her throat.

           A man strangling a little girl.

           Her eyes bulge, her face turns red.

           Pepper stretches with her bound hands. Grabs the knife.

           Garret digs his fingers deeper and deeper into Emily’s neck.

           He’s frothing with rage.

                                 GARRET BLUESTONE (CONT’D)
                        You made me do this!

           Emily claws at his face, but it’s no use.

           He throttles her, smacks her head against the ground.

           Emily’s eyes roll back into her head.

           It gets dark...

           Then...

           SPLASH

           Emily’s eye’s shoot open as she’s baptized in -

           Garret’s BLOOD pouring from the -

           GASH in his throat.

           He looks just as surprised as she does.

           His grip loosens.
           He collapses, lands next to Emily.

           DEAD.

           And standing above him, face drained of color -

           Pepper. The bloody knife in her hand.

           Still struggling to breathe, Emily climbs out from under 
           Garret. She clasps at her bruised throat.

           Pepper looms over her kill, the shock rendering her 
           motionless.

           Eventually, she falls to her knees, rests on her feet.

           The two girls, both covered in Garret’s blood, sit silently 
           on the floor, neither looking at the other.

           Finally, Pepper looks at Emily.

           Emily looks back.

           The Gruesome Twosome.

           EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT

           Emily glides down Main Street on her bike.

           SIRENS WAIL in the distance.

           The cold wind blows through her hair.

           EXT. SCHOOL - NIGHT

           POLICE CARS, FIRE TRUCKS, AMBULANCES all come racing to the 
           scene.

           Pepper sits hugging her knees on the steps to the school.

           EXT. DERRINGER’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Emily walks her bike to the front door.

           Lets it fall to the ground as she reaches her front door.

           Walks inside.
           INT. DERRINGER’S HOUSE

           Emily steps into a puddle of BLOOD pooling at the bottom of 
           the STAIRS.

           It drips down from the top step.

           JUDY lays dead at the landing, her lifeless eyes staring down 
           at her daughter.

           Emily keeps walking.

           INT. DERRINGER’S KITCHEN

           She stops for a moment to observe David crumpled on the 
           floor.

           She goes to the CABINET and takes out a box of CEREAL. Rests 
           it on the TABLE.

           She steps over her father’s body to get to the SINK. She 
           grabs a BOWL and a SPOON, then a bottle of MILK from off the 
           COUNTER.

           She sits down at the table.

           She pours the cereal in the bowl, is about to douse it with 
           MILK.

           Takes a look at the bottle. 

           Thinks better of it.

           She takes a bite of dry cereal.

           INT. AMBULANCE - NIGHT

           Pepper sits in the back of an open ambulance gripping a cup 
           of hot chocolate and a blanket wrapped around her shoulders.

           A POLICE OFFICER stands above her.

           She hands the Officer the DIARY.

                                 PEPPER DEVONSHIRE
                        She told me to give you this.

           INT. DERRINGER’S FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT

           As POLICE SIRENS approach -
           Emily sits in a CHAIR facing the FRONT DOOR.

           She twiddles her thumbs.

           RED and BLUE LIGHTS flash outside the windows.

           And as she hears the thunder of BOOTS storm up her porch -

           She smiles. She’s ready for this.

           But upon reaching the front door -

           The MEN on the other side hesitate.

           As if terrified by what they’ll encounter.

                                 PEPPER DEVONSHIRE (V.O.)
                        Emily Derringer is the Misfit.

           THE END
