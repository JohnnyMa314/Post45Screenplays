           INT. OFFICE - DAY

           A NERVOUS ASSISTANT sits at her cubicle, eyes darting around 
           like she’s waiting for something terrible to--

                                 BOSS (O.S.)
                        WHAT’S-YOUR-FACE! 

                                 NERVOUS ASSISTANT
                        Coming!!

           She jumps up, knocking over her chair as she hurries into her 
           boss’s office.  MUSIC STARTS as we CUT TO....

           INT. DIFFERENT OFFICE - DAY

           An ASSISTANT getting angry ON THE PHONE--

                                 ASSISTANT ON THE PHONE
                        Well guess what, Janet, I’ve got a 
                        masters in sociology and nothing 
                        else to do today, so put me on hold 
                        for as long as you want ‘cause I’m 
                        not hanging up until his seat’s 
                        bumped to first class.  

           INT. CAFE - DAY

           A FRANTIC ASSISTANT looks through a lunch pick-up.

                                 FRANTIC ASSISTANT
                        No, I said no onions.  I said 
                        onions were fatal.  As in if there 
                        are onions, I will be killed.

           INT. VARIOUS - DAY

           --ASSISTANT #1 walks out of a DRY CLEANERS with 40 pounds of 
           clothes, balancing a phone to his ear:
                                 ASSISTANT #1
                        I’ll be right there.

           --ASSISTANT #2 answers the phone at dinner:

                                 ASSISTANT #2
                        I’ll be right there.

           --ASSISTANT #3 answers the phone in bed, mid-sex:

                                 ASSISTANT #3
                        I’ll be right there.

           EXT. STREET - DAY

           An ASSISTANT walks her boss’s PSYCHOTIC DOG.  It BARKS and 
           lunges toward a POLICEMAN as she struggles to hold on--

           The Policeman gets out pepper spray but the dog stops short 
           of him and takes a huge horse-sized poop at his feet. 

                                 DOG WALKING ASSISTANT
                             (sheepish)
                        Do you by chance have a bag?

           The Policeman just gives her a look.  QUICK CUT TO....

           The Dog Walking Assistant picks up the poop with something 
           white.  WIDER REVEALS it’s her shirt.  She stands in the 
           middle of the street in her bra.

           INT. DIFFERENT OFFICE - DAY

           The Assistant on the phone is still on hold as everybody else 
           leaves for lunch.  He tries to roll his chair to the next 
           desk over to grab a bag of chips, but it’s too far.

           INT./EXT. VARIOUS - DAY

           --On the STREET, ASSISTANT #4 pleads with a METER MAID:

                                 ASSISTANT #4
                        Please, she was only gone for a few 
                        minutes, is there any way--

           --In a COURTROOM, ASSISTANT #5 pleads with a judge:

                                 ASSISTANT #5
                        He’s not gonna be able to serve, so 
                        let’s make some sort of deal.  What 
                        if I serve on three juries....

           --In an OFFICE, ASSISTANT #6 on the phone:
                                 ASSISTANT #6
                        He wanted me to let you know he’s 
                        breaking up with you and needs you 
                        out of the apartment by 6 tonight.

           THREE QUICK CUTS of cups hitting desks:

           --A CUP OF COFFEE

           --A CUP OF ALCOHOL

           --A SPECIMEN CUP OF URINE

           A grossed-out ASSISTANT puts the specimen cup in a brown 
           paper bag.  His BOSS walks by--

                                 URINE BOSS
                        It better still be warm when it 
                        gets there.

                                 ASSISTANT #7
                        No problem!

           He runs down the hall with it.

           INT. DIFFERENT OFFICE - NIGHT

           The Assistant on Hold groans, head on his hands, as everyone 
           else packs up to go.  He sits up and accidentally hits a 
           button -- then hears a dial tone.

                                 ASSISTANT ON THE PHONE
                        No.  Hello?  HELLO?!  NO!!!

           INT. VARIOUS - NIGHT

           QUICK CUTS of all the Assistants we’ve seen before finally 
           going home:  slamming laptops closed, grabbing bags, escaping 
           so quickly their chairs are still spinning.

           EXT. BUILDING - NIGHT

           A LAST ASSISTANT bursts out of the building.  She beams up at 
           the sky, finally free, as we pan UP AND AWAY....

           But then we STOP ABRUPTLY -- at one lonely office with its 
           light still on, where HARPER HALL (27, bright, always too 
           eager) has her face pressed up against the glass, a low-paid, 
           under-appreciated prisoner of war.
           INT. “THE RUNDOWN” OFFICES - NIGHT

           At the window, Harper watches the Last Assistant leave.  Her 
           hair is unbrushed, she looks like she got dressed in the 
           dark, everything about her is frazzled.

                                 HARPER
                        Be free, turtle dove.  Save 
                        yourself...

           She heads back through a sea of empty cubicles, passing the 
           only other person still here, her boss, KIRSTEN (39, vain, 
           intense), typing furiously in her office.

           Harper gets to her desk and falls into her chair and opens 
           her laptop to a GUY’S DATING PROFILE.  She checks the time, 
           curses, and keeps one eye on Kirsten as she calls her date-- 

                                 HARPER (ON PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        Heeey, it’s Harper again!  
                             (listening, then)
                        Nope, not there yet.  I’m so sorry 
                        but I’m still at work.  I know I’ve 
                        already done this twice and we’ve 
                        never actually met so you may want 
                        to continue to never meet, but I 
                        think I’ll be free around 2 or 3am.
                             (trying to be flirty)
                        Can you think of something we could 
                        do that would be worth waiting for?
                             (listens, then, horrified)
                        Are you kidding me?  Absolutely 
                        not.  Not a chance.  That comes 
                        after love, and marriage, and like, 
                        a Valium.  Are people really doing 
                        that on first dates?  Is that a 
                        thing?  Hello?

           He’s hung up.  She hangs up, sighs, and deletes his profile. 

           She quits Safari, revealing a HALF-WRITTEN ARTICLE open on 
           her computer, cursor blinking.  She reads it to herself--

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        “Some call it a field, some call it 
                        a pitch, but to soccer phenom 
                        Sophie Seymour, it’s a spa, a 
                        church, a librar”--oh my GOD.

           She groans and deletes the entire thing, just as Kirsten 
           leans out of her office.

                                 KIRSTEN
                        Are you trying to starve me?  My 
                        bones are eating themselves just to 
                        stay alive.  Order me that thing I 
                        like from that place with that gay 
                        waiter.  The closeted one.
                                 HARPER
                             (super upbeat)
                        Sure!  So we are doing second 
                        dinner?

           Kirsten tosses her a FITBIT--

                                 KIRSTEN
                        And make sure this is at 10,000 
                        steps before Chad gets here 
                        tomorrow because I don’t want him 
                        to think I haven’t been working out 
                        between sessions.

                                 HARPER
                             (super duper upbeat)
                        Great!  

           INT. “THE RUNDOWN” OFFICES - NIGHT

           Harper wears Kirsten’s Fitbit as she runs laps around the 
           office and orders dinner.

                                 HARPER (ON PHONE)
                        So the truffle mac and cheese, a 
                        kale salad, and a turkey burger.  
                        Perfect.  45 minutes?  
                             (kill me)
                        Yep!  I’ll be here.  

           She hangs up and keeps running as we CUT TO....

           EXT. CITY CLUB - NIGHT

           A stone-faced DOORMAN guards the entrance to the CITY CLUB, a 
           fancy building oozing money and exclusivity.  CHARLIE (26, 
           sweet but trying too hard) paces on the sidewalk outside.  

           A BALD MAN exits the building, typing on his Blackberry, and 
           when Charlie sees him, he lights up. Charlie watches him walk 
           away, then turns back to the Doorman, star-struck.

                                 CHARLIE
                        That was David Walsh!  Of Walsh 
                        Associates!  He was on Shark Tank!

           Charlie shakes his head, amazed, as he dials someone on his 
           cell phone and absentmindedly sits on the front steps--

                                 CITY CLUB DOORMAN
                        Steps are for members only.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Totally.  Sorry.  I’m just waiting 
                        for my boss. 
           The Doorman doesn’t care.  

           INT. BAR - NIGHT [INTERCUT]

           An insanely hot girl, SUZE, answers her phone in this 
           boisterous bar, shouting over the MUSIC--

                                 SUZE (ON PHONE)
                        HELLO?!

                                 CHARLIE (ON PHONE) 
                        Hey baby.  I’m still here, Rick 
                        hasn’t left yet, so I’m just gonna 
                        have to meet you at your place 
                        later.

                                 SUZE (ON PHONE)
                             (frowny face)
                        Baby....

                                 CHARLIE (ON PHONE)
                        What are you wearing?  Will you 
                        send me a photo?
                             (she MUMBLES something)
                        What?!

                                 SUZE (ON PHONE)
                        Nothing, some guy’s getting me a 
                        drink!

                                 CHARLIE (ON PHONE)
                        No!  That’s--  I get you drinks.  
                        Let me buy you a drink!  Give the 
                        bartender my credit card number, 
                        okay?  Ready?  4407--

           Suddenly RICK (45, an angry live wire in the most expensive 
           suit) walk out of the building.  Charlie throws his cellphone 
           against the building wall as if he’d never been on it, 
           perking up with a mix of adoration and terror--

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        What?  No one.  Nothing.  What’d 
                        you think?  Are you gonna invest?

                                 RICK
                        I’ll invest in that company when 
                        they figure out how to dip their 
                        dicks in ink and write the Japanese 
                        symbol for “horseshit.”

           A VALET GUY screeches a super-expensive car to a stop in 
           front of them and hurries over to Rick.  Rick walks to take 
           the keys and Charlie waves--
                                 CHARLIE
                        See you tomorrow!

                                 RICK
                        What are you talking about?  We’re 
                        going back to the office.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Oh!  Okay.  Do you want me to order 
                        you dinner?

                                 RICK
                        You know I’m on a cleanse. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yeah, it’s just that sometimes you 
                        end up wanting dinner anyw--

           Rick shuts him up with a look of death.  Charlie reaches for 
           the passenger door but Rick gives him another look--

                                 RICK
                        Am I an Uber driver?  Are you Miss 
                        Daisy?  What’s happening here? 

           Charlie jumps back as Rick floors it and zooms away.  Charlie 
           waits a beat, then dashes over to his cell phone--

                                 CHARLIE
                        Suze?  Baby?  

           INT. KIRSTEN’S OFFICE - “THE RUNDOWN” OFFICES - NIGHT

           Harper stands in Kirsten’s office, sweaty and out of breath 
           from the laps.  Kirsten’s looking at a wall-sized corkboard 
           full of story ideas, names, and teams as Harper takes notes--

                                 KIRSTEN
                        I want a young woman to do the 
                        profile on Coach Brown, so he’ll 
                        think it’s a puff piece.  Someone 
                        smart but who can play innocent.

           Kirsten looks right at her and Harper straightens, excited--

                                 KIRSTEN (CONT’D)
                        Did you return that jacket?

                                 HARPER
                             (hiding her deflation)
                        I did!  And after a two-hour drive 
                        to their warehouse and a very 
                        intense conversation with a 
                        saleswoman that ended with both of 
                        us crying, I got you a full refund.
                                 KIRSTEN
                        I want it back.

                                 HARPER
                        Terrific!  Will do.

                                 KIRSTEN
                        What else? 

                                 HARPER
                        I’m getting a present for your 
                        niece’s birthday next week and you 
                        still owe RSVP’s to a few parties--

                                 KIRSTEN
                        What kind of parties?

                                 HARPER
                        Let’s see.... Polly’s wedding.  
                        Annie’s engagement party.  
                        Bridget’s baby shower....  

           Kirsten’s eyes get narrower with each invitation--

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        Alice’s son’s birthday.  You RSVP-
                        ed to Jane’s wedding and they just 
                        need to confirm you’re okay sharing 
                        a room with Helen since you’re--

           Harper finally registers Kirsten’s face but it’s too late.

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        Both...coming...alone.

           Kirsten slams her desk.  Harper jumps.

                                 KIRSTEN
                        I’m starting a business!  I don’t 
                        have time to celebrate some friend 
                        of a friend’s third kid.  From now 
                        on just decline all of them and 
                        send a $200 gift.  Don’t even ask 
                        me anymore.
                             (then, angrier)
                        And we should have three times this 
                        many feature ideas by now! 

                                 HARPER
                             (blurting out)
                        I have a story idea!

           Harper immediately regrets it, but Kirsten looks at her, 
           expectant, so she has to keep going.
                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        It’s not fleshed out, or anything, 
                        it’s not--I haven’t cracked it.  

                                 KIRSTEN
                        Why are you telling me it’s bad 
                        before I’ve heard it?

                                 HARPER
                        But there’s this soccer player, she 
                        was born in Germany, but she was 
                        obsessed with the US soccer team, 
                        and then she found out her father-- 
                        she had a single mom, I should have 
                        said that earlier-- and in high 
                        school she finally met her dad, and 
                        he’s American, so she has 
                        citizenship, and now she’s trying 
                        out for our national team--

           Harper’s voice breaks and she tries to shake it off--

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        --with her heroes, and she never 
                        thought she’d be here, and she’s 
                        learning what it means to be an 
                        American...
                             (voice straining)
                        I’m sorry.  I get really emotional 
                        when I talk about sports....
                             (trying again)
                        But she’s taking a chance with....

           Kirsten just stares at her.  Harper’s cell RINGS, saving her.

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        Your dinner!  I’ll leave this room 
                        now to go get it.

           She hurries out of Kirsten’s office, shaking her head. As she 
           goes she passes a window, where we see the only other light 
           on in the building and CUT TO.....

           INT. MCKELVY CAPITAL OFFICES - NIGHT

           Charlie takes notes as he follows Rick through the empty 
           desks toward Rick’s palatial corner office.

                                 RICK
                        Their 5-year plan is really a 2-
                        year plan, their market capital is 
                        overvalued, and their name is 
                        stupid.  People using a private 
                        chef want to feel fancy, they’re 
                        not gonna open an app called “Chef-
                        Me.”  What do I have tomorrow?
                                 CHARLIE
                        I moved your lunch to Delfine’s, 
                        and your ex-wife wants you to call 
                        her to discuss your daughter’s 
                        parent-teacher conferences.

                                 RICK
                        Tell Kiki she can suck my left nut.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Like, if she calls?  Or....

                                 RICK
                        Ask Kiki if she’s still fucking our 
                        real estate agent in the house I 
                        bought for us. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        I don’t actually communicate--

           Rick stops at Charlie’s desk-- it’s covered in lemons.

                                 RICK
                        What is this?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Oh, this is your daughter’s science 
                        project!  It’s actually coming 
                        along really well.  It’ll be a fun 
                        play on “When life gives you 
                        lemons,” ‘cause I’m using a lemon 
                        battery to power a lemonade--

                                 RICK
                        Where’s my dinner?

           A beat. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Did you want dinner?  ‘Cause you 
                        said....

                                 RICK
                        No, I’m just asking for its 
                        location so I have a more complete 
                        image when I jack off to it later.

                                 CHARLIE
                             (trying not to panic)
                        No problem.  Coming right up.

           Charlie grins too widely and backs out of the room.  As soon 
           as he’s out of Rick’s view, he sprints to the elevator.
           INT. BUILDING LOBBY - NIGHT

           Harper and a DELIVERY GUY stand in the empty, echoing lobby.  
           He holds two bags of food as Harper tears through her wallet.

                                 HARPER
                        I have three credit cards.  I can 
                        write you a check.  

                                 DELIVERY GUY
                        I’m sorry, it’s cash only.

                                 HARPER
                        What if I told you I could pay you 
                        triple tomorrow?

                                 DELIVERY GUY
                        Cash only. 

                                 HARPER
                        What if I told you this face was 
                        just a mask and I’m really a 
                        hundred-year-old gypsy who will 
                        curse your family for generations 
                        if you don’t give me that food?

                                 DELIVERY GUY
                        Cash only.

           Harper stifles a scream of frustration.

           On the other side of the lobby, Charlie bursts out of an 
           elevator on the phone.

                                 CHARLIE (ON PHONE)
                        What good is a 24-hour grocery 
                        store if you can’t cook the food 
                        you sell?!  Do you sell microwaves? 

           He comes around the corner to see Harper arguing--

                                 HARPER
                        I cannot go up there and ask for 
                        cash and I cannot go up there 
                        without food so it seems like my 
                        only two options are for you to 
                        help me out or for me to finally 
                        commit a felony. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        HEY!
                             (hangs up, sprints over)
                        Whose food is this?

                          HARPER
           It’s mine.
                                                      DELIVERY GUY
                                              You got cash, it’s all yours.
           Charlie takes out his wallet, giddy.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        I have cash!  I have so much cash!  
                        Holy shit, you’re saving my life--

           Harper slaps his wallet out of his hand.

                                 HARPER
                        Stop!  This is my boss’s dinner and 
                        I don’t have any cash and if I 
                        don’t bring it back up I’m fucked.
                             (a beat)
                        Can I borrow some money?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Um, no, because now this is my 
                        boss’s dinner and if I’m not 
                        upstairs in two minutes I’m fucked.

           He reaches for the food but she grabs his hand, emotional:

                                 HARPER
                        Please.  Help me.  

           Charlie hesitates.  He recognizes the look of misery and 
           exhaustion in her eyes.  But--

                                 CHARLIE
                        Sorry.  

           Charlie gives the guy cash, takes the food and walks away.

                                 HARPER
                        There are two!  
                             (Charlie stops)
                        There are two dinners, one for me 
                        and one for her.  We can split it.    
                        You take one to your boss and I’ll 
                        take one to mine.
                             (before he can respond)
                        PLEASE.  This is DEF-CON 5.

           Charlie sighs.  Finally--

                                 CHARLIE
                        What are the meals?

           Harper squeals with relief, then dives into the bag.

                                 HARPER
                        I can take her the truffle mac and 
                        cheese and you can have the burger--

                                 CHARLIE
                        I’m not bringing him a plain 
                        hamburger, he’s a man of taste. 
           Harper opens the food containers, scooping some of the cheese 
           from the mac-and-cheese onto the burger.

                                 HARPER
                        Fine, look, now it’s a...truffle 
                        cheeseburger...
                             (putting some salad on it)
                        With kale.  This burger would win 
                        an award!  

           She takes the pickle but he snatches it out of her hand.

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        The pickle’s my dinner! 

                                 CHARLIE
                        I can’t give him a truffle 
                        cheeseburger without a pickle.

           Charlie grabs his food and they hurry to the elevators.  

                                 HARPER
                        Thank you so, so, so much.  I swear 
                        I’ll pay you back tomorrow! 

                                 CHARLIE
                        With interest.  80%.  Liquidity 
                        preference.

                                 HARPER
                        Are you serious?  Do I look like 
                        someone who can afford interest?  I 
                        steal my toilet paper from the 
                        office bathroom.

           Charlie shrugs as he steps onto his elevator.  Harper steps 
           onto the elevator across from him.

                                 CHARLIE
                        You should really keep cash on you.

                                 HARPER
                        You should really order dinner 
                        earlier.

                                 CHARLIE
                        The pickle isn’t for my boss, it’s 
                        for me.

           He takes a big bite as their doors close.  Harper gasps--

                                 HARPER
                        You’re a monster!
           INT. CHARLIE’S CAR - NIGHT

           Charlie races down the empty highway as he calls Suze.  

                                 CHARLIE (ON PHONE)
                        Don’t fall asleep.  I’m coming!  

           EXT. SUZE’S BUILDING - NIGHT

           Charlie’s old, dilapidated car screeches to a stop.  He tries 
           to get out so fast he gets stuck in his seat belt, then 
           manages to escape and sprints to the building’s INTERCOM, 
           buzzing over and over until--

                                 SUZE (O.S.)
                             (half-asleep)
                        Hello?

                                 CHARLIE
                        I’m here!  I’m here! 

                                 SUZE (O.S.)
                        It’s three a.m.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Do you still wanna watch a movie?

                                 SUZE (O.S.)
                        I’m in bed, Charlie.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Perfect!  I’ll get in with you!

                                 SUZE (O.S.)
                        I’m already asleep.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I could wake you up.  
                             (sing-songy)
                        With my penis.
                             (immediately)
                        Not with my penis, you’ll be awake 
                        before it touches you.  You know 
                        what I mean. 

                                 SUZE (O.S.)
                        I have an early meeting.  I’ll just 
                        call you tomorrow.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Okay, sure!  Whatever you want.  

           Charlie turns back to his car to see a creepy HOMELESS GUY 
           smiling at him.
                                 HOMELESS GUY
                        You could wake me up.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Nope, no thank you. 

                                 HOMELESS GUY
                             (sing-songy)
                        With your penis. 

           Charlie rushes away. 

           INT. CHARLIE & DUNCAN’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           A clean, stylish guy’s apartment.  DUNCAN, 26, a corn-fed 
           jock, does PULL-UPS in a doorway.  Charlie walks in.

                                 DUNCAN
                        Good morning!  Want some coffee?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Why are you awake?

                                 DUNCAN
                        I can’t wake up early and make my 
                        best friend breakfast to hear about 
                        his okay I need to tell you 
                        something.  I didn’t want to 
                        mention it until it was official, 
                        but...I bought a place.

                                 CHARLIE
                        What’s a place? 

                                 DUNCAN
                        I bought an apartment.

                                 CHARLIE
                             (a beat)
                        Bought it, like, you own it?

                                 DUNCAN
                        Yeah.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Who’s gonna live in it?

                                 DUNCAN
                        I am.

                                 CHARLIE
                        WHAT?!  That-- But-- We live here!
                                 DUNCAN
                        I know, but our lease is up in two 
                        months, and this was a great 
                        financial opportunity--

                                 CHARLIE
                        Financial opportunity?!  How much 
                        money do you have?  

                                 DUNCAN
                        You know I love living with you.  
                        But we’re 27--

                                 CHARLIE
                             (offended)
                        I’m 26!

                                 DUNCAN
                        And I’m ready for my own space.  To 
                        decorate, to bring guys home--

                                 CHARLIE
                        You can bring guys here!  I’m 
                        completely cool with it. 

                                 DUNCAN
                        You get a little weird.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I do not!

                                                                POP TO:

           INT. CHARLIE & DUNCAN’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Duncan flirts with a GUY on the couch.  Charlie glides into 
           the room with a platter of snacks and condoms.  He whispers--

                                 CHARLIE
                        I’m not here.

           He puts the platter on the coffee table, grins, and glides 
           back out of the room.

                                                         BACK TO SCENE:

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry I want my best friend to 
                        never go hungry and stay STD-free!

                                 DUNCAN
                        Honestly, your hours are so shitty, 
                        we’ll probably see each other more 
                        when we don’t live together.

           Charlie runs a hand through his hair, freaking out.
                                 CHARLIE
                        This is insane.  Buying apartments 
                        is for grown-ups.  I can’t even 
                        afford the HBO package!

                                 DUNCAN
                        I know.  That’s why I pay for the 
                        HBO package.

                                 CHARLIE
                             (quietly furious)
                        We’ve had HBO this whole time? 

           INT. HARPER & BECCA’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Harper, in sweatpants, sets her alarm for 5:45AM and settles 
           into the couch.  She pulls her computer on her lap and opens 
           a YouTube clip: Olympic runner Derek Redmond tearing his 
           hamstring mid-race and Derek’s father running down to help 
           his son limp across the finish line. 

           Harper tears up as she watches, mouthing along with the 
           announcer.  Just then BECCA (27, beautiful, wild) bursts in, 
           a little drunk, guided by her boyfriend, MIKE (30, sweet, put-
           together).  Becca sees Harper and jumps on her--

                                 BECCA
                        YOU’RE HOME!  How was your date?

                                 HARPER
                        Amazing!  He’s in my room drinking 
                        Gatorade to recover from our 
                        vigorous lovemaking.

                                 BECCA
                        Really?!

                                 HARPER
                        Of course not.  I worked too late 
                        and didn’t make it in time.

                                 MIKE
                        Aw man, again?

                                 HARPER
                        How was the party? 

                                 BECCA
                        Fine.  Gilbert was there.

                                 HARPER
                        He WAS?  Have you seen him since...

           She pantomimes something, trying to be secretive.
                                 MIKE
                        Since she had sex with him in the 
                        handicapped bathroom on the Acela?

                                 HARPER
                             (whipping around to Becca)
                        You told him that?!

                                 BECCA
                        I tell him everything.  And it 
                        wasn’t the Acela, it was the 
                        Northwest Regional, I’m not a 
                        maniac.

                                 MIKE
                        If we had to avoid every guy she 
                        ever had sex with on some sort of 
                        public transportation, we could 
                        never leave the apartment.

           Becca smacks him.  Mike gives her a cute smirk.

                                 MIKE (CONT’D)
                        I’m gonna fart.  Don’t come in your 
                        room for a minute.

                                 BECCA
                        You’re disgusting!

           He heads to her room.  She watches him go adoringly.

                                 BECCA (CONT’D)
                        Look at his little khakis.  Who 
                        wears khakis to a bar?! 

                                 HARPER
                        So many people.  Like everyone who 
                        ever went to private school.

                                 BECCA
                        How was your day?

                                 HARPER
                             (trying to be positive)
                        I only cried once!

                                 BECCA
                        If I ever see Kirsten on the street 
                        I’m gonna punch her in the throat.

                                 HARPER
                        You never will, because she’s 
                        always at the office, but I love 
                        the sentiment.

                                 BECCA
                        I love you!
           She kisses Harper and skips to her room.  Harper smiles sadly 
           and heads to her own room, when suddenly BECCA SCREAMS.  

           Harper whips around, grabs an UMBRELLA by the door and wields 
           it like a club as she races toward Becca’s room.

                                 HARPER
                        I KNEW IT!  No one wears khakis to 
                        a bar except Jeffrey Dahmer--

           INT. BECCA’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Harper kicks the door in, ready to take Mike out--

                                 HARPER
                        GET OFF OF HER YOU--

           She stops suddenly:  Mike’s on one knee, slipping an 
           engagement ring on Becca’s finger.  

                                 BECCA
                        I said no!  Just kidding I SAID 
                        YES! 

           Mike laughs.  Harper drops her umbrella, stunned.

                                 HARPER
                        We’re not old enough to get 
                        married.

                                 MIKE
                        What?

                                 HARPER
                        What?  Nothing!!  Oh my God, 
                        CONGRATULATIONS!!!

           She jumps on Becca, squealing.  Mike joins in on the hug.

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        Mike!!  MIKE!!!  I love you!

                                 MIKE
                        I love you too, Harper!

           Becca and Mike kiss.  Then they start really making out. 
           Harper tries to squeeze out of their group hug.

                                 HARPER
                             (ducking under Mike’s arm)
                        Oh-- uh-huh.  Get into it!  You 
                        guys keep doing that-- I’m gonna 
                        get outta here.  

           Mike throws Becca on the bed.  Her shirt’s already off.  
           Harper hurries out--
                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        Okay have so much fun!

           INT. HARPER’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Harper lies in bed, staring at the ceiling, unable to sleep.  
           Her alarm starts BEEPING:  time for work again.

           INT. “THE RUNDOWN” OFFICES - DAWN

           Harper walks into the dark office, hands full of bags and 
           coffees.  She clicks on the lights on the way to her desk.

           She drops the bags on her desk and sighs, a rare moment of 
           quiet, and goes to take a sip of coffee--

                                 KIRSTEN (O.S.)
                        I’ll need my own room!

           Harper jumps and turns to see Kirsten marching in.

                                 HARPER
                        Kirsten!  You’re here so early--

                                 KIRSTEN 
                        Helen met some fat bank manager 
                        last week and she’s dragging him to 
                        Jane’s wedding so make sure they 
                        know I’ll need my own room.  
                             (then, pleasantly)
                        Also, what are they paying you?

                                 HARPER
                        Who?

                                 KIRSTEN
                        ESPN.  To sabotage my site from the 
                        inside.  Whatever it is, you 
                        deserve a raise, because the 
                        writing samples you sent me last 
                        night had no attachment.

                                 HARPER
                        They did, I’m sure they did--

           She frantically clicks through her email, but Kirsten just 
           storms in her office.  Then she storms back out--

                                 KIRSTEN
                        Do you think she knows how 
                        desperate it looks?  To bring the 
                        first man she matched with on some 
                        $8/month dating site to a 
                        destination wedding?  I mean, I 
                        feel bad for her.

                        Sharing a room with some hairy 
                        stranger instead of actually 
                        getting to relax and enjoy the 
                        hotel.  

                                 HARPER
                        Totally.

                                 KIRSTEN
                        I just think it’s really 
                        transparent.  What she’s doing.  
                        And embarrassing.  

           Kirsten dives into the bag of food and pulls out a bagel.

                                 KIRSTEN (CONT’D)
                        Is this flaccid?

                                 HARPER
                        I was just about to toast it--

           Harper grabs the bagel and hurries to the kitchen as fast as 
           she can, her shitty day already starting.

           INT. MCKELVY CAPITAL OFFICE - DAY

           Charlie scrolls through Suze’s Instagram at his desk when--

                                 RICK (O.S.)
                        CHARLIE!

           INT. RICK’S OFFICE - DAY

           Charlie hurries inside.  Rick’s sitting back in his chair, a 
           disconcertingly wide smile on his face.  

                                 RICK
                        Apparently Jason Fox Investments 
                        had breakfast with the Chef-Me guys 
                        at the City Club this morning 
                        before he made a $500,000 angel 
                        investment.

                                 CHARLIE
                        That’s-- good, right?  Because we 
                        hate him, and he’s wasting his 
                        money on a bad idea--

                                 RICK
                        It was my bad idea.  Mine.  They 
                        came to me, they were hard for my 
                        money, and now he’s turning my shit 
                        into gold?  Only I turn my shit 
                        into gold!  Get out!
           Charlie hurries away.

           INT. MCKELVY CAPITAL OFFICE - LATER

           Charlie keeps scrolling through Suze’s Instagram feed -- Suze 
           in a bikini, Suze pretending she just woke up, Suze giving 
           duck face.  Charlie frowns longingly.  He looks up and 
           notices a meek INTERN (20) heading for the door--

                                 CHARLIE
                        Intern!

                                 INTERN
                        My name is Bo.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        I don’t give a shit.

                                 INTERN
                        It’s just, it has fewer syllables 
                        than “intern.”

                                 CHARLIE
                        I’m gonna get Rick’s lunch and 
                        you’re gonna cover his phones.

                                 INTERN
                             (terrified)
                        What?  How?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Don’t pee, don’t zone out, don’t 
                        sneeze, just put his calls through 
                        and try not to exist.  And do not, 
                        EVER, connect his ex-wife.

                                 INTERN
                        Do I tell him if she calls?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yeah, and then you slather my dick 
                        in ink and use it to write the 
                        hieroglyphic for “no.”

           The Intern just stares at him, confused.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        That-- no.  Don’t tell him.

           INT. BY THE ELEVATORS - CONTINUOUS

           Charlie’s on the phone, happily jabbing the elevator button.

                                 CHARLIE (ON PHONE)
                        Baby!  I have 30 minutes, let’s--  
           BANG!  There’s a huge crash behind him.  He turns, concerned.

           INT. MCKELVY CAPITAL OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Charlie runs back in to see Rick trying to tear apart his 
           office.  He’s not strong enough to really break anything so 
           he ends up kind of just throwing paper and pens everywhere.  
           The rest of the office watches, scared.  Charlie races over--

                                 CHARLIE
                        What happened?!

                                 INTERN
                             (two octaves too high)
                        I think he’s upset about the 
                        invitation?

           The Intern hands Charlie a wedding invitation: Kiki McKelvy & 
           Michael Posada.  Charlie looks up, horrified--

                                 CHARLIE
                        No.  No.  This is his ex-wife-- you 
                        showed him this?!  She’s getting 
                        married in their old house and you 
                        showed him?!

                                 INTERN TWO
                        You didn’t say anything about his 
                        mail!

           CRASH.  Rick tries to throw his chair out the window but it 
           bounces back and hits him.

                                 RICK
                        What is this, BULLET-PROOF GLASS?!

           He storms out of his office--

                                 RICK (CONT’D)
                        Where is that pencil dick?

                                 INTERN
                             (raising his hand)
                        I feel like I’m pencil dick.

                                 RICK
                        You’re fired.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        Rick, he’s a hard worker--

                                 RICK
                        ALL THE INTERNS ARE FIRED.
                                 CHARLIE
                        What?!  Fire this idiot, but the 
                        others aren’t even in today--

                                 RICK
                        I’m going to Delfine’s.

           Rick marches out of the office.  The Intern dumps a TOWER OF 
           FILES on to Charlie’s desk, sadly.

                                 INTERN
                        I’m very average-sized.  I just 
                        want that to be clear....

           The Intern slumps out of the office as Charlie stares at the 
           pile, his workload tripled, and puts his head on his hands.  

           EXT. BUILDING - NIGHT

           TIME LAPSE as most people flow out of the office and into 
           their cars, driving off.  Only two lights are still on.

           INT. “THE RUNDOWN” OFFICES - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Harper slowly types out a sentence on her computer.  She 
           looks up when Kirsten walks a WRITER to the door of her 
           office as their meeting ends. Kirsten speaks warmly--

                                 KIRSTEN
                        You’re talented.  Stop trying to 
                        convince us.  Cut every adjective 
                        and send it back to me and we’ll 
                        see what we really need.

                                 WRITER
                        Totally.  Thank you so much, 
                        Kirsten.  This is so helpful.

           They hug.  Harper watches, incredulous.  The Writer starts to 
           leave, stopping at Harper’s desk to lean over and whisper--

                                 WRITER (CONT’D)
                        Kirsten is amazing.  You’re so 
                        lucky to work for such a nice 
                        person! 

           Harper forces a smile and nod as her eyes go black.  Kirsten 
           calls out to Harper as the Writer leaves--

                                 KIRSTEN
                        I’m taking a nap.  Wake me up at 
                        midnight.
           She closes the door before Harper can respond.  Harper turns 
           back to her computer, noticing POST-IT on her desk:  “Pay 
           back pickle thief.”

           Harper glances at her computer, the half-written article 
           staring her in the face, then snatches the post-it.

           INT. MCKELVY CAPITAL OFFICE - NIGHT

           As usual, the office is dark and quiet except for the lamp on 
           Charlie’s desk, where he’s filing the pile of paperwork the 
           Intern left for him.  Harper walks up, handing him $20--

                                 HARPER
                        Here you go.

                                 CHARLIE
                             (jumps, startled)
                        Holy shit, Pickles.  What are you 
                        still doing here?  Are you like, a 
                        janitor, or something?

                                 HARPER
                        What?  No!  I work for Kirsten 
                        Jones, the sports writer.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        But why are you here?

                                 HARPER
                        I can’t leave ‘til she leaves, and 
                        she never leaves.  I’m always the 
                        last one here.

                                 CHARLIE
                        No, I’m always the last one here.  

                                 HARPER
                        Kirsten keeps a cot in her office.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Rick keeps a cot in his office.  
                        It’s a tempurpedic.  It’s like the 
                        Tesla of cots.  He also drives a 
                        Tesla.  He’s like the Tesla of 
                        humans.

                                 HARPER
                        Kirsten’s like if Miss Piggy and 
                        Voldemort had a baby, and that baby 
                        had low blood sugar and also hadn’t 
                        had sex in a year. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Ew, a baby shouldn’t ever have sex.  
                        And Rick is worse.

                        I check off every day like a 
                        prisoner at Alcatraz.

                                 HARPER
                        How many?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Days?  604.  But it’ll all be worth 
                        it.

           He takes something out of his wallet: a torn-out magazine ad 
           of Suze laughing as she opens a TAMPON.  Charlie hands it to 
           Harper, as he turns back to his work.  

                                 HARPER
                        Why do you keep a tampon ad in your 
                        wallet?

                                 CHARLIE
                             (super proud)
                        That’s my girlfriend.  

                                 HARPER
                        Oh.  Sure.  She lives in Canada?  
                        And can never video chat?

                                 CHARLIE
                             (snatching it back)
                        She’s very real, and she’s hotter 
                        in person.

           Charlie reaches into his trash can and pulls out a brand new 
           bottle of Scotch with a big red BOW wrapped around it.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        And while she’s out there being 
                        lusted after by every non-asexual 
                        in Los Angeles, I will do the work 
                        of three unpaid sophomores drinking 
                        the liquor Rick throws away because 
                        it cost less than $200.
                             (opens it, then)
                        You want a glass?  

                                 HARPER
                        We’re at work.

                                 CHARLIE
                        It’s after midnight.

                                 HARPER
                        It’s been so long, I have the 
                        tolerance of a fetus.

           She smells it and recoils.  CUT TO....
           LATER.  Harper pours herself another glass.  She’s really 
           feeling it, splayed across a rolling chair.  Charlie sits 
           with his feet on his desk, still reading his paperwork.  

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        I miss everything.  I haven’t been 
                        to a party or made out with a guy 
                        in so long I’ve forgotten how to do 
                        it.  My tongue has atrophied.

                                 CHARLIE
                             (totally not listening)
                        Suze is always just out in the 
                        world, being looked at by guys with 
                        more time and more money.

                                 HARPER
                        When my mom was my age, she had me.  
                        I’ve never even had a boyfriend.

                                 CHARLIE
                        But you’re like, a grown-up.

                                 HARPER
                        TAKE THAT BACK.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Not even at camp?

                                 HARPER
                        I’ve dated guys, I’ve just never 
                        had an in-love, real...thing. 
                             (then, intense)
                        I am so happy for Becca.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        Who’s Becca?

                                 HARPER
                        I don’t want it to seem like I’m 
                        not happy for her.  Mike is perfect 
                        and she should be engaged because 
                        she’s experienced everything.  
                        She’s seen it all and done it all 
                        and done all of them. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Seriously who is Becca?

           Harper sits up, the whiskey hitting her.

                                 HARPER
                        I’ve never had sex on a plane.  
                        I’ve never even had sex outside!  I 
                        don’t get to go outside!  Do you 
                        have any idea how long it takes to 
                        show a man my boobs?  
                                 CHARLIE
                        .... No.

                                 HARPER
                        A long time.  I don’t even have 
                        time to blow dry my hair--

                                 CHARLIE
                        You should do that.

                                 HARPER
                        Let alone go on dates.  And given 
                        my average date-to-sex ratio, if I 
                        want to sleep with as many guys as 
                        Becca did, I’ll get married when 
                        I’m seven-hundred-and-forty-DEAD.  

           She tries to chug her whiskey, but hacks and coughs as soon 
           as it touches her lips.  Through her coughs--

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        I’m gonna be the maid of honor and 
                        I’m not gonna be able to go to her 
                        engagement party, her bachelorette 
                        party, I’ll be lucky if I get to 
                        her WEDDING!  I’m gonna end up like 
                        Kirsten.  Buying thousand-dollar 
                        throw blankets and sleeping with my 
                        laptop every night.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        That’s why she’s so mean.  She’s 
                        sleeping with a laptop.  She needs 
                        to get laid. 

                                 HARPER
                        She needs to be made love to.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Rick needs to get laid.  
                             (thinking, then)
                        Is it still illegal to hire a 
                        prostitute if it’s for someone 
                        else?

                                 HARPER
                        They’re always in this stupid 
                        building, let’s just lock them in a 
                        room and they can have sex with 
                        each other. 

           Charlie laughs.  But Harper’s thinking.

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        I’m serious.  We could Cyrano them 
                        out of the office.  And when 
                        they’re banging, we’re free.
           Charlie drinks another sip of whiskey, sighing--

                                 CHARLIE
                        I don’t need to be free. I just 
                        need to get promoted before my 
                        birthday.  I already made a 
                        reservation at Delfine’s and I’m 
                        not gonna sit there with Suze and 
                        still be an assistant.  I refuse to 
                        be an assistant at 28.  That’s the 
                        age it gets sad, you know?

                                 HARPER
                        I’m 28.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Oh.  I’m sorry.
                             (then)
                        For you.  That’s sad for you.

           Harper smirks at him and kicks off Charlie’s desk, sailing 
           away in the wheelie chair.  As she rolls away:

                                 HARPER
                        Byyyyyyye!

                                 CHARLIE
                             (calling after her)
                        That’s my chair!

           INT. HARPER & BECCA’S APARTMENT - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Harper lays in bed, staring at the ceiling, thinking hard.  
           Muffled whispers and laughs come from Becca’s room.  A beat, 
           then Harper jumps out of bed and grabs her computer.

           INT. MCKELVY CAPITAL OFFICE - DAY

           Charlie clicks through Suze’s Facebook page as Rick works in 
           the office behind him.  Harper tiptoes in with her laptop--

                                 HARPER
                        Hey.

           Charlie jumps out of his seat again--

                                 CHARLIE
                        Oh my GOD!  Why are you so quiet?! 
                        You move like a Prius. 

                                 HARPER
                        I made something.

           She hands him her laptop, open to a HUGE SPREADSHEET.
                                 CHARLIE
                        What is this?

                                 HARPER
                             (”obviously”)
                        It’s a Google doc of Kirsten’s 
                        likes, dislikes, past relationships--
                             (off his blank look)
                        To set them up.  For our Cyrano.

                                 CHARLIE
                        That was a joke.

                                 HARPER
                        But it doesn’t have to be!  What’s 
                        Rick’s favorite food?

                                 CHARLIE
                        The filet from Delfine’s.

                                 HARPER
                        Where will he be at 3pm tomorrow?

                                 CHARLIE
                        At the Mandarin for a meeting with 
                        the guys from JP Morgan.

                                 HARPER
                        What does he hate more than 
                        anything?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Bryant Gumbel and sour cream.

                                 HARPER
                        We know everything about them -- 
                        what they like, what they hate.  We 
                        control their entire schedule.  
                        We’re the men behind the curtain. 

           Charlie stands, gathering his stuff--

                                 CHARLIE
                        That’s insane.  I barely have time 
                        to do my actual job and keep my 
                        girlfriend.  I can’t do this, too.

                                 HARPER
                        But this could save us! 

                                 CHARLIE
                        I gotta go.

           He runs past her out the door.  She watches him go, deflated.
           INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - DAY

           A bright, colorful auditorium set up for a play.  EXCITED 
           PARENTS mill about, taking seats.  Suze, dressed for a 
           nightclub, walks in, confused.  Every DAD in the audience 
           notices her immediately.

                                 CHARLIE (O.S.)
                        Suze!!

           Charlie waves happily from the front row, where he’s reserved 
           the four center seats with his blazer.  Suze walks over and 
           Charlie goes to kiss her but she gives him her cheek so he 
           just kisses her cheek really sexually.

                                 SUZE
                        I thought we were getting lunch.

                                 SWEET MOTHER
                        Excuse me, are--

                                 CHARLIE
                        They’re all taken, yes.
                             (turning back to Suze)
                        I brought lunch to us!  Two kale 
                        chicken caesar salads and a soy 
                        latte for some mid-afternoon 
                        theater.  You look so hot.  How was 
                        your meeting?

                                 SUZE
                        It was good.  I booked that Old 
                        Navy print campaign.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Are you kidding?!  Baby!  That’s 
                        incredible!  

                                 SUZE
                        Look, Charlie--

           A GLARING MOM tries to take one of the seats--

                                 CHARLIE
                        This seat is saved, he’ll be here 
                        any minute, thank you. 

                                 SUZE
                        It’s shooting in New York, and I’m 
                        gonna be traveling so much, and 
                        you’re already so busy--

           Charlie can feel where this is going and his voice goes high--

                                 CHARLIE
                        I’m not that busy.
                                 SUZE
                        I barely see you as it is.  I don’t 
                        want to eat a to-go salad at some 
                        weird school.  I want to be wooed.  
                        Maybe our schedules are too much to 
                        keep dating. 

                                 CHARLIE
                             (too loud)
                        NO!

           Everybody jumps.  Charlie clears his throat, then, calmer--

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        What I mean is that’s silly.  
                        Things are going so well, we’re 
                        having fun--

           An ANGRY MOM tries to move Charlie’s blazer and take a seat.  
           He stops her, intense--

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        I’d lay my life down for these 
                        seats and if you can’t say the same 
                        I’d MOVE ON!
                             (back to Suze)
                        We can totally make this work.  My 
                        schedule’s about to get so much 
                        easier.  

                                 SUZE
                        It is?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yes!  I can be around whenever 
                        you’re home.  I’m gonna take care 
                        of you.  You’re a print model!  
                        This is gonna be fine.  I promise. 

           The lights go down.  Charlie’s PHONE BEEPS with a text and 
           all the parents glare at him.  It’s from Rick: “Not coming, 
           get back now.”  Charlie jumps up and takes Suze’s hand, 
           crouching and crawling over the other parents in the row--

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                             (whispering)
                        Excuse me.  Excuse me.

           The ANGRY MOM re-crosses her legs and knees him in the balls.  
           Charlie groans and folds over.

           INT. “THE RUNDOWN” OFFICES - DAY

           Charlie limps in and makes a beeline for Harper.  She looks 
           up and sees him coming--
                                 CHARLIE
                        I’m in.
                             (off her confusion)
                        When they’re boning, we’re free, 
                        right?  

           Harper smiles, getting it--

                                 HARPER
                        When they’re boning, we’re free.

           She does a weird hand motion like birds flying away.

                                 CHARLIE
                        What was that?

                                 HARPER
                        It was supposed to be birds being 
                        free, don’t worry about it.
                             (then, intense)
                        Let’s do this.

           EXT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

           Harper and Charlie walk out of a coffee shop, each balancing 
           a tray of drinks.  They power-walk back to their office, 
           darting in and out of the sidewalk crowd.

                                 CHARLIE
                        He’s usually at the City Club.

                                 HARPER
                        Could she run into him there?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Oh, yeah, sure.  She’ll just “run 
                        into” him.  After she’s been 
                        nominated by two current members 
                        and one former member and then get 
                        approved by the board, and then 
                        also had a sex change because 
                        technically women are allowed--

                                 HARPER
                        I get it.

                                 CHARLIE
                             (thinking)
                        All Rick cares about is winning.  
                        Literally.  We just need to make 
                        your boss seem like a business deal 
                        or a softball game.

                                 HARPER 
                        All Kirsten cares about is the 
                        website.  It’s her baby.  
                                 CHARLIE 
                        Because she doesn’t have a real 
                        baby? 

                                 HARPER 
                        How DARE you.  But yes I do think 
                        that’s a huge part of it.
                             (then)
                        We need a meet cute. Every great 
                        romance has a meet cute.  Like, 
                        how’d your grandparents meet?

                                 CHARLIE
                        My grandmother was running to catch 
                        a train, and a man put his foot out 
                        to keep the door open, but the door 
                        broke his foot and she took him to 
                        the hospital.

                                 HARPER
                             (emotional)
                        Oh my God.

                                 CHARLIE
                        And at the hospital he got a staph 
                        infection and died and my 
                        grandmother married the doctor who 
                        treated him.

                                 HARPER
                             (”what the fuck”)
                        Oh my God.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Pop Pop....  I miss him. 

                                 HARPER
                        How do people even meet now?  How’d 
                        you meet your tampon lady?  

                                 CHARLIE
                        If you mean Suze, my girlfriend, I 
                        was like Babe Ruth.

                                 HARPER
                        .... Fat?  

                                 CHARLIE
                        She was on a date, with like, an 
                        MMA fighter, but I saw her across 
                        the bar and pointed at her and said 
                        “she’s gonna be my girlfriend.”  So 
                        I waited until he went to take a 
                        dump and then I walked over, super 
                        cool, and I bought her every single 
                        drink on the menu and said, 
                             (super dramatic)
                        “Take your pick.”
                                 HARPER
                        That worked?!

                                 CHARLIE
                        Of course it did.  And then I wore 
                        her down over weeks of texts and 
                        flowers and chocolates and concert 
                        tickets and shopping trips.

                                 HARPER
                        That’s insane.  

                                 CHARLIE
                             (shrugs, sweetly)
                        She was the most beautiful girl I’d 
                        ever seen in my entire life.  

           He says it so nicely it stops Harper a little.  She gets to 
           the crosswalk and jabs at the button--

                                 HARPER
                        We need a classic.  Getting-stuck-
                        in-an-elevator or something.  
                        What’s our getting stuck in an 
                        elevator?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Why don’t we just get them stuck in 
                        an elevator?  

                                 HARPER
                        Because how would we do that. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Oh, you don’t know Creepy Tim?

           The walk signal turns and he starts off as we CUT TO....

           INT. BUILDING MAINTENANCE ROOM - DAY

           CREEPY TIM, super high and very pale, sits in the bowels of 
           the building.  Harper looks around, concerned, as Charlie 
           hands Tim a plant.  

                                 CREEPY TIM
                        My succulent! 

                                 HARPER
                        Can you grow plants down here?

                                 CREEPY TIM
                             (pleasantly)
                        Oh no, they just slowly die.

           Harper gives Charlie a freaked-out look.
                                 CHARLIE
                        So buddy, we wanted to shut down an 
                        elevator for a few minutes so two 
                        people can fall in love.

                                 CREEPY TIM
                        The only thing I love more than 
                        love is love in enclosed spaces.  
                        And succulents.  But you already 
                        gave me one of those.  Let’s do 
                        this.

           INT. MCKELVY CAPITAL OFFICE - DAY

           Rick walks towards the elevator, staring at his phone.  He 
           presses the button.    

           INT. “THE RUNDOWN” OFFICES - DAY

           Kristin walks towards the elevator, staring at her phone.  

           INT. BUILDING MAINTENANCE ROOM - DAY

           Harper skids into the room, where Charlie and Tim are 
           watching the SECURITY MONITORS.  

                                 HARPER
                        She’s on the move.  She’s headed to 
                        the nest.

                                 CHARLIE
                        You’re not the secret service, you 
                        can say elevator.   

           INT. “THE RUNDOWN” OFFICES - DAY

           Kirsten is about to press the elevator button, then stops.

           INT. BUILDING MAINTENANCE ROOM - DAY

           Harper watches Kirsten root through her purse on the monitor.

                                 HARPER
                        No no no, she’s looking for her 
                        glasses.
                             (yelling at the monitor)
                        They’re in the zipper pouch of your 
                        bag, you beautiful idiot!

                                 CHARLIE
                             (to Tim)
                        Just stop it at her floor! 
           INT. “THE RUNDOWN” OFFICES - DAY

           Kirsten turns around to go back to her office when -- DING!  
           The elevator doors open.  That’s weird.  Just then she finds 
           her glasses, and turns around to get on the elevator.

           INT. ELEVATOR - DAY

           Kirsten gives Rick a polite smile.  He doesn’t respond.  She 
           drops her smile, annoyed.  They both go back to their phones.  

           INT. BUILDING MAINTENANCE ROOM - DAY [INTERCUT]

           Harper and Charlie watch the monitors.

                                 HARPER
                        Does no one look each other in the 
                        eye anymore?!  I hate technology! 

           The doors are about to close when a UPS GUY slips in, 
           carrying a big package. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Whoa whoa whoa?  Who’s this? 

                                 HARPER
                        Get out!  GET OUT, SIR!

           But the doors slide closed.  Kirsten and Rick stare at their 
           phones as the UPS Guy stares straight ahead.

                                 CREEPY TIM
                        Are you thinking what I’m thinking?  

                      HARPER/CHARLIE
                                                       CREEPY TIM
           Abort mission./Call it off.
                                              IT’S GO TIME.  

           Creepy Tim hits the button and the elevator STOPS.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        What the fuck?!  

                                 CREEPY TIM
                        Wait, what did you guys say?

           In the elevator, Rick, Kirsten and the UPS Guy jolt as it 
           stops.  They look around, startled.

                                 UPS GUY
                        Oh my God.  Oh my God.  No.

           In the Maintenance Room, Harper turns to Creepy Tim--
                                 HARPER
                        Start it.  Start it back up.

           Creepy Tim hits a button and the elevator GROANS to a start.  
           On the monitor the UPS Guy breathes out, relieved.

                                 UPS GUY (ON MONITOR)
                        Oh thank God.  I’m really 
                        claustrophobic.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Let it go.  Let it go, Rick.

                                 RICK (ON MONITOR)
                        You work in a truck.  Your job is 
                        to take elevators.  How can you be 
                        claustrophobic?  

                                 UPS GUY (ON MONITOR)
                        Usually I take the stairs.  Today 
                        was a really big day for me.  

           Kirsten shoots Rick a look--

                                 KIRSTEN (ON MONITOR)
                        Okay, let’s not make this any 
                        worse.  

           Suddenly the elevator STOPS AGAIN.  Rick, Kirsten and the UPS 
           guy stumble again.  Creepy Tim pounds on the keys. 

                                 HARPER
                        Why did you stop it?!

                                 CREEPY TIM
                        This wasn’t me.  This I think might 
                        be an actual system malfunction. 

           In the elevator, the UPS Guy starts hyperventilating and 
           feeling the walls.

                                 UPS GUY
                        Yep.  This is how my nightmares 
                        start.  Here we go.  We all need to 
                        just CALM DOWN!! 

           He starts to take his clothes off.  Like all of them. 

                                 KIRSTEN
                        What are you doing? 

                                 HARPER
                        What is he doing? 

                                 RICK
                        Stop.  Stop that right now.
                                 UPS GUY
                        I need to be free of this!

           The UPS Guy shimmies out of the last of his clothes.  Kirsten 
           goes for the emergency phone as Rick takes out his cell.

                                 KIRSTEN
                        I’m calling 911.

                                 RICK
                        Don’t, I’m calling on my cell.

                                 KIRSTEN
                        This phone is specifically designed 
                        for this exact emergency.  

                                 RICK
                        Exactly.  We want actual emergency 
                        response team, not the assholes 
                        assigned to elevator squad.

           The UPS Guy is tying his discarded clothing together--

                                 UPS GUY
                        Maybe we could make a rope....

                                 KIRSTEN
                        You won’t get service and this 
                        phone’s already ringing.

           Rick reaches over and hangs up the emergency phone.

                                 KIRSTEN (CONT’D)
                        Excuse me!

                                 RICK
                        If we both call it in it might 
                        confuse the system.

           The UPS Guy starts opening his package--

                                 UPS GUY
                        I have to pee.  I’m gonna pee.

                                 RICK
                        If you pee I will end your life.

                                 KIRSTEN
                        This is STRESS PEE, stressing him 
                        out more won’t help! 

                                 RICK
                        I get men to do what I want for a 
                        living, I know what I’m doing.
                                 KIRSTEN
                        Well I write about men full of shit 
                        for a living--

                                 UPS GUY
                        I gotta listen to my body!

           He pulls a cooper pot out of the package--

                                 RICK
                        DO NOT PEE IN THAT.

           He starts peeing in the pot.  Kirsten closes her eyes.  The 
           pee echoes so, so, so loudly.  Just then, the elevator STARTS 
           AGAIN.  The UPS Guy just keeps peeing.  

           INT. LOBBY - DAY

           The elevator opens and Rick and Kirsten storm out, pissed.  A 
           MAN starts to get on, then sees the naked UPS Guy, scattered 
           clothes, pot full of pee.  UPS Guy gives an awkward wave.

                                 UPS GUY
                        Hello.

           INT. BUILDING MAINTENANCE ROOM - DAY

           Charlie and Harper just stare at the monitors.

                                 CREEPY TIM
                        I’m not great at reading rooms, 
                        how’d that go?

                                 HARPER
                        It was okay, Creepy Tim.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Are you kidding me?  That was a 
                        disaster.  They hate each other!  

                                 HARPER
                        Hate is good.  Hate we can work 
                        with. 

           INT. KIRSTEN’S OFFICE - LATER THAT DAY

           Harper goes over her notes from the doorway--

                                 HARPER
                        I proofread the Jackson article and 
                        found a few typos.
                             (very casually)
                                 (MORE)
                                 HARPER (CONT'D)
                        And apparently some guy you were in 
                        an elevator with today asked 
                        security for your contact info?

           Kirsten stops typing, concerned.

                                 KIRSTEN
                        A delivery man?

                                 HARPER
                        No!  No.  Some bigshot who works in 
                        the building.  I guess he has a 
                        crush on you, or something.  But 
                        don’t worry, I told them we don’t 
                        give out your number.
                             (then)
                        Okay, I’ll send these e-mails! 

           Harper turns and walks out.  Behind her, Kirsten smiles.

           INT. MCKELVY CAPITAL OFFICE - DAY

           Rick comes back into his office.  Charlie looks up nervously.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I heard you got stuck in an 
                        elevator with Jason Fox’s 
                        girlfriend.

                                 RICK
                        Jason Fox from Fox Capital?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yeah.  Maybe he’s just trying to 
                        date her, I can never remember.  Do 
                        you want your third juice?

           Rick walks into his office, thinking.  Charlie watches him 
           go, then calls Harper.

                                 CHARLIE (ON PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        Okay, I said it.  What now?

                                 HARPER (O.S.)
                        Does Rick have good Dodgers 
                        tickets?

                                 CHARLIE (ON PHONE)
                        No, he watches from the nosebleeds 
                        like a common hoodlum.  Of course 
                        he has home plate seats.  What does 
                        that have to do with anything?

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. DODGER STADIUM - SUNSET

           The sun sets behind Dodgers Stadium as fans buzz around 
           excitedly -- peanuts, beer, hot dogs, baseball!

           Charlie waits outside the stadium, in a full suit.  He checks 
           his watch, annoyed.   Harper races up to him in a Dodgers 
           jersey, hat, wearing a foam finger.

                                 HARPER
                        Sorry sorry sorry.  I got here so 
                        early that I thought I had time to 
                        dick around so I went to the gift 
                        shop and I tried on like seventeen 
                        things but then I lost track of 
                        time and suddenly I was late.

                                 CHARLIE
                        That’s the dumbest thing I’ve ever 
                        heard.  That’s not a real thing.

                                 HARPER
                        Yes it is.  It’s the dick-around 
                        thing.  It’s very common.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Did you cancel on whoever she was 
                        supposed to be going with?

                                 HARPER
                        I never even called him in the 
                        first place.

           She high-fives herself with the foam finger, then notices--

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        What are you wearing?

                                 CHARLIE
                        A suit.  I’m not on the team, why 
                        would I wear the jersey?  I don’t 
                        wear scrubs to the doctors office.  

           Harper rolls her eyes and drags him inside.

           INT. DODGERS STADIUM - EVENING

           Harper leads Charlie around the stadium, looking for 
           something.  She finally spots it--

                                 HARPER
                        Bobby!

           BOBBY, a huge COSTUMED MASCOT that looks like an oversized 
           BOBBLE-HEAD turns, sees Harper, and waves.  Charlie jumps.
                                 CHARLIE
                        OhmyGod--

                                 BOBBY THE MASCOT
                        Harper! 

           Bobby bounds over and leans down to hug Harper.  She squeezes 
           him around his waist.  Charlie backs up, uncomfortable.  When 
           Bobby talks it’s MUFFLED through his costume head:

                                 BOBBY THE MASCOT (CONT’D)
                        Why didn’t you tell me you were 
                        coming?

                                 HARPER
                        I didn’t know until tonight!

           Charlie reaches up to try and take off Bobby’s costume head.  
           Bobby swats his hand away.

                                 BOBBY THE MASCOT
                        Dude.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I need to see it without a head or 
                        I’m gonna have nightmares.

           Harper gives him a weird look, then turns to Bobby--

                                 HARPER
                        I have a favor to ask.

           She hands Bobby a piece of paper.  He tries to take it with 
           his huge foam costume hands, but he can’t.  Harper shoves it 
           in his mouth hole.

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        We need them to make out.

           Bobby does an elaborate dance that ends in a nod.  Harper and 
           Charlie watch, confused--

                                 BOBBY THE MASCOT
                        That’s my Yes Dance!  I’ll give 
                        this to the jumbotron guy.

                                 HARPER
                        Thank you!!

           She jumps up and hugs him.  Charlie pretends to hug him, then 
           reaches around to try and take off the head again.  Bobby 
           swats at Charlie’s hands--

                                 BOBBY THE MASCOT
                        DUDE!!
           INT. NOSEBLEEDS SEATS - DODGER STADIUM - EVENING

           In the highest, farthest-away row, Harper and Charlie step 
           over people in their row on the way to get to their seats.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I need to see the human inside, 
                        otherwise it’s just a nightmare 
                        come to life!

           The game’s just started.  Harper takes out some BINOCULARS 
           and Charlie eats popcorn.  She sees Rick sitting behind home 
           plate, yelling at someone on his phone. 

                                 HARPER
                        Rick’s here! 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Kirsten better get here soon.  Once 
                        he realizes his meeting isn’t 
                        coming he’ll go.

           Harper settles back into her seat, and starts swiping through 
           Tinder on her phone.  Charlie looks over.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Ahh, online dating.  I remember 
                        that old wily beast.  Desperately 
                        searching for the nearest available 
                        genitals.  Can you match with 
                        someone in the section where they 
                        give out free hot dogs?
                             (she ignores him)
                        Want me to take your photo here?  
                        Guys love girls who like sports.

                                 HARPER
                        HA!  
                             (off his look)
                        Wait, are you serious?

                                 CHARLIE
                        They do.

                                 HARPER
                        That’s one of the world’s great 
                        myths.  Guys think they like girls 
                        who like sports.  What they 
                        actually like is a girl in a very 
                        tight sports jersey serving them 
                        wings and getting the terminology 
                        wrong.  They like girls who like 
                        guys who like sports.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        That’s not true.  Think of every 
                        beer commercial.
                                 HARPER
                        Exactly.  No guy actually wants to 
                        talk to a girl about offensive line 
                        coaches or batting averages.  They 
                        want a girl to blow them while 
                        they’re watching the Super Bowl.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        Sure, that too.  Suze loves sports.

                                 HARPER
                        No she doesn’t.  You can’t love 
                        sports until you’ve gotten 
                        goosebumps watching Jesse Owens on 
                        the medal podium.  Or Doug Flutie’s 
                        Hail Mary.  Abby Wambach scoring in 
                        the 122nd minute at the women’s 
                        world cup.  
                             (getting emotional)
                        Al Michael’s voice breaking as he 
                        asked if we believed in miracles--

           She tries to keep talking but she just ends up mouthing the 
           words so she doesn’t really cry.  Charlie laughs, eyes wide--

                                 CHARLIE
                        What is happening?!

           Harper takes a deep breath and gets control of herself.

                                 HARPER
                        I’m just saying Suze doesn’t get 
                        sports.   Sports are about the 
                        human spirit, the joy in seeing 
                        people do incredible things.  The 
                        way that SHE’S HERE!

           Harper whips up her binoculars -- behind home plate, Kirsten 
           stares at her phone, walking toward her seat.  

           INT. HOME PLATE SEATS - DODGERS STADIUM - NIGHT [INTERCUT]

           Kirsten gets to her seat, just a few away from Rick.  Rick 
           sees her and does a double-take.  

                                 RICK
                        Hello.

           Kirsten looks up, then recognizes Rick, surprised.

                                 KIRSTEN
                        Oh.  Hi.

                                 RICK
                        This is an odd coincidence.
           Kirsten blushes, nervous.  She tries to joke--

                                 KIRSTEN
                        Hope you took the stairs.

                                 RICK
                        I did.  We both did.  To get down 
                        here.

                                 KIRSTEN
                             (so bad at this)
                        That’s-- lucky...for us.  ‘Cause no 
                        one peed.

           A long awkward beat.

                                 RICK
                        Are you here with anyone?

                                 KIRSTEN
                        I’m supposed to meet with a 
                        colleague, but I guess he’s not 
                        here yet.  

                                 RICK
                        Meeting an investor.  He must be 
                        stuck in traffic.

           Kirsten nods.  They sit in silence.  Up in the nosebleeds, 
           Charlie watches with the binoculars, freaking out--

                                 CHARLIE
                        Why aren’t they talking?  
                             (Harper doesn’t respond)
                        Why aren’t they talking?
                             (she doesn’t respond)
                        Why aren’t they saying anything?!  
                        This is a disaster--

                                 HARPER
                        Shut up!  Silence is only bad when 
                        you’re worried you actually don’t 
                        have anything to say anymore.  This 
                        is just new silence.  

           Down at the good seats, Kirsten and Rick sit in silence.  The 
           batter SWINGS and misses, striking out.  They both groan--

                          KIRSTEN
                                                          RICK
           Oh, come on!  You know his 
           slider drops like that!  Do 
           you research!
                                              You’re paid at the elite 
                                              level, give a fucking elite 
                                              performance! 

           They share a shy smile.  A beat, then--
                                 RICK
                        You’re welcome to take this seat.  
                        The view’s better.

                                 KIRSTEN
                        Barely.

           But she hides a smile and moves over next to him.

           Up in the nosebleeds, Harper takes Charlie’s popcorn tub and 
           shakes it like it’s a champagne celebration--

                                 HARPER
                        THAT’S WHAT I’M TALKING ABOUT! 

           INT. NOSEBLEEDS - DODGER STADIUM - NIGHT

           Charlie and Harper eat popcorn, watching the game, when 
           suddenly the familiar music starts -- it’s the KISS CAM.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        Kiss Cam that’s the Kiss Cam music--

           The very first couple is Rick and Kirsten!  

                                 HARPER
                        BOBBY YOU FURRY MAGICIAN!

           It takes Rick and Kirsten a second to realize they’re on 
           camera.  Kirsten blushes and Rick rolls his eyes, 
           embarrassed.  He shakes his head -- “we’re not together.”  A 
           few scattered people BOO.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Come on!  

           The Kiss Cam cuts to a NEW COUPLE, two BASEBALL BROs, who 
           happily oblige and start making out.  

                                 HARPER
                        Nooo!  You have to give them time!  

                                 CHARLIE
                        BOOOOO--
                             (then, realizing)
                        Not ‘cause they’re gay!  For 
                        something else! 

           Harper and Charlie fall back in their seats, upset, as the 
           Kiss Cam keeps cutting to new couples.  

                                 HARPER
                        They’re nervous, this was too soon--
           And then the Kiss Cam cuts BACK to Rick and Kirsten!  The 
           crowd LAUGHS as Rick and Kirsten jump, thinking they were 
           home free.  They’re both blushing but they still won’t kiss.  

                          HARPER
                                                         CHARLIE
           KISS!  IT’S THE LAW! 
                                              LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE! 

           The stadium starts BOOING good-naturedly.  Kirsten shakes her 
           head.  Rick looks away as if he can’t see the camera.

           The Kiss Cam cuts to a cute LITTLE BOY who kisses his MOM.  
           Charlie and Harper MOAN, heads in their hands--

                                 CHARLIE
                        Oh my GOD.  

                                 HARPER
                        What else can we do?  Should we 
                        send some popcorn or cotton candy 
                        down there--

           The Kiss Cam comes back to Rick and Kirsten a third time!  
           Rick looks like he wants to murder someone.  Kirsten blushes 
           furiously.  Now the whole stadium CHEERS encouragingly.  
           Harper grips Charlie’s arm, on the edge of their seats....

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        COME ON!

           Rick and Kirsten share a glance -- “just to shut them up?”  
           Rick adjusts in his seat and Kirsten pushes her hair back and 
           they finally, shyly kiss in front of 50,000 people.  The 
           crowd CHEERS.  Harper and Charlie leap to their feet--

                          HARPER
                                                         CHARLIE
           YESS!!
                                              YEAH!!!!

           CRACK!  A Dodger whacks a home run.  The stadium ERUPTS, no 
           one cheering louder than Harper and Charlie, still watching 
           as Rick and Kirsten make out behind home plate.

           EXT. DODGER STADIUM - NIGHT

           Downtown sparkles behind the stadium.  The game’s still going 
           as Harper and Charlie hurry out to the parking lot.  Harper 
           checks her phone and looks up, amazed--

                                 HARPER
                        No e-mails!

                                 CHARLIE
                             (delighted)
                        You can’t bark orders when your 
                        tongue’s down someone’s throat!
                                 HARPER
                        Okay, have fun with Suze!

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yep, you too!  I mean, not with 
                        Suze, but, you know....

           Charlie clicks his key and it BEEPS somewhere far away.  
           Harper clicks hers, it BEEPS close by, but she can’t find it.  
           They walk past each other, beeping their keys--

                          HARPER
                                                         CHARLIE
           Yep, bye!
                                              Bye-bye.

           INT. HARPER & BECCA’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Harper pulls a big hoodie on backwards, so the hood is right 
           below her face, and fills the hood with popcorn.  She flips 
           through guys on Tinder on her phone, hesitating on one, and 
           finally typing: Any sports moments make you cry?

           INT. SUZE’S BEDROOM - LATER

           Charlie and Suze walk into her room.  Charlie’s giddy. 

                                 SUZE
                        I can’t believe you made it before 
                        I fell asleep.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I told you my schedule was gonna 
                        get better! 
                             (as they climb in hed)
                        You like sports, right?

                                 SUZE
                        Duh!  I love basketball, and the 
                        one with no hands.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Soccer?  You don’t know the word 
                        for soccer?

           Suze climbs on top of him.

                                 SUZE
                        That’s the one with balls, right?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Mmm-hmm.  You know everything.

           She reaches under the covers.  His eyes flutter.

                                 SUZE
                        Should I not use my hands?
                                 CHARLIE
                        No!  You can be the goalie.  

           INT. “THE RUNDOWN” OFFICES - THE NEXT DAY

           Harper races in, fumbling with a tray of coffees, bags 
           falling off her shoulders, and sprints to her desk--

                                 HARPER
                        I’m so sorry!!  There was a new 
                        barista and then a huge accident on 
                        Fairfax I’m so so sorry--

           She realizes Kirsten’s office is empty.  Harper checks her 
           watch, confused. 

           INT. MCKELVY CAPITAL OFFICES - DAY

           Charlie’s freaking out as he decorates Rick’s daughter’s 
           science project poster board and calls Harper.

                                 HARPER (O.S.)
                        Hello?

                                 CHARLIE 
                        Rick’s still not here.  

                                 HARPER (O.S.)
                        Neither is Kirsten.

                                 CHARLIE 
                        What if a psychopath saw them on 
                        the kiss cam and followed them home 
                        and murdered them?!  Legally, where 
                        are we in that scenario?

           Just then Charlie sees Rick sauntering in the office.  
           Charlie hangs up and straightens.  Rick smiles--

                                 RICK
                        Morning!  I could use a coffee.  Do 
                        you mind grabbing me a flat white?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Do I mind?  It would be my honor...

                                 RICK
                        And we should probably order some 
                        lunch.  I’ll have the pork belly 
                        from Delfine’s.  And then whatever 
                        you want.

           Rick walks into his office.  Charlie almost tears up.
           INT. “THE RUNDOWN” OFFICES - DAY

           Harper’s staring at a notebook, trying to scribble ideas, 
           when Kirsten floats into the office.  As she passes Harper:

                                 KIRSTEN 
                        Harper, my office?

           INT. KIRSTEN’S OFFICE - DAY

           Harper follows behind her and stands in the doorway as 
           Kirsten falls into her desk chair.  She stares off for a long 
           beat, then turns--

                                 KIRSTEN
                        I spent the night with a man.

                                 HARPER
                             (overacting)
                        Whaaaaat?  That’s amazing!  Get it, 
                        girl! 

                                 KIRSTEN
                        We didn’t sleep together.  We did 
                        everything but.

                                 HARPER
                             (eyes wide)
                        Oh wow.

                                 KIRSTEN
                        I’m still a lady.  And it has 
                        been...a while.  A while. 

                                 HARPER
                        Mmm-hmm.

                                 KIRSTEN
                        Even when he was being gentle, you 
                        could sense the possibility of 
                        strength hovering in his touch.  
                        Like when that huge gorilla held 
                        and stroked that tiny kitten....  

           She gets lost in her train of thought.  Harper’s frozen.  
           Finally Kirsten turns to Harper, blushing.

                                 KIRSTEN (CONT’D)
                        He doesn’t know anything about 
                        baseball.  But, you can’t have 
                        everything.  

           Kirsten smiles.  Harper smiles back.  Then, all business--

                                 KIRSTEN (CONT’D)
                        Did that guy from the Post call?
                                 HARPER
                        He did, I’ll return right now.

           INT. MCKELVY CAPITAL OFFICE - DAY

           Charlie’s packing up when Harper runs in, giddy--

                                 HARPER
                        She just left!

                                 CHARLIE
                        So did Rick!  IT’S DAYLIGHT!!

                                 HARPER
                        I’m getting out of here before 
                        Kirsten comes back and it was all a 
                        terrible prank.  I have a date with 
                        a guy I messaged last night.  We’re 
                        going mini-golfing.

                                 CHARLIE
                        That’s a terrible idea.  You have a 
                        Dave Matthews concentration face.

                                 HARPER
                        No I don’t.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I saw you write cursive one time.

           He does a version of her concentration face -- it does look 
           like Dave Matthews.  She flips him off.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Have fun on your date.  Let him win 
                        a few holes.

                                 HARPER
                        Excuse me, I only have one hole.  
                        Two on birthdays.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Oh my God, I meant at mini golf.

           Harper starts to reply, then blushes a red so deep she may 
           pass out, then hurries away.

           INT. CHARLIE & DUNCAN’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Duncan walks in, sweaty in gym clothes, to find Charlie 
           cooking an elaborate dinner.

                                 DUNCAN
                        You finally quit?!
                                 CHARLIE
                        No!  I just got out early.  I’m 
                        making Suze dinner.

                                 DUNCAN
                             (voice too high)
                        Oh.  Suze is coming here?  

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yeah-- What is that tone?  Why’d 
                        your voice go up like that?  What 
                        does that mean?

                                 DUNCAN
                        She’s just... she’s kinda...boring.

                                 CHARLIE
                        No she’s NOT!

                                 DUNCAN
                        If you’re not distracted by her 
                        face or her boobs, you realize that 
                        she’s not really saying anything. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        That is the most heterophobic thing 
                        I’ve ever heard in my life.  You 
                        just don’t know her.  

           Charlie takes a sip of his sauce.  A beat.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Get me the take-out menus, I gotta 
                        Mrs. Doubtfire this shit.

           EXT. MINI GOLF COURSE - NIGHT

           A worn-down, charming Mini Golf Course, dotted with a few 
           happy FAMILIES or COUPLES.  Harper and her MINI GOLF DATE 
           (20s, sweet face) cross a tiny bridge over a neon-blue river 
           on their way to the next hole.

                                 MINI GOLF
                        ...and I just figured graphic 
                        design was the closest thing to 
                        drawing comic books besides... 
                        actually drawing comic books.

           Harper goes to putt at the next hole.  She tries to keep her 
           face slack, but it’s distracting and she whiffs the ball.

                                 MINI GOLF (CONT’D)
                        You’re not letting me win to boost 
                        my ego, are you?
                                 HARPER
                        Are you kidding?  I want to destroy 
                        you.  I’m just trying not to do my 
                        concentration face.

                                 MINI GOLF
                        Oh, no.  I’ve got the John Mayer.

           He does his John Mayer concentration face.  Harper laughs.

                                 MINI GOLF (CONT’D)
                        Why don’t I just get behind you, 
                        and then you can make whatever face 
                        you want.

           He steps behind her, almost touching, as she bends over to 
           hit her ball.  It’s kind of sexy.  Then Mini Golf gently 
           pokes Harper in the butt with his golf club.

                                 HARPER
                        I really hope that’s your golf 
                        club.  Because it feels very small.

           Mini Golf laughs.  Harper grins and whacks her putt.  

           INT. KIRSTEN’S OFFICE - THE NEXT DAY

           Harper’s still smiling to herself at her desk when an IM pops 
           up from Charlie: How was the date? 

           Harper quickly responds: PERFECT.  We played three rounds 
           because we couldn’t stop talking.

           Behind her, Kirsten reloads her e-mail over and over, 
           annoyed, and calls out--

                                 KIRSTEN
                        Harper!  My phone is broken.  The 
                        messages aren’t coming through.

           Harper thinks for a moment, then IM’s Charlie: Rick needs to 
           call Kirsten ASAP.

           INT. “THE RUNDOWN” OFFICES - LATER

           Harper’s phone rings with the caller ID: McKelvy Investments.  
           Kirsten leaps for it--

                                 KIRSTEN
                        I’ll get it!  I’ve got it.
                             (answers, “sexy”)
                        Hi.

           At her desk, Harper smiles.
           INT. MCKELVY CAPITAL OFFICE - DAY

           Rick’s on a call with a COLLEAGUE.  Charlie listens and works 
           on the science project, lemon juice squirting everywhere.  

                                 RICK (ON PHONE)
                        Dating’s so much easier now. 
                        Everybody’s sexting all the time.  
                        And waxing!  Kiki never waxed, just 
                        to punish me.  I’ll never have to 
                        have sex with an un-waxed woman 
                        again.

           Charlie puts his head on the desk.

           INT. ELEVATOR - DAY

           Harper steps up to see Charlie already there.  Charlie waits 
           for the doors to close so they’re alone, then--

                                 CHARLIE
                        Kirsten needs to get a bikini wax.

                                 HARPER
                        Excuse me?  

                                 CHARLIE
                        Tell her to get one.  You’re girls, 
                        you talk about this stuff.

                                 HARPER
                        Oh, yeah, I walk in every morning 
                        and hand her a latte and then we 
                        talk about merkins and the cyclical 
                        popularity of the full bush--

                                 CHARLIE
                        What’s a merkin?

                                 HARPER
                        It’s a pubic hair wig.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I miss the time when I didn’t know 
                        what that was.

                                 HARPER
                             (annoyed)
                        Why don’t you go tell your 
                        girlfriend to get a bikini wax?

                                 CHARLIE
                        I don’t have to, Suze is totally 
                        hairless, like a beautiful tan 
                        dolphin.
                                 HARPER
                        Well in a frozen apocalypse she’d 
                        retain no body heat and be the 
                        first to die so who’s laughing now?

           The elevator doors open and she marches off.

           INT. SALON - DAY

           A HEAVY SALON ATTENDANT grins, preparing her wax. 

                                 SALON ATTENDANT 
                        It has been a long, long time, yes?  
                        You are ready?

           Reveal: Harper is on the table, knees up to her chin.  

                                 HARPER
                        Yep.  I mean, I don’t want it to 
                        happen, but yes, ready.

                                 SALON ATTENDANT
                        You don’t want it?

                                 HARPER
                        Of course I don’t want it, I hate 
                        you.  But it has to happen.

                                 SALON ATTENDANT
                        So don’t do?

                                 HARPER
                        I need you to do it.  Do it before 
                        I stop you. 

           INT. “THE RUNDOWN” OFFICES - DAY

           Harper types at her desk when Kirsten walks by, smiling to 
           herself, dressed up.  Harper watches her go, thinking.  Then 
           she picks up her cell.

           EXT. BUILDING COURTYARD - DAY

           Charlie sneaks in to find Harper already pacing.

                                 CHARLIE
                        What?

                                 HARPER
                        If we hadn’t intervened, Rick would 
                        have never called her and Kirsten’s 
                        70s bush would’ve turned him off 
                        and there would be no second date.
                             (then, serious)
                                 (MORE)
                                 HARPER (CONT'D)
                        We can’t just kick them out of the 
                        nest.  They’re baby birds and 
                        they’re careening to their death.  
                        We need to actually Cyrano them.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Absolutely.  Totally.  Which is 
                        what we were doing before and is 
                        now what we’re doing now.

                                 HARPER
                        You do know what Cyrano is, right?

                                 CHARLIE
                        I’m not an idiot.  It’s when 
                        assistants...set up...their bosses 
                        I do not know what Cyrano is.

                                 HARPER
                        I’ve said it like fourteen times!

                                 CHARLIE
                        I thought I knew what it was the 
                        first few times you said it and 
                        then it was too late to ask!

                                 HARPER
                        It’s about a nerdy guy who helps a 
                        handsome guy date the girl he’s in 
                        love with by telling him what to 
                        say and do.
                             (then)
                        We can’t just set them up, we need 
                        to help them keep dating.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Um, does Cyrano know he stole his 
                        entire plot from a Steve Martin 
                        movie?

           MUSIC UP as we CUT TO....

           INT./EXT. VARIOUS - DAY/NIGHT

           --Kirsten finds a HUGE BOUQUET on her desk.  She beams.  Out 
           by her desk, Harper air-fives no one.

           --Rick smiles when he finds expensive-as-hell SCOTCH with a 
           red bow on his desk.  Out at his desk, Charlie air-fives no 
           one.

           --Harper sits on Charlie’s desk as they scroll through 
           DRESSES on a clothing website.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        Oooh, that one.  He’s an ass man.
           --Rick’s on the phone with Kirsten--

                                 RICK
                        What about Tuesday night?

           At Charlie’s desk, Harper and Charlie listen to the call. 
           Harper adds an event on Kirsten’s calendar for Tuesday night.  

                                 KIRSTEN (O.S.)
                        Hmmm, I can’t Tuesday.

                                 RICK (O.S.)
                        Friday?

           Harper adds an event for Kirsten on Friday night.

                                 KIRSTEN (O.S.)
                        I’m busy Friday, too.

                                 RICK (O.S.)
                             (flirty)
                        You’re a hard woman to track down.

           Harper and Charlie high-five for real.

           --Harper listens to Kirsten on the phone with Rick.

                                 KIRSTEN 
                        Harper, drop off the call.

           Harper gives her a thumbs-up, presses a random button so it 
           beeps, mutes her phone, and keeps listening, taking notes....

                                 KIRSTEN (ON PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        It’s just us now.

                                 RICK (O.S.)
                        You are so hot.

           Harper grimaces but keeps taking notes.

           --Harper’s giving Charlie instructions.

                                 HARPER
                        There are two kinds of compliments 
                        to give a woman.  The things she 
                        already thinks about herself but 
                        she wants confirmed, and the things 
                        she doesn't think anybody else 
                        notices.  He’s only giving her the 
                        first kind.  The second kind 
                        matters more.  

           --Charlie writes a note from Rick on the next set of flowers.  
           He thinks, then write: “I love how competitive you are.”
           --Charlie walks up, ready to wait outside, but the Doorman 
           opens the door--

                                 DOORMAN
                        He said you can wait in the lobby.

           Charlie tries to hide his huge smile and walk in casually, 
           but he goes too casual and accidentally strolls in like a 
           very fancy old man.

           --At night, Kirsten waves happily as she heads out--

                                 KIRSTEN
                        Have a great night, Harper!

           --ANOTHER DAY, Kirsten leaves as the sun sets--

                                 KIRSTEN (CONT’D)
                        You can cancel my dinner.

           --ANOTHER DAY, Kirsten leaves at lunch--

                                 KIRSTEN (CONT’D)
                        I’m taking the rest of the day.

           --Charlie, on the phone, looks out the window to see Rick 
           walking to his car--

                                 CHARLIE (ON PHONE)
                        Baby, wanna get lunch?

           --Harper, in her bathrobe, wearing a clay face mask, blow-
           dries her hair, smiling happily.

           --Harper strides into the office, hair blown out like a 
           queen.

           --Charlie snuggles on the couch with Suze.  He thinks for a 
           moment, then--

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        I love how you look when you first 
                        put on your glasses.

           She looks up at him, surprised and pleased.  He grins.

           --Harper laughs at a romantic dinner with Mini Golf.

           --Only two lights are still on in the building -- and then 
           those two lights click off.  MUSIC OUT.

           INT. CACTUS CANTINA MEXICAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Harper and Charlie clink WATER GLASSES at the bar.
                                 CHARLIE
                        I took a nap today.  A fucking nap.

           The exasperated WAITER approaches.

                                 CACTUS CANTINA WAITER
                        Are you ready to order yet?

                                 HARPER
                        Still deciding.  Can we get some 
                        more chips, though?

           The Waiter glares at her as he walks away.  Charlie picks up 
           one of the chips and grimaces.

                                 CHARLIE
                        When I get promoted I’m never 
                        eating at a place with photos of 
                        their food on the menus again.

                                 HARPER
                        First of all, rude.  Secondly, naps 
                        are great but Becca’s engagement 
                        party is this weekend and I need to 
                        guarantee I can go.  

           She slides something across the bar.  Charlie picks it up, 
           intrigued, and reads it, confused--

                                 CHARLIE
                        This is just a bar menu.

                                 HARPER
                        I know, I just thought that seemed 
                        dramatic.  I reserved them a 
                        romantic weekend for two in Ojai.
                        Friday to Sunday.  And there’s no 
                        service out there.  We’ll have the 
                        entire weekend to ourselves.

                                 CHARLIE
                        That’s PERFECT.  Suze’s agency is 
                        throwing some big pool party this 
                        weekend!  I’ll finally be able to 
                        go instead of sitting around 
                        thinking about all the guys looking 
                        at her in her bathing suit.

                                 HARPER
                        Isn’t she a bathing suit model?

           Charlie smirks at her.  Harper’s phone DINGS with a text and 
           she reads it, grins, and starts typing a reply.  Charlie 
           takes a swig of his beer and reads it over her shoulder--

                                 CHARLIE
                        Easy with the ha-ha’s.  
                                 HARPER
                        That’s a fine amount of haha.

                                 CHARLIE
                        You like his joke, you’re not a 
                        clown on meth.  Read it out loud.  
                        “Hahahahaha--”

           Harper smacks him.  

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        If really you like him then you 
                        should go out with three other 
                        guys, this week.

                                 HARPER
                        What?  Why?

                                 CHARLIE
                        You know how when you were little, 
                        if you had three salamanders, you 
                        would play with each of them for a 
                        little bit every day, and they’d 
                        live for years, but if you only had 
                        one salamander, you held it and 
                        loved it and played with it so much 
                        that it died almost immediately?

                                 HARPER
                             (so weirded out)
                        No.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Well, men are like that.  If you’re 
                        only focusing on one, he can sense 
                        it, and you’re gonna accidentally 
                        kill him and hide him in your 
                        drawer so your mom doesn’t find 
                        out.

                                 HARPER
                        I like my one salamander.  
                             (standing)
                        Let’s get out of here.

                                 CHARLIE
                        We haven’t ordered anything.

           Harper pretends to answer her cell, yelling loudly--

                                 HARPER
                        What?  What kind of emergency?  No, 
                        I was going to pay for a meal at 
                        this restaurant, but I better come 
                        straight to the hospital!

           Harper opens her bag and pours the rest of the chips into it.
                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                             (overracting)
                        The whole leg??  I’ll be right 
                        there!

           She sprints out of the restaurant.  Charlie hops up awkwardly 
           and hurries after her.  The waiter calls after them--

                                 CACTUS CANTINA WAITER
                        I mean, I saw your phone not ring.  
                        It’s not legally a crime but I 
                        think you know this isn’t right.

           INT. “THE RUNDOWN” OFFICES - DAY

           Harper listens to Kirsten on a call in her office.  Kirsten’s 
           face lights up.

                                 KIRSTEN (ON PHONE)
                        I’ve never been to Ojai.

           At her desk, Harper hides a grin.

           INT. HARPER & BECCA’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Harper, dressed up, opens the door to Mini Golf.  

                                 MINI GOLF
                        Hey!  You ready?

                                 HARPER
                        Yes!  But I was thinking maybe 
                        instead of dinner we could stay in 
                        and have sex and watch Netflix.

           Mini Golf doesn’t say anything.  Harper backtracks--

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        Or we can go out let’s go to dinner 
                        out in public, I’m thinking of 
                        seeing other people, two other 
                        salamanders--

           Mini Golf picks her up and carries her into the apartment.  
           Harper shrieks happily.

           INT. CHARLIE’S APARTMENT - THE NEXT MORNING

           Charlie whistles in his boxers, making PANCAKES in the shape 
           of a penis and two boobs.  Suze comes up behind him and hugs 
           him around the waist.  
           INT. HARPER’S BEDROOM - MORNING

           Sun pours in Harper’s room.  She stirs, startled for a second 
           to see Mini Golf asleep next to her.

           Then she smiles and traces her finger along his back, happy 
           and a tiny bit nervous.

           INT. MCKELVY CAPITAL OFFICE - DAY

           Charlie saunters in the office, beaming, fresh from morning 
           sex, ready to take on the--

           BAM.  A printer slams into the wall next to him.  Charlie 
           ducks and screams a Mariah-Carey-falsetto.  

           In his office, Rick going full Hulk again.

                                 RICK
                        WHY DO I ONLY HAVE A 2D PRINTER?!  
                        AM I A CAVEMAN?!

           Harper settles into her desk for the day.  Her phone rings.  
           She sees it’s Charlie and answers--

                                 HARPER (ON PHONE)
                        Yes, I did bang someone last night, 
                        thank you so much for asking--

                                 CHARLIE (O.S.)
                        CODE RED!  CODE BLACK!  CODE SHIT! 

           Before Harper can respond, she sees Kirsten walk in -- face 
           puffy, eyes red, still leaking tears.  Harper hangs up as 
           Kirsten straightens her shoulders--

                                 KIRSTEN
                        Change of plans.  I will be in town 
                        this weekend.  Make sure they know 
                        we’ll need the office open from 
                        seven to seven Saturday and Sunday.

                                 HARPER
                        Of course. 
                             (then, delicately)
                        Is everything all right?

                                 KIRSTEN
                        Why would you ask me that?

           Tears are still pouring out of her eyes.
                                 HARPER
                        No reason.

                                 KIRSTEN
                        I’m a successful woman who’s 
                        launching a website and doesn’t 
                        need to travel with pathetic man-
                        children who can’t feed themselves 
                        or take a joke.

           Kirsten storms into her office, then she storms back out--

                                 KIRSTEN (CONT’D)
                        Here’s a riddle.  Would you tell me 
                        you “love” Korean barbecue if you’d 
                        never eaten it and didn’t know what 
                        it was?

                                 HARPER
                        ....No?  No.

                                 KIRSTEN
                        And if I took you there, would you 
                        claim to know what you were doing, 
                        eat a slab of raw tenderloin, 
                        swallow it rather than admit that I 
                        was right, and then vomit on the 
                        hot grill?  And then blame ME?

                                 HARPER
                        No.  Never.  What a jerk. 

           Kirsten’s eyes flare, even more mad.

                                 KIRSTEN
                        I’m worried that your abrasiveness 
                        and general demeanor will hinder 
                        you in the workplace.

           Kirsten stalks past Harper into her office.  

           INT. ELEVATOR - DAY

           Charlie and Harper pace, each on the phone--

                                 CHARLIE
                        How could you let them pick the 
                        restaurant?!

                                 HARPER
                        It was your turn to choose!  

                                 CHARLIE
                        No!  You chose last time!
                             (realizing)
                        Dammit!
                                 HARPER
                        I’m going to kill you.

                                 CHARLIE
                        This is worse than before!  Rick 
                        just tried to fire a mailman!  
                        Mailmen work for the US government!  

                                 HARPER
                        The only thing worse than being 
                        single and miserable is being 
                        dumped and miserable.  We have to 
                        get them back together before they 
                        kill us.
                             (intense, quiet)
                        I feel in my bones that Kirsten is 
                        capable of murder.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        What do we do?!

                                 HARPER
                        I don’t know!  You did this, fix it! 

           She storms off.

           INT. MCKELVY CAPITAL OFFICE - DAY

           Charlie thinks hard as he walks back to his desk.  Rick, in 
           his office, slams on his laptop.

                                 RICK
                        This stupid piece of shit is saying 
                        my password is wrong! 

                                 CHARLIE 
                        That--

           Rick throws the laptop to the ground and STOMPS on it.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        That’s my laptop.   

           INT. “THE RUNDOWN” OFFICES - NIGHT

           Kirsten walks out with her bag and coat.

                                 KIRSTEN
                        I’ll need breakfast and a coffee 
                        before I get here tomorrow morning.  
                        Sometime between 6 and 9.  And I 
                        need those articles sent to my iPad 
                        since apparently printing is beyond 
                        your capabilities.
                                 HARPER
                        I didn’t realize you wanted hard 
                        copies.  I can print--

           Kirsten stops and looks Harper right in the eye.

                                 KIRSTEN
                        You’re bad at your job.  If I pay 
                        you to make my life easier but 
                        you’re making it harder, you’re 
                        useless to me.  Do you understand 
                        that?

           Harper blinks, hurt, and starts to respond, but Kirsten walks 
           out past her.

           INT. MCKELVY CAPITAL OFFICE - NIGHT

           Harper walks in, still stung.  She sees Rick’s empty office 
           and brightens a little, heading for Charlie’s desk.

                                 HARPER
                        Well, my life is over and I may 
                        have just gotten fired, but at 
                        least Kirsten left.  I’m gonna see 
                        if Mini Golf--

           She stops when she sees Charlie’s desk: total lemon carnage.  
           The science project is smashed to bits.  Charlie’s miserably 
           trying to fix it.

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        Oh my God, what is this?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Rick’s daughter’s science project.  
                             (bitterly)
                        Life gave me lemons and I used them 
                        to battery power lemonade! 

           Harper delicately picks up a smashed lemon.

                                 HARPER
                        Can you fix it?

                                 CHARLIE
                        I have to try.  It’s due tomorrow. 
                             (then)
                        Get outta here while you still can.  
                        Save yourself.

           Harper watches him for a beat, then pulls a chair up to his 
           desk and sits.

                                 HARPER
                        I think we have to start over.  
           Charlie looks over, surprised--

                                 CHARLIE
                        What about Mini Golf?

           Harper shrugs.

                                 HARPER
                        I don’t wanna squeeze my salamander 
                        too hard, right?

                                 CHARLIE
                        That’s what my dad told me at 13 
                        when he was worried I would 
                        masturbate myself to death.

           Harper laughs, then rubs her hands together, thinking--

                                 HARPER
                        We need some food coloring and a 
                        new poster board.

           INT. MCKELVY CAPITAL OFFICE - LATER

           It’s late into the night, the building empty and quiet. 
           Charlie’s telling a story as Harper laughs and sets out 
           plastic plates, a carton of milk, and some dish soap.

                                 CHARLIE
                        And he made this noise, like-- 
                        imagine if a duck were on meth, and 
                        you were holding his meth supply 
                        and refused to give it to him -- he 
                        sounded like that duck.

           Harper laughs louder as she pours milk into a plate.  Charlie 
           can’t help laughing too.

                                 HARPER
                        Why do you work for him?  He sounds 
                        insane.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        He totally is.  But no one can do 
                        anything about it, because he’s so 
                        goddamn cool.  He can be the 
                        biggest asshole or totally wrong 
                        but he’s so rich and smart that 
                        nobody says anything!  Have you 
                        seen his house?  His car?  That’s 
                        the life I wanna live.
                             (then)
                        Why do you work for Kirsten?

           Harper pours DISH SOAP on another plate as she grabs a few 
           different bottles of FOOD COLORING.
                                 HARPER
                        Because I wanna be a sports 
                        journalist and she’s the best 
                        editor there is, and I’m a sadist, 
                        apparently.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Has she read any of your stuff?

           Harper delicately drops different colored food coloring on to 
           the plate of milk (the drops stay where they are).

                                 HARPER
                        No.  Because I haven’t really 
                        written anything.  My day is so 
                        long, and exhausting, and if I ever 
                        actually have free time--

                                 CHARLIE
                             (kindly)
                        I get it.

           Harper dips a Q-TIP in the plate of dish soap.  A beat.  

                                 HARPER
                        And everything I write is bad.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        That’s probably not true.

                                 HARPER
                        It is.  I want to impress her, and 
                        I wanted her to like me, and I feel 
                        like I’ve worked so hard to be a 
                        great assistant that I’ve killed 
                        any writing skill I ever had.

                                 CHARLIE
                        That’s definitely not true.  You’re 
                        not a great assistant.

           Harper laughs.  Charlie smiles.

                                 HARPER
                        Ready?

           She dips the soaped-up Q-tip in the plate of milk and the 
           colors from the food coloring EXPLODE around the plate in 
           beautiful circles and streaks.  It looks like a kaleidoscope.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Holy shit.  How does this work?

                                 HARPER
                        I have no idea.  We should Google 
                        it.
           They sit in silence as they watch the different colors 
           spiraling out and away.

           INT. MCKELVY CAPITAL OFFICE - LATER

           Charlie works on a new poster board: Magic Milk!  Harper 
           sleeps on the desk next to him.  Rick walks in, grumpy.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Hey!  So, everything she needs is 
                        in this bag, she just drops the 
                        food coloring into the--

                                 RICK
                        This isn’t as good as the lemon 
                        shit.  She’s not even gonna ribbon.

           Rick grabs the bag and walks out.  Charlie deflates.

           INT. “THE RUNDOWN” OFFICES - LATER THAT DAY

           Harper, sleepy but in new clothes, signs for a messenger’s 
           envelope.  She opens it and a BLUE RIBBON falls out.  A 
           note’s attached;  This is purely symbolic, they haven’t even 
           judged yet.  But call me, I have an idea.

           INT. KIRSTEN’S OFFICE/RICK’S OFFICE - DAY [INTERCUT]

           Harper and Charlie stand in their boss’s respective doorways.  
           CUT BETWEEN THEM as they pitch their bosses--

                                 CHARLIE
                        I was just thinking.  You still 
                        have the Ojai reservation, right?

                                 HARPER
                        You should just go yourself.  Take 
                        some Kirsten time.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Since it’s a nonrefundable trip, 
                        isn’t it kind of financially short-
                        sighted if no one goes?

                                 HARPER
                        He’s already paid for it and you 
                        deserve to be coated in ancient mud 
                        with cucumbers on your eyes.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        Take in a round of golf, lay by the 
                        pool, tan up the ol’ body leather.

           Harper plays her Ace--
                                 HARPER
                        What are you gonna do, go to 
                        another godforsaken baby shower?  

           Kirsten sits back, thinking about it.

                                 KIRSTEN
                        I could use a massage.

           Charlie plays his Ace--

                                 CHARLIE
                        I mean, I can go, just so it’s not 
                        a waste of money--

                                 RICK
                        Absolutely not.  I’ll go.

           Charlie tries not to smile.

           INT. CHARLIE & DUNCAN’S APARTMENT - THE NEXT DAY

           Charlie’s on his cell, in a very short swimsuit.  He opens 
           the apartment door to find Harper in the doorway.  He lets 
           her in while he talks on the phone--

                                 CHARLIE 
                        Yes.  Rose petals all over the bed.  
                        And candles everywhere.  

                                 HARPER
                        Kirsten’s car is 45 minutes out.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        Okay perfect.  Thank you.  
                             (he hangs up, then)
                        The room’s all set.  It’s gonna be 
                        Boner City in there.

           Duncan walks out, also in a bathing suit.  

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Harper this is Duncan, the best, 
                        most handsome, most perfect man in 
                        the world, but he’s gay, so keep 
                        your ovaries in your pants.

                                 HARPER
                        Good to know, I’ll shove ‘em back 
                        in.  I just have one super quick 
                        question, where are the rest of 
                        your shorts?

           Duncan laughs.  Charlie looks down, sensitive--
                                 CHARLIE
                        These are cool.  Suze likes short 
                        shorts on guys.  

                                 HARPER
                        You look like John Stockton’s 
                        slutty sister.

           Duncan laughs again.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Who is that?!  Is that mean?  Stop 
                        making Duncan laugh.

                                 DUNCAN
                             (to Harper)
                        He doesn’t know anything about 
                        sports.

                                 HARPER
                        Oh, I know.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        Stop!  You guys aren’t friends!  
                        You’re each my friend!  

                                 DUNCAN
                             (to Harper)
                        Please tell me you’re coming to 
                        Suze’s party.

                                 HARPER
                        I would, but I have to sit on my 
                        bed and stare at my phone until a 
                        man calls me back. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Mini Golf?

                                 HARPER
                        Technically I haven’t heard from 
                        him since we had sex, which I’m 
                        totally fine and happy and not at 
                        all concerned about, but he told me 
                        he’d come to Becca’s engagement 
                        party, so I’m just going to get 
                        ready at home and wait--

                                 DUNCAN
                        No.  You’re coming.

                                 CHARLIE
                        It’ll be a good distraction.  And 
                        you can meet Suze! 

                                 HARPER
                        I don’t have a bathing suit.
                                 DUNCAN
                        You can wear one of my shirts.

           Duncan takes off his shirt and hands it to her.  She does a 
           double-take: Duncan’s body is AMAZING.  She turns to Charlie--

                                 HARPER
                        You’re Urkel and Duncan’s like your 
                        Stefon Urquelle.

                                 DUNCAN
                        I love you.

                                 CHARLIE
                        That’s genuinely very hurtful.

           EXT. POOL PARTY - DAY

           MUSIC PUMPS at the most fun party ever: a gorgeous green 
           backyard, a huge splashy pool, tan shiny people in swimsuits, 
           beer and liquor everywhere, food on the grill.

           Harper (wearing Duncan’s shirt), Charlie and Duncan walk in.  
           Harper and Charlie’s eyes light up like they’re seeing Oz.  

                                 HARPER
                        Look at all these people who live 
                        in sunlight, who breathe in real 
                        air, who are young and free and 
                        wild as horses!

           A GUY walks by with a hot dog and Harper takes it off his 
           plate, taking a huge bite--

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        I knew this was what was happening 
                        when we were at work!!  

           Suze, in the world’s tiniest bikini, runs up to him.  Charlie 
           lights up and picks her up in a hug.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        Baby!  You look so hot!  This is my 
                        friend Harper.

           Harper goes in for a hug, too, which Suze wasn’t expecting. 

                                 HARPER
                        Oh my God, you’re so light.  Even I 
                        can pick you up!

           Harper does pick up Suze.  It’s awkward.  She drops her.

                                 SUZE
                        Baby, will you get me a drink?
                                 CHARLIE
                        Always!

           He puts his arm around her and leads her to the bar.  She 
           checks out his swimsuit they go:

                                 SUZE
                        Your shorts are so long! 

           Harper gives Duncan a look.  He rolls his eyes, then--

                                 DUNCAN
                        Wanna do the Slip ‘N Flip?

                                                                CUT TO:

           THE SLIP ‘N FLIP: a slip-and-side down a small hill that ends 
           at a flip cup table.  Harper and Duncan line up at the top.

                                 RANDOM GUY
                        Aaaaaaand GO! 

           They FLING themselves down the slip n’ slide, screaming 
           happily, then POP UP at the end and wobble to the flip cup 
           table.  It’s neck-and-neck, they’re downing beer and flipping 
           cups over, but Harper wins at the last second!  She throws 
           her arms in the air--

                                 HARPER
                        I’M YOUNG AND I’M FREE!!!

           EXT. POOL PARTY - LATER

           Charlie’s laughing and firing TWO WATER GUNS at people when 
           Harper runs up on her cellphone--

                                 HARPER
                        Great!  Yes, thank you!  Thank you!
                             (hangs up, freaking out)
                        Two people just ordered room 
                        service and more towels up to the 
                        suite!  They’re there!  Together!  
                        It worked!!

                                 CHARLIE
                        YES!!!!

           They jump up and down and dance in celebration.  Charlie 
           fires his water guns into the air, then fires one at Harper.  
           It gets in her eye and she yelps, rubbing her face--

                                 HARPER
                        Ow!  What is that?!

                                 CHARLIE
                        Oh sorry, it’s vodka.
           He grins and squirts some in his mouth.  Harper grabs the 
           other water gun and sprays it into her mouth, then chokes, 
           coughing and spitting it out.  

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Oh shit, that one’s just pool 
                        water.

           EXT. POOL PARTY - LATER

           Harper and Duncan play Charlie and Suze in beer pong.  Harper 
           SINKS a ball and Duncan cheers, delighted.  Harper bows.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        HOW ARE YOU DOING THIS?!

           Suze laughs with some SKINNY GIRLS off to the side, not 
           really paying attention.  Charlie tries to get her attention--

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Sweetie-- do you wanna drink this 
                        one, baby?  I can if you want--  

           Duncan and Harper bounce two balls in simultaneously.  They 
           cheer and do an elaborate handshake celebration.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        You don’t have a secret handshake!  
                        YOU GUYS ARE NOT FRIENDS! 

           EXT. POOL PARTY - LATER

           Suze talks with a JACKED GUY across the party.  Charlie 
           stands next to her, holding a sun umbrella over her like he’s 
           Fonsworth Bentley.  He tries to join in on the conversation, 
           but they’re not really listening to him.

           Across the party, Harper watches.  She catches his eye and 
           raises her eyebrows, giving him a look.  He ignores her.

           EXT. POOL PARTY - LATER

           Harper, a little drunk, checks her phone off to the side.  
           Duncan and Charlie approach.  Duncan hands her a drink. 
           Charlie slaps the phone out of her hand.

                                 HARPER
                        Hey!

                                 CHARLIE
                        Stop.  A watched phone never pings.
                                 HARPER
                        Maybe he accidentally drove into a 
                        ditch and is running out of food 
                        and he can’t make outgoing calls, 
                        he can only receive calls--

                                 CHARLIE
                        Stop!  So he’s not calling you.  
                        It’s not a big deal.

                                 HARPER
                             (too loud)
                        Yes it is!  I slept with him!  

           Harper catches herself, vulnerable, but then admits:

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        That’s a big deal to me.
                             (then)
                        I’ve only done it with two other 
                        people and one of them came out 
                        while he was inside me.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I hate that I’m the one explaining 
                        this to you, but that’s actually 
                        how sex works, it goes in and out.

                                 HARPER
                        No, he actually came out.  Of the 
                        closet.

                                                                POP TO:

           INT. DORM ROOM - DAY

           A very nervous COLLEGE GUY shifts on top of an excited-but-
           nervous Harper, under the covers.  

                                 HARPER
                        Ready?

                                 COLLEGE GUY
                        Mmm-hmmm.

           He closes his eyes, wincing as he enters her--

                                 COLLEGE GUY (CONT’D)
                        III’M GAY! 

                                                             BACK TO SCENE:

           Charlie laughs.  Duncan nods--
                                 DUNCAN
                        Sometimes we don’t know until we’ve 
                        tried it.  And then we really know.

                                 HARPER
                        Mini Golf isn’t like that.  He was 
                        perfect.

                                 DUNCAN
                        You can’t know if something’s 
                        perfect right away.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Yes you can, I knew Suze was 
                        perfect at first sight.

           He realizes Harper is texting again and slaps the phone out 
           of her hand again--

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Stop!  Don’t text him.  It’s time 
                        to play a little hard to get.

           Harper’s just drunk enough to rant--

                                 HARPER
                        Why does everyone say that?!  “Hard 
                        to get” makes no sense!  It is 
                        EVOLUTIONARILY UNSOUND!  Why would 
                        cavemen want a cavewoman who was 
                        like, “Go get me food, and then, I 
                        don’t know, maybe there will be a 
                        cave for you, maybe there won’t.”   
                        He would die!  Men should want the 
                        women who are very obviously going 
                        to keep the warmest coziest cave 
                        for them! They need shelter! I am 
                        guaranteeing shelter!

           She hangs her head.  Duncan rubs her back sweetly.

                                 DUNCAN
                        Maybe it’s because all cavemen did 
                        was shoot animals or climb 
                        mountains, and the harder the 
                        animal was to kill, the better it 
                        tasted.  So they probably learned 
                        that anything worth anything is 
                        going to be hard.  

           That hits Harper -- and it hits Charlie, too.  Harper takes 
           Duncan’s hand, emotional.
                                 HARPER
                        I wish it was the 50’s and you had 
                        to pretend to be straight and we 
                        had a passionless and confusing 
                        marriage.

                                 DUNCAN
                        Simpler times.

           Charlie looks over at Suze, flirting with a group of guys by 
           the pool, and decides something.  He turns back--

                                 CHARLIE
                        Fuck Mini Golf.  

                                 HARPER
                        I did fuck Mini Golf!  That’s why 
                        I’m having this problem! 

                                 CHARLIE
                        No, I mean, forget him.  I’ll go 
                        with you.  I’ll be your date.  I’ll 
                        other-salamander you tonight.

                                 HARPER
                        What about Suze?

                                 CHARLIE
                        She should see what it’s like when 
                        her cave doesn’t have any fire.
                             (then, realizing)
                        I’m not the cavewoman, I’m still 
                        the guy-- let’s just go.

           EXT. ROOFTOP - DUSK

           A downtown LA rooftop with a gorgeous view, hanging twinkly 
           lights, great food passed around.  Guests mingle in pretty 
           dresses and blazers, drinking, laughing.  

           Charlie, a button-down over his bathing suit, and Harper, 
           still in Duncan’s t-shirt, move through the crowd, searching 
           for Becca.  Harper spots her talking to an OLDER COUPLE and 
           bounds over, hip-checking the Older Couple out of the way, 
           picking Becca up in a hug.

                                 HARPER
                        YOU’RE GETTING MARRIED!!!

                                 BECCA
                        You’re here!! 
                             (seeing Charlie)
                        Is this Mini Golf?

                                 HARPER
                        No, this is Charlie, from work.
                                 BECCA
                             (surprised but happy)
                        Oh my gosh, hi!

           She hugs him as Harper grabs a passing appetizer plate.

                                 HARPER
                        Do you have a funnel, or something, 
                        I can use for these?

           She jokingly pours the plate into her mouth but she tips it 
           too far and they all fall on her face.  Mike approaches--

                                 MIKE
                        Yep, there she is.

           EXT. ROOFTOP - LATER

           The sun is setting.  Becca’s giving a speech.  Mike looks up 
           at her adoringly.  Charlie brings Harper a champagne and they 
           watch from the side.

                                 BECCA 
                        I’ve dated a lot of guys, and I 
                        liked things about each of them.  
                        And then I met Mike, and there was 
                        so much to not like about him.  
                        Harper pointed out that he dressed 
                        like a step-dad--

           People laugh.  Harper calls out--

                                 HARPER
                        It was true!

                                 BECCA
                        And he has terrible taste in music.  
                        He listens to Linda Rondsadt, non-
                        ironically.  His feet are something 
                        out of Lord of the Rings.

                                 MIKE
                             (good-naturedly)
                        This is super fun for me.

           Everybody laughs.

                                 BECCA
                        But he loves me.  And I am 
                        completely in love with him.  

           Harper sees Becca getting emotional and starts getting 
           emotional herself.
                                 BECCA (CONT’D)
                        When I was little my grandma told 
                        me, “you like because, and you love 
                        despite.”  You like someone because 
                        of all of their qualities, and you 
                        love someone despite some of their 
                        qualities.  I never thought I’d 
                        find someone who loves me so much 
                        that he likes my worst qualities.  
                        But that’s Mike, and that’s me, and 
                        I just can’t wait to marry him.

           Harper smiles, so happy for her friend and a tiny bit sad.

                                 BECCA (CONT’D)
                        Now please go get wasted so I can 
                        tell fun stories next week. 

           Everybody cheers and we CUT TO.....

           LATER.  Charlie, Harper, Becca and Mike do shots.  Harper 
           winces as she swallows and we CUT TO.....

           LATER.  A DANCE FLOOR’s broken out.  Becca glides around 
           Mike, laughing.  Charlie’s actually a great dancer -- he 
           might be technically terrible, but he’s fearless and 
           hilarious to watch.  Harper watches, incredulous--

                                 HARPER
                        Why are you good at this?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Just stop thinking!  Just do your 
                        thing, no one cares! 

           Harper moves stiffly, basically just walking.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Imagine you're paralyzed, and then 
                        you gain feeling back in your 
                        limbs, what would you do?

           She tries, but she’s helpless. She jerks around as Charlie 
           watches, horrified--

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        That’s-- you look like a scarecrow.  
                        I’ve never seen a human body move 
                        like this before.
                             (she tries something else)
                        You look like a magician being 
                        electrocuted.  

           Harper laughs as the song end and a SLOW SONG starts.  
           There’s a small awkward beat, but then Charlie grabs her--
                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Don’t be weird.

           They dance for a beat.  It’s nice.

                                 HARPER
                        What’s Rick and Kirsten’s “and 
                        yet?”

                                 CHARLIE
                        What?

                                 HARPER
                        That like because, love despite 
                        thing.  When there are all these 
                        reasons why it shouldn’t work out, 
                        but they don’t care.  Like Romeo 
                        and Juliet: “Our families are 
                        mortal enemies, and yet...”  Or 
                        Beauty and the Beast: “I’m a 
                        bookish librarian suffering from 
                        Stockholm Syndrome, and you’re 
                        technically an animal, and yet....”

                                 CHARLIE
                        “You’re a black man who works for 
                        my father and I accidentally 
                        accused you of rape, and yet...”
                             (off her look)
                        To Kill a Mockingbird?  Read a 
                        book.

                                 HARPER
                        I’m worried Kirsten and Rick don’t 
                        have one.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        Are you insane?  We just got them 
                        back together.  We’re hanging on by 
                        a thread.

                                 HARPER
                        But even friendships have them.  
                        Becca’s wild and drinks too much 
                        and has never paid a bill on time, 
                        and yet, I love her.  You like 
                        douchey things and let a 23-year-
                        old walk all over you, and yet, 
                        you’re tolerable.

                                 CHARLIE
                        You’re nice instead of honest and a 
                        know it all and you’re a terrible 
                        dancer, and yet, you’re kind of 
                        fun.
           Charlie twirls her.  She meets eyes with Becca, who’s 
           watching them, grinning.  Harper gives her a look: “don’t 
           start.”  The slow song ends, and a fast one starts. CUT TO...

           LATER.  Harper and Charlie pound another shot. CUT TO....

           LATER.  An entire day of drinking is starting to really hit 
           Charlie and Harper.  They dance under hanging lights, 
           twirling, not self-conscious at all. Harper laughs, happy, 
           then suddenly gets very serious--

                                 HARPER
                        I NEED PIZZA.

           CUT TO:  Over by the bar, Becca laughs with some FRIENDS.  
           Harper squeezes through the group like Red Rover and hugs 
           Becca around the waist.

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        You look.  So beautiful.

                                 BECCA
                             (delighted)
                        You’re drunk!

                                 HARPER
                        It was an accident but it was also 
                        incredibly on purpose.

           Harper takes Becca’s head in her hands, too aggressively.

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        You’re the love of my life, I’m so 
                        happy for you and I’ll remember 
                        this night until my death, but 
                        there’s no pizza on this roof and 
                        so I have to go.  Do you mind if we 
                        sneak out?

           Becca sees Charlie holding Harper’s coat behind them and 
           smiles.

                                 BECCA
                        Get outta here.  

           Harper squeezes Becca, kisses her on the cheek, and skips 
           over to Charlie.  Becca watches them go and smiles.  A beat 
           later, a PIZZA DELIVERY GUY walks in behind Becca, holding a 
           stack of at least a dozen pizzas.

                                 PIZZA DELIVERY GUY
                        Where do you want these?

                                 BECCA
                             (turning around)
                        On the table, wherever.
           INT. PIZZA PLACE - NIGHT

           A dinky late-night pizza place.  A few people chew silently.  
           Charlie gets a soda while Harper waits for her pizza with a 
           thousand yard stare.  Suddenly--

                                 HARPER
                        WHERE THE HELL ARE THE GOO GOO 
                        DOLLS?!

           A few people jump, but Harper just goes back to her stare.

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT

           Charlie and Harper walk toward his building, wobbly drunk.  
           Harper tries to open the box to smell the pizza--

                                 CHARLIE
                        No!  Don’t let its smell out.

                                 HARPER
                        This smells the way I imagine 
                        heroin feels.  I wish this box was 
                        my bed! 

           INT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE CHARLIE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           They amble to his apartment.

                                 HARPER
                        I just-- when I was little and I 
                        thought of myself getting married 
                        and having kids, I always pictured 
                        a different person doing that.  Who 
                        was a lot more put together and 
                        mature and prettier.  But now I’m 
                        realizing -- that person has to be 
                        me!  Doesn’t that freak you out?!

                                 CHARLIE
                        I know this isn’t gonna sound like 
                        how I mean it to sound, but.... I 
                        wanna fuck this pizza.

                                 HARPER
                        I get it.  I mean, you shouldn’t 
                        ever say that to anyone else, but I 
                        get it.

           Charlie opens his door, then slams it closed, eyes wide.

                                 CHARLIE
                             (whispered)
                        Oh my God.  Oh my God.  Duncan’s 
                        hooking up with a guy in there.
                                 HARPER
                        What?!  Are they 69-ing?

           She tries to open the door but Charlie holds it closed.

                                 CHARLIE
                             (whispering fiercely)
                        We-can’t-interrupt-them!  He has to 
                        know this is a safe space!  
                             (thinks, then)
                        There’s another way in.

           EXT. CHARLIE’S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

           They stumble outside to a FIRE ESCAPE outside Charlie’s 
           window.  Harper jumps on the ladder, climbing up.

                                 HARPER
                        Okay, I’ll get to the top and then 
                        you hand me the pizza--

                                 CHARLIE
                        Absolutely not.  Your hands are too 
                        small.  

                                 HARPER
                        I can palm a child-sized 
                        basketball! 

                                 CHARLIE
                        I’ll hold it and I’ll climb with 
                        one hand like a monkey.

           He starts to climb, balancing the pizza.

                                 HARPER
                        Oh my God, keep the top up!  The 
                        cheese is gonna slide, oh my God--

                                 CHARLIE
                        Shut up you’re distracting me! 

           She tries to grab it but he slaps her hand away--

                                 HARPER
                        If you fall I will spend all of my 
                        efforts to catch this pizza and I 
                        will let you die!  Don’t put me in 
                        this position! 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Don’t make me laugh!

           Harper bursts out laughing.  
           INT. CHARLIE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Harper crawls into the window, falling on Charlie’s floor. 
           The pizza appears in the window behind her and she grabs it.  
           Charlie’s face follows and he hoists himself up, tumbling 
           into the room.  Harper laughs.  He shushes her.

           Harper takes the pizza and sits on the floor against 
           Charlie’s bed, inhaling the smell.  Charlie crawls over to 
           the pizza, sprawled on the floor, and takes a slice.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Thank God.

           She takes a bite of pizza and moans.  He inhales his slice.  
           They chew in pleasant silence, smiling, so happy, just the 
           right amount of drunk.  Finally, Harper whispers--

                                 HARPER
                        This is the best meal I’ve ever had 
                        in my entire life.

           Charlie smiles.  They keep eating in silence.  It’s relaxing, 
           and nice, and kind of intimate.  Maybe too intimate.  After a 
           moment Harper realizes that they’re in his room, on his 
           bed.... She offers him a shy smile and stands.

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        I should probably get out of here.

                                 CHARLIE
                        A slice for the road?

                                 HARPER
                        I’m a lady.  Two slices for the 
                        road.
                             (he hands them to her)
                        Roll it crust side out, I’m not a 
                        monster.

           They roll up two slices and Harper holds one in each hand, 
           salutes him, and climbs down the fire escape out of view.

           Charlie watches her go, then flops down on his bed and eats 
           his pizza, in a weirdly good mood. His phone PINGS -- it’s a 
           text from Suze.  He ignores it and takes another bite.

           INT. HARPER’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Harper lays in her bed in almost the same position, a plate 
           of pizza on her chest, eating her slice and thinking.  After 
           a beat she smiles.
           INT. “THE RUNDOWN” OFFICES - THE NEXT DAY

           Harper walks up to her desk with her morning coffees and sees 
           a note scribbled on her desk:  Meet me on 12th floor.

           INT. MCKELVY CAPITAL OFFICE - DAY

           Harper walks up to Charlie’s desk.  He brightens.

                                 HARPER
                        Hi.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Hey!

           They smile, a little shy from their adventure.  Harper’s 
           about to say something when Rick leans out of his office--

                                 RICK
                        Come in.  Both of you.

           INT. RICK’S OFFICE - DAY

           They walk in to find Kirsten sitting perched on Rick’s desk. 

                                 RICK
                        Charlie, this is Kirsten, and her 
                        assistant, Harlowe.

                                 KIRSTEN
                        Harper.

           Charlie and Harper shake hands, very formal, eyes smiling.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Nice to meet you.

                                 RICK
                        You guys are gonna need to know 
                        each other, because Kirsten and I 
                        are getting married.  

           Harper and Charlie’s heads whip up.

                          HARPER
                                                         CHARLIE
           What?!
                                              Are you serious?

           Kirsten takes Rick’s hand, absolutely glowing.

                                 RICK (CONT’D)
                        It happened quickly, but when you 
                        know you know.  
                                 HARPER
                        That’s-- amazing.

                                 RICK
                        We wanna fly down to St. John’s and 
                        elope on the beach.  

           He squeezes Kirsten’s hand and she blushes.

                                 RICK (CONT’D)
                        Super romantic.  At sunset, all 
                        that bullshit.  And we need you two 
                        to plan it.

                                 CHARLIE
                        We can do that.  We can totally do 
                        that.  Consider me J.Lo.  From her 
                        movie The Wedding Planner.  About 
                        planning weddings--

                                 HARPER
                             (cutting him off)
                        Whatever you need, we’ll make it 
                        happen.  When do you want to go?

                                 RICK
                        This Saturday.

                                 CHARLIE
                        That’s my birthday!

                                 RICK
                        I don’t care.  

                                 KIRSTEN
                        Harper, I’ll be gone for so long 
                        with little to do in the office, so 
                        maybe now’s a good time to prepare 
                        a draft of that soccer article you 
                        were weeping about.

                                 HARPER
                             (trying to hide her joy)
                        That’s-- yes.  Yeah.  I would love 
                        that.  I’ll do that.

           Harper tries to hide her joy but she can’t.  Kirsten smiles 
           happily.  Rick looks between them, not wanting to be outdone--

                                 RICK
                        Also Charlie you’re promoted.

                                 CHARLIE
                        What?
                                 RICK
                        Not now, I still need you to be my 
                        assistant.  But when we get back.  
                        You can train the new bastard for a 
                        few weeks so they can get up to 
                        your level.

           Charlie beams.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Absolutely.  Of course.

           He and Harper steal a look: holy shit. 

           INT. MCKELVY CAPITAL OFFICE - DAY

           Harper and Charlie walk out, trying to be cool, but as soon 
           as they’re out of sight of Rick’s office they freak out, 
           jumping up and down and whispering frantically--

                          HARPER
                                                         CHARLIE
           Oh my God!!
                                              Holy shit!!

           They hug.  The hug lasts that half-second too long that gives 
           you a drop in your stomach.  They pull away quickly.

                                 HARPER
                        You’re getting promoted!  Before 
                        your birthday! 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Dude!  You get to write an article!

           Harper inhales, eyes wide, excited but nervous, as Rick and 
           Kirsten walk out of Rick’s office. 

                                 RICK
                        Grab my bag, Charlie, we can work 
                        from the City Club today. 

           Charlie gives Harper his most excited look, then drops it to 
           look casual, grabs his bag and hurries after Rick.  

           INT. STEAM ROOM - CITY CLUB - DAY

           A few OLDER MEN men sit, eyes closed, sweating profusely.

           Rick enters in a towel.  Charlie follows him, also in a 
           towel, looking around like he’s in the North Pole.

           Rick sits on a bench, puts his arms back, and closes his 
           eyes.  Charlie sits next to him, legs swinging, just excited 
           to be there.  He keeps trying to catch someone’s eye to say 
           something, but everyone ignores him.  Eventually he closes 
           his eyes and tries to relax.
           INT. DINING ROOM - CITY CLUB - DAY

           Charlie follows Rick down a fancy food buffet, in a sea of 
           blue blazers and bloated rich guys.  

                                 RICK
                        We were smart to wait on Chef-Me.  
                        What we really want is to get in on 
                        the Series A.  Fuck angel 
                        investments. 
                             (taking a bite of bread)
                        And make sure my wife knows.

                                 CHARLIE
                        About Chef-Me?

                                 RICK
                        No, idiot, about the wedding.  And 
                        the date.  Six weeks before hers.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I was just gonna send her an 
                        invitation when I sent the rest 
                        out.... Do you want me to call her, 
                        or something? 

                                 RICK
                        No I’ll do it.
                             (then)
                        You know what?  Let’s send her 
                        flowers instead.  Some “fuck you” 
                        flowers.  Really big daisies.  She 
                        hates daisies.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Awesome.  What should they say?

                                 RICK
                        Say.... “I’m gonna beat you to the 
                        altar.  And I’m gonna fuck you 
                        harder tonight than I did last 
                        week.”

                                 CHARLIE
                             (a frozen beat)
                        What?

                                 RICK
                        Or maybe, “I’m getting hitched 
                        first, but you can come first.”  
                        No, that’s gross.  The first one.

                                 CHARLIE
                             (clearing his throat)
                        I just...I thought you were gonna 
                        marry Kirsten.
                                 RICK
                        We are.  And it better be  
                        spectacular.  Speaking of which, we 
                        need a ring, right?  Tomorrow you 
                        should go to a jewelry store and 
                        pick out something that looks 
                        expensive.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        Okay....

                                 RICK
                        Let me know when Kiki gets the 
                        flowers.  And tell Kirsten I’ve got 
                        a meeting tonight. 

           Rick picks up a lobster tail, frowning--

                                 RICK (CONT’D)
                        God the food here sucks.

           INT. KIRSTEN’S OFFICE - LATER

           Harper stands in the doorway, juggling papers as she goes 
           over the calendar.

                                 HARPER
                        The coders and designers will need 
                        a few days to prepare the mock-ups 
                        for your approval, so it’s pretty 
                        easy to clear next week. 

                                 KIRSTEN
                        I really don’t want to delay the 
                        launch.  Can we squeeze anything in 
                        this weekend?  

                                 HARPER
                        Totally, you just have Mary’s baby 
                        shower but I already declined--

                                 KIRSTEN
                        Ugh, I’ll go to that.

                                 HARPER
                        To the baby shower?  What about the 
                        moratorium?

                                 KIRSTEN
                        This time I’ll have something to 
                        talk about.  Or at least something 
                        they’ll wanna listen to.

           Harper rolls her eyes, but Kirsten’s face softens.
                                 KIRSTEN (CONT’D)
                        I love this job.  This site is my 
                        dream and I wouldn’t do a single 
                        thing differently.  But.... I was 
                        lonely.

           Harper freezes, totally thrown by this vulnerability--

                                 KIRSTEN (CONT’D)
                        Men don’t wanna date you when 
                        you’re beating them to a story.  I 
                        used to think there was something 
                        wrong with me.  That everyone else 
                        had found someone and I was the 
                        only loser alone.  But I wasn't 
                        going to meet the person for me 
                        until I'd done what I wanted and 
                        become the person I am.  
                             (a beat, then)
                        I know I’ve been a cunt to you.

                                 HARPER
                             (startled)
                        Oh my God, no you haven’t, don’t 
                        say that--

                                 KIRSTEN
                        Don’t be one of those women who 
                        can’t say “cunt.”  It’s just a 
                        word.  And I’ve been cunty.  Partly 
                        because you’re young and your skin 
                        bounces back and it annoys me.  But 
                        also because I think you’re 
                        talented.

                                 HARPER
                             (even more startled)
                        What?

                                 KIRSTEN
                        People are shitty to talented, 
                        driven women.  They’re gonna be 
                        awful to you.  So if I’m the most 
                        awful to you, when this testicle-
                        dominated shitstorm of an industry 
                        is hard on you, you’ll be prepared.  
                        And you’ll dominate. 

           Harper smiles, touched and a little stunned. 

                                 KIRSTEN (CONT’D)
                        Which is why I’m not gonna stop.  I 
                        asked for those wedding dress mock-
                        ups an hour ago. 

                                 HARPER
                        I’ve got them--
           She hurries out of the office, smile faltering, suddenly 
           feeling really guilty.

           INT. MCKELVY CAPITAL OFFICES - DAY

           Harper walks in. Charlie sees her and spins around in his 
           chair, trying to keep things light--

                                 CHARLIE
                        Okay so I just talked to the Caneel 
                        Bay Resort, and we can get them a 
                        sunset slot next Saturday and the 
                        second-best honeymoon suite--

                                 HARPER
                        Charlie, is this crazy?

                                 CHARLIE
                        What? 

                                 HARPER
                        It just feels like it’s getting out 
                        of hand.  They’re gonna link their 
                        bank accounts because we wanted 
                        some free time?  They don’t even 
                        know each other!  

                                 CHARLIE
                        That’s-- No!  They know each other. 
                        And they’re obviously happier 
                        together than they were apart.  
                        They both want to be married.  This 
                        is good for them!

           Harper takes a deep breath.

                                 HARPER
                        Okay.  Tell me about our flower 
                        choices.

           INT. “THE RUNDOWN” OFFICES - LATER THAT DAY

           Harper’s working when her phone rings.

                                 HARPER (ON PHONE)
                        Hello?

           EXT. STREET - DAY [INTERCUT]

           Charlie’s walking down the street on his cell--

                                 CHARLIE
                        Will you come and help me pick out 
                        the ring? 
                                 HARPER
                        No.  I’ve already stood up like 
                        four times today.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        Please?  You’re so good at this.  
                        You’re better at this than me.  I 
                        need your female expertise.

           INT. MCKELVY CAPITAL OFFICE - DAY

           Harper walks in.  She sees Rick in his office on the phone 
           and tiptoes over to Charlie’s desk.  She moves some papers 
           around, opens a drawer, searching for the credit card.  

           She finds a PHOTO of Suze and Charlie taking a goofy selfie 
           and picks it up for a second, until she hears Rick--

                                 RICK (O.S.)
                        No.  Because you look so hot in 
                        that dress I can’t concentrate.

           Harper looks over to Rick talking on the phone.  She smiles.  
           Then she frowns, thinking of something.  She takes out her 
           phone and checks Kirsten’s calendar: Kirsten’s in a meeting.  
           Harper thinks a beat, then picks up Charlie’s phone to hear:

                                 KIKI (O.S.)
                        You shouldn’t be concentrating on 
                        anything but my tits.

           Harper’s face falls.  That’s not Kirsten’s voice.

                                 RICK (ON PHONE)
                        What are you wearing right now?

                                 KIKI (O.S.)
                        The bra you bought me on our 
                        honeymoon.

                                 RICK (ON PHONE)
                        Did you get what Charlie sent you?

           Harper slams the phone down like it’s on fire.

           INT. JEWELRY STORE - DAY

           Harper walks in as Charlie talks with a RING SALESMAN at the 
           counter.  The Ring Salesman notices Harper--

                                 RING SALESMAN
                        Is this the lucky lady?
                                 CHARLIE
                             (turns and sees her)
                        Finally!  Okay, how does Kirsten 
                        feel about blood diamonds?

           Harper hands him the credit card, studying his face.

                                 HARPER
                        It was so weird, when I got the 
                        card, I heard Rick flirting with 
                        somebody on the phone, but I think 
                        Kirsten’s in a meeting.  What do 
                        you think that was?

           Harper watches Charlie go a little pale.  He clears his 
           throat, voice faltering--

                                 CHARLIE
                        I don’t know.  I bet he was leaving 
                        Kirsten a voice mail.  For her to 
                        hear later.  And be happy.

           Harper’s face falls.  Charlie tries to change the subject--

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Does she like topaz?

                                 HARPER
                        I don’t know?  Does Kiki like 
                        topaz?  She didn’t mention it when 
                        she and Rick were having PHONE SEX!

           She slams the counter and the rings go flying.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        How do you know about that?!

                                 HARPER
                        You are such a LIAR! 

                          CHARLIE
           Look, it was one time, it was 
           a mistake, it didn’t mean 
           anything--
                                                         HARPER
                                              After everything we did for 
                                              him?  We gave him everything 
                                              he wanted!

                                 CHARLIE
                        He’s confused!  He just needed to 
                        get it out of his system before the 
                        wedding--

                                 HARPER
                        The WEDDING?!  They can’t get 
                        married!
                                 CHARLIE
                        Yes they can!  Harper, we can keep 
                        this from her...we control their 
                        schedule, their e-mail-- she never 
                        has to know.  

                                 HARPER
                        Are you being serious?  You would 
                        ruin someone’s life so you can hang 
                        out with a girl who treats you like 
                        shit and work longer hours at a job 
                        that doesn’t matter?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Whose life am I ruining?!  Your 
                        lonely boss?  She has no life!  
                        We’re giving her a husband!  

                                 HARPER
                        OH MY GOD.  You’re worse than Rick!  
                        Rick’s a selfish, superficial 
                        asshole, but he can’t help it.  
                        You’re better than that, you could 
                        be great, but you want to be an 
                        asshole.  You’re choosing to be a 
                        piece of shit!  You don’t care 
                        about anybody but yourself!  

                                 CHARLIE
                        Stop pretending this is some moral 
                        dilemma.  You're just scared not to 
                        be an assistant anymore.  You're 
                        going to ruin my life and their 
                        lives because you'd rather run 
                        around getting Kirsten coffee than 
                        actually have to write something.

           Harper flinches, stung.  She almost tears up, but reels it 
           back in, standing up straighter--

                                 HARPER
                        I’m telling Kirsten.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Harper--

                                 HARPER
                        The whole truth, ALL OF IT! 
                             (as she goes)
                        Congratulations on your promotion 
                        from assistant douchebag to full 
                        douchebag, and all before your 28th 
                        birthday! 

           She storms out, face crumpling.  Charlie watches her go, 
           pissed and confused.  Fuck.  A beat.
                                 RING SALESMAN
                             (pulling out another tray)
                        I’d be happy to show you our “I 
                        fucked-up” selection... 

           INT. BEAUTIFUL HOUSE - DAY

           A classy, sterile, mini-mansion covered in baby decorations.  

           Harper enters, holding a present, and glides through clumps 
           of LADIES in pastels laughing and drinking.  She spots 
           Kirsten across the room, talking to a crowd of WOMEN.  

           Kirsten sees Harper and gives her a confused smile.  Harper 
           gestures -- “I need to talk you” -- and Kirsten excuses 
           herself and walks over to her.

                                 HARPER
                        I’m so sorry to just show up, you 
                        forgot the present--

                                 KIRSTEN
                        Honestly, you saved me.  If I hear 
                        one more woman talk about how much 
                        their nipples have changed since 
                        giving birth, I’ll kill myself.  I 
                        swear to God, Harper, I walked in 
                        here with a fiance and it’s like 
                        suddenly I was a member of a club.  

           She says it like it’s a bad thing but she’s clearly happy.  
           They get to a corner away from everybody else.

                                 KIRSTEN (CONT’D)
                        All they wanna talk about is when 
                        I’m gonna have kids.  I told them, 
                        first I have to learn to be a 
                        stepmother--

                                 HARPER
                             (blurting it)
                        Rick is cheating on you.

           Kirsten freezes.  A beat.

                                 KIRSTEN
                        What?  

                                 HARPER
                        He’s sleeping with his ex-wife.  
                        I’m so sorry.  
                             (quickly)
                        But it’s actually not as bad as it 
                        seems!  Because you don’t actually 
                        like him.
                                 KIRSTEN
                        What are you talking about?

                                 HARPER
                        This whole thing-- it’s not real.  
                        His assistant and I, we.... we set 
                        you up.  We made you think you 
                        liked each other.  We shut down the 
                        elevator.  So you’d meet.  And the 
                        game!  The Dodgers game wasn’t 
                        real, we made you meet there and 
                        the Kiss Cam, that was me.  

           Kirsten flinches at each memory, but Harper doesn’t notice--

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        Even Ojai, we sent the flowers, we 
                        did the meal...  The whole 
                        relationship... it isn’t real.  You 
                        don’t even know him.  I know you 
                        better than Rick does.  What you 
                        feel for him, it’s not real.  
                             (desperate)
                        So it’s not as bad....

           Kirsten’s face stays completely still.  Another long beat.  
           Harper waits, scared.  Then, calmly--

                                 KIRSTEN
                        You’re fired.

           Harper winces as Kirsten holds her head up and walks away.

           INT. FOYER - MINI MANSION - DAY

           Harper walks out, crying, and passes a group of KIRSTEN’S 
           FRIENDS gossiping by the appetizers.

                                 KIRSTEN’S FRIEND 
                        I think it’s a financial thing.  
                        They get married and he can put all 
                        his bad assets in Kirsten’s name. 

           The others laugh.  Harper stops.

                                 KIRSTEN’S FRIEND #2
                        She’s acting like she invented 
                        getting engaged.  It’s like, I’ve 
                        been engaged three times.  It’s not 
                        that hard.

                                 KIRSTEN’S FRIEND #3
                        I just hope her vows include 
                        working all the time and leaving 
                        him at home to jerk off.
                                 HARPER
                        Excuse me?

           The women turn.  

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        You’re lucky to even be Kirsten’s 
                        friend.  Do you have any idea what 
                        a big deal she is?  What she’s done 
                        for sports journalism?  I can tell 
                        you don’t because if you did you 
                        would WORSHIP her.  And she still 
                        comes to your shitty showers and 
                        parties and brunches-- Carol, she 
                        spent four hours at your water 
                        birth.  She’ll never be able to 
                        unsee that.  She’s tough and she’s 
                        smart and she doesn’t put up with 
                        any bullshit and I want to be just 
                        like her when I’m older.  In some 
                        ways. Not in every way, but in a 
                        lot of them-- most of her qualities 
                        are great.  And you’re all a bunch 
                        of c--

           She tries to say “cunts” but she can’t get it out.

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        C--hmmmmm.  Damnit-- 
                             (furious, but can’t do it)
                        C-words.  You’re all a bunch of C-
                        words.
                             (then, just as mad)
                        This home is beautiful thank you 
                        for having me.

           She grabs an appetizer from the plate by the door, glares at 
           them one more time, and storms out to the door.  

           She passes a hallway where Kirsten stands, hidden, having 
           heard the entire exchange.

           INT. MCKELVY CAPITAL OFFICE - THE NEXT DAY

           Charlie fidgets at his desk, waiting for Rick.  Rick finally 
           walks in and Charlie sits up, nervous, but--

                                 RICK
                        Good morning!  Is this mine?

                                 CHARLIE
                             (very confused)
                        Uh, yeah.  Yes.
                             (then, fishing)
                        So your tickets are all set for 
                        tomorrow.  For the wedding....
                                 RICK
                        Great.

                                 CHARLIE
                        A car will pick you and Kirsten up 
                        from the building?

           Rick just goes into his office.  Charlie watches him, even 
           more confused.  

           INT. HARPER & BECCA’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Harper’s sprawled on the couch in her bathrobe and 
           sweatpants, staring at a blank page blinking on her laptop.  
           Becca walks out of her room, surprised to see her.  

                                 HARPER
                             (trying to sound excited)
                        I got fired!

                                 BECCA
                        THAT’S AMAZING!

           Harper bursts into tears.  Becca hurries over.

                                 HARPER
                        I spent a year there and didn’t 
                        write a single thing and now 
                        Kirsten hates me and will never 
                        help me.  I wasted all that time.  
                             (gesturing to her laptop)
                        And I’m bad.  I’m bad at this.  I 
                        have been trying to write the same 
                        article for months and it’s so bad 
                        I can’t even finish it.

           She starts crying again.  Becca leans in to hug her, then 
           shoves her instead.  Harper looks up, surprised--

                                 BECCA
                        Of course your first draft is bad. 
                        It’s gonna be terrible. And then 
                        you make it better.  But you can’t 
                        make it better until you do it.  

           That hits Harper. She sits back.

                                 BECCA (CONT’D)
                        You learned a lot from that 
                        psychopath, you’ve just never had 
                        time to actually use it.  And now 
                        you do.  So go do it!

                                 HARPER
                        Okay.  
                                 BECCA
                        Okay!

                                 HARPER
                        I’m gonna go write the shittiest 
                        thing I’ve ever written.

                                 BECCA
                        It’s gonna suck ass!  I can’t wait 
                        to read it!

           Harper grabs her laptop, kisses Becca on the cheek, and 
           sprints out of the apartment.

           INT. CACTUS CANTINA MEXICAN RESTAURANT - DAY

           Harper marches into the restaurant, still in her bathrobe.  
           She slams into a seat at the bar and opens her laptop.  

                                 HARPER
                        I’m not leaving this chair until I 
                        write an entire article.  

                                 CACTUS CANTINA WAITER
                        That’s great.  That’s great news 
                        for me.

                                 HARPER
                        Free chips and water, please! 

           INT. MCKELVY CAPITAL OFFICE - DAY

           Charlie stares at his phone, then picks it up, dials Harper-- 

                                 NEW INTERN (O.S.)
                        Hello?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Uh...is Harper there?

                                 NEW INTERN (O.S.)
                        Who’s Harper?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Kirsten’s assistant.

                                 NEW INTERN (O.S.)
                        I’m Kirsten’s assistant.  Can I 
                        help you with something?

           Charlie slams the phone down.
           INT. CACTUS CANTINA MEXICAN RESTAURANT - DAY

           Harper types maniacally.  The Waiter approaches, so 
           frustrated.  Harper notices him and realizes--

                                 HARPER
                        Oh, God, I should probably eat 
                        something.

           She pulls a GRANOLA BAR out of her bag and opens it.  She 
           stuffs it in her mouth and goes back to typing--

                                 HARPER (CONT’D)
                        Keep that water coming! 

           INT. DELFINE’S - THAT NIGHT

           A condescending HOST leads Charlie and Suze through an 
           unbearably fancy restaurant.  Charlie tugs at his nicest 
           suit.  Suze’s dress catches every eye in the room.  She takes 
           Charlie’s hand, thrilled--

                                 SUZE
                        I’ve always wanted to eat here!

           Charlie smiles.  They arrive at a tiny table shoved awkwardly 
           in the back corner.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Oh.  I think we requested a table 
                        by the window, actually...

                                 DELFINE’S HOST
                        I think you’re mistaken.

           The Host leaves.  Charlie frowns, annoyed, but sits.  

           INT. CACTUS CANTINA MEXICAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           The restaurant’s pretty empty.  Harper types a last sentence 
           and sits back, surprised.

                                 HARPER
                        I finished.  
                             (a beat)
                        I FINISHED!  

           She grabs two handfuls of chips and crushes them in her hands 
           like she’s the Hulk.  Then she realizes something.  She 
           checks the time, then shoves her computer in her bag--

                                 CACTUS CANTINA WAITER
                        Nope.  Not again--
                                 HARPER
                        I actually do have to be somewhere!  
                        I really have to go! 

                                 CACTUS CANTINA WAITER
                        YOU HAVE TO ORDER SOMETHING!!

           INT. DELFINE’S - NIGHT

           Suze picks up her wine glass to cheers--

                                 SUZE
                        Happy birthday, baby.  28 is going 
                        to be the best year.

           Charlie manages a smile.  He takes a bite of his steak and 
           chews, unimpressed.  Suze takes a bite and moans.

                                 SUZE (CONT’D)
                        Oh my God.  This is the best meal 
                        I’ve ever had.  

           Charlie watches her, realizing something.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        The best meal I ever had was a $5 
                        piece of pizza that was thrown up a 
                        fire escape.

                                 SUZE
                        What?

           He looks around the restaurant, the fancy tablecloths and 
           stuffy people... 

                                 CHARLIE
                        I don’t want this anymore.

                                 SUZE
                        Do you want to order something 
                        else?

                                 CHARLIE
                        No.  Delfine’s sucks.  That guy is 
                        an asshole and everything’s too 
                        quiet in here and this steak is 
                        delicious but it’s not worth $70.  
                        I could buy two bikes for that.
                             (then)
                        I don’t want to want to be an 
                        asshole.

                                 SUZE
                        What are you talking about?
                                 CHARLIE
                        If my 15 year-old self was here he 
                        would punch me in the dick.  But I 
                        can’t do this anymore, Suze.  

           Suze is literally shocked.  Charlie stands.

                                 SUZE
                        But-- that-- you’re my backup.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I know.  And you’re gonna find 
                        someone much hotter and more 
                        appropriate for you and be happier.  

           He kisses her on the cheek and hands her his credit card.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Order whatever you want, on me.
                             (leaves, then turns back)
                        What the fuck am I doing, you’re 
                        not my girlfriend anymore, gimme 
                        that.  I’m not a Rockefeller! 

           He snatches the card back and sprints away.

           EXT. DEFLINE’S - NIGHT

           Charlie races over to the VALET GUY, waving his ticket--

                                 CHARLIE
                        I need my car!  This is an 
                        emergency!  I have to get to the 
                        airport to stop someone from 
                        getting married!   

           The Valet Guy just stares at him.  Charlie checks his watch.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Oh, actually, I have plenty of 
                        time.  The flight’s not for another 
                        four hours.  
                             (a long awkward beat)
                        How’s your night going so far?

           INT. CHARLIE’S CAR - NIGHT

           Charlie calmly drives towards the airport.  He passes the far-
           away DISCOUNT PARKING LOT and shrugs--

                                 CHARLIE
                        I got time.
           EXT. PARKING LOT SHUTTLE BUS STOP - NIGHT

           Charlie waits as the SHUTTLE BUS pulls up to the parking lot.  
           He lets an OLDER LADY board before him--

                                 CHARLIE
                        Please, go ahead.

           INT. AIRPORT STARBUCKS - NIGHT

           Charlie steps up to the Barista, pondering the menu--

                                 CHARLIE
                        What’s the difference between an 
                        Americano and a latte, again?

           INT. AIRPORT BOOKSTORE - NIGHT

           Charlie sips his coffee and flips through a book.  An 
           EMPLOYEE approaches--

                                 AIRPORT BOOKSTORE EMPLOYEE
                        Sir, we’re closing in five minutes.

                                 CHARLIE
                             (checks his watch)
                        I did the dick-around thing! 

           He sprints off.

           INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - NIGHT

           Charlie hurries through people waiting to go through 
           security.  He searches the crowd, frantic, then finally sees 
           Rick and Kirsten in line and sprints over--

                                 CHARLIE
                        Kirsten!  Stop! 

           Rick and Kirsten turn, surprised to see him.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Rick, I quit.  And Kirsten, you 
                        can’t marry him, because he’s a 
                        huge dick.

                                 RICK
                        Thank you.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I said you are a huge dick, not you 
                        have a huge dick.  
                             (to Kirsten)
                        You deserve better than this.  
                                 RICK
                        Excuse me?

           Some of the crowd starts to realize what’s happening.

                                 TSA AGENT
                        Is this some sort of sick joke?

                                 RANDOM AIRPORT GUY
                        DO IT!  GO WITH THE YOUNG GUY! 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Oh, gross, no.  I mean-- not gross, 
                        she’s a handsome woman, but no--

                                 RICK
                        Charlie, I don’t know what you 
                        think you’re doing--

                                 HARPER (O.S.)
                        HEY!

           Charlie turns-- Harper’s on the other side of security, 
           waving at them, pissed.

                                 CHARLIE
                        What are you doing?!

                                 HARPER
                        I came to stop them!  I was worried 
                        I was gonna do the dick around 
                        thing so I bought a ticket to meet 
                        them at the gate and it was 
                        EXPENSIVE AS SHIT! 
                             (then)
                        Don’t do it, Kirsten!  You don’t 
                        have to settle for him! 

                                 RICK
                        What is going on?!

                                 CHARLIE
                             (turning to Kirsten)
                        I know we’ve never really met, but 
                        I know a lot about you.  Because 
                        Harper’s always talking about you.  
                        And even when Harper’s saying mean 
                        things, you can hear how much she 
                        admires you.  

                                 HARPER
                        You’re a badass, Kirsten!  Whatever 
                        you think you’re getting from doing 
                        this, you don’t need it.

           Kirsten’s armor starts to crack.  Rick takes her arm and 
           tries to move toward the gate--
                                 RICK
                        Charlie, you are fired as fuck.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I ALREADY QUIT!

           Kirsten stops him.

                                 KIRSTEN
                        What’s my favorite food?

           On instinct, Rick looks to Charlie.  Charlie glares at him.

                                 RICK
                        Steak tartare--

                                 HARPER
                        IT’S GREEN CURRY YOU DOUCHETARD!

                                 KIRSTEN
                        Where’s my favorite place?

           Rick starts to say something, but he’s got nothing.  

                                 KIRSTEN (CONT’D)
                        It’s Squam Lake, New Hampshire, you 
                        douchetard.

                                 RICK
                        Kirsten, this is ridiculous--

           Kirsten takes her bag from Rick’s hand, puts her shoulders 
           back, clears her throat, and takes a deep breath.

                                 KIRSTEN
                        Harper?  Can you remove the wedding 
                        from my calendar?

                                 HARPER
                        Absolutely!

                                 KIRSTEN
                        Thank you.

           Charlie smiles.  The crowd CHEERS and starts chanting--

                                 CROWD
                        KISS!  KISS!

                                 CHARLIE
                        Ew, no.  Again, not “ew,” just, 
                        this is not a sexual thing--

           Kirsten marches away with her rolling bag.  Rick chases her.

                                 RICK
                        Kirsten!  Stop!  
           Charlie watches them go, then turns to Harper, but Harper’s 
           already walking away.

                                 CHARLIE
                        HARPER!

           Harper turns back.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        I, um-- I broke up with Suze.

                                 HARPER
                        Congratulations.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I’m sorry I was an asshole.

                                 HARPER
                        It’s fine.

                                 CHARLIE
                        It’s not fine!  Don’t say it’s 
                        fine.  
                             (then)
                        Do you want to get a pizza?

                                 HARPER
                             (a beat, then, sadly)
                        No.

           She turns and walks away.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Harper....

           Her face falls but she doesn’t turn around.  

           INT. CHARLIE & DUNCAN’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Duncan and Charlie pack up the apartment, moving boxes 
           everywhere.  Duncan puts all of the kitchen stuff in a box 
           marked “Duncan.”  Charlie puts a single chipped cereal bowl 
           in a tiny box marked “Charlie.”  

           INT. “THE RUNDOWN” OFFICES - DAY

           Harper walks into the empty office with a cardboard box for 
           her things.  She gets to her desk and starts packing up her 
           few personal items, then stops, surprised, when she sees 
           Kirsten walking out of her office, frantic.

                                 HARPER
                        Hi--
                                 KIRSTEN
                        Thank God you’re here.  I can’t 
                        find that article on lesbian soccer 
                        players in Nigeria.

                                 HARPER
                        It’s probably still in your 
                        downloads folder.

                                 KIRSTEN
                        Also, I can’t find Geoff’s number.

                                 HARPER
                        You made me change his name to 
                        “Satan” in your contacts.

                                 KIRSTEN
                        Also, come back to work.

                                 HARPER
                             (a surprised beat)
                        What?

                                 KIRSTEN
                        You crossed every line, ever.  Last 
                        week I genuinely considered setting 
                        you up for a white collar crime and 
                        letting you rot in jail.

           Kirsten glares at her, but there’s a warmness to it.

                                 KIRSTEN (CONT’D)
                        But I...understand, in some ways, 
                        what you were trying to... you’re a 
                        smart girl.
                             (then)
                        Also I have no idea how you did all 
                        of this and I can’t do it without 
                        you.  This place is falling apart.  
                        Come back and do this with me.

                                 HARPER
                        I learned so much from you and 
                        admire you so much...but by my age 
                        you were already starting your own 
                        magazine, because that’s what you 
                        wanted to do, and I want to be a 
                        writer.  So I think I need to 
                        write.  But I’d love to help you 
                        find a new assistant.

                                 KIRSTEN
                        You’re fired again.  I hate you.

           Harper nods and turns to go.  Kirsten calls after her--
                                 KIRSTEN (CONT’D)
                        Harper! 
                             (Harper turns back)
                        Do you have a first draft?
                             (off Harper’s confusion)
                        Of your article.

                                 HARPER
                        Yes!  Yes.  

                                 KIRSTEN
                        Send it to me.  We can go over it 
                        and when it’s in good enough shape, 
                        I’ll send it to some friends.

           Harper beams and nods.  

           INT. CHARLIE’S NEW APARTMENT - DAY

           A much smaller studio.  Charlie unpacks his lone box, 
           drinking a beer.  Someone knocks on the door and Charlie goes 
           to open it-- it’s Rick.  

                                 CHARLIE
                        What do you want?

                                 RICK
                        You live here?  
                             (looking around)
                        This is disgusting.

           Charlie starts to close the door but Rick stops it.

                                 RICK (CONT’D)
                        I need some information.  On my 
                        wife.  My ex-wife. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Like what?

           Rick clears his throat and pulls out a notebook.

                                 RICK
                        Assorted favorites, like food or 
                        flowers or clothing.  Ideal 
                        vacations or romantic gestures.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Are you serious?

                                 RICK
                        I should know these things, but you 
                        always did them for me. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        I know.
                                 RICK
                             (awkwardly)
                        And I want her back.

           Charlie’s shocked -- for the first time Rick looks a tiny bit 
           vulnerable.  Charlie softens.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I have an old Kiki folder.  I’ll 
                        send it to you.

                                 RICK
                        I’d really appreciate that.

           Charlie nods.  Duncan walks up with an iced coffee.  

                                 DUNCAN
                        Rick!  How are you?
                             (to Charlie)
                        You don’t work for him anymore, 
                        right?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Nope.

           Duncan tosses his iced coffee on Rick’s shirt.  Rick recoils, 
           shocked, as Duncan walks past him into Charlie’s apartment.

                                 DUNCAN
                        This place is great!

           Charlie gives Rick a salute and closes the door.

           INT. HARPER & BECCA’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Becca reads her laptop on the couch when Harper walks in.

                                 BECCA
                        How’d it go?

                                 HARPER
                        She’s gonna help me with my story 
                        and then send it to a few people.

                                 BECCA
                        That’s amazing!!

                                 HARPER
                        Yeah!  It’s awesome.  

           Harper’s trying to be excited but she sounds miserable. Becca 
           watches her for a beat, then jumps up.

                                 BECCA
                        Let’s go, we’re getting free chips.
           INT. CACTUS CANTINA MEXICAN RESTAURANT - DAY

           Harper walks in, talking to Becca behind her.

                                 HARPER
                        I honestly think I cry harder at 
                        the speech Murray gives when he 
                        loses Wimbledon.  Because it’s so--

           Harper freezes-- Charlie’s sitting at the bar.  He looks up, 
           just as surprised.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Did Duncan invite you, too?

           Harper turns, but Becca’s gone.  Harper looks outside and 
           just catches Becca getting into Duncan’s car.  

                                 BECCA
                        GO!!

           Duncan floors it and Becca leans out the window as they 
           squeal away--

                                 BECCA (CONT’D)
                        Just make up and make out!!  You’re 
                        driving us crazy!!!

           Harper and Charlie watch them go, stunned.  Harper turns back 
           to Charlie.  She thinks a beat.  Then sits at his table.  
           Charlie clears his throat, nervous.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I like you so, so much.  You’re not 
                        hard to get, at all.  But you’re 
                        hard to earn.  And that’s better.

           Harper doesn’t say anything for a long time.

                                 CHARLIE (CONT’D)
                        Is this the good kind of silence--

                                 HARPER
                        You displayed a total lack of 
                        character when it mattered.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I know.

                                 HARPER
                        You have the sexual and romantic 
                        personality of a seventh grader. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        I don’t think a seventh grader, I 
                        think at least high school--
                                 HARPER
                        You wear suits to sports games.

           Charlie realizes what she’s doing.  He starts smiling.

                                 CHARLIE
                        You can be really judgmental.

                                 HARPER
                        You’re terrible at beer pong.

                                 CHARLIE
                        You’ve never used less than four 
                        exclamation points.

           A beat.  Harper’s trying her hardest to hide it but she can’t 
           help smiling.  Finally she shrugs--

                                 HARPER
                        And yet....

           Charlie leaps over the table and kisses her.  Harper throws 
           her arms around him and they make out, oblivious to the 
           world.  The Waiter walks over.

                                 CACTUS CANTINA WAITER
                        I mean, this is not your home.  
                        This is a public space.  That-- 
                        keep your feet on the floor.

           Charlie picks Harper up onto the table, swiping it clear and 
           sending a bowl of chips CRASHING to the ground as we--

                                                              FADE OUT.
