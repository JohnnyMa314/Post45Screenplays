                                                            OVER BLACK:

           The cheery, adventurous melody of a CARTOON THEME SONG.

           INT. MASON’S BEDROOM - MORNING

           Dark and dramatic. Band posters erratically pinned to every 
           surface. Obsessive. Chaotic. A teenager’s realm.

           The cartoon theme song is coming from the room next door, 
           waking MASON MULLIGAN, 16. Sweating. Shaking. Reaching for a 
           BOTTLE OF PILLS at his bedside, we see a peripherally 
           inserted central catheter (PICC) line in his arm.

           Mason sits up and swallows the pill. Then a different one. 
           And another. He runs down a line of medications by rote. 

           He pushes the jet-black hair out of his face, revealing a 
           shock of bright green that distracts from his weak pallor. 

           Mason hits PLAY on his iPod to drown out the merry melody 
           with angsty rock as he musters the strength to get up.

           Grabbing some floor clothes, he finds a used HOSPITAL 
           BRACELET beneath. He adds it to a collage on the wall. 
           There’s a lot of them. He smells the clothes and shrugs.

           INT. MULLIGAN HOUSE - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Dressed in the floor clothes, Mason heads down the stairs, 
           but his foot hits a stray COMIC BOOK, slipping on the pages. 
           He takes a rough spill on the steps, grabbing the railing. 

           Wincing, he gathers himself. Until he sees what he slipped 
           on. There’s no love between Mason and comics. He grabs the 
           comic and storms upstairs, barging through another door. 

           INT. WYATT’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Mason busts in, causing his brother WYATT, 14, to scramble to 
           cover up what he’s doing in bed.

                                 WYATT
                        You don’t just open doors!

           Mason grabs the bed covers and yanks them off, revealing 
           COMICS and PADS and PENCILS. Wyatt tries to hide a cartoon 
           he’s drawn of HIMSELF MAKING OUT WITH SPIDER-MAN. 

                                 MASON
                        He chose this crap over us.
           He flings the comic he’s holding at Wyatt and walks out. 
           Wyatt picks it up, smoothing the pages to reveal the title, 
           “Hammerspace,” by HENRY MULLIGAN. 

           The same title splashes across the cartoon on his TV.

           INT. MULLIGAN HOUSE - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Mason’s mother ELLEN, 45, is frazzled. She’s on the phone, 
           has paperwork out, an open laptop, and is making something 
           resembling breakfast.

                                 ELLEN
                             (into phone)
                        Yes, I’ve been on hold for ten 
                        minutes. I just want to speak to 
                        someone about payment options.

           Mason enters, casually dodging around Ellen’s frantic 
           movements like it’s a dance they do regularly.

                                 ELLEN (CONT’D)
                             (into phone)
                        A payment plan. Yes. Preferably one 
                        where I don’t have to plan to pay. 
                        No don’t put me on... hold.
                             (to Mason)
                        Where’s your brother?

           Mason starts flipping through the paperwork just long enough 
           to see the OVERDUE BILLS FROM THE ONCOLOGY UNIT. 

                                 MASON
                        Doodling himself in bed.

           She looks at him funny, then hangs up and snatches the bills 
           away, embarrassed, but hiding it. She sits him at the table. 

                                 ELLEN
                        You have to eat. 
                             (her phone buzzes a text)
                        Shit.

                                 MASON
                        But I don’t want to eat shit.

                                 ELLEN
                        What? Oh. Clever. 

           She hands him his food. It’s unappetizing, but she’s trying.
                                 ELLEN (CONT’D)
                        I finally get a buyer to come see 
                        that godforsaken roller rink and 
                        Larry double books me with open 
                        houses. He knows we have an 
                        appointment.

                                 MASON
                        I can show the rink.

                                 ELLEN
                        Maybe I can close the Putnam 
                        property early.

                                 MASON
                        I need to get out of the house.

                                 ELLEN
                        I’ll just have to reschedule.

                                 MASON
                        MOM. Let me do it! 

                                 ELLEN
                        Sweetie. I appreciate the offer, 
                        but I just don’t want you over -

                                 MASON
                        - doing anything that would make me 
                        feel the least bit normal? I feel 
                        good today. Let me be useful.

           Ellen isn’t convinced, but her phone buzzes again. 
           Overwhelmed, she hands him a set of keys.

                                 ELLEN
                        Just show him around. Have him call 
                        me with questions. I’ll pick you up 
                        here at four, okay?

           Mason eyes the hidden bills again. She turns his eyes to her.

                                 ELLEN (CONT’D)
                        That’s my business. You understand? 
                        Your business is getting better. So 
                        take it easy on that bike.

           She kisses his forehead, struggling to let him do this. He 
           hands her bag to her and they both head out. 

           A beat later, Wyatt comes downstairs. Totally forgotten.

                                 WYATT
                        Hello?
           EXT. CARMEL, NEW YORK - DAY

           Mason coasts through this little hamlet on his bike. Past 
           parks and ponds, he shuts his eyes in the breeze. Freedom.

           HONK. He opens his eyes to dodge a car. He skids to a stop, 
           nearly falling off. When he recovers, he sees some KIDS HIS 
           AGE laughing at the near-miss. There’s a CUTE GIRL smiling. 

           He goes to wave, but his sleeve pulls up, revealing his PICC 
           line. He pulls his sleeve down as another boy starts flirting 
           with the girl. Not a care in the world. Must be nice.

                                 MALLORY (O.C.)
                        She thinks she’s so mature because 
                        she’s hanging with older boys.

           Mason cringes and turns to see MALLORY BARNES, 15, and 
           wearing too much Hammerspace merchandise for one human being.

                                 MALLORY (CONT’D)
                        But maturity is more a state of 
                        mind. Don’t you think? Like, a 
                        search for greater meaning. 
                        Intellectual curiosity. Finding the 
                        poetry within what others find 
                        trivial.

                                 MASON
                             (told her a million times)
                        I don’t read the comics. I don’t 
                        watch the show. I have no comment.

           Mason gets on his bike again. But he’s winded and goes so 
           slow that Mallory can keep up on foot if she hurries.

                                 MALLORY
                        Well as president of the Putnam 
                        County Hammerspace Fan Club, it’s 
                        my duty to make sure no one 
                        harasses you or your family.  

           Mason notes the irony. Behind him, Wyatt approaches on his 
           skateboard, spots Mallory, and quickly rolls by unseen. 

                                 MALLORY (CONT’D)
                             (super serious)
                        Don’t you sometimes think 
                        Hammerspace is just a metaphor for 
                        the existential dread we all feel 
                        when faced with the uncertain 
                        realities of infinite nothingness?

           Mason stops his bike and blinks at her, dumbfounded.
                                 MASON
                        It’s just a cartoon.

           Mallory’s mouth drops. Her phone comes out. She queues up an 
           episode of the Hammerspace cartoon, featuring its adorable 
           “Hello Kitty meets big-eyed alien” protagonist PUNCHY.

                                 MALLORY
                        JUST a cartoon? You clearly haven’t 
                        seen season two episode four in 
                        which Punchy throws a party...

           She looks up. Mason is already down the road. 

                                 MALLORY (CONT’D)
                        ... and nobody shows up.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Mason rides through town, but a familiar SKATEBOARD rolls out 
           of an alley in front of him, causing him to crash.

           INT. BACK ALLEY - CONTINUOUS

           Wyatt is cornered by much bigger TRAVIS BUNK and his geeky 
           cronies, JAY and MILO. Travis shoves Wyatt against a wall.

                                 TRAVIS
                        Your review of Guardians of the 
                        Galaxy 2 got more retweets than 
                        mine. That’s a total violation of 
                        my cred in the blogosphere.

                                 WYATT
                        I’ve been reading those comics for 
                        years. It’s not my fault you’re a 
                        bandwagon geek.

           Jay and Milo gasp in shock. Travis seethes.

                                 JAY
                             (to Travis)
                        You gonna let this little fag get 
                        away with besmirching you?

           Milo shoves Jay, totally offended.

                                 MILO
                        Hey! Would you call me a fag?
                                 JAY
                        I meant fag like loser, not fag 
                        like gay. He just happens to be 
                        both.

                                 MILO
                        Then call him a loser. Don’t 
                        degrade me by insulting him. It’s 
                        counterproductive.

                                 TRAVIS
                             (to Jay and Milo)
                        You guys are ruining my glory!
                             (to Wyatt)
                        I got you something to retweet.

           He punches Wyatt in the stomach. Wyatt drops to his knees.

                                 MASON (O.C.)
                        When did geek-on-geek violence 
                        become a thing?

           They turn to see Mason, holding Wyatt’s skateboard.

                                 TRAVIS
                        Hey look, it’s The Fault in Our 
                        Stars.

                                 JAY
                             (sotto, offended)
                        I like that book.

                                 WYATT
                        Mason, I got this.

                                 MASON
                        What are they gonna do, hit a 
                        cancer kid?

           Travis shoves Mason hard into a wall. Mason drops the board 
           with the wind knocked out of him.

                                 TRAVIS
                        Why hit you when a gust of wind 
                        could knock you over?

           The skateboard rolls over to Wyatt, who flips it up and kicks 
           it at Jay and Milo, landing the wheels in their groins. 

           The bully geeks collapse in pain as Wyatt rolls the board and 
           stomps it just right, slamming it up into Travis’ face.
                                 TRAVIS (CONT’D)
                             (clutching a nose bleed)
                        Aw, man. This is gonna ruin my 
                        Comic Con makeup! This isn’t over!

           He scurries out of the alley. Jay and Milo limp after him.

                                 WYATT
                             (to Mason)
                        I told you I got this.

                                 MASON
                        What are you even doing here?

                                 WYATT
                        Mom texted me to check on you.

           Wyatt tries to help Mason up, but Mason swats him away.

                                 MASON
                        I don’t need your help. I’m the 
                        older brother. I’m supposed to be 
                        checking on you.

                                 WYATT
                        You think I like being sent after 
                        you? You think this is what I want 
                        my life to be like?

           Mason eases himself up, frustrated with his limitations.

                                 MASON
                        It won’t be an issue much longer.

           That stings. Wyatt doesn’t want to think about that. Mason 
           retrieves his bike, nursing his ego.

                                 MASON (CONT’D)
                        I can handle the rink by myself. 
                        Just go home.

           When Mason is gone, a TRASH CAN suddenly falls over. Wyatt 
           turns to find Mallory recording it all on her PHONE.

                                 MALLORY
                        I caught the whole thing on video. 
                        I could post it online to expose 
                        them if you want! You’re like a 
                        real-life hero.

           Wyatt watches his brother riding off. Shakes his head.

                                 WYATT
                        Heroes can actually save lives.
           EXT. ROLLER RINK - DAY

           Mason rides into an empty parking lot at the edge of town, 
           looking a lot worse for wear. He stops at an abandoned roller 
           rink, overgrown and out of touch with the times. 

           A VAN pulls up as Mason unlocks the door. Out pops the 
           bookish, inquisitive face of CHET STANLEY, 45. 

                                 CHET STANLEY
                        Oh. Hi, there. Chet Stanley. I’m 
                        looking for Ellen Mulligan.

                                 MASON
                        She couldn’t make it. I’m gonna 
                        show you around.

                                 CHET STANLEY
                        Oh, okay. Mind if I take pictures?

           INT. ROLLER RINK - MOMENTS LATER

           FLASH. Chet snaps a photo of the rink’s sound booth. Mason 
           looks around uneasily at the cavernous realm, scattered with 
           remnants of its mid-90s heyday. Haunted by bad memories.

                                 CHET STANLEY
                        So when was it last operational?

                                 MASON
                        I think the 90s? We’ve had it like 
                        five years. Never actually skated.

           FLASH. Chet snaps a photo of an open tape deck.

                                                                CUT TO:

           FLASH. Chet snaps a photo of the kitchen’s industrial fridge. 
           Mason fiddles nervously with his keys.

                                 CHET STANLEY
                        Did your father actually reside 
                        here? I think your mother mentioned 
                        that. He was some sort of 
                        cartoonist?

                                 MASON
                        Something like that.

           FLASH. Chet snaps a photo inside a microwave.

                                                                CUT TO:
           FLASH. Chet snaps a photo of an open bathroom stall. Mason is 
           finding this progressively weirder.

                                 CHET STANLEY
                        What could have drawn him to this 
                        location? Seems weirdly specific.

                                 MASON
                        Yeah. A lot of things seem weird.

           FLASH. Chet snaps a photo of a flushing toilet.

           INT. LOCKER ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           They’re walking down an aisle of lockers. Chet’s examining 
           random doors as he goes. Mason fumbles and drops his keys.

                                 CHET STANLEY
                        Your dad ever tell you about any... 
                        odd... happenings?

           Mason reaches under the lockers, pawing around for the keys. 
           But his hand lands on something else. He pulls out a HAMMER 
           SHAPED KEY, confused by the strange object.

                                 MASON
                        We didn’t talk much.

           He pockets it before Chet can see, then grabs his other keys.

           INT. OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           CARTOON SKETCHES pinned everywhere. Like a madman’s realm. 
           Mason can barely look at them. But Chet snaps pictures, fully 
           intrigued. Mason is increasingly more uncomfortable.

                                 MASON
                             (suspicious)
                        What did you say you were planning 
                        to do with this place?

           Chet spots an old FAMILY PHOTO, fascinated by something on 
           it. He pulls it down for a better look. 

                                 CHET STANLEY
                        Did he seem... different before he 
                        disappeared?

           He turns the photo to Mason, revealing that Henry scratched a 
           SMILEY FACE over his own. It’s disturbing. Mason takes it.
                                 MASON
                        I never told you he disappeared.
                             (realizing)
                        You’re not a buyer. What are you, 
                        another reporter? 

           Mason drops the photo and pushes Chet out of the office. Chet 
           keeps snapping pictures as he goes.

                                 MASON (CONT’D)
                        I thought you guys gave up on this 
                        years ago. There’s no story here! 
                        My dad is dead. 

                                 CHET STANLEY
                        Missing doesn’t mean dead! There’s 
                        more going on here than you think!

                                 MASON
                        Leave us alone!

           Mason shoves Chet out the exit. He watches from a window as 
           Chet snaps another photo before getting in his van to leave.

           One last look back at his father’s office. He’s done here.

           INT. MULLIGAN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER

           Mason drags himself inside, exhausted. He face plants on the 
           couch for a nap. Wyatt comes in and turns on the TV. Loudly. 

           Mason rolls over and grabs ANOTHER REMOTE, turning the TV 
           off. Wyatt turns it back on. LOUDER. 

           Mason turns it off again and throws a pillow at Wyatt. Wyatt 
           turns it on again and throws the pillow back.

           Mason sits up. A momentary standoff. They start throwing 
           anything they can at each other, ducking and diving. 

           Mason rolls off the couch and nails Wyatt with a pillow. 
           Wyatt retaliates, but Mason dodges, up on his feet. Smiling. 
           Until Wyatt sees Mason is standing on a BLANKET and yanks it.

           Mason FLIPS BACKWARDS in the air, hits his head on the TV, 
           and BOUNCES BACK the other direction, landing face-first.

                                 WYATT
                        Oh shit. Mason! 

           He runs over to him, horrified at what he’s done. But Mason 
           rolls over with an expression of utter shock. He’s fine.
                                 MASON
                        Did I just do a back flip?

           Mason sits up. Wyatt checks him for injuries. Nothing.

                                 ELLEN (O.C.)
                        What is going on in here?

           They turn to see their mom gaping at the mess. 

                           MASON
                                                          WYATT
           Nothing!
                                              Nothing!

           Ellen isn’t buying it, but it’s time to go.

           INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE - LATER

           Mason sits in a chair as a NURSE inserts an IV into his PICC 
           line. He’s still processing the weirdness in the living room. 
           Almost hopeful. Then he hears his mom and DOCTOR in the hall.

                                 ELLEN (O.C.)
                        But he’s been doing so much better. 
                        He was even on his bike today.

                                 DOCTOR (O.C.)
                        Sometimes patients get a surge of 
                        energy. But the cancer is 
                        aggressive. The prognosis hasn’t 
                        changed. I’d say he’ll be lucky to 
                        see Halloween this year.

           He’s still dying. The Nurse pats his arm comfortingly and he 
           tries to act like this isn’t a blow, but it is.

           INT. MULLIGAN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - MORNING

           Mason comes in to find Wyatt watching cartoons. 

                                 MASON
                        Is mom gone?

                                 WYATT
                        Yup.

           They both smile mischievously.

           EXT. MULLIGAN HOUSE - BACKYARD - MOMENTS LATER

           Mason and Wyatt stand opposite each other on the back porch.
                                 MASON
                        Okay. Just not the face.

           Wyatt picks up a FRYING PAN, preparing to hit Mason with it. 
           He swings, but Mason chickens out and runs.

           When he’s safely away, he turns around, only to see Wyatt, 
           standing on the porch, astounded. He drops the frying pan.

           Confused, Mason looks down, realizing he’s run a good twenty 
           feet off the porch and is now HANGING IN MID-AIR.

           As soon as he realizes this, he FALLS. 

           Landing on the ground, the Hammer Key drops out of his 
           pocket. Wyatt runs up to him, amazed.

                                 WYATT
                        Dude. You were like, flying!

                                 MASON
                        More like floating. Until I wasn’t.

                                 WYATT
                        Do it again!

                                                                CUT TO:

           Mason pumps himself up and runs straight off the porch again. 
           But this time he instantly crashes to the ground. It hurts.

           That’s when he notices the key in the grass. He picks it up.

                                 MASON
                        Hit me with the frying pan.

           Wyatt grabs the frying pan and hits him. Mason bounces back, 
           unharmed. They both look at the Hammer Key with wonder.

                                 WYATT
                        What is that? Where’d you get it?

                                 MASON
                        From Dad.

           INT. MULLIGAN HOUSE - KITCHEN

           Mid-dinner, the family picks at their meals. Everyone’s minds 
           occupied. Mason and Wyatt exchange looks, egging each other 
           to initiate a convo. Wyatt kicks Mason into action.
                                 MASON
                        You know, that guy I showed the 
                        rink to was asking a lot of 
                        questions about Dad.

                                 ELLEN
                        I’m so sorry you wasted your time.
                             (really upset)
                        I’m sorry I wasted your time.

                                 MASON
                        No, Mom, it’s not that. It’s 
                        just... I guess I don’t really know 
                        any of the answers myself.

                                 WYATT
                        Why did you guys buy that place?

                                 ELLEN
                        He said it inspired him. 

                                 MASON
                        It’s a dump.

                                 ELLEN
                        You’re looking for reason where 
                        there isn’t any. Henry wasn’t well. 
                        He struggled. His work just never 
                        connected. And when you got...

           She trails off, not wanting to go there.

                                 MASON
                        When I got sick. You can say it.

                                 ELLEN
                        I know I can say it. But I never 
                        want it to sound like it was your 
                        fault. It wasn’t. It was his fault.
                             (sighs)
                        Or maybe it was no one’s fault.

           Her boys look confused. She tries again.

                                 ELLEN (CONT’D)
                        The art thing wasn’t working out 
                        for him. He was helping me with 
                        some property sales and went out to 
                        the rink to get it in shape for me 
                        to show. But when he came back... 
                        he was different. He had all these 
                        ideas. Said he found his “muse” in 
                        there and that we should buy it.
           Ellen gets lost in a brief dose of nostalgia.

                                 ELLEN (CONT’D)
                        I’d never seen him so excited. So I 
                        thought it was worth the 
                        investment. In him and in whatever 
                        he wanted to make of that place. 
                        And for a while, things got better. 
                        He came up with Hammerspace and 
                        Cosmic Comics bought the rights. 
                        Money was coming in.
                             (nostalgia sours)
                        But he became obsessive. Reclusive. 
                        Turns out the deal he signed was a 
                        screw job. So he holed up in that 
                        rink. I tried to reach him, to help 
                        him. But he was just so unhappy. 
                        And then one day he was gone.

           She picks up the plates to take to the sink.

                                 ELLEN (CONT’D)
                        Now we’re stuck with that useless 
                        rink in the middle of a recession.

                                 MASON
                        Did he mention any odd happenings, 
                        you know, before he...?

                                 ELLEN
                        You’d have to ask Cosmic Comics. 
                        Pretty sure they were the last 
                        people he spoke to. Right before 
                        the restraining order.

           A flood of difficult memories washes over her.

                                 ELLEN (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry. I’m exhausted. I think 
                        I’m just gonna...

           She kisses them each on the head and goes up to her room. 
           Wyatt picks up a Hammerspace comic book, pointing out the 
           Cosmic Comics address. Mason was thinking the same thing.

                        You up for a field trip?

           INT. TRAIN - DAY

           Wyatt’s watching the scenery. Mason examines the Hammer Key.
                                 WYATT
                        Mom’s gonna kill us if she finds 
                        out we did this.
                             (looks at the key)
                        So, I’m thinking it’s either magic 
                        or alien. Maybe future tech, but 
                        that seems unlikely. 

                                 MASON
                        It all seems unlikely.

           Wyatt tries to touch the key, but Mason pulls it away.

                                 WYATT
                        Please don’t make me quote Spider-
                        Man. It’s beneath me.

                                 MASON
                        What are you talking about?

                                 WYATT
                        You need to read more comics.

           INT. MOTEL ROOM - SAME

           Chet opens a HAMMERSPACE COMIC, comparing an image of Punchy 
           to a series of old etchings, cave drawings, and Egyptian 
           hieroglyphics, all showing similar big-eyed creatures. 

           He looks up at a wall covered in RESEARCH. Newspaper 
           clippings of strange sightings. Reports of items mysteriously 
           vanishing and reappearing elsewhere. 

           He ends on Henry Mulligan’s photograph. He grabs his phone, 
           feverishly walking the line between brilliant and bonkers.

                                 CHET STANLEY
                             (into phone)
                        I’d like to speak with Agent 
                        Broder. This is Chet Stanley.
                             (bored muffled response)
                        I have pertinent information 
                        directly related to his-
                             (annoyed muffled response)
                        Yes. I know I’m not-
                             (annoyed muffled response)
                        But if you could just let him know 
                        that I may have found another-
                             (angry muffled response)
                        Yes. Of course he’s busy, but-
           They’ve hung up. Chet traces his finger across a world map, 
           pinned with each report, forming a FIBONACCI-STYLE PATTERN. 
           Henry’s photo completes it, pinned on the roller rink.

                                 CHET STANLEY (CONT’D)
                        - I may have finally found one.

           EXT. COSMIC COMICS BUILDING - DAY

           Mason and Wyatt approach the imposing glass door. 

           INT. COSMIC COMICS OFFICE - LATER

           They’ve been waiting in reception a long time. FLAT SCREENS 
           play the Hammerspace cartoon and Punchy product commercials, 
           like a new PUNCHY POGO STICK. Mason is in Hell.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Ms. Mathers will see you now.

           INT. VELMA MATHERS’ OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           The boys enter a vast, perfectly curated corner office with 
           floor to ceiling windows and a statuesque woman in high end 
           corporate attire, VELMA MATHERS, 58. She smiles tightly.

                                 VELMA MATHERS
                        I don’t usually see unscheduled 
                        visitors, but Henry Mulligan’s 
                        boys? Call me intrigued. I’m Velma 
                        Mathers, CEO of Cosmic Comics.

                                 MASON
                        Mason. And this is Wyatt.

                                 VELMA MATHERS
                        I can see the resemblance. Now, 
                        what has brought you all the way to 
                        the city just to see me?

                                 MASON
                        I want you to tell me about your 
                        dealings with my father.

           Velma looks uncomfortable, perhaps defensive. She gets up and 
           struts to the window, looking out over the city.

                                 VELMA MATHERS
                        Can you be more specific?
                                 WYATT
                        Why did you get a restraining 
                        order?

           Velma cocks her head, considering how to reply. She walks 
           over to a wall of featured comics properties, pausing at a 
           promotional poster of Hammerspace. She straightens it.

                                 VELMA MATHERS
                        At Cosmic Comics, we value our 
                        content creators. We kept Henry in 
                        the loop after securing the rights 
                        to Hammerspace because we thought 
                        he would be an asset. But Henry 
                        became... irrational. He refused to 
                        collaborate. Wouldn’t make 
                        necessary creative adjustments 
                        because he said, “that’s not how it 
                        is.” As if Hammerspace is a real 
                        thing. 

                                 WYATT
                        Is that why you shut him out? Cause 
                        he was losing it?

           Velma sits behind her imposing desk, crossing her arms.

                                 VELMA MATHERS
                        The last time I saw Henry, he 
                        pulled out a sledgehammer and 
                        smashed every piece of Hammerspace 
                        memorabilia on the premises. I 
                        don’t even know where he got that 
                        weapon. But he was obviously 
                        unstable. Security removed him, I 
                        had our lawyers void his contract, 
                        and enacted a restraining order 
                        against him. For the good of the 
                        brand.

                                 MASON
                        And his vision for Hammerspace 
                        wasn’t for the good of the brand?

                                 VELMA MATHERS
                        Creative differences are not 
                        uncommon in these situations. It’s 
                        just the nature of our business.

                                 WYATT
                        Your business is screwing over 
                        troubled artists?

           Velma stands up, politely having enough of this.
                                 VELMA MATHERS
                        Violently delusional artist. And 
                        no. He did that to himself. 
                             (she opens the door)
                        Please feel free to grab a Punchy 
                        Pogo Stick on your way out.

           INT. COSMIC COMICS - LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER

           Wyatt did, indeed, take a Punchy Pogo Stick. Mason is angry.

                                 MASON
                        I can’t believe you took that.

                                 WYATT
                        I can’t believe you have a magic 
                        power key. Life is unpredictable.

           Mason glares at Wyatt, then turns right into the closed glass 
           exit door... AND CRASHES RIGHT THROUGH IT.

           Mason stops on the other side, uninjured. He looks back to 
           see a hole in the glass in the EXACT OUTLINE OF HIS BODY. 

           Wyatt stands on the other side, examining the clean cut.

                                 WYATT (CONT’D)
                        Curiouser and curiouser.

           SECURITY shouts at them. Wyatt slips through the hole and 
           hops on his pogo stick, bouncing away. Mason follows.

           INT. MASON’S ROOM - MORNING

           Mason is sleeping soundly. Until Wyatt creeps in and sets 
           Mason’s iPod speakers super loud. He hits play. SONIC BOOM.

           The shock causes Mason to shoot up out of bed, into the air, 
           slamming against the ceiling, before crashing down to bed.

           Wyatt turns the iPod off and touches the Hammer Key, now 
           hanging from a string around Mason’s neck.

                                 WYATT
                        We really need to properly test 
                        your powers.

           Mason snatches the key away and hides it under his shirt.

                                 MASON
                        GET OUT!
           Ellen comes in to wrangle Wyatt. Mason looks worn out.

                                 ELLEN
                        Wyatt, don’t bother your brother.
                             (to Mason, concerned)
                        Are you okay?

                                 MASON
                        I hate that question.

                                 ELLEN
                        I’m driving Wyatt to school. I’ll 
                        try to check in on you between 
                        meetings. Breakfast is on the 
                        table. You have to eat.
                             (Wyatt silently warns 
                              Mason against it)
                        I want you to take it easy today, 
                        okay? 

           She kisses his forehead and heads out. Wyatt follows, but 
           pauses at the door, thoughtfully.

                                 WYATT
                        What do you think it’s a key to?

           He hears the car start outside. She’s leaving without him. 
           Again. He runs out the door.

           Mason waits for the front door to close before rushing 
           through his morning pill routine.

           EXT. ROLLER RINK - LATER

           Mason’s bike is propped up against the wall. 

           INT. LOCKER ROOM - LATER

           Mason searches the aisle where he found the key, but the 
           lockers all have orange “lock and take” keys on them.

           He crouches to look under the lockers again, spotting a track 
           of disturbed dust where something slid from the other side.

           Mason walks around until he’s directly across from LOCKER 17. 
           Unlike the other lockers, this one has a STRANGE KEY HOLE. He 
           pulls out the Hammer Key and it begins to GLOW AND SHAKE, 
           pulling towards the lock.

           The key clicks into place. A BRIGHT LIGHT illuminates from 
           within the locker. Mason tentatively turns the key.
           Locker 17 swings open in a burst of light. The locker seems 
           to warp and expand like a portal. 

           Mason stares into it, almost emotional. Like this is the 
           tunnel of light at the end of his life. He reaches up and 
           takes his own pulse. Still alive. This is real.

           He steps closer. But before he can get a good look, SOMETHING 
           JUMPS OUT, knocking him over and slamming the door shut. 

           When he regains his bearings, Mason hears MUSIC playing in 
           the rink. He puts the Hammer Key around his neck again.

           INT. ROLLER RINK - CONTINUOUS

           A late 80s/early 90s jam is blaring over the sound system.

           In the dim light from outside, Mason can just make out the 
           child-sized shape of SOMETHING moving around in the rink.

                                 VOICE
                        Everything is so messed up over 
                        there. I thought you’d never open 
                        that door again. 

           Mason grabs AN OLD SKATE to arm himself as he slowly circles 
           the rink, trying to get a better look.

                                 VOICE (CONT’D)
                        I missed my jams!

           Mason keeps his eyes on the dark, dancing silhouette.

                                 VOICE (CONT’D)
                        Are you even listening to me?
                             (beat)
                        Henry! Don’t be a grump!

           Mason throws the light switch. The rink explodes with 
           colorful lights, illuminating the talking creature. 

           Mason’s mouth drops. The creature freezes. If Hello-Kitty 
           were bred with an alien, this would be the result.

           About three feet tall, pure white with obsidian eyes and 
           lashes in a round featureless head, it has a pair of lumps 
           that look sort of like ears, mitten-style hands, and is 
           wearing tube top overalls with a large pocket on the front. 

           If Mason didn’t know better, he’d think this is a living, 
           breathing 3D version of Henry’s Hammerspace character PUNCHY. 
           But Mason tries to convince himself that he knows better.
                                 MASON
                             (to himself)
                        Okay. Okay. I’m dying. 
                             (steps into the rink)
                        That was the tunnel of light. But I 
                        didn’t go in. 
                             (moves closer)
                        So I’m alive. For now.
                             (closer still)
                        And I’m hallucinating. Because this 
                        isn’t real. That’s not real. That 
                        can’t be -

           He pokes Punchy. She’s squishy. And real. 

                                 MASON (CONT’D)
                        Punchy?

           Scared, she hits him in the gut, causing him to drop the 
           skate and hunch over so she can upper cut his face, sending 
           him flipping over in exaggerated fashion.

           When he lands, Punchy is on him, searching his body and 
           inadvertently tickling him until she finds the Hammer Key 
           tied around his neck. She gasps. Her eyes narrow.

                                 PUNCHY
                        Where did you get this? How did you 
                        know my name? Where is the Land 
                        Lord?

           Mason freaks out and tosses her off him, squirming backwards 
           against the rink wall. 

           Punchy lands on her squishy, tube-like feet, bouncing 
           backwards and crashing hard onto the rink floor, bonking her 
           head. She sits up, rubbing her head where it’s hurt.

                                 PUNCHY (CONT’D)
                             (weirdly happy about it)
                        Ow! Consequence.
                             (gets up and comes closer)
                        Do it again!

                                 MASON
                        Stay away! 
                             (Punchy pauses)
                        What are you? What is this?

                        I... I found the key in the locker 
                        room. I know your name because 
                        you’re a cartoon.

                                 PUNCHY

                                 MASON
                        That’s what I said.

                                 PUNCHY
                        No you didn’t.

                        I don’t know what a TOON is, but it 
                        sounds stupid and I’m not one. Now 
                        where is the Land Lord?

                                 MASON
                        Who’s the Land Lord?

                                 PUNCHY
                        Henry. The Land Lord. The Ruler of

                        This universe.

           Mason just blinks at her, not computing. Punchy bounces up 
           onto the rink wall to get a good look at his head.
                                 PUNCHY (CONT’D)
                        Maybe I hit you too hard. I’ve 
                        never met a small human before.

           Punchy is examining his head. Mason is still processing.

                                 PUNCHY (CONT’D)
                             (noticing the green hair)
                        Did I do this? Are you leaking?

                        If you say so.

           Mason stands up. They circle each other suspiciously.

                                 MASON (CONT’D)
                        How did he make you?

                                 PUNCHY
                        He didn’t make me. 

                                 MASON
                        He drew you. And now you’re here.

                                 PUNCHY
                        No. I was here, and then he drew 
                        me. A lot rounder than I am I might 
                        add. He’s not very good.

                                 MASON
                        Then where do you come from?

                        Again with this word. I don’t know

                        I came from Hammerspace. It’s 
                        another dimension. Connected to 
                        Human Space through that metal 
                        chamber.

           She points back towards the locker room.

           INT. LOCKER ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Mason runs in and stands in front of Locker 17 again. The 
           Hammer Key is being pulled towards it.

           Punchy bounces in, smacking the Hammer Key out of his hand.

                                 PUNCHY

                        He went missing. Was declared dead.

                             (in whispered awe)
                        The ultimate consequence.

                                 MASON
                        What?

                                 PUNCHY
                        Then you are the Land Lord now.

                                 MASON
                        What does that even mean?

                                 PUNCHY
                        You are the ruler of Human Space. 

           Mason looks down at this bizarre creature inexplicably 
           standing there talking to him saying these things. And he 
           suddenly bursts out laughing. He sits on a bench.

                                 MASON
                        I’m not even the ruler of my own 
                        space.

                                 PUNCHY
                        Then who rules this world? There 
                        are no other humans here.

                                 MASON
                        This is an abandoned roller rink. 
                        “Human Space” is an entire planet 
                        filled with people.
           Punchy gasps in shock and amazement.

                                 PUNCHY
                        There’s... more?

                                 MASON
                        Have you never looked out the 
                        window?

                                 PUNCHY
                        It’s just an empty lot. Henry said 
                        it’s where The Misery lives. And if 
                        we go out there, it will get us.

                                 MASON
                        Misery can reach you anywhere.

           Punchy is suddenly scared. Mason gets up and holds the Hammer 
           Key out to the lock, it’s involuntarily pulled in again. 
           Punchy shoves him away from the door again.

                                 PUNCHY
                        DON’T OPEN THAT!

           Mason stares at the locker, now lit up from within. He’s 
           nervous. Afraid of what the other side might hold.

                                 MASON
                        What if he went through there?

                                 PUNCHY
                        If a human were living in 
                        Hammerspace, I would know. 

           She pulls the key out of Locker 17. It goes dark again.

                                 PUNCHY (CONT’D)
                        We should never open that again. 
                        It’s better here. I’m staying. In 
                        fact, maybe we should just open it 
                        real quick and throw the key 
                        through so it closes forever.

                                 MASON
                        Why?

                                 PUNCHY
                             (duh)
                        The lock is only on this side.

           Mason is really struggling to keep up with her logic.

                                 MASON
                        How is this even possible?
                                 PUNCHY
                        I dunno. One day I was cleaning my 
                        room and found this locked door 
                        that wasn’t there before. I 
                        couldn’t open it since I didn’t 
                        paint it there. So I sat and 
                        watched it. And watched it. And 
                        watched it. And then it opened and 
                        there was Human Space and Henry and 
                        this wonderful new feeling.

           She intentionally slams her hand in another locker door, 
           hurting herself. But she smiles up at Mason.

                                 PUNCHY (CONT’D)
                             (happily)
                        Consequence!

                                 MASON
                        Great. A cartoon cutter.

                                 PUNCHY
                        I got cut once. And I did something 
                        called bleeding! It was amazing!

                                 MASON
                             (unnerved)
                        You don’t bleed in Hammerspace?

                                 PUNCHY
                        Have you bled since you got the 
                        Hammer Key?

                                 MASON
                             (realizing)
                        No.

           He grabs the key from her, examining it once more.

                                 PUNCHY
                        Let’s get rid of it!

           Mason swats her away, keeping the key and letting all of this 
           insanity wash over him. His phone RINGS. It’s Ellen.

                                 MASON
                             (into phone)
                        Hello?

                                 ELLEN (O.S.)
                        Mason! Where are you? I told you to 
                        take it easy today. I’m worried 
                        about you.
           Punchy climbs to the top of the lockers, jumps off, bounces 
           off her feet, and slams her head into the other side. She 
           lands on her butt, dazed, hurt, and smiling excitedly. 

                                 MASON
                        I am too.

                                 ELLEN (O.S.)
                        What? Why? Where are you? I’ll pick 
                        you up.

           Realizing she’d see Punchy, Mason snaps out of it.

                                 MASON
                        NO! No. I mean, I’m on my way.

           He hangs up. Punchy looks at his phone, curiously.

                                 PUNCHY
                        Who were you talking to? Henry had 
                        one of those but it just made noise 
                        and then he’d turn it off.

           Mason looks at Punchy, looks at Locker 17, looks at the 
           Hammer Key, and then calmly walks out the door.

           INT. ROLLER RINK - CONTINUOUS

           Mason shuts down the music, then the lights. Punchy is 
           following after him, confused.

                                 PUNCHY
                        My jams! Where are you going?

                                 MASON
                        Home.

           Punchy bounces up to a window, looking out to the empty lot.

                                 PUNCHY
                             (scared)
                        Into The More?

                                 MASON
                        Yup. Bye.

           Mason goes outside. Punchy watches with bated breath. When 
           she sees no “Misery” coming to get him, she emboldens. 

           She rushes to the door, but looks down at herself, realizing 
           she’s pretty conspicuous. She bounces over to the skate 
           rental desk, ducking behind it to find the LOST AND FOUND.
           EXT. ROLLER RINK - DAY

           Mason gets on his bike, but pauses to compose himself. That 
           was a lot to take in. His world is different now. And he’s 
           not necessarily okay with that.

           As he rides away, the roller rink door opens. Punchy, hidden 
           beneath a flannel, Hyper Color tee, novelty sunglasses, and a 
           Rasta hat with fake dreads, cautiously steps out. 

           When she realizes no “Misery” is coming to get her, she 
           pauses to compose herself. This is a lot to take in. Her 
           world is different now. And she’s totally okay with that.

           INT. MULLIGAN HOUSE - LATER

           Ellen is multitasking as usual. But she’s more frantic this 
           time. She burns dinner. Of course. Into the disposal. It 
           GRINDS, CLUNKS, and stalls out. She hangs her head, defeated.

           Mason comes in, looking shell-shocked and exhausted. Ellen 
           composes herself, then touches his face with concern.

                                 ELLEN
                        You feel warm. Where have you been?

                                 MASON
                        Discovering new worlds.

           He looks so sincere, Ellen forms a genuine smile.

                                 ELLEN
                        You are stuck in this house a lot.  
                        Go lie down for a bit. Dinner... is 
                        gonna need a reboot.

           Mason shuffles up the stairs. Ellen takes a deep breath and 
           opens the fridge, looking for options.

           Behind her, the front door opens and closes. Punchy walks in, 
           still wearing her 90s era disguise. She’s in awe of 
           everything she sees. Touching everything. Making a racket.

           Ellen grabs too many ingredients. A jar slips, spilling sauce 
           on the floor. The paper towel roll is empty.

                                 ELLEN (CONT’D)
                             (without looking)
                        Wyatt, can you go to the basement 
                        and grab me some paper towels?

           Punchy freezes, staring at this new human being, uncertain.
                                 MASON (O.S.)
                        Mom, where’s the rubbing alcohol?

                                 ELLEN
                        In the bathroom. Under the sink. 
                        Where it always is.

           Recognizing Mason’s voice, Punchy bounces up the stairs. 

           Ellen steps over the mess to put the food on the counter. The 
           front door opens again and Wyatt actually enters. Ellen looks 
           up, seeing that Wyatt is empty handed.

                                 ELLEN (CONT’D)
                        Are paper towels really too much to 
                        ask for?

                                 WYATT
                        Huh?

           INT. MASON’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Mason walks in from the bathroom, wiping his PICC line down 
           with alcohol. Punchy is sitting on his bed, fiddling with his 
           iPod. He doesn’t notice her until the music BLARES.

           He’s startled right up into the ceiling again. He crashes 
           down and crawls up to the bed, peering over at Punchy.

                                 PUNCHY
                        I hate when that happens. And these 
                        are not my jams.

           He kicks the door shut, then grabs the iPod from Punchy.

                                 MASON
                             (urgent whisper)
                        What are you doing here?

           Punchy hops off the bed and explores the room, examining 
           anything she can get her hands on. 

                                 PUNCHY
                        Exploring The More!

           Mason follows her, taking things away and putting them back.

                                 MASON
                        How did you get here? Why are you 
                        following me?
                             (seeing her outfit)
                        What are you wearing?
                                 PUNCHY
                        A small human disguise.

           She opens a drawer and finds a MAXIM MAGAZINE. She cocks her 
           head at the sexy pictures.

                                 PUNCHY (CONT’D)
                        What do you do with this?

           Mason snags it and shoves it back in the drawer.

                                 MASON
                        In Human Space we have a thing 
                        called personal boundaries. 

                                 PUNCHY
                        In Hammerspace we have a thing 
                        called boundless personalities!
                             (thinks for a beat)
                        Those aren’t the same, are they?

                                 MASON
                        My mom is going to freak out if she 
                        sees you. 

                                 PUNCHY
                        Is that the human downstairs with 
                        the sad eyes and clumsy hands?

           Mason flops down on the bed, at his wit’s end.

                                 MASON
                        I’m gonna need a straight jacket.

                                 PUNCHY
                        So pull one.

                                 MASON
                        It’s a figure of speech. Obviously 
                        I don’t have a straight jacket.

                                 PUNCHY
                             (motions reaching behind 
                              her back)
                        Then pull it.

                                 MASON
                        You think I can just pull a 
                        straight jacket out of my ass?

                                 PUNCHY
                        Well, it doesn’t have to be from 
                        there, but if that’s where you want 
                        to reach, I’m sure it’ll work.
           Mason sits up, looking at her.

                                 MASON
                        You’re serious?

                                 PUNCHY
                             (reaching into her pocket)
                        Why do you think I have this stupid 
                        thing on my belly?

           Mason expects something to pull out, but she’s empty handed.

                                 PUNCHY (CONT’D)
                        What? I can only put things into it 
                        on this side of the door. You’re 
                        the one with the Hammer Key. Pull 
                        something.

           Mason looks at the key. He stands up and concentrates. He 
           reaches behind his back. It looks like the fabric of the 
           universe warps as he digs around and POP! He yanks out... a 
           DVD. It’s STRAIT JACKET, an old Joan Crawford flick.

                                 PUNCHY (CONT’D)
                             (shrugs)
                        It takes some practice.

                                 MASON
                             (still utterly amazed)
                        Just like cartoons. All of these 
                        powers. It’s like I’m a cartoon!

                                 PUNCHY
                        Would you quit it with that word?

                                 MASON
                        You have no idea, do you?

                                                                CUT TO:

           An episode of Hammerspace in which a CARTOON PUNCHY bounces 
           around doing ridiculous things in a strange, colorful world.

                                 CARTOON PUNCHY
                        Punchy Power!

           Pull back to see the real Punchy’s eyes wide in horror. She 
           reaches her mitten-like hand out and turns it off. She’s 
           clutching COMICS with her likeness in the other hand.

                                 PUNCHY
                        This is the most offensive, 
                        degrading representation of my 
                        species I have ever seen. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 PUNCHY (CONT'D)
                        And I don’t sound like that. Do I 
                        sound like that? I’m so annoying. I 
                        want to punch me. And everyone 
                        else. With my hands. These are 
                        HANDS! They are not MITTENS! They 
                        don’t come off! It’s basic biology! 
                             (she turns on Mason)
                        Are there more of these cartoons? 

                                 MASON
                        Six seasons and hundreds of comic 
                        books. And that’s just Hammerspace. 
                        There’s thousands of similar ones.

           Punchy boils into a rage. She tears up the comic books and 
           punches the DVD set until it shatters and cuts her hands. She 
           bleeds ORANGE. Mason is taken aback. By all of it.

                                 PUNCHY
                             (looking at the blood)
                        I’m so angry I can’t even enjoy 
                        this consequence.

                                 MASON
                        Wow. You hate them as much as I do.

                                 PUNCHY
                        He lied to me. He used me. He 
                        exploited me. I’ve never felt so 
                        violated. So dirty. So...

                                 MASON
                        Disposable? Henry was good at that.

           Punchy and Mason share a moment. It turns out Henry wasn’t 
           the man either one of them thought he was.

           The door suddenly opens and Wyatt busts in.

                                 WYATT
                        Mom says dinner’s ready. Though I’m 
                        not sure ingestion is what it’s 
                        ready for.

           He sees his destroyed Hammerspace stuff and shoves Mason.

                                 WYATT (CONT’D)
                        You asshole!

           Wyatt crouches down to collect the remains of his stuff. He 
           looks up and sees Punchy sitting there, motionless.
                                 WYATT (CONT’D)
                        You ruin my Hammerspace stuff, but 
                        you buy a Punchy doll?

                                 PUNCHY
                        THEY MAKE DOLLS OF ME TOO?!

           Wyatt falls backwards, shuffling up against the closed door.

                                 WYATT
                             (to Mason)
                        What is that? WHAT IS THAT?!

                                 MASON
                        Shut up! Mom will come in here!

           Punchy rolls her eyes and calmly walks over to Wyatt, 
           examining yet another new human. She holds up the comics.

                                 PUNCHY
                        Do you own this defamatory horror?

                                 WYATT
                        Y-yes.

           She slaps him.

                                 PUNCHY
                        Stop it.

           She returns to Mason. Wyatt, slapped out of his shock, crawls 
           closer, becoming more and more intrigued.

                                 WYATT
                             (to Mason)
                        Is... is this about the key?

                                 MASON
                        It opens a door to another 
                        universe. Turns out dad ripped the 
                        entire concept of Hammerspace. And 
                        now I have cartoon powers.

                                 PUNCHY
                        TEWWWWN powers!

                                 WYATT
                             (putting it together)
                        Parallel dimensions. Like Counter-
                        Earth or Otherplace or The Larval 
                        Universe. Pylea! Oz! Narnia!
                                 PUNCHY
                             (to Mason)
                        Are those words?

                                 WYATT
                             (excitedly)
                        It’s multiverse theory! It’s a 
                        staple of comic books and sci-fi 
                        and fantasy. If something can 
                        happen, then there is a parallel 
                        universe in which it does. Like 
                        cartoon physics!

                                 PUNCHY
                        You’re annoying.

                                 WYATT
                        You’re amazing!

           The door opens and Ellen peeks her head in. POP!

                                 ELLEN
                        You’re letting dinner get cold. 
                        Don’t make me eat alone. 

           She notices something out of the ordinary behind them.

                                 ELLEN (CONT’D)
                             (weirdly moved)
                        Is that a Halloween costume? I... 
                        dinner. Let’s have dinner.

           She heads downstairs. Wyatt turns to see Mason holding a REAL 
           STRAIGHT JACKET. Punchy’s head pops out from inside.

                                 WYATT
                        Where did that come from?

           EXT. ROLLER RINK - NIGHT

           Chet’s van rolls into the abandoned lot. He gets out, eyeing 
           the roller rink to make sure no one is there. 

           He slides the van’s door open to reveal A LOT OF HIGH TECH 
           EQUIPMENT. This is not something a reporter would have. 

                                 CHET STANLEY
                             (mimicking detractors)
                        It’s not possible, Chet. You need 
                        evidence, Chet. Cartoon alien 
                        dimensions don’t exist, Chet.
           He grabs a couple STRANGE DIGITAL METERS and plants them in 
           the weeds all around the perimeter of the building.

                                 CHET STANLEY (CONT’D)
                        Stop talking to yourself, Chet. 
                        You’re not crazy, Chet. 
                             (annoyed with himself)
                        Seriously, stop it.

           Back at the van, he checks to make sure he’s receiving 
           readings. Satisfied, he shuts the door and drives away, not 
           noticing the DARK-SUITED AGENTS WATCHING HIM FROM AFAR.

           INT. MULLIGAN HOUSE - MORNING

           Mason tiptoes down the stairs, looking around to make sure 
           Ellen is gone. Punchy pushes past him.

                                 PUNCHY
                        I stayed in your smelly closet all 
                        night and ate your table scraps. 
                        I’d like to reestablish my 
                        independence, please and now.

                                 WYATT (O.C.)
                        Join the club.

           Mason jumps. Wyatt is eating cereal in front of the TV.

                                 MASON
                        Aren’t you supposed to be in 
                        school?

                                 WYATT
                        Isn’t mom supposed to drive me? 

           Punchy starts ransacking the kitchen.

                                 MASON
                        She left without you?

                                 WYATT
                        Again. 
                             (jumps up)
                        But who cares? There’s an entire 
                        universe in a roller rink locker!

                                 PUNCHY
                             (mouth full of food)
                        It’s not actually IN the locker; 
                        It’s THROUGH the locker. And it’s 
                        kinda lousy. The key gives you the 
                        good stuff right here.
                                 WYATT
                        She’s right! Mason, you have to do 
                        something with this. You’re a 
                        sickly, bullied teenager who found 
                        an object that grants you fantastic 
                        powers. This is textbook origin 
                        story stuff! You’re a -

                                 MASON
                        - Please don’t say superhero.

                                 WYATT
                        Screw superheroes. Let’s get 
                        wicked!

           EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           School is letting out. Mason, Wyatt, and Punchy (in her 90s 
           gear again) peek around a corner. Mason is nervous.

                                 MASON
                        I told you to stay in the closet.

                                 WYATT
                        A little late for that.

                                 MASON
                        Not you. Her!

                                 PUNCHY
                        I’m wearing human clothes. I blend.

           That’s debatable. They spy Travis, lording over his 
           disciples, Jay and Milo, in a courtyard. He’s gesturing with 
           a TOY SONIC SCREWDRIVER ala Doctor Who. It’s dramatic.

                                 WYATT
                        Okay. So it looks like they’re knee 
                        deep in their daily debate over 
                        which Doctor Who was the best. The 
                        answer is David Tennant, but Travis 
                        insists on being contrary.

                                 PUNCHY
                             (whispers to Mason)
                        If that’s another cartoon, I’m 
                        gonna punch him.

                                 WYATT
                        I’ll go over there and rile them 
                        up. Then they’ll chase me back 
                        here, and that’s when you do it.
                                 MASON
                        Do what?

                                 WYATT
                             (gesturing cartoonishly)
                        Zing. Wham. POW!
                             (off their confusion)
                        Let’s just call it comic relief.

           Mason and Punchy watch as Wyatt rolls over on his skateboard. 
           They can’t hear what he’s saying as he circles the bullies, 
           but clearly it’s offending their geeky sensibilities.

           Travis shoves Wyatt off his board, but Wyatt bounces back up, 
           snatches Travis’ sonic screwdriver, and hops on his board.

           Mason and Punchy duck behind the wall, neither knowing 
           exactly what’s about to happen. Mason reaches behind his back 
           for something. We don’t see it. POP!

                                 WYATT (CONT’D)
                             (speeding around the wall)
                        Do it. Do it. Do it. Do it. Do it!

           Travis, Jay, and Milo come tearing around the corner and stop 
           abruptly when they see Wyatt, confused and alone, aiming the 
           sonic screwdriver at them. Travis scoffs.

                                 TRAVIS
                        You think I’m afraid of a toy?

           Wyatt notices a PAINT CAN and THE SLOPPY IMAGE OF A DOOR 
           PAINTED ON THE WALL where Mason and Punchy had just been. 

           Wyatt pushes the screwdriver button, it lights up with noise.

                                 JAY
                        He’s kidding, right?

                                 MILO
                        Like we don’t have them too.

           They pull out their own SONIC SCREWDRIVERS. It’s a really 
           lame stand off with no consequences.

                                 TRAVIS
                        You guys are so embarrassing.

           The painted door opens behind them, swinging part of the wall 
           with it. Mason steps out unseen. Punchy peeks her head out 
           too, motioning for Mason to pull something. 
           Mason reaches behind his back and POP! He pulls out what look 
           like TWO BLACK CIRCLES. He places them on the ground behind 
           Jay and Milo, then ducks back through the door. 

           Wyatt sees this and flips his board up the same way he did in 
           their last encounter. Jay and Milo flinch, stepping back and 
           falling through what we now realize are actual black holes. 

           They disappear and the holes close up behind them.

           INT. GIRLS BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Two matching holes are on the ceiling above a pair of stalls. 
           Jay and Milo fall out of the ceiling, splashing into toilets. 

           Mason and Punchy exit the wall door just as some GIRLS enter.

           Jay and Milo step out of the stalls, soaked in toilet water 
           and horribly confused. The girls freak out. Jay and Milo run 
           for the door that Mason left behind, only to run smack dab 
           into the wall it’s painted on. 

           The girls stand over them, considering what to do.

           Mallory comes out of the next stall, totally confused.

           EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - CONTINUOUS

           Mason and Punchy stand where Jay and Milo used to be. 

                                 TRAVIS
                             (to “Jay and Milo”)
                        You guys grab this nerf herder.

           When nothing happens, he turns to see his friends have been 
           replaced by Mason, and a short, strangely dressed “kid.”

                                 TRAVIS (CONT’D)
                        What the hell is this?

                                 MASON
                        Comic relief.

           Wyatt pulls Travis’s pants down, revealing SUPERMAN BRIEFS.

           Jay and Milo run out of the school, faces covered in words 
           like “perv,” “loser,” and “creepo” in makeup and markers. 

           They spot Travis and he spots them, stunned by their mutual 
           embarrassing states. Travis pulls his pants mostly up, angry.
                                 TRAVIS
                             (to Mason)
                        You’re dead, sick boy.

                                 MASON
                        Not quite yet.

           Travis runs after Mason, who ducks behind a tree, only to 
           seemingly disappear. POP! His head pops out from behind 
           another tree nearby and taunts him.

           Confused, Travis runs that way, but Mason pops out from 
           behind another tree. Travis gets infuriated.

           This time he can see Mason’s legs sticking out from behind a 
           tree on the right. He runs up to give him a swift kick, but 
           Mason’s head and torso pop out from behind a tree on his 
           left, grabbing Travis’ exposed briefs for a wedgie.

           The others watch in amazement. Then Milo and Jay slowly turn 
           toward Punchy, a strange looking “kid.” She looks up at them.

                                 PUNCHY
                        You like cartoons, don’t you?

           They nod, slowly and silently. She hits them in the nuts.

           Mason lets go of Travis and steps out from behind the tree. 
           Travis tries to recover, crawling away, scared and confused.

                                 TRAVIS
                        How are you doing this?

                                 MASON
                        C’mon Travis. You read enough 
                        comics to figure it out.

                                 TRAVIS
                        That shit’s not real.

                                 MASON
                        It was real enough to harass my 
                        brother about it.

                                 TRAVIS
                             (to Jay and Milo)
                        Are you guys just gonna stand 
                        there? Avenge your fallen leader!

           Jay and Milo are recovering from Punchy’s punches. 

                                 MILO
                        I’m a firm believer in not engaging 
                        with that which I don’t understand.
                                 JAY
                        I fell into a girl’s toilet.

           They back away toward the painted door, tripping over the 
           paint bucket and spilling it all over themselves.

           Mason and Wyatt close in on Travis, who double takes Punchy.

                                 TRAVIS
                        Who... what is that?

                                 MASON
                        Don’t stare. She has a condition.

                                 PUNCHY
                        What color is your blood? Mine’s 
                        orange.

           Travis scoots away from her, totally creeped out.

                                 MASON
                        Tell Wyatt you’re sorry.

                                 TRAVIS
                        I-I’m sorry.

                                 MASON
                        Tell him he’s the king of the 
                        geeks.

                                 TRAVIS
                        Y-you’re the king of the geeks.

                                 MASON
                        Now tell him who the best Doctor 
                        Who is.

                                 TRAVIS
                        It-it’s... David Tennant.

                                 WYATT
                        Damn straight it’s David Tennant.

           POP! Mason pulls a PAINT BRUSH from behind his back, slapping 
           it into Travis’ hand. Mallory comes out of the school just as 
           Mason and Punchy hop on his bike and Wyatt grabs his board.

                                 MALLORY
                             (to Wyatt)
                        Did you see Jay and Milo come out 
                        of the girls’ bathroom? What are 
                        you guys doing out here?
                             (noticing Punchy)
                        Who’s that?
                                 WYATT
                        Not now Mallory.

                                 MALLORY
                        But-

           The boys ride off in a hurry, leaving Mallory to stew in her 
           stifled attempts at friendship.

                                 TEACHER (O.C.)
                        Mr. Bunk! Care to explain this?

           Behind Mallory, Travis, still shell shocked, turns to see an 
           ANGRY TEACHER throwing accusatory glares at the three bullies 
           covered in paint next to a wall defaced with a fake door.

           INT. ROLLER RINK - LATER

           Another 90s Hip-Hop jam blasts on the sound system. Punchy 
           does a little dance on roller skates. Wyatt’s amused. He hops 
           off his board to join her in the celebratory choreography. 

           Mason rests behind the guardrail, watching with a smirk.

                                 MASON
                        Think they’ll tell anyone?

                                 WYATT
                        Who would believe them?

           Mason looks at the key, cocking an eyebrow. He has a point. 

                                 MASON
                        You know Mallory likes you, right?

                                 WYATT
                        She seems to be delusional about a 
                        lot of things. Including me. 

           Wyatt rolls over and reaches out to touch the Hammer Key.

                                 WYATT (CONT’D)
                        Can I try it?

           Mason instinctively tucks it back in his shirt. Protective.

                                 MASON
                        I think we used it enough today.

           Punchy notices this action, but goes on with her routine.
                                 WYATT
                        Sorry. Forgot the “Land Lord” is 
                        the only one who can use it.

                                 MASON
                        Don’t call me that.

                                 WYATT
                        How about Land Lord Jr.?

           Wyatt rolls back over to rejoin Punchy.

                                 WYATT (CONT’D)
                        I can’t believe Dad kept this all 
                        to himself. Do you think he looked 
                        like Gollum at the end?
                             (to Mason)
                        Do you think you’ll look like 
                        Gollum too?

                                 MASON
                        I’m nothing like him.

           Punchy loses control of her skates and crashes into the 
           guardrail right below Mason, smacking her head hard. It 
           hurts, so she smiles. Mason looks down at her.

                                 MASON (CONT’D)
                        Your jams are dated.

                                 PUNCHY
                        You haven’t even heard my favorite 
                        ones. Henry took them away because 
                        one made him sad. But he’s gone 
                        now, so I get them back!

           She bounces out of her skates and across the rink towards 
           Henry’s old office. Wyatt watches her go, then eyes the key.

                                 WYATT
                             (to Mason, off the key)
                        If you do go crazy, can I have it?

           INT. OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Punchy bounces in, rummaging around, looking for her jams. 
           She scowls at some sketches of herself before finding a CD in 
           a drawer beneath them, smiling big.

           As she turns to leave, her squishy foot brushes against a 
           PHOTOGRAPH fallen to the floor. It’s the one of the Mulligan 
           family, with Henry’s face scratched out with a smiley face.
           Punchy picks it up, disturbed by the image. Hand shaking. She 
           looks at the rest of the drawings, noticing for the first 
           time a progression of these over-exuberant added smiles. 

           Her face floods with recognition, fear, and regret. 

                                 PUNCHY
                        The Grinz.

           She quickly hides the photo in her pocket.

           INT. MULLIGAN HOUSE - LATER

           Mason and Wyatt walk in to find a spotless house and Ellen 
           calmly preparing final details of a meal. It’s suspicious. 

           Punchy wanders in behind them as if she owns the place. The 
           boys motion for her to go upstairs, but she jokingly makes a 
           silent scene behind Ellen’s back. 

           Mason finally lifts and spikes Punchy, her squishy legs 
           bouncing her upstairs just before Ellen turns to see them.

                                 ELLEN
                        It’s so nice to see you two 
                        spending time together. What have 
                        you been up to this afternoon?

           Mason and Wyatt ease into their seats skeptically. Ellen’s 
           demeanor is eerily calm. Like she’s overcompensating.

                                 MASON
                        Not much. But you’ve been busy.

                                 ELLEN
                        I just thought it would be nice to 
                        have a clean house and dinner you 
                        don’t have to pretend to like.

           She smiles, but her eyes betray an impending emotional break.

                                 ELLEN (CONT’D)
                        I want you both to know that it’s 
                        going to be okay. Everything will 
                        be fine. But I lost my job today 
                        and I have to put the house on the 
                        market.

                                 WYATT
                        We’re moving?

                                 MASON
                        What happened?
                                 ELLEN
                        Just cut backs. You know?

                                 WYATT
                        We’re moving?

                                 MASON
                        Are you okay?

           Ellen looks at him like no one has asked her that in years.

                                 ELLEN
                        You hate that question.

           She smiles sadly and wipes a stray tear, keeping it together.

                                 ELLEN (CONT’D)
                        I’ll find another job. But we just 
                        can’t afford this place. Not with 
                        our other expenses.

                                 MASON
                        You mean my expenses.

                                 ELLEN
                        No. Well, yes. But this is okay. 
                        I’ll find a job with better health 
                        coverage. It’ll be better for us.

                                 WYATT
                        I don’t want to move.

                                 MASON
                        But my expenses will end soon.

           Ellen slams the table with her hands.

                                 ELLEN
                        DON’T SAY THAT! Stop saying that!

           Ellen stands and clears the plates that haven’t been eaten.

                                 WYATT
                        What about the royalties? From Dad.

           Ellen drops the plates in the sink, taking a breath.

                                 ELLEN
                        They ended years ago. Your father 
                        wasn’t exactly a master negotiator. 

                                 WYATT
                        But Hammerspace is huge!
                                 ELLEN
                        And Cosmic Comics owns it. Not us. 
                        I’m sorry sweetie. It’s best we all 
                        put that stupid cartoon behind us.

                                 WYATT
                        But it’s not just a cartoon! It’s -

           Mason kicks Wyatt under the table to shut him up. Wyatt 
           throws him an accusatory glare, like this is all his fault.

                                 WYATT (CONT’D)
                        Fine. Whatever.

           He storms upstairs, door SLAMMING behind him. Ellen stares 
           after him, feeling like a failure. Mason goes to the sink and 
           picks up a piece of uneaten food. He tentatively tastes it.

                                 MASON
                             (it’s awful)
                        That’s... good.

           Ellen’s emotions break into laughter. She touches his face.

                                 ELLEN
                        I’ll order pizza.

           INT. MASON’S ROOM - LATER

           Mason comes into his room, hands a slice of pizza to Punchy 
           and lays down on his bed, exhausted. She peeks over his bed 
           as she eats, finally noticing the PICC line in his arm.

                                 PUNCHY
                        Is that a consequence?

           Mason pulls his sleeve down self-consciously.

                                 MASON
                        What is it with you and your 
                        consequences, anyway? Getting hurt 
                        isn’t a good thing.

                                 PUNCHY
                        But if you’ve never been hurt, you 
                        wouldn’t know the difference. 
                        Opposites provide meaning.

                                 MASON
                        So you come here looking for 
                        meaning?
           Punchy bounces onto the bed, causing Mason to cartoonishly 
           bounce off and crash to the floor.

                                 PUNCHY
                        Did you really appreciate not 
                        falling off the bed before you did?

                                 MASON
                        You don’t have to give examples!

           Punchy picks at her pizza, sadly contemplating.

                                 PUNCHY
                        There’s no pain in Hammerspace. No 
                        consequences to actions. It’s just 
                        never ending happiness.

                                 MASON
                        And that’s bad?

                                 PUNCHY
                             (getting worked up)
                        It’s oppressive! Most Tewns don’t 
                        think about it. Most Tewns don’t 
                        think about anything. I didn’t 
                        either. Until I came here. Then I 
                        found danger and pain and fear! 
                        Everything I do has meaning here. 
                        All because there are consequences.

                                 MASON
                        But if there are no consequences in 
                        Hammerspace, does that mean you 
                        don’t die there?

                                 PUNCHY
                             (whispers reverently)
                        The ultimate consequence.
                             (back to normal)
                        I’ve never seen it happen. Every 
                        day just blends into the next.

                                 MASON
                        Do you get sick?

                                 PUNCHY
                        What’s “sick”?

                                 MASON
                        I’m sick.

                                 PUNCHY
                        Is that why your hair is green?
           Mason glances over at the mirror above his dresser. It’s 
           surrounded by the hospital band collage he’s made. He runs 
           his fingers through his green streak, revealing white roots.

                                 MASON
                        After the first round of chemo, it 
                        grew back white. I felt like a 
                        freak. 

                                 PUNCHY
                        And green makes you feel normal?

                                 MASON
                        Green. Blue. Red. Whatever I feel 
                        like. Because I can. 

           Punchy climbs up on the bed and examines him closely.

                                 PUNCHY
                        What is sick doing to you?

                                 MASON
                        It’s killing me. It came back. And 
                        it’s everywhere now. 
                             (getting emotional)
                        You talk about the “ultimate 
                        consequence” like it’s something 
                        special. But it’s something awful. 
                        And it’s ruining my family.

                                 PUNCHY
                        They have the sick too?

                                 MASON
                        It spreads in all sorts ways you 
                        don’t expect.

                                 PUNCHY
                        Can you stop the sick from 
                        spreading to them?

                                 MASON
                        Not unless I can pull a wad of 
                        money out of my ass.

                                 PUNCHY
                        Why must you always pull from 
                        there?

           Mason suddenly sits up, grabbing the Hammer Key.

                                 MASON
                        Wait. I can just pull the money!
                                 PUNCHY
                        But where would it come from?

                                 MASON
                        What do you mean? From Hammerspace. 
                        Like everything else.

                                 PUNCHY
                        Oh you’re not pulling anything from 
                        Hammerspace. Everything you pull, 
                        you’re pulling from someplace here.

                                 MASON
                        What do you mean?

                                 PUNCHY
                        In Hammerspace, pulling is part of 
                        the fabric of reality. But here, it 
                        has to come from somewhere real.

                                 MASON
                        So, I’ve been stealing stuff?!

                                 PUNCHY
                        Is that not okay?

                                 MASON
                        Taking things that don’t belong to 
                        you is wrong.

           He spies the leftover pieces of Wyatt’s torn up comic books 
           on the floor. The Cosmic Comics logo pops out at him.

                                 MASON (CONT’D)
                        Unless you’re just taking back 
                        what’s owed to you.

           INT. TRAIN - NIGHT

           Mason and Wyatt sit next to Punchy, back in her 90s era 
           disguise, glued to the window, watching Human Space roll by.

                                 WYATT
                             (to Mason)
                        The longer you’re kicking around, 
                        the less you fear Mom killing us.

                                 MASON
                             (re: Punchy)
                        I’m more concerned that she won’t 
                        stay hidden. She looks ridiculous.

           They pass a HAMMERSPACE BILLBOARD reading, “Punchy Power!”
                                 PUNCHY
                        I would never say something so 
                        stupid. What does that even mean?

           A LITTLE KID stares at Punchy, clearly recognizing something 
           familiar beneath the disguise. He pulls his FATHER’S sleeve.

                                 LITTLE KID
                        Daddy. Daddy! It’s Punchy.

                                 KID’S FATHER
                        Yeah, yeah. I saw.

                                 LITTLE KID
                             (pointing at Punchy)
                        No. Daddy. Right there. In the 
                        weird clothes.

           The kid’s Father grabs his arm and pulls it down.

                                 KID’S FATHER
                        It’s rude to point. You have no 
                        idea why that person looks that 
                        way.

           Punchy sees the look of awe and love on the kid’s face. And 
           the unfair confusion. They both know he’s right. 

                                 MASON
                             (to kid’s Father)
                        She has a condition.

                                 PUNCHY
                             (whispering to the kid)
                        Yeah. It’s called Punchy Power.

           The kid’s face lights up. The train stops and his father 
           drags him off at their stop, smiling the whole way. Punchy 
           can’t help but smile too. Mason and Wyatt stare.

                                 PUNCHY (CONT’D)
                             (defensively)
                        You’re getting to pull all the fun 
                        stuff! I can’t pull a smile?

           EXT. COSMIC COMICS BUILDING - NIGHT

           Punchy is enthusiastically running around the street, 
           touching and exploring everything and everyone. Mason and 
           Wyatt desperately hustle to keep her incognito.

           They stop outside Cosmic Comics, closed for the night.
                                 WYATT
                        You’re really taking this “let’s 
                        get wicked” thing seriously.

                                 MASON
                        I prefer the term “comic relief.”

           Mason pulls on an IRON MAN mask. Wyatt, a STAR LORD mask. 
           Punchy pulls on a “Punchy” mask. It looks ridiculous.

           INT. COSMIC COMICS BUILDING - NIGHT

           A SECURITY GUARD watches TV at the front desk. Behind him, 
           THE WALL OPENS LIKE A DOOR. Mason holds a paint brush as he 
           ushers Wyatt and Punchy in and over to the stairs unseen.

           INT. COSMIC COMICS OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           They sneak in through reception. Punchy’s image is 
           everywhere. Posters. Toys. Candy dispensers. She hits one and 
           M&Ms spew out of “her” mouth. She’s astounded and horrified.

                                 PUNCHY
                        Can we destroy it? Can we destroy 
                        it all? Can we destroy it now?

                                 MASON
                        That’s not the plan.

           INT. VELMA MATHERS’ OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           They walk in, not sure what they’re looking for.

                                 WYATT
                        I know they screwed dad on the 
                        royalties, but how are we supposed 
                        to get them back? It’s not like 
                        they keep money lying around.

           Punchy sees a statue of herself in the corner. She hates it.

                                 PUNCHY
                        This doesn’t look like me. Does 
                        this look like me? It doesn’t.

           Mason starts rummaging through Velma’s desk.

                                 MASON
                        Maybe if she has a bank statement. 
                        An account number. Something like 
                        that. I could pull the money.
           Punchy hits the statue, but doesn’t make a dent.

                                 PUNCHY
                        They can’t just put my image on 
                        everything. Especially if they 
                        don’t get it right.

           Wyatt searches a filing cabinet behind the desk.

                                 WYATT
                             (holding a file)
                        Is this what you need?

           Mason takes it. It’s a CORPORATE ACCOUNT file. Account 
           numbers and balances. BIG BALANCES.

                                 MASON
                        Yes. Okay. Okay. I’m just gonna 
                        make a little withdrawal.

           Mason focuses intently on the file numbers, on the bank 
           address. He takes a breath and reaches behind his back, 
           rummaging around in the fabric of reality for big money.

           He’s got it. He pulls. POP! He’s snagged AN ENTIRE LAPTOP. He 
           fumbles it to the ground, where it turns on with the bank’s 
           logo as a screen saver. It’s password protected.

                                 WYATT
                        Everything is digital these days.
                             (to Mason)
                        You’re a terrible super villain.

           Punchy bounces onto the statue, finally knocking it over, 
           sending her crashing into a wall, smashing framed pictures 
           that fall to the ground. AN ALARM WAILS.

                                 PUNCHY
                        Consequence!

           They run!

           INT. COSMIC COMICS OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Just as they reach reception, the ELEVATOR DINGS. Mason 
           shoves Wyatt and Punchy out of sight.

                                 MASON
                        Get out of here. I’ll lead him 
                        away.
           Wyatt and Punchy hide behind a Punchy statue as the Security 
           Guard exits the elevator, TASER at the ready. He spots Mason, 
           temporarily confused by his Iron Man mask.

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        Freeze!

           Mason bolts down the hall for the stairway. When Security 
           Guard chases, Wyatt and Punchy hop in the elevator.

                                 SECURITY GUARD (CONT’D)
                        Stop or I’ll taze you!

           Mason doesn’t stop. The guard pulls the trigger. The taser 
           connects with Mason. His body jerks and spasms as cartoonish 
           bolts of electricity shoot through him, x-ray style.

           He crashes to the floor, smoking like a barbecue. 

           Security Guard approaches, reaching for his radio for backup.

           But Mason hops right up and stumbles away, looking back just 
           long enough to not realize he’s hit the door. He busts right 
           through, leaving another hole in the shape of his silhouette.

           INT. COSMIC COMICS - STAIRWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Mason starts to go down, but hears GUARDS coming up. He’s 
           scared and turns the other way, temporarily treading his feet 
           in space like a cartoon before running up the stairs.

           EXT. COSMIC COMICS BUILDING - ROOF - CONTINUOUS

           Mason busts through a door and straight to the edge. No 
           escape. He turns the other way, but the GUARDS have arrived. 

           Mason blindly runs away from them. He’s reaching in his 
           pockets and anywhere the Guards can’t see, POP! POP! POP! 
           He’s pulling BLACK HOLES and tossing them behind him.

           Some Guards fall through to the floor below. But Security 
           Guard is still on his tail. Mason is so distracted by the 
           chase he doesn’t realize he’s run straight off the roof.

           It’s not until he turns to see the dumbfounded look on the 
           Security Guard’s face, still safely on the roof, that he 
           looks down. He’s sixty stories above Manhattan.

           He promptly falls.
           Mason plummets through the air, desperately trying to pull 
           anything to help him. POP! INFLATED BALLOONS, which only 
           tangle him up. POP! A PARACHUTE PACK that slips away. 

           The ground is coming quick.

           POP! He’s got Wyatt’s PUNCHY POGO STICK. He gets it under his 
           feet as he lands, bouncing down the sidewalk, out of control. 
           Right past Wyatt and Punchy, hiding in an alley.

           Mason slips and crashes to the pavement below. Balloons 
           release from his body in a festive display.

           He opens his eyes. Wyatt and Punchy are looking down on him.

                                 MASON
                        I think I’ve had this dream before. 
                        But I was dead.

                                 WYATT
                             (holds up his phone)
                        Well, Mom knows we snuck out. So I 
                        might be joining you.

           They help him up, leaving a Mason-shaped hole in the ground. 
           Punchy gets a good look at the pogo stick with her fake face 
           plastered on it. Her real face drops.

                                 PUNCHY
                             (dejected)
                        What the misery is that?

           INT. MULLIGAN HOUSE - MORNING

           Mason and Wyatt quietly enter the house. Punchy is behind 
           them. Mason spots Ellen waiting up for them and instinctively 
           shoves Punchy into a bush outside.

                                 ELLEN
                        Where the hell have you been?

           The boys shut the door. Ellen is pacing around. She’s wired. 
           Two mugs of coffee, unaware that she’s double-fisting.

                                 ELLEN (CONT’D)
                        Do you have any idea how worried 
                        I’ve been? Do you have any idea 
                        what you’ve put me through?
                             (notices her two mugs)
                        Do you have any idea what a cliche 
                        you’ve made me? Look at this!

           She puts the mugs down, calming a bit.
                                 ELLEN (CONT’D)
                        I don’t want to be a cliche. But 
                        I’m a mom. I can’t avoid it. And 
                        you can’t just disappear like that.

                                 MASON
                        Normal teenagers disappear. Normal 
                        teenagers lie and sneak out and go 
                        to parties and hook up and their 
                        parents never know what they’ve 
                        really been up to. 

                                 ELLEN
                        You’re not a normal teenager!

                                 MASON
                        You think I don’t know that? It’s 
                        all I ever know. 

                                 ELLEN
                        So you were, what? Partying? On 
                        your meds?

                                 MASON
                        No. I was just trying to do 
                        something. For you. For us. To help 
                        with everything. But it didn’t 
                        work. It was stupid. So forget it. 

                                 ELLEN
                        I’m just trying to keep it together 
                        here. Keep us together here.

                                 MASON
                        Well “us” is gonna be one less in 
                        the near future. And I’d like to at 
                        least pretend I’ve lived a little 
                        first. 

           Mason goes upstairs. Ellen sits down at the kitchen table, 
           defeated. She takes a sip of one coffee mug, then the other. 

           She looks up to see Wyatt standing there expectantly.

                                 ELLEN
                        I’ve got an interview to go to. You 
                        better get ready for school.

           Wyatt realizes he’s not getting chewed out. Like he didn’t 
           sneak out too. Like he’s not worth the trouble.

                                 ELLEN (CONT’D)
                        I’m glad you were at least out 
                        there with him. Thank you for that.
                                 WYATT
                        I’m surprised you even noticed I 
                        was gone.

           He heads upstairs, letting that sink in. She feels terrible.

           INT. VELMA MATHERS’ OFFICE - DAY

           Velma Mathers reviews video footage of the comically inept 
           invasion last night. She sees “Iron Man” seemingly pull a 
           computer from out of nowhere. She pauses and cuts to:

           Old footage of Henry Mulligan trashing her office, seemingly 
           pulling a SLEDGEHAMMER out of nowhere. The exact same way.

                                 VELMA MATHERS
                        Curioser and curioser.

           EXT. ROLLER RINK - DAY

           CHET STANLEY’S VAN lingers in the empty lot behind the rink.

           INT. CHET’S VAN - CONTINUOUS

           Chet’s comparing readings from the digital meters, 
           triangulating a location over the BLUEPRINTS OF THE ROLLER 
           RINK. And it’s pinpointing the locker room. He smiles.

           A BEEPING goes off, alerting him to video surveillance as he 
           sees Mason and Wyatt heading his way. He gets nervous.

                                 CHET STANLEY
                        You’re trespassing, Chet. You don’t 
                        want to go to jail again, Chet.
                             (beat)
                        That’s when you started talking to 
                        yourself, Chet. It was bleak.

           EXT. ROLLER RINK - CONTINUOUS

           As Wyatt, Mason, and Punchy, hunched in front of Mason on his 
           bike, pass in front of the rink, Chet’s van slowly pulls out 
           from behind it, rolling away unseen.

           The van nearly hits Mallory, trudging along on her own 
           Hammerspace-themed bike a ways behind the boys. She flips 
           Chet off from the ditch she’s now landed in.
                                 PUNCHY
                        Who’s that human covered in my 
                        face?

                                 MASON
                             (to Wyatt)
                        Shit. I’ll take Punchy inside. You 
                        get rid of her.

           Mason and Punchy duck inside as Wyatt rolls over Mallory’s 
           way. He helps her out of the ditch.

                                 MALLORY
                        You’ve been weird lately.

                                 WYATT
                        You’ve been weird always.

                                 MALLORY
                        That’s what I like best about 
                        myself.

           Wyatt can’t help but respect that. He half smiles.

                                 MALLORY (CONT’D)
                        And my Hammerspace blog. Ranked 
                        number one in the Tri-State area.

                                 WYATT
                        I’m officially reneging that smile.

                                 MALLORY
                             (nodding toward the rink)
                        What’s going on in there? You guys 
                        have been spending a lot of time 
                        here. Not that I follow you. 
                        Normally. Not counting today. 
                             (she heads that way)
                        Did your dad leave stuff behind?

           Wyatt doesn’t want to have to do this, but he knows it’s the 
           only way to get rid of Mallory. He rolls to block her path.

                                 WYATT
                        Mallory, I need you to hear this. 
                        To really hear this. And coming 
                        from a total comic book geek, this 
                        really means something. Okay? You 
                        ready? Here it comes. GET. A. LIFE. 

           Mallory absorbs this. Simple. Clear. And it dug deep.

                                 MALLORY
                        You don’t mean that.
                                 WYATT
                             (he doesn’t)
                        Please go home.

           Wyatt boards back to the roller rink. Mallory turns her bike 
           away, hurt. Angry. But pauses to look back, suspicious.

           INT. ROLLER RINK - LATER

           Wyatt locks the door behind him just as the opening notes of 
           a classic Bone Thugs ‘N Harmony 90s jam “Tha Crossroads” 
           echoes through the dimly lit rink. It’s eerie.

                                 PUNCHY
                             (to Mason)
                        Henry hated this jam because it’s 
                        about the ultimate consequence. He 
                        always hid the CD. But I found it.
                             (starts singing along)
                        “Now tell me what you gonna do/ 
                        When there ain’t nowhere to run/ 
                        When judgement comes for you/ When 
                        judgement comes for you/ Now tell 
                        me what you gonna do/ When there 
                        ain’t nowhere to hide/ When 
                        judgement comes for you/ Cause it’s 
                        gonna come for you...”

           And Punchy mumbles out as the song continues in a smooth, 
           fast rap that’s too hard to understand.

                                 PUNCHY (CONT’D)
                        And then I have no idea what 
                        they’re saying. But it just sounds 
                        so right. Like, inside. Right?

           She turns it up, grooving to the jam. Mason is dubious, but 
           starts to really listen to it. His head is bobbing along.

                                 PUNCHY (CONT’D)
                        I heard what you said to your mom.
                             (catching a few lyrics)
                        “It’s steadily creeping up on the 
                        family, exactly how many days we 
                        got lasting/ while you laughing, 
                        we’re passing, passing away.”

           Wyatt circles the rink, watching this moment unfold, having 
           not yet been noticed. Mason is watching Punchy butcher this 
           song, and it’s striking a chord deep inside him.
                                 PUNCHY (CONT’D)
                        “Hey, and we pray and we pray and 
                        we pray, every day every day every 
                        day/ And we pray and we pray and we 
                        pray, every day every day every 
                        day.”

           Mason starts to get into the vibe with Punchy. He surprises 
           himself by joining in, with growing passion.

                           MASON
           See you at the crossroads.

                          PUNCHY
                                                     MASON (CONT'D)
                                              That’s how we roll.
           Living in a hateful world/ 
           Sending me straight to 
           Heaven.

                          PUNCHY
                                                     MASON (CONT'D)
                                              That’s how we roll.
           Living in a hateful world/ 
           Sending me straight to 
           Heaven.

                          PUNCHY
                                                     MASON (CONT'D)
                                              That’s how we roll.
           Living in a hateful world/ 
           Sending me straight to 
           Heaven.

           They mumble-laugh through the lyrics they don’t understand. 
           But Mason knows this part. He knows it well.

                                 MASON (CONT’D)
                        Can somebody anybody tell me why, 
                        hey/ Can somebody anybody tell me 
                        why, we die, we die/ I don’t wanna 
                        die.
           He’s got tears in his eyes. The song plays itself out as he 
           allows this much-needed release. Punchy comes up to comfort 
           Mason. He laughs at how silly this was. Composes himself.

                                 PUNCHY
                        What’s Heaven?

                                 MASON
                        Sounds a lot like Hammerspace, 
                        actually. But I’m not sure it even 
                        exists.

                                 WYATT (O.C.)
                        Multiverse theory says it could.

           Mason scrambles to collect himself, wiping tears away.

                                 MASON
                             (to Wyatt)
                        How much of that did you see?

           Wyatt’s eyes are watery too. He half smiles. 

                                 WYATT
                             (enough)
                        Just play it again.

           EXT. ROLLER RINK - SAME

           As the song starts over inside and Wyatt joins the jam, we 
           pull out to find Mallory standing outside a dusty window, 
           recording it on her phone, amazed at what she’s seeing.

           Her video zooms in on a semi-distorted image of Punchy.

                                 MALLORY
                        This is Mallory Barnes with a 
                        Hammerspace exclusive. What we’re 
                        looking at appears to be a new 
                        prototype Hammerspace toy. A life-
                        size Punchy doll that moves to 
                        music, being tested out by none 
                        other than the sons of original 
                        Hammerspace creator Henry Mulligan. 
                        It seems Cosmic Comics has kept 
                        this on the down low. Perhaps for a 
                        Christmas rollout. But Christmas 
                        has come early to this fan. And 
                        now, for all of you.

           She hits a few buttons and watches it load onto her 
           Hammerspace Fan Page. As she steps away from the window, her 
           foot hits something. One of Chet Stanley’s strange METERS.
           She crouches down for a better look at the unusual device, 
           but her phone PINGS. Her video got a hit. And another. And 
           another. And suddenly the hit counter is all that matters.

           INT. MASON’S ROOM - MORNING

           Mason’s asleep. Wyatt busts in, startling him awake so fast 
           he inadvertently pulls A SEXY BRA from under his pillow. POP!

           They both look at it, confused. Mason drops it, embarrassed.

                                 MASON
                        I was having a good dream.

           Wyatt drops his laptop on the bed, pointing at it in a panic. 
           It has Mallory’s Hammerspace fan page. The video is playing.

                                 MASON (CONT’D)
                        You read Mallory’s fan page?

                                 WYATT
                        I do when everyone I know sends me 
                        the link because we’re the 
                        headline.

           Mason clicks the video and sees Punchy revealed to the world.

                                 WYATT (CONT’D)
                        It’s gone viral! 355,454...5...6. 
                        It just keeps getting hits!

                                 MASON
                        She has to take this down.

                                 WYATT
                        It won’t matter. The Internet is 
                        forever!

           Off screen, the PHONE RINGS. We hear Ellen answering.

                                 WYATT (CONT’D)
                        Where’s Punchy?

           Mason opens the closet, where Punchy has set up camp with all 
           sorts of items she’s been coveting from Human Space.

                                 PUNCHY
                        You don’t just open doors! 

           They hear Ellen coming up the stairs. Quickly.
                                 MASON
                             (to Punchy)
                        Get to the roller rink. Stay 
                        hidden. We’ll meet you there.

           Before Punchy can respond, she’s buried in Mason’s laundry. 
           She pops her face out and is hit with the sexy bra. Mason 
           slams the door just as Ellen enters the room, confused.

                                 ELLEN
                        Why am I getting phone calls from 
                        Cosmic Comics’ legal team accusing 
                        you of copyright infringement?

           INT. CHET’S VAN - DAY

           Chet watches the video, rapt. It’s beyond anything he could 
           have expected. His mind is exploding. He dials his phone.

                                 CHET STANLEY
                             (into phone)
                        Agent Broder, please. It’s Chet 
                        Stanley. Don’t hang up!
                             (cold muffled response)
                        Tell him I’ve made contact.
                             (dubious muffled response)
                        Well, I’ve seen contact.
                             (angry muffled response)
                        No. Not the movie. Well, yes, that 
                        too. But no. I sent an e-mail. It’s 
                        remarkable.
                             (annoyed muffled response)
                        It’s not a toy. The readings at the 
                        time say three biological beings 
                        inside the building. It fits with 
                        my calculations. I was right. The 
                        portal is here.
                             (dramatic beat)
                        And something came through.

           INT. MALLORY’S HOUSE - DAY

           Ellen drags Mason and Wyatt to Mallory’s house, a small, 
           dilapidated place with an overgrown lawn.

                                 MASON
                        Mom, please. Let’s not do this.

                                 ELLEN
                        If you say this Mallory girl is the 
                        one who put the video up, then I 
                        want to talk to her parents. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ELLEN (CONT'D)
                        We have enough issues to deal with. 
                        I don’t need a lawsuit too!

           She rings the doorbell. A moment later, Mallory opens the 
           door, a bit startled to find the whole Mulligan clan there.

                                 ELLEN (CONT’D)
                        Mallory? Are your parents home?

                                 MALLORY
                        No.

                                 ELLEN
                        Will they be back soon?

                                 MALLORY
                        I wonder that myself most of the 
                        time.

           Glimpsing into the house, it doesn’t seem like parental 
           supervision is a popular hobby here.

           She wasn’t expecting that. Ellen’s phone RINGS. 

                                 ELLEN
                        It’s the Cosmic Comics jerk again.

           Ellen steps away to take the call. Mason and Wyatt step 
           closer to Mallory. She half closes the door, nervous.

                                 MASON
                        Mallory, listen. You have to say it 
                        was a hoax.

                                 MALLORY
                        But it wasn’t. I saw it. Where did 
                        you even get that toy? I thought 
                        you hated Cosmic Comics.

                                 WYATT
                        It’s... complicated. But trust us. 
                        You have to take it back.

                                 MALLORY
                        That would totally violate my 
                        journalistic integrity.

           Mason hears his mom getting worked up on the phone. He’s 
           desperate to keep a lid on this. There’s only one way.

                                 MASON
                        If you say it’s a hoax, we’ll tell 
                        you everything.
                                 MALLORY
                        What’s everything?

                                 WYATT
                        What you saw. What it really is. 
                        Where it came from. EVERYTHING. At 
                        the roller rink. Later.

           The kids shut up as Ellen returns, thoroughly frustrated. 

                                 ELLEN
                        Now they claim they’re sending a 
                        representative out here to 
                        “investigate.” What’s to 
                        investigate?

           The guys look at Mallory. Her mental debate begins and ends.

                                 MALLORY
                             (reluctantly)
                        There’s nothing to investigate. I 
                        doctored the footage. 
                             (killing her)
                        It’s just a hoax.

           Ellen is surprised to hear this so easily. She’s relieved.

                                 ELLEN
                        Oh. Well, thank you for admitting 
                        that. I know that wasn’t easy. And 
                        I may need your parents to talk to 
                        this legal looney if he calls back.

                                 MALLORY
                        If you manage to get in touch with 
                        them, tell them I said hi. And 
                        we’re out of dish soap.

           She shuts the door. Ellen’s phone PINGS. She sighs.

                                 ELLEN
                             (overwhelmed)
                        I forgot your appointment this 
                        afternoon. I have a follow up 
                        interview. I just... 
                             (she takes a breath)
                        I’ll drop you two at home. Mason, 
                        you have got to rest. I’ll be back 
                        to pick you up later. Do not leave 
                        the house. Do not talk to anyone 
                        who calls. Do not make this any 
                        more complicated. Do you both 
                        understand?
           The boys nod their agreement.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. ROLLER RINK - LATER

           They clearly didn’t understand, because both Mason and Wyatt 
           are sitting in the roller rink instead of at home.

           A KNOCK at the door. Wyatt checks the window, then unlocks 
           it, pulling Mallory inside before locking it again.

           She’s equal parts intrigued and skeptical. She looks around.

                                 MALLORY
                        So? Where is it? And you better 
                        have a good explanation because I 
                        don’t appreciate being dicked 
                        around like this.

                                 MASON
                             (to Wyatt)
                        Do you want to tell her?

                                 WYATT
                        I’m a little afraid of what will 
                        happen.

                                 MASON
                        All her dreams come true?

                                 WYATT
                        Or maybe our nightmares.

                                 MALLORY
                        JUST. TELL. ME.

                                 WYATT
                        Punchy is real.

           Mallory nods her head like she knew this was a waste of time.

                                 MALLORY
                        You must think I’m the biggest 
                        idiot in the world. Just because I 
                        care about something doesn’t give 
                        you the right to make fun of me.

           She turns for the door, But Punchy blocks her way.
                                 PUNCHY
                             (to Mason)
                        Should I say something stupid like 
                        “Punchy Power” or is this enough?

           Mallory’s mouth drops in shock.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. ROLLER RINK - LATER

           Mallory’s mouth is still hanging open. Mason, Wyatt, and 
           Punchy stare at her with concern. It’s clearly been a while.

           Punchy’s had enough. She hauls back and punches Mallory, 
           knocking her onto her butt. 

                                 MASON
                             (to Punchy)
                        You can’t just go around hitting 
                        people! Humans don’t like 
                        consequences!

           But it did the trick. Mallory snaps out of it. She’s beaming.

                                 MALLORY
                             (to herself)
                        I was just punched by Punchy.
                             (to Mason)
                        I was just punched by Punchy!
                             (to Wyatt)
                        I WAS JUST PUNCHED BY PUNCHY!

                                 WYATT
                             (walking away)
                        Yeah, join the club.

           Mallory stares at Punchy in amazement. Her favorite fictional 
           character alive and in the flesh. It’s like a religious 
           experience. She falls to her knees, eye-level with her.

                                 MALLORY
                             (beyond moved)
                        You’re beautiful.

           Suddenly Madonna’s “Like a Prayer” echoes through the rink. 
           Mason turns to see Wyatt at the sound booth.

                                 MASON
                        Really?

                                 WYATT
                        It just seemed appropriate.
           Mallory’s got tears in her eyes. Punchy gives her the once 
           over, not appreciating her Hammerspace apparel one bit.

                                 PUNCHY
                             (to Mason)
                        Why is she crying?

                                 MASON
                        Punchy. You literally just blew her 
                        mind. Humor the girl.

                                 PUNCHY
                        Fine. She can ask me one question. 
                             (to Mallory)
                        Make it good.

           Mallory doesn’t have to think very hard for the right one.

                                 MALLORY
                        Don’t you sometimes think 
                        Hammerspace is just a metaphor for 
                        the existential dread we all feel 
                        when faced with the uncertain 
                        realities of infinite nothingness?

           And now it’s Punchy’s turn to have her mind blown. She stares 
           at Mallory like she’s seen the very core of her inner mind.

                                 PUNCHY
                        I do. I do think that. 

           Mason can’t believe these two just bonded over that. Punchy 
           gets surprisingly emotional, looking away from them.

                                 PUNCHY (CONT’D)
                        Ever since The Grinz showed up, 
                        Hammerspace hasn’t been the same.

                                 WYATT
                        What’s The Grinz?

                                 PUNCHY
                        The Overlord of Hammerspace.

                                 MASON
                        You never mentioned an Overlord.

                                 PUNCHY
                             (shrugging)
                        You never asked. Humans are a 
                        pretty self-involved species.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. MULLIGAN HOUSE - DAY

           Ellen comes home to take Mason to his appointment, but he’s 
           not there. Neither is Wyatt. She storms out, annoyed.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. ROLLER RINK - SAME

           Punchy finishes telling Mallory about Hammerspace.

                                 PUNCHY
                             (very dramatic)
                        Hammerspace isn’t what it used to 
                        be. The Grinz is the worst.

                                 MASON
                        Does he torture?

                                 PUNCHY
                        We don’t hurt there.

                                 WYATT
                        Imprison?

                                 PUNCHY
                        It’s too easy to escape.

           Mallory approaches Punchy, placing a gentle hand on her arm.

                                 MALLORY
                        Is he psychologically abusive?

                                 PUNCHY
                        Yes. Yes he is. He’s so... happy. 
                        Oppressively happy. No other 
                        emotions are allowed. If he catches 
                        you thinking or feeling something 
                        else, he forces you to...

                                 MASON
                        To what?

                                 PUNCHY
                        It’s too horrible.

                                 MALLORY
                        It’s okay. You can tell us.

                                 PUNCHY
                        He forces us to laugh.

           Mason, Wyatt, and Mallory stare at her, unimpressed.
                                 WYATT
                        When did laughing become a bad 
                        thing?

                                 PUNCHY
                        Have you ever had to fake a laugh?

                                 WYATT
                        Sure. It’s easy.

           Wyatt does it. Mason and Mallory join him. It doesn’t last.

                                 PUNCHY
                        Now imagine having to do that for 
                        days straight. Listening to this 
                        big, smiling monster’s jokes. He’ll 
                        just follow you around, all day, 
                        all night, until you’ve broken.

                                 MASON
                        Has he done this to you?

                             (yes)
                        The Grinz won’t be satisfied until 
                        there is nothing but happiness 
                        left.

                        But that sounds nice. Outside the 
                        psychological abuse part.

           Mason shakes his head, realizing why this is so bad.

                                 MASON
                        Opposites create meaning. Without 
                        them, it’s just oblivion.

           Punchy looks up at Mason, surprised he actually did listen to 
           her. A CAR can be heard pulling up outside. Wyatt looks out.

                                 WYATT
                        Speaking of oblivion. We forgot 
                        your appointment.

           EXT. ROLLER RINK - SAME

           Ellen exits the car and spots Chet Stanley’s van around the 
           side of the rink. She assumes he’s the Cosmic Comics guy.

                                 ELLEN
                             (to herself)
                        That was fast.
           She storms right up to him, catching him off guard.

                                 ELLEN (CONT’D)
                        For your information, my sons had 
                        nothing to do with that video. It 
                        was a hoax created by the girl who 
                        posted it. So you can go back to 
                        Cosmic Comics and tell them they’re 
                        barking up the wrong tree.

           Chet realizes that Ellen thinks he’s someone he’s not. Ellen 
           realizes his hands are full of high tech sci-fi style 
           equipment, like the meters he had put around the building.

                                 ELLEN (CONT’D)
                        What kind of investigation is this?

           INT. ROLLER RINK - CONTINUOUS

           Mason, Wyatt, Punchy, and Mallory crowd around the windows. 

                                 WYATT
                        Who is that guy?

                                 MASON
                        I thought he was a reporter.

                                 PUNCHY
                        What’s he holding?

                                 MALLORY
                        I saw those things around the 
                        perimeter of the building when I 
                        was...

           They all glare at her.

                                 MALLORY (CONT’D)
                        Yeah. I know. I’m sorry.

                                 WYATT
                        Why would a reporter have high-tech 
                        gadgets like that?

           Mason looks to the right and sees a SWARM OF GOVERNMENT STYLE 
           VEHICLES descending upon the vacant lot.

                                 MASON
                        Because he’s not a reporter at all.
           EXT. ROLLER RINK - DAY

           The vehicles come to a halt. ARMED, UNIFORMED MEN jump out to 
           secure the perimeter as LAB TECHS set up mobile laboratories. 

           Ellen is stunned. It’s all happening so fast.

                                 ELLEN
                             (to Chet Stanley)
                        You’re not from Cosmic Comics?

           Chet looks at her quizzically, but snaps to attention as a 
           stern man with a vaguely military air approaches. This is 
           AGENT BRODER, 40s. Chet is astounded.

                                 CHET STANLEY
                        You’re here. You believe me!

                                 AGENT BRODER
                        I believe my agents who keep an eye 
                        on everyone on our watch list.
                             (Chet isn’t a fan of that)
                        Show me what you’ve found.

                                 CHET STANLEY
                             (handing him reports)
                        The portal is inside. In the locker 
                        room at the south west corner to be 
                        exact. There are three humans and 
                        one unspecified life form in the 
                        building.

           Ellen hears this and scurries after them, more concerned.

                                 AGENT BRODER
                        You’re certain they’ve made 
                        contact?

                                 ELLEN
                        Excuse me?

                                 CHET STANLEY
                        Video authentication confirmed.

                                 AGENT BRODER
                        And the portal is stable?

                                 ELLEN
                        Hello?

                                 CHET STANLEY
                        It appears to be contained, 
                        somehow. Direct examination will 
                        tell us how and for how long.
                                 AGENT BRODER
                             (takes in the roller rink)
                        Years of searching the most exotic 
                        and scientifically relevant 
                        locations on Earth, but we finally 
                        find one in this depreciated dump.

                                 ELLEN
                        THIS IS MY DEPRECIATED DUMP!

           Agent Broder looks at Ellen as if for the first time.

                                 AGENT BRODER
                        I’m Special Agent Broder.
                             (flashes a badge)
                        We’re quarantining your building.
                             (to ANOTHER AGENT)
                        Nothing in or out except us.

           Ellen panics and moves towards the building.

                                 ELLEN
                        Those are my kids in there!

           Agent Broder holds her back. Looking dead in her eye.

                                 AGENT BRODER
                        And they may be in serious danger.

           He nods to some OTHER AGENTS, who step up to contain her.

           INT. ROLLER RINK - DAY

           Mason and Punchy have been watching it all intently. But when 
           they see Ellen detained, they have to act.

                                 MASON
                        We’ve got to get out of here.

           Wyatt comes running from the back of the building.

                                 WYATT
                        They’ve surrounded us.

           Mallory runs down the stairs from the second floor snack bar. 

                                 MALLORY
                        I can hear them on the roof too.

                                 PUNCHY
                        What do they want?

           All eyes fall on Punchy. 
                                 PUNCHY (CONT’D)
                        Wait. Me?! Why do they want me?

           INT. LOCKER ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Mason leads them all into the locker room, right up to Locker 
           17. Punchy eyes it warily. Mason pulls out the Hammer Key.

                                 PUNCHY
                        That’s not an option.

                                 MASON
                        It’s not safe for you here.

                                 PUNCHY
                        It’s not safe for you either. And 
                        you’re not going through that 
                        locker. So try again.

                                 MALLORY
                        If only we could go under them.

           They all look at her like she’s a genius. She doesn’t get it. 
           POP! Mason pulls a BLACK HOLE. Mallory is amazed.

                                 MALLORY (CONT’D)
                        What the how?

           POP! Mason pulls a SHOVEL.

           INT. ROLLER RINK - MOMENTS LATER

           Armed agents bust in, securing the location.

           INT. LOCKER ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Agent Broder leads Chet Stanley into the locker room, but 
           there’s no sign of the kids or Punchy anywhere.

           Instead, they find MASSIVE PILES OF DIRT all over the floor, 
           but no hole to explain where it came from.

                                 AGENT BRODER
                             (into radio)
                        Be advised, subjects are on the 
                        move. Apprehend with non-lethal 
                        force. I repeat, non-lethal force.

           Chet Stanley is holding a BEEPING meter directly in front of 
           Locker 17. He examines it, noticing that it has a strange, 
           specific lock unlike any of the other lockers.
                                 CHET STANLEY
                        Curioser and curiouser.

           EXT. ROLLER RINK - DAY

           They kids tunnel underground, upending the earth as they go. 
           The bizarre trail runs directly into a TELEPHONE POLE, 
           causing it to shake. Ellen notices this from a distance.

           She watches as Mason and the others pop their heads out from 
           underground. He tosses the shovel and they quickly run into 
           the woods. And that includes Punchy, bouncing behind them.

           Ellen can’t believe her eyes. A SECONDARY AGENT approaches.

                                 SECONDARY AGENT
                        Ma'am. Are you okay?

                                 ELLEN
                        Hmm? Oh. Yes. I’m just a bit dizzy.

           She stumbles towards her car. The agent thinks quick and 
           opens the door for her to sit and compose herself.

           But Ellen slips her keys in the ignition and turns it over, 
           peeling away. She barrels through the perimeter, nearly 
           taking out other agents as she goes.

           Broder exits the building, noting the strange disrupted dirt 
           leading away from the east side.

                                 SECONDARY AGENT
                        Sir. The owner fled.

                                 AGENT BRODER
                        You placed the device first?

                                 SECONDARY AGENT
                        Yes, sir.

                                 AGENT BRODER
                        Then she’ll lead us right to them.
                             (into radio)
                        I need an extraction team on Kent 
                        Cliffs Road.

           EXT/INT. ELLEN’S CAR - SAME

           We see a TRACKING DEVICE underneath the car and pan up to 
           Ellen, inside, talking to herself in shock and panic.
                                 ELLEN
                        I’m fleeing. I’m fleeing the 
                        government agents. I’m in the car 
                        and I’m fleeing. I saw a cartoon. 
                        With my kids. But not on a screen. 

           EXT. CARMEL, NEW YORK - LATER

           The gang is trudging through the woods towards the road.

                                 MALLORY
                        You guys realize that this is all, 
                        like, life-altering stuff, right? I 
                        mean, I’ve only known for half a 
                        day and my concept of reality and 
                        fantasy is a manic mess.

                                 WYATT
                        What else is new?

                                 MASON
                        We won’t be able to hide for long.

                                 PUNCHY
                        They can’t get into Hammerspace 
                        without that key. Can we please 
                        destroy it?

           Mason flips the Hammer Key around in his hand, thinking.

                                 MASON
                        You’d never go home again.

                                 PUNCHY
                        I’d never have to fake laugh again.

                                 WYATT
                             (reaching for the key)
                        Here, let me try something.

                                 MASON
                             (yanking the key away)
                        No.

           Punchy sees Mason’s possessiveness and gets worried.

                                 WYATT
                        Just let me see it.

                                 MASON
                        No. It’s caused enough trouble!
                                 WYATT
                        In your hands! Give it!

           Wyatt tries to grab the key, turning into a tug-of-war. The 
           boys start wrestling each other, neither letting go. 

           It quickly devolves into a cartoon-like fight, with limbs and 
           heads popping out of a cloud of dust as they roll along.

           Wyatt gets flung out of the cloud, having let go. He lands in 
           the nearby road in front of ONCOMING TRAFFIC.

           Mason shoves Wyatt out of the way, taking the hit from a car 
           and bouncing across the pavement. He stands up, unharmed.

           He looks over at Wyatt, also getting up, unharmed.

           That’s when they all notice Ellen behind the wheel. 

           Mixed emotions flood over her as she watches three familiar 
           kids and an alien-like creature climb into her car.

           INT. ELLEN’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Mason in front, the others in back. Ellen looks Mason over - 
           he’s totally fine. She looks ahead, horrified and baffled. 

           They all sit there for an extended beat of silence as Ellen 
           tries to wrap her head around Punchy. It’s awkward.

                                 MASON
                        We should probably go.

           Ellen nods, still in shock. She drives. She keeps eyeing 
           Punchy in the rearview mirror.

                                 ELLEN
                             (to Mallory)
                        The video wasn’t a hoax.

                                 MALLORY
                        No.

           Ellen nods, accepting this. Then:

                                 ELLEN
                        And where did... she... come from?

                                 MASON
                        An interdimensional portal 
                        contained within a locker inside 
                        the roller rink.
           Ellen nods again, finding it harder to accept this. Then:

                                 ELLEN
                        And did that exist before or after 
                        your father made the cartoon?

                                 PUNCHY
                        BEFORE!

           Ellen nods a third time, like she’s finally lost her mind.

                                 ELLEN
                        Right. Well. This explains a lot.

           They continue driving in silence for an extended beat. 

           EXT. KENT CLIFFS RD. - CONTINUOUS

           Ellen’s car approaches Kent Cliffs Road, a two lane open air 
           stone causeway across a reservoir.

           INT. ELLEN’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           The silence continues. Until:

                                 WYATT
                        If you think about it, things could 
                        be worse. We could be on drugs.

                                 ELLEN
                             (snapping)
                        My children have been harboring an 
                        interdimensional alien -

                                 PUNCHY
                        - Tewn.

           Ellen still isn’t used to Punchy speaking.

                                 ELLEN
                        Okay, interdimensional cartoon.

                                 PUNCHY
                        TEWN. With an ewwwwww.

                                 ELLEN
                        Toon.

                                 PUNCHY
                        Tewwwwwwwn.
                                 ELLEN
                        Toooooooon.
                             (she doesn’t care)
                        The government is after us! 

                                 WYATT
                        Do you think they’re FBI or NASA?

                                 MALLORY
                        Probably neither. I feel like this 
                        is one of those agencies we don’t 
                        know exists. Like Men In Black, 
                        only real. Like, we’ll never really 
                        know. You know?

                                 ELLEN
                        I should have been home more. I 
                        should have kept an eye on you. 

                                 MASON
                        You can’t protect me from the 
                        world, Mom. It already got me.

                                 ELLEN
                        So you’re running around acting -

                                 MASON
                        - Normal. I’m acting normal!

                                 ELLEN
                        Normal? You said normal kids sneak 
                        out and party and hook up, Mason! 
                        This is not that!

                                 MASON
                        You’d prefer I were doing drugs?

                                 ELLEN
                        I’d prefer to not be an X-File!

           Through the back window, we see GOVERNMENT VEHICLES catching 
           up to them. Wyatt and Mallory take note.

                                 WYATT
                        Um. Guys...

           INT/EXT. ELLEN’S CAR/KENT CLIFFS RD. - CONTINUOUS

           The Government Vehicles are fast approaching. POP! Mason 
           pulls a LARGE CAN OF OIL and tosses it out the window.

           It spills all over the road. The cars swerve, but maintain.
           POP! He pulls HANDFULS OF NAILS, tossing them onto the road.

                                 ELLEN
                        How are you doing that?!

           Turns out the Government Vehicles have run-flat tires. They 
           slow down, but are not deterred.

                                 WYATT
                        Pull dynamite! Pull a bazooka!

                                 ELLEN
                        NO! NO DYNAMITE! NO BAZOOKAS!

                                 PUNCHY
                        Move the line.

                                 MASON
                        What?

                                 PUNCHY
                        The line in the road. Move it.

           Mason catches on to what she’s thinking. He opens his door 
           and jumps out of the moving vehicle.

                                 ELLEN
                        Mason!

           EXT. KENT CLIFFS RD. - CONTINUOUS

           Mason rolls to the side. He’s fine. He jumps up and runs 
           across the road, reaching down and ACTUALLY GRABBING THE 
           CENTER YELLOW LINE and curving it directly into the water.

           He steps back, uncertain if it’s going to work. 

           The Government Vehicles catch up. But before they reach him, 
           they inexplicably follow the yellow line right over the edge 
           and into the reservoir. Just like a cartoon.

           Mason is amazed. He actually laughs. But AGENTS swim out of 
           the vehicles and Mason runs back to Ellen’s stopped car. 

           INT. ELLEN’S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

           They’re all a bit stunned by that one.

                                 ELLEN
                        We need to have a serious talk when 
                        we get home.
                                 MASON
                        Not our home. It won’t be safe.

           INT. LOCKER ROOM - SAME

           Chet sits to the side as LAB TECHS study the portal energy 
           from Locker 17, trying to crack it open. Chet can’t take it.

                                 CHET STANLEY
                        You mustn’t disrupt the locker! 
                        Breaking it open could be 
                        devastating. It could cause the 
                        portal to expand. To destabilize. 
                        Who knows what lies on the other 
                        side or how it will effect us?

                                 AGENT BRODER (O.C.)
                        There is one thing that knows.

           Chet turns to see Agent Broder watching intently. 

                                 AGENT BRODER (CONT’D)
                        And we’ll have it back soon enough.

           Secondary Agent enters the room with a DIGITAL TABLET.

                                 SECONDARY AGENT
                        Sir. They’ve evaded extraction. 
                        I’ve got dashboard video feed from 
                        the pursuit.

           Agent Broder watches Mason’s bizarre, cartoon antics ending 
           with the traffic line plunging the cars into the reservoir.

                                 AGENT BRODER 
                             (intrigued, but unfazed)
                        Where are they now?

                                 SECONDARY AGENT
                        They’ve stopped at a residence on 
                        the east end of town.

           Agent Broder nods and motions for several of his agents as he 
           heads out to handle this himself.

           INT. MALLORY’S HOUSE - SAME

           They take refuge in Mallory’s house. 

                                 MALLORY
                        My parents won’t be home till... I 
                        don’t know. So just, do whatever.
           Ellen plops down on a recliner, her brain on overload.

                                 ELLEN
                        All this time, Henry wasn’t crazy.

           Punchy looks at a smiling PUNCHY DOLL with existential angst.

                                 PUNCHY
                             (off handedly)
                        If he wasn’t crazy then, he’s 
                        definitely crazy now.

           Mason realizes she just spoke of Henry in the present tense.

                                 MASON
                        What do you mean “now”?

                                 PUNCHY
                             (realizes what she said)
                        What do YOU mean “what do I mean?”

                                 WYATT
                        Punchy. Is our dad alive?

           Punchy looks at the hopeful, confused humans in front of her. 
           She knows it’s time to tell them. And she knows it won’t go 
           well. She punches the Punchy doll.

                                 PUNCHY
                        The Land Lord crossed over and 
                        became The Overlord.

                                 ELLEN
                        Henry went to Hammerspace?

                                 WYATT
                        Dad is The Grinz?

                                 ELLEN
                        What’s a Grinz?

                                 MASON
                             (to Punchy)
                        You said if a human were living in 
                        Hammerspace, you’d know it.

                                 PUNCHY 
                        I didn’t know because he’s not 
                        human anymore!

           She pulls the MULLIGAN FAMILY PHOTO from her pocket. The one 
           with Henry’s face scratched over with a creepy smiley face.
                                 PUNCHY (CONT’D)
                        I didn’t recognize him until I saw 
                        this. The physics of Hammerspace 
                        must have warped him. Turned him 
                        into how he wanted to feel.

           Mason looks at the photo. The aggressive smiley face.

                                 MASON
                        This wasn’t the first time, was it?

                                 PUNCHY
                        No. We had a deal. If he’d unlock 
                        the door, I’d come through and wait 
                        with the key so he could get back. 
                        We could experience each other’s 
                        worlds. Get the perspective we need 
                        to continue on in our own.
                             (getting sad)
                        Until he opened it without me and 
                        sealed us both in there.

                                 WYATT
                        So our dad’s been in there all 
                        along? We have to get him out!

                                 PUNCHY
                        NO! The reason I haven’t wanted you 
                        to open that door again is because 
                        The Grinz wants to destroy Locker 
                        17. He wants to unleash the portal 
                        so he can spread the unending 
                        “happiness” of Hammerspace to Human 
                        Space as well.

           Mason stares at the Hammer Key like it’s to blame for it all.

                                 ELLEN
                        Unending happiness doesn’t sound 
                        too bad right about now.

                                 MALLORY
                        That’s what I said.

                                 PUNCHY
                        An uncontrollable portal could 
                        destroy both worlds! I couldn’t 
                        believe I made it through and shut 
                        the door before he had the chance. 

           Mason tosses the Hammer Key across the room, disgusted with 
           it, with himself, and with Punchy. He can barely look at her.
                                 MASON
                        Maybe you never should have.

           That hits Punchy right in the heart space. But it’s Mason who 
           suddenly looks like he’s going to be sick. 

           Mallory hears a CAR OUTSIDE. She peeks out the window.

                                 ELLEN
                        Are those your parents?

                                 MALLORY
                             (to Punchy)
                        RUN!

           THE DOOR BUSTS OPEN. AGENTS stream in, securing the location 
           at gunpoint. Mason eyes the Hammer Key, too far out of reach.

           Agent Broder enters, assessing the humans in front of him. 
           Contained. Not pulling any inexplicable tricks.

           INT. MALLORY’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The room is filled top-to bottom in Hammerspace merchandise. 
           Punchy’s face is everywhere. It’s hard to know where the real 
           Punchy is, but she’s hiding in plain sight. Right on the bed.

           The door creaks open. Secondary Agent enters the room, 
           scanning for life. Even he seems a bit shocked at the over 
           fanatical decor. He looks right past Punchy.

           But then he presses a button on his GLASSES, providing him 
           with HEAT VISION. He scans the room again, landing on the now-
           colorful shape of Punchy lunging at him with a punch.

           She literally bounces off the walls trying to take him out 
           with as many Hammerspace-related items as she can grab.

           Secondary Agent bides his time, aiming his firearm. Punchy 
           bounces at him again.

                                 PUNCHY
                        Punchy Power!

           And she’s shot with a TRANQUILIZER. She flops to the ground.

           EXT. MALLORY’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           HAZMAT-SUITED LAB TECHS load unconscious, restrained Punchy 
           into a transport vehicle. Mason and the others watch 
           stoically from inside the house.

                        You don’t know what you’re doing.

           INT. MALLORY’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Agent Broder turns to Mason, who now looks seriously ill.

                                 AGENT BRODER
                        I know more than you think. 

           Mason makes a sudden move for the Hammer Key on the floor. 
           But Broder quickly subdues him, picking the key up himself. 
           He smirks, now holding an unusual key for an unusual lock.

                                 AGENT BRODER (CONT’D)
                        But I didn’t know that. Thank you.
                             (to Ellen, re: the kids)
                        We’ll need to question them.

           As Agent Broder walks out, Mason takes a step to follow, but 
           he collapses to the floor, unconscious. 

                                                          CUT TO BLACK:

                                 LAB TECH 1 (PRE-LAP)
                        Should we take the gloves off?

                                 LAB TECH 2 (PRE-LAP)
                        Um. Those appear to be the hands.

           INT. ROLLER RINK - DAY

           Punchy groggily blinks awake, finding herself restrained on 
           an examination table, hooked up to MYRIAD MACHINES. 

           A pair of Lab Techs hover over her, while others analyze 
           various readings from the surrounding equipment.

           Punchy struggles to free herself, but only manages to draw 
           Chet Stanley’s attention. He’s in awe of this new life form.

                                 CHET STANLEY
                        I’ve been searching for you my 
                        whole life.

                                 PUNCHY
                        That’s creepy.

           Chet is equal parts surprised and elated that she speaks.
                                 CHET STANLEY
                        Perhaps you come from a pocket 
                        universe within our own? One where 
                        the things we imagine here come to 
                        life?

                                 PUNCHY
                        Is that a thing?

           Agent Broder steps in, nudging Chet aside.

                                 AGENT BRODER
                        How are you able to recover from 
                        blunt force trauma? To pull things 
                        out of thin air? And what happens 
                        if we cross over?

                                 PUNCHY
                        You can’t cross over without - 

           Agent Broder holds up the Hammer Key. Punchy’s eyes go wide.

                                 PUNCHY (CONT’D)
                        Where’s Mason?

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - LATER

           Mason wakes up in the hospital. Ellen, Wyatt, and Mallory are 
           there with him, but the AGENTS outside have them sequestered.

                                 MASON
                        What happened?

                                 ELLEN
                             (teary)
                        I think reality caught up with you 
                        a little bit, sweetie. You’ve run 
                        yourself into the ground.

                                 MASON
                        And Punchy?

                                 WYATT
                        They took her. And the key.

           Mason nods, realizing how badly he’s messed up. He looks at 
           Wyatt, suddenly overcome with guilt and responsibility.

                                 MASON
                        I’m sorry.

                                 WYATT
                        Sorry, me? For what?
                                 MASON
                        For everything. I wanted things to 
                        be better for you, but I couldn’t 
                        undo any of it. 

                                 WYATT
                        Shut up. You’re a hero.

                                 MASON
                        Not without the key. I’m nothing.

                                 WYATT
                             (shaking his head)
                        Why do you think I’ve been able to 
                        be so open about being gay?

                                 MASON
                        I thought it was Glee.

                                 WYATT
                        You’re an asshole. It’s because of 
                        you. If you could face cancer, then 
                        I could face anything life throws 
                        at me too. 

           Mason isn’t quite convinced. Wyatt gets annoyed.

                                 WYATT (CONT’D)
                        Look at you! Terminal diagnosis, 
                        but you’ve used every ounce of your 
                        remaining energy trying to set 
                        things right. If that’s not heroic, 
                        then every comic I’ve ever read is 
                        wrong. And that’s not possible.

                                 MASON
                        But when they open that door...

                                 WYATT
                        You’ll be there to go through.

           That gets everyone’s attention. Ellen stands up.

                                 ELLEN
                        No one is going through any 
                        interdimensional portals!

           She feels weird having to say that. She looks at Mallory.

                                 MALLORY
                        It sounded as silly as you think. 
                                 MASON
                             (to Wyatt)
                        Why would I go through?

                                 WYATT
                        Because you have to convince The 
                        Grinz... you have to convince DAD 
                        not to destroy it. The door will be 
                        opened one way or another, but what 
                        happens after is up to us.
                             (Looks around the room)
                        It’s up to all of us.

           Ellen isn’t having any of this.

                                 ELLEN
                        No. I lost one family member this 
                        way and I won’t lose another.

                                 MASON
                        Mom.
                             (gently)
                        You’re going to lose me either way.
                             (Ellen starts crying)
                        At least this way it might mean 
                        something. 

           Ellen looks at Mason. Weak, fading, but still willing to 
           fight. She might not understand everything that’s going on, 
           but in this moment, she understands him.

           She wipes her tears and composes herself before opening the 
           door and addressing Secondary Agent.

                                 ELLEN
                        Mason’s awake. Tell Agent Broder he 
                        has information to share.

           INT. ROLLER RINK - SAME

           Punchy is mid-confession.

                                 PUNCHY
                        And there’s this really large 
                        smiling monster who lords over 
                        Hammerspace, demanding unrelenting 
                        happiness from us all. He wants to 
                        destroy the door to spread 
                        happiness to Human Space too.

           Chet seems open to what Punchy is saying, but Broder is not 
           impressed with this story.
                                 PUNCHY (CONT’D)
                             (knows it sounds stupid)
                        It’s... horrible. I swear.

           EXT. CARMEL, NEW YORK - SAME

           A pair of Government Vehicles drive by, Mason and Ellen in 
           the first, Wyatt and Mallory in the second. Agents in both.

           INT. GOVERNMENT VEHICLE

           Mallory spots her PHONE in an Agent’s pocket. Wyatt follows 
           her eyes. She motions for him to grab it. Wyatt leans over 
           the agent, pointing at something out the window.

                                 WYATT
                        Whoa. Is that another portal 
                        opening? 

           He picks the agent’s pocket and slips the phone to Mallory.

           Mallory does some quick maneuvering on the phone, posting 
           something online before giving it back to Wyatt to replace.

                                 WYATT (CONT’D)
                        Oh, no. Just a cloud. A really cool 
                        cloud. I like clouds.

           The agent pushes Wyatt back into his seat. Wyatt looks at 
           Mallory, done with her phone, unsure what she’s up to.

                                 MALLORY
                        I’m not a ridiculous person. I 
                        mean, I know I can be ridiculous, 
                        but I’m not ridiculous. Sometimes 
                        it just feels better to focus on 
                        something...

           She trails off, not knowing how to finish.

                                 WYATT
                        Unreal?

                                 MALLORY
                             (surprised)
                        Yeah.

           They share a rare moment of connection.

                                 WYATT
                        You know we’re not gonna kiss, 
                        right?
                                 MALLORY
                        Um. Ew. Weirdo. You like guys and I 
                        like your brother.

           Wyatt is weirdly disappointed with this ego-blow.

           INT. ROLLER RINK - CONTINUOUS

           Punchy continues pleading with Broder and Chet.

                                 PUNCHY
                        If you open that door, The Grinz 
                        comes through. And he’ll destroy 
                        it. I don’t know much about 
                        portals, but that has to be bad.

                                 CHET STANLEY
                        A destabilized portal could be 
                        devastating to both worlds.

                                 AGENT BRODER 
                        Listen, Stanley. Your semi-
                        psychotic obsession with this 
                        theory has been helpful. You filled 
                        in the blanks when our funding fell 
                        through. But do you really think we 
                        haven’t been tracking these 
                        anomalies? That you’re somehow 
                        aware of something the United 
                        States government is not? You’ve 
                        been working for us without even 
                        knowing it. You’re just a crackpot 
                        without a payroll.

                                 CHET STANLEY
                        If I were a crackpot, you wouldn’t 
                        be here. 
                             (motioning to Punchy)
                        She wouldn’t be here.

                                 AGENT BRODER
                        And she won’t be here much longer 
                        if she doesn’t start talking.
                             (to Punchy)
                        My lab techs are itching to  
                        performing an autopsy on a toon.

                        You mean Tewn.

           They all turn to see Mason, still weakened, being led in by 
           Agents. Ellen, Wyatt, and Mallory are there too.
                                 MASON (CONT’D)
                        With an ewwwwwww.

                        Thank you!

                        She only looks like a toon. My dad 
                        discovered the portal and copied 
                        the world. A world where cartoon 
                        physics exist. Like...
                             (to Wyatt)
                        What’s the term?

                                 MASON
                        That.

           Agent Broder absorbs this intel, not particularly surprised. 

                                 AGENT BRODER
                        And the smiling monster?

                        My dad. And I’d like to talk him 
                        out of inadvertently destroying us.

                                 AGENT BRODER
                        You think I’m going to let a kid 
                        walk through a portal to another 
                        dimension you’ve just claimed 
                        psychotically distorted the last 
                        human to do so? 

                                 MASON
                             (shrugs)
                        If it could save the world, sure.

                                 AGENT BRODER
                        You want to save a world?
                             (Getting angrier)
                        A world where terrorists kill 
                        thousands of innocent people? Where 
                        soldiers die protecting a country 
                        that cares more about reality TV 
                        than national security? Where 
                        infectious diseases threaten to 
                        eradicate our population and 
                        biological warfare is already 
                        underway?
                                 MASON
                        Um. I guess?

                                 AGENT BRODER
                        Saving the world is more than 
                        protecting it from outside threats; 
                        it’s protecting it from ourselves. 
                        And doing so requires power. Power 
                        from beyond that portal. Imagine an 
                        entire army immune to violence and 
                        disease. With the ability to bounce 
                        back from gunfire and pull whatever 
                        weapon they want from behind their 
                        backs. They’d be unstoppable. 

                                 CHET STANLEY
                             (horrified)
                        You want to weaponize Hammerspace?

                                 AGENT BRODER
                             (genuine)
                        I want to save the world.

           EXT. ROLLER RINK - SAME

           A ROWDY CROWD OF HAMMERSPACE FANS, including Travis, Jay, and 
           Milo, approach the Agent-guarded perimeter of the lot. 

                                 AGENT 1

                        If you guys are turning Hammerspace 
                        into one of those live action/CGI 
                        abominations, there will be hell to 
                        pay. I’m a master troller.

                                 AGENT 1

                                 TRAVIS
                        The secret is out.
           Travis holds up Mallory’s fan page, revealing her recent post 
           claiming the video was leaked footage from a live-action 
           Hammerspace movie being secretly filmed in town.

           Agent 1 looks around. With all the Government Agents and NASA-
           like equipment, a film set is exactly what it looks like.

                                 AGENT 1
                             (into radio)
                        Sir. We have a situation.

           INT. ROLLER RINK - SAME

           Agent Broder marches to a window, not happy. Wyatt looks 
           outside, then at Mallory, impressed. She shrugs.

                                 MALLORY
                        I have a lot of followers.

           While Broder is distracted, Chet spies the Hammer Key in his 
           hand. When Broder turns around, Chet punches him in the face. 
           Broder spins around cartoonishly, but felt nothing.

           They both look at the Hammer Key, making the same 
           realization. Chet snatches it and hits Broder again. He takes 
           it on the chin, tough as nails, and slugs Chet right back.

           Chet is launched across the room.

           INT. LOCKER ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           He crashes into the LAB TECHS, knocking them away from Locker 
           17. But he gets right up, totally fine. He eyes the Hammer 
           Key, amazed at its abilities. But Broder is charging.

           As Broder tackles him, Chet tosses the key to Mason.

           Mason turns to Locker 17. The Hammer Key glows as he inserts 
           and turns it. The door to Hammerspace opens, expanding within 
           the locker. Agents and Lab Techs don’t know what to do.

           Agent Broder releases Chet and pulls his gun on Mason.

                                 AGENT BRODER
                        Don’t move. 

           Mason considers diving through the door with the key, closing 
           it forever, but hesitates. Looks over at Chet.

                                 MASON
                        Keep it open.
           He tosses the key to Chet and dives through the portal. 

           But Broder catches the key instead. Smiling maniacally.

           INT. PUNCHY’S HOUSE

           Mason lands on the other side, revealing a bizarre world that 
           is clearly the inspiration for the Hammerspace cartoon. 

           EVERYTHING LOOKS LIKE 2D ANIMATION HERE. 

           Mason stands up, looking back at the normal little door he 
           came through. It seems innocuous in this cartoonish setting.

           Mason steps past a mirror, noticing for the first time that 
           HE, TOO, LOOKS LIKE 2D ANIMATION. It’s rather alarming. 

           He touches his face, stretching it around in an exaggerated 
           manner, then letting it snap back into place.

           Yup. This is happening.

           EXT. HAMMERSPACE - CONTINUOUS

           The door to a little house opens and Mason pops his head out. 
           Hammerspace looks like a brightly colored cartoon world. 

           He sees other TEWNS similar to Punchy going about their 
           goofy, unfamiliar lives, happy as can be. All the cartoon 
           physics that seemed special in our world are on full display 
           all around him. It’s organized chaos.

           He needs to find The Grinz, but doesn’t know where to begin.

           That’s when A GIANT YELLOW BALL rises in the sky like the 
           sun. But as it spins around, a pair of DISEMBODIED WHITE 
           GLOVED HANDS uncover a GIANT SMILEY FACE.

                                 THE GRINZ
                        Mason! You’re still alive! I’m so 
                        happy to see you!

           This is THE GRINZ, the creature Henry evolved into, and he 
           truly is disturbingly happy. Mason is speechless.

                                 THE GRINZ (CONT’D)
                        That means the door must be open! 
                        This is wonderful news!

           The Grinz approaches, seemingly floating through the sky. 
           Mason is equal parts horrified and fascinated.
                                 MASON
                        Dad?

           The Grinz pauses, hovering above him.

                                 THE GRINZ
                        Why aren’t you smiling?

                                 MASON
                        I thought you were dead.

                                 THE GRINZ
                        Then you should be happy I’m not!

           The Grinz pulls Mason’s face into a forced smile and lets it 
           go. It snaps back to a concerned look.

                                 THE GRINZ (CONT’D)
                        Turn that frown upside down!

           The Grinz literally flips Mason’s mouth upside down. Mason is 
           annoyed and flips it back.

                                 MASON
                        Do you have any idea what you did 
                        to us? To mom?

                                 THE GRINZ
                        I went to a better place. And I’m 
                        going to bring it to you!
                             (face darkening)
                        In Human Space, you suffer. You 
                        hurt. You feel guilt and sadness 
                        and hopelessness.
                             (face lights up again)
                        But Hammerspace is the opposite!

           The Grinz swirls around, showing off the wonders of this 
           universe. The Tewns all start to pay attention.

           Mason pulls out the FAMILY PHOTO, now appearing like a hand-
           drawn cartoon. He thrusts it up in The Grinz’s face.

                                 MASON
                        You abandoned your family. How are 
                        you happy about that?

           The Grinz looks at the photo with his ever-present smile, 
           then shows it to all of the Tewns watching curiously.

                                 THE GRINZ
                        Look how sad. Soon we’ll make them 
                        happy!
                                 MASON
                        If you destroy Locker 17, you could 
                        destroy life as we know it.

                                 THE GRINZ
                        Life as you know it has been pretty 
                        rotten. So it can only get better!

           POP! The Grinz pulls DYNAMITE AND A MATCH from behind his 
           back. He reaches out his other hand to Mason.

                                 THE GRINZ (CONT’D)
                        Give yourself to the bright side!

           Mason backs away, slowly. The Tewns advance, even slower.

                                 MASON
                        You’re crazy.

                                 THE GRINZ
                        It’s pronounced “happy”!

           Mason turns and runs back through Punchy’s house. The Grinz 
           chases after him, striking the match as he goes.

           Mason reaches the little door to Human Space and dives 
           through. But The Grinz is right behind him, LIGHTING THE 
           DYNAMITE.

           INT. LOCKER ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Mason tumbles out onto the floor, gasping for air as he 
           recovers from the sudden transformation from 2D.

           Agent Broder and his team have Chet and the others held at 
           gunpoint. Mason looks at Chet for the key.

                                 MASON
                        SHUT THE DOOR!

           But Broder dangles the Hammer Key, tauntingly.

                                 AGENT BRODER
                        I don’t think so.

           A PAIR OF LARGE WHITE GLOVES reach through the door, pulling 
           the bulbous, yellow globe that is The Grinz out of 
           Hammerspace and into Human Space.

           Like Punchy, The Grinz appears as a CGI-style creature in 
           this universe. A giant floating head with disembodied hands.
           The humans stand there in awe and horror. The Grinz takes it 
           in with a huge smile. He looks back at the LIT DYNAMITE 
           planted on the open locker door, no longer just a 2D item.

                                 THE GRINZ
                        This New-niverse starts with a 
                        bang!

           The humans all run for cover in the roller rink.

           The Grinz happily floats their way as the dynamite DETONATES 
           behind him, blowing Locker 17 apart. The door flies into the 
           roller rink, knocking Agent Broder over. 

           He drops the key. It slides over to cowering Chet just as the 
           locker door lands next to him, useless.

           INT. LOCKER ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The portal, now destabilized, starts to expand into the rink. 
           LIGHT AND ENERGY pulsing outward in unpredictable ways, 
           blending the 2D look of Hammerspace with anything it touches.

           INT. ROLLER RINK - CONTINUOUS

           As the Lab Techs flee the building, Agent Broder recovers 
           from the blow, rallying his men.

                                 AGENT BRODER
                             (into radio)
                        Regroup. Contain and control. Take 
                        lethal measures if necessary.

           In the chaos, Ellen, Wyatt, and Mallory take cover in Henry’s 
           office. Punchy’s table has fallen over. She’s still stuck.

                                 PUNCHY
                        Little help here!

           Mason crawls over to free Punchy from the table in the rink. 
           She bounces up and hugs Mason. He’s surprised, but hugs back.

                                 THE GRINZ (O.C.)
                        How touching!

           They turn to face The Grinz. Punchy is livid.

                                 PUNCHY
                             (getting in his face)
                        You lied to me. You stole my image. 
                        You put stupid words in my mouth! 
                        And now I keep saying them!
                                 THE GRINZ
                        Oh, Punchy. You’ve become such a 
                        downer. Chin up!

           The Grinz smacks Punchy across the room. She bounces into the 
           sound booth, triggering an upbeat 90s jam to echo through the 
           rink. Punchy stands up, hurt, but determined.

                                 PUNCHY
                        Okay. You wanted Punchy Power, 
                        you’re gonna get Punchy Power.

           ARMED AGENTS rush in, surrounding The Grinz. But their guns 
           are aimed at Punchy too. Her hands go up.

                                 PUNCHY (CONT’D)
                        Or... not.

           Mason sees Chet uselessly trying to put the Hammer Key back 
           into the lock on the blown off door to Locker 17.

                                 MASON
                        That could be put to better use.

           Chet, out of his element, hands it over. 

                                 CHET STANLEY
                        I just wanted to find other worlds.

                                 MASON
                        And I just want to save them.

           In the center of the rink, The Grinz and Punchy are 
           surrounded. The energy from the portal encroaching nearby.

                                 AGENT BRODER
                        Surrender yourself.

                                 THE GRINZ
                        I don’t take orders from Grumpy 
                        Guses. I cheer them up!

           The Grinz does a fantastic spin, his disembodied hands 
           swinging out and knocking all the Agents over. Punchy ducks 
           and rolls, running up to Mason across the way.

           The Agents regroup as the energy from the portal expands into 
           the rink, lashing out at them. Wherever its energy hits, it 
           turns our 3D reality into 2D cartoons.

                                 AGENT BRODER
                        OPEN FIRE!
           Bullets riddle The Grinz, but they seemingly detonate on 
           impact, leaving his face cartoonishly smoke-blasted, but not 
           the least bit harmed. He’s basking in the portal’s energy.

                                 THE GRINZ
                        You see! In Human Space the answer 
                        is violence. The response is pain. 
                        The result is misery. I’m offering 
                        you an escape from all of that!

           The Grinz rises up to the second floor, looking down upon 
           them all. The Agents are being consumed by the energy, 
           blending the physics and appearance of both worlds.

                                 THE GRINZ (CONT’D)
                        An escape from the confines of 
                        cause and effect. An escape from 
                        the suffering of illness and 
                        injury.
                             (noticing Mason is gone)
                        An escape from death as you know 
                        it.

           Agent Broder looks at his arm as it pulses between human and 
           cartoon-looking. His stoic demeanor is gone.

                                 THE GRINZ (CONT’D)
                        Come, Tewns! It’s the dawn of the 
                        New-niverse!

           OTHER TEWNS FROM HAMMERSPACE tentatively come through the 
           portal. They, too, fluctuate between their 2D selves and 3D 
           versions, depending on their portal exposure.

           Chet Stanley is in awe as the Tewns outnumber the Agents. 
           They pounce on them, rumbling like a cartoon cloud fight.

           When it’s over, the Tewns have the weapons in the portal 
           energy. They bend them all like cartoon rifles. Useless.

           Agent Broder flees the building.

           INT. OFFICE - SAME

           Mason and Punchy strategize with Ellen, Wyatt, and Mallory.

                                 MASON
                        The only way to hurt The Grinz is 
                        to lure him away from the portal 
                        energy. Mom?

                                 ELLEN
                        Yes?
                                 MASON
                        Think you could talk to dad?

                                 ELLEN
                             (processing)
                        I have a thing or two I’d like to 
                        say to him.

                                 MASON
                        Okay. The rest of you. Arm 
                        yourselves. We have a Tewn army to 
                        send back to Hammerspace.

           Wyatt grabs his skateboard. Mallory grabs a PAIR OF ROLLER 
           SKATES TIED AT THE LACES. Punchy grabs the Punchy Pogo Stick.

                                 PUNCHY
                             (annoyed)
                        Really?

           INT. ROLLER RINK - SAME

           Wyatt speeds out into the rink on his skateboard, dodging in 
           and out of cartoon energy, amazed at how it changes him.

           Punchy bounces out behind him on her pogo stick. She lands on 
           a TEWN, knocking him to the ground. The Tewn responds in 
           utter terror.

                                 TEWN 1
                             (clutching his face)
                        What is this horrible feeling?

                                 PUNCHY
                        That’s a consequence.

                                 TEWN 1
                        I-I don’t like it!

           The Tewn runs right back through the portal. Punchy realizes 
           the Tewns are easily scared off by the new sensation of pain.

                                 PUNCHY
                             (calling to the others)
                        They’re afraid of consequences!

           Mallory, wearing one pair of skates and swinging the tied 
           together pair like nunchucks, is taking out Tewns left and 
           right. The ones not in the energy get hurt and run away.

           Wyatt flips his board around, smacking TEWNS as well.
                                 PUNCHY (CONT’D)
                             (to the other Tewns)
                        Don’t listen to The Grinz! He’s 
                        taken all the good of Hammerspace 
                        and warped it for his own means. We 
                        used to be happy. BEFORE these 
                        worlds were connected. BEFORE The 
                        Grinz. BEFORE fake laughing!

           The destabilized portal starts to shake the whole building. 
           Walls crack. The rink splits in half. And the fabric of 
           reality seems to be stretching and warping in front of them.

                                 PUNCHY (CONT’D)
                        Look what he’s done to us all!

           The Tewns start to see that Punchy is right. We follow a few 
           of them back through the portal into...

           INT. HAMMERSPACE - CONTINUOUS

           The Tewns come piling back into Hammerspace, nursing wounds 
           they’ve never experienced before in a world that’s being torn 
           apart. Human Space and Hammerspace are destroying each other.

           INT. ROLLER RINK - SAME

           Punchy, Wyatt, and Mallory continue scaring off the Tewns, 
           enraging The Grinz. He’s about to go after them when Ellen 
           steps out of the shadows before him.

           In the portal light, she shifts into a 2D Hammerspace look.

                                 THE GRINZ
                        Ellen?

                                 ELLEN
                        H-Henry?

                                 THE GRINZ
                        You look beautiful like this!

                                 ELLEN
                        You look monstrous like that.

           It’s the first time The Grinz shows any sign of insecurity.

                                 THE GRINZ
                        I did this for us.
                                 ELLEN
                        You left me for us? You left the 
                        boys for us? No. You did this for 
                        you. Because you’re a coward.

           Ellen slowly backs away, luring The Grinz out of the energy.

                                 THE GRINZ
                        I had to find a better way. 

                                 ELLEN
                        You had to run away. From life.

                                 THE GRINZ
                        From pain. No more pain, Ellen. 

                                 ELLEN
                        Without pain there’s no 
                        perspective. And you’ve given me 
                        both since you left. 

                                 THE GRINZ
                        Hammerspace will change that.

           Ellen steps out of the energy, shifting back into her human 
           self. The Grinz goes with her, no longer protected.

                                 ELLEN
                        Hammerspace didn’t change you. It 
                        just let the real you out. Sad, 
                        addicted, and delusional.

                                 THE GRINZ 
                             (infuriated)
                        IT’S PRONOUNCED “HAPPY”!

           Mason steps out behind The Grinz. POP! He pulls out the TASER 
           used on him by the Cosmic Comics Guard and fires. 

           Shock waves of electricity flow through The Grinz.

           EXT. ROLLER RINK - SAME

           The crowd outside the perimeter watches Lab Techs and Agents 
           regrouping outside, but can only see what seems like an 
           excessive light show going on inside.

                                 TRAVIS
                        Those special effects are weak.

           A car pulls up and out pops Velma Mathers with her COSMIC 
           COMICS LEGAL REP, 40s, confused about the hubbub. 
           INT. ROLLER RINK - CONTINUOUS

           Without the protection of the portal energy, The Grinz 
           suffers. But it’s not enough. He flies into the sky, pulling 
           Mason by the taser cords with him.

           EXT. ROLLER RINK - SAME

           The Grinz smashes through the roof of the rink, revealing 
           himself to the crowd outside. A wall falls down, revealing 
           multiple Tewns bouncing all over the place inside.

                                 TRAVIS
                        Okay. Those effects are decent.

           The whole crowd is FILMING THIS ON THEIR PHONES.

                                 VELMA MATHERS
                             (to her Legal Rep)
                        We’re going to have a much bigger 
                        problem than we thought.

           INT. ROLLER RINK - CONTINUOUS

           The Grinz swings Mason around by the taser, finally swiping 
           him loose. Mason goes crashing into the second floor snack 
           bar. He recovers quickly, just as the rink begins to crumble.

           Down below, Mason sees Wyatt about to get squashed by a 
           falling object outside the energy field. Without thinking, 
           Mason rips the Hammer Key from his neck.

                                 MASON
                        WYATT!

           Wyatt looks up as Mason throws him the Hammer Key, but 
           they’re both lost in the falling rubble. Wyatt is squashed.

                                 MASON (CONT’D)
                        No!

           Mason, suddenly weakened without the key, stumbles down to 
           the rink. Ellen and Mallory have already rushed over in a 
           panic, trying to dig Wyatt out. The Grinz hovers nearby.

                                 MASON (CONT’D)
                             (to The Grinz)
                        You see what you’ve done!

           Punchy gets the last of the Tewns through the portal just in 
           time to see one of her humans receive the ultimate 
           consequence up close and personal. It’s horrible.
                                 THE GRINZ
                        Something that wouldn’t happen if 
                        he’d been in Hammerspace.

           The portal energy pulses and flashes between them, constantly 
           altering their states, warping reality.

                                 MASON
                        There won’t be a Hammerspace! 
                        You’re destroying both worlds!

                                 THE GRINZ
                        It’s just growing pains! Now, show 
                        me that smile again!

           Mason can’t believe he’s making jokes. He really is insane.

                                 MALLORY (O.C.)
                        Look!

           A FLATTENED HAND reaches out from under the debris. It pulls 
           out the FLATTENED BODY of Wyatt. He stands up, paper thin and 
           wobbling around. The Hammer Key in one hand.

           He’s amazed he survived. He puts his other thumb in his mouth 
           and blows, inflating himself back to a healthy state.

                                 WYATT
                        That. Was. AMAZING!

           Mason hugs his brother. Ellen hugs them both. Then she takes 
           Wyatt’s face in her hands, so relieved. 

                                 ELLEN
                        I always see you. You’re just so 
                        strong I forget you need me. 

                                 THE GRINZ
                        You see. Everything’s better!

           Wyatt steps forward, facing his dad for the first time. And 
           really seeing him for what he is. He nods his head.

                                 WYATT
                        Everything’s better. Without you.

                                 MASON
                        You’re not The Grinz. You’ve been 
                        The Misery all along.

           The Grinz is enraged. He flies into a fit, revealing that 
           even he isn’t as happy as he may seem.

           Enveloped in the portal energy, he smashes through a wall.
           EXT. ROLLER RINK - CONTINUOUS

           Agent Broder is ready for him. They open fire, blowing The 
           Grinz back into the rink.

           INT. ROLLER RINK - SAME

           The Grinz smashes through a back wall. It’s unclear if he’s 
           survived this onslaught. The family huddles together.

           Punchy looks around at the destruction unfolding, finally 
           realizing that her visits to Human Space have had real 
           consequences. Ones she needs to take responsibility for. 

           Punchy reaches out and takes the Hammer Key from Wyatt. Mason 
           realizes what she’s doing.

                                 MASON
                        But there’s no actual door.

                                 PUNCHY
                        There’s still a portal.

           She heads into the energy, back where the locker room used to 
           be. Mason gets up and chases after her.

           INT. LOCKER ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Mason and Punchy get close to the origin of the portal.

                                 PUNCHY
                        Here. Hold this for a second.

           Mason takes the key, confused. Punchy steps through the 
           portal to Hammerspace, facing each other.

                                 MASON
                        Wait. You’re going back?

                                 PUNCHY
                        You’re not the only one with a 
                        family to protect.

                                 MASON
                        You have a family?!

                                 PUNCHY
                        Humans. So self-involved.

           Punchy hauls back and punches Mason with all she’s got, but 
           it doesn’t knock him back; her hand went right into him.
           But Mason is suddenly yanked away. The Grinz has him by the 
           feet, dragging him and the Hammer Key away from the portal.

                                 THE GRINZ
                        Mason! You’re holding the key to 
                        happiness! Don’t throw it away!

                                 MASON
                        You want the key to happiness?
                             (looks up at Punchy)
                        Never fake a laugh.

           Mason throws the key through the portal. Punchy catches it on 
           the other side, CAUSING THE PORTAL ENERGY TO REVERSE. 

           Reality bends and warps as the Hammerspace element is quickly 
           pulled away from Human Space, spiraling towards the portal. 

                                 THE GRINZ
                        No!

           Punchy shares one final wave to Mason from across two worlds.

                                 PUNCHY
                        See you at The Crossroads!

           THE BLOWN APART DOOR OF LOCKER 17 flies back toward the 
           portal, slamming shut between them and sealing it forever.

           Everything is suddenly silent. No more destruction. No more 
           warping reality. Just plain old Human Space.

           The Grinz has lost all hope. He lets go of Mason. 

           Mason stands up, staring at Locker 17, which now has the same 
           “lock and take” key as every other locker. He opens it, but 
           it’s just a regular locker. Punchy and Hammerspace are gone.

           Behind him, Ellen, Wyatt, and Mallory come in.

                                 ELLEN
                        Are you okay?

                                 MASON
                             (shell-shocked)
                        I hate that question.

           They turn to see The Grinz, writhing on the floor. Trapped in 
           Human Space, he’s starting to revert to his human form of 
           HENRY MULLIGAN, 40s. Shaking and panicked like an addict. 

           The transformation is disturbing, but his face finally 
           resembles the man Ellen once knew. He looks up at her, manic.
                                 HENRY
                        The key to happiness. I had it.

                                 ELLEN
                             (looks at her boys)
                        Yes. You did.

           Agent Broder and his team rush in, guns ready. Ellen and the 
           kids back away from Henry, hands up. Agents secure the room.

                                 AGENT BRODER
                             (to Mason)
                        Where is it? Where is The Grinz?

           Mason motions to Henry on the floor. 

                                 AGENT BRODER (CONT’D)
                        And the alien known as Punchy?

           Mason gestures to Locker 17. Agent Broder approaches 
           cautiously. He opens the door. Nothing. Just a locker.

                                 AGENT BRODER (CONT’D)
                             (into radio)
                        It’s clear.

           Chet Stanley and the Lab Techs come back in, cautiously 
           observing the destruction all around them. Some objects 
           remain warped by the Hammerspace energy. It’s fascinating.

           Chet sees Henry, rocking on the floor like a crazy person.

                                 HENRY
                        I’m not The Misery. I’m not The 
                        Misery. I’m not The Misery.

                                 CHET STANLEY
                        Mr. Mulligan?

                                 HENRY
                        MY NAME IS THE GRINZ!

                                 LAB TECH 1
                        Okay. Mr. Grinz. Up on the table.

           He starts to resist, but they restrain him on a stretcher. 

                                 AGENT BRODER
                             (to Chet)
                        We’ve appropriated your van and the 
                        research you left in your motel. Is 
                        there anything else you want to 
                        share with us?
                                 CHET STANLEY
                             (innocently)
                        Me? I’m just a crackpot.

           Chet turns and walks out of the rink with a satisfied smile. 

                                 HENRY
                             (to his family)
                        Happiness. Happiness. You all want 
                        this happiness.

           Mason looks at his family, his friend. Then back at his 
           father, with a sense of closure he never expected.

                                 MASON
                        We’ll settle for this happy mess.

           Lab Techs roll Henry away, ranting and raving like a lunatic.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MALLORY’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           It’s really late. Mallory comes home to find her PARENTS 
           watching the news. She’s startled to see them.

                                 MALLORY
                        Hey. Did you get dish soap?

                                 MALLORY’S DAD
                        Didn’t have time.

           Mallory nods, it figures. She heads to her room. Mallory’s 
           Mom actually looks away from the TV at her.

                                 MALLORY’S MOM
                        This place is a mess. What have you 
                        been doing?

           Mallory tries to think of how to explain it. Shrugs.

                                 MALLORY
                        Saving the world.

           She escapes to her room just as VIRAL FOOTAGE FROM THE CROWD 
           OUTSIDE THE ROLLER RINK comes up on the news. Mallory walking 
           away from the rubble. Her parents exchange a surprised look.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. MASON’S BEDROOM - MORNING

           Under the covers, Mason sleeps like he’s dead. Wyatt stands 
           over him, nervously, trying to see if he’s breathing. Mason 
           opens his eyes. And SCREAMS. Wyatt screams too.

                                 MASON
                        What are you doing?!

                                 WYATT
                        I thought you were dead!

                                 MASON
                        I will be if you keep doing that!

           Out of habit, Mason reaches for a BOTTLE OF PILLS at his 
           bedside. He goes down the line. Back to the routine.

           INT. MULLIGAN HOUSE - KITCHEN 

           The boys come downstairs, hearing the familiar sound of Ellen 
           cooking breakfast while talking on the phone.

           But when they enter, they’re surprised to see she’s talking 
           to Velma Mathers and her Legal Rep, sitting at the table.

                                 MASON
                        Whoa. What... what’s going on?

                                 WYATT
                        You can’t sue us! 

                                 ELLEN
                        Guys. Settle down. Ms. Mathers is 
                        just about to sign some documents.

           Ellen passes her a PROPERTY DEED. Ms. Mathers signs it.

                                 VELMA MATHERS
                        I still don’t fully understand what 
                        went on in that roller rink, but I 
                        do understand the value of social a 
                        media phenomenon.

           Legal Rep pulls up an iPad, flipping through various sites 
           and clips, showing footage of last night’s epic events.

                                 LEGAL REP
                        Hammerspace is trending through the 
                        roof. 
                             (off The Grinz footage)
                        Quite literally. You can’t buy this 
                        kind of publicity!
                                 VELMA MATHERS
                             (finishes signing)
                        But you can buy property. 
                             (eyeing Ellen)
                        For an exorbitant fee.
                             (to the boys)
                        But it’s a small price to pay for 
                        what will surely be a family 
                        destination for years to come.

                                 MASON
                        Family destination?

           Velma and her Legal Rep pack up and head for the door.

                                 VELMA MATHERS
                        A theme park, of course. Tied 
                        directly into the live-action 
                        movie. We’ve put that into 
                        development immediately. It’ll be a 
                        found-footage approach, to maintain 
                        the illusion of reality.

           She spots an IRON MAN MASK. Wyatt quickly kicks it away.

                                 VELMA MATHERS (CONT’D)
                             (suspiciously)
                        Which is becoming harder and harder 
                        to do these days.
                             (shaking Ellen’s hand)
                        Thank you for your business. Send 
                        our regards to Henry. I hope he 
                        gets the help he needs.

           And with that, Velma Mathers walks out of their lives. 

           EXT. MULLIGAN HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           The Mulligans stare after her.

                                 WYATT
                        The illusion of reality?

                                 MASON
                             (to Ellen)
                        She bought the rink?

                                 ELLEN
                             (giddy, with a secret)
                        She bought the rink. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ELLEN (CONT'D)
                        A property she has yet to realize 
                        has been seized by the government 
                        and won’t be available for 
                        development for a long, long time. 
                        But hey, we don’t have to move.

           Her phone PINGS. She looks down at it.

                                 ELLEN (CONT’D)
                             (to Mason)
                        Go get dressed. You missed your 
                        appointment and they’re squeezing 
                        you in today. 

           Ellen and Wyatt go back inside. Mason stands there, looking 
           at his PICC line. So much has changed. So much is the same.

           INT. DOCTOR’S OFFICE - LATER

           Mason sits in a chair as a NURSE sets up an IV into his PICC 
           line. He’s still processing everything he’s been through. He 
           hears his mom and DOCTOR in the hall.

                                 ELLEN (O.C.)
                        But I-I don’t understand.

                                 DOCTOR (O.C.)
                        We’ll have to run more tests to be 
                        certain. I’m honestly baffled. The 
                        cancer just seems to be... gone.

           Mason hears this and looks up at The Nurse, equally confused. 
           She motions that she’ll be a moment and steps outside.

           Mason looks down at the PICC line, at his body. He puts his 
           hand on his chest where Punchy last hit him.

           FLASH BACK: LOCKER ROOM

           Punchy’s hand is inside Mason’s chest. The Grinz yanks Mason 
           away. What Mason didn’t see in the chaos was that Punchy was 
           left holding a GLOB OF GREENISH GOO. 

           POP! She pulls a HAZARDOUS WASTE BAG from her pocket and 
           dumps the goo inside, tossing it out of sight in Hammerspace.

           BACK TO SCENE:

           Mason realizes that Punchy removed it. He looks at the 
           returning Nurse, who starts to remove his PICC line. 
           A million emotions run through his face. He looks up to see 
           Ellen mirroring his reaction. Everything really has changed.

           INT. MULLIGAN HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Mason finds Wyatt and Mallory on the couch, watching CARTOON 
           PUNCHY in another adventure on the Hammerspace series. 
           Somehow, they know the real Punchy is doing the same.

                                 CARTOON PUNCHY
                        It’s time for Punchy Power!

                                 MASON
                             (smiles at the TV)
                        It’s time to go.

           He pulls on his straight jacket. Wyatt is surprised.

                                 WYATT
                        I thought we were going as heroes. 
                        You look like... Dad.

                                 MASON
                             (shrugs)
                        Losing his mind saved my life.
                             (off Wyatt’s doubt)
                        Sometimes villains can be redeemed. 
                        You need to read more comics.

           Wyatt rolls his eyes with a smirk and dons his Star Lord 
           mask. Mallory puts the Punchy mask on. It’s Halloween. A day 
           Mason didn’t think he’d see again. They head outside.

           Ellen watches the kids go off. She smiles, at peace with her 
           family. Then she sees the TV still on. She grabs the remote, 
           takes one last look at Hammerspace. And clicks it off.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.
           OVER THE CLOSING CREDITS:

           We see all the things Mason pulled and where they came from: 

           1. A GAY COUPLE preps for movie night. The STRAIT JACKET DVD 
           by the TV. Mason’s hand warps through reality, groping around 
           unseen till he grabs it. The couple turns back, confused.

           2. ORDERLIES in a mental ward try to wrangle a CRAZY INMATE. 
           Mason’s hand warps through reality, snatching the STRAIGHT 
           JACKET behind them. They can’t find it. Inmate runs free.

           3. A MAN paints his house. He puts a BRUSH AND PAINT CAN down 
           to evaluate his work. Mason’s hand warps through reality, 
           snagging the can and brush. The man reaches down. Nothing.

           4. A ROAD MAINTENANCE CREW opens a MANHOLE COVER, but the 
           hole below is missing. It’s just paved over. They’re baffled. 
           THREE MORE MANHOLES behind them are the same.

           5. The same Man painting his house comes back with another 
           BRUSH. When he puts it down, Mason’s hand appears behind him 
           and snatches it. The man thinks he’s losing his mind.

           6. The Man exits a hardware store, puts new PAINT AND BRUSH 
           in his back seat. Mason’s hand warps through and grabs them. 
           The man looks in his rearview - they’re gone. He gives up.

           7. A high-security bank is closed for the night. Mason’s hand 
           warps through reality, snatching a LAPTOP off a banker’s 
           desk. When it unplugs, an ALARM BLARES.

           8. A WATER PARK EMPLOYEE is baffled as he notes that all the 
           holes at the top and bottom of the slides are now closed off. 
           No holes. Water is bursting out of all the seams.

           9. A kid’s birthday party. Mason’s hand warps through and
