           BUBBLES, a grizzled, muscular, 33-year-old chimpanzee lazily 
           knuckle walks across the floor of a large, domed enclosure 
           nestled in a verdant Florida woodland. 

           SUPER: Center for Great Apes - Wachula, Florida - Present Day

                        There are many kinds of kingdoms in 
                        this world. And many kinds of 
                        kings.

           Bubbles scoops up a hunk of sweet potato from the ground.

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        I have known more than most, though 
                        all here have served outside these 
                        castle walls in some capacity. 

           He comes upon a cluster of three chimps, acknowledges them.

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        Butch and Chipper served The 
                        Ringling Brothers, as did Petunia. 

           Moving along, he passes two other chimps.

                        Ellie and her friend Kodua were 
                        both in a Super Bowl commercial.

           A third chimp runs over, WHACKS Ellie on the head and then 
           runs off.

                        That’s Jonah. He starred in a 
                        “Planet of the Apes” film. 
                        Unfortunately, it was the one 
                        people didn’t enjoy.

           Bubbles effortlessly ASCENDS a wooden jungle gym, then sits 
           perched on the top of it, overlooking his domain, munching 
           his sweet potato.

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        Now this is their kingdom, and I am  
                        their king. But it was not always 
                        so. I was once heir to the greatest 
                        kingdom on Earth, one ruled by a 
                        king like none before him. But 
                        every kingdom, great or small, has 
                        its boundaries. Its walls. Every 
                        kingdom is itself a kind of cage.

                        I have in my life become a student 
                        of cages. 

           His ruminations are interrupted by...

                                 FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        Good morning, everyone.

           He looks down to see LAURA (30s), one of the sanctuary staff, 
           approaching from outside the enclosure.

                                 LAURA
                        We have a visitor today...

           Bubbles shifts his gaze to an indistinct figure behind her - 
           a MAN IN WHITE. Dark, longish hair. Sunglasses.

           Could it be..?

           Bubbles’ eyes widen. His pulse quickens. He scurries down 
           from his perch. Races across the enclosure, nudging other 
           chimps from his path.

           But as he nears...his face falls. The visitor is not who he’d 
           hoped. It’s just a stranger in lab coat. It’s just...

                                 LAURA (CONT’D)
                        ...a primate specialist who has 
                        come all the way from Orlando to 
                        meet you! 

           Bubbles regards DR. ARNOLD OMAR (40s) a moment. Disappointed.

           INT. LABORATORY - DAY

           A tiny two-year-old Bubbles sits in a small metal cage, 
           clasping a terry cloth blanket. Lonely. Frightened. 

           SUPER: “University of Texas - Anderson Cancer Center - 1985”

           BUBBLES P.O.V.

           ...as a doorway opens at the end of a long, antiseptic 
           hallway lined with caged baby chimps. 

           Two men enter. One is the LAB TECH familiar to Bubbles, the 
           other a stranger in dressed in white. Curly black hair. Giant 
           mirrored shades.
           As they near, the two men become visible only from the waist 
           down. They stop in front of Bubbles’ cage.

                                 LAB TECH
                        This is the one.

           The strange man leans over and we see it’s...MICHAEL JACKSON 
           (27) the King of Pop in his ethereal prime. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Oh my gosh. He’s so beautiful. 
                        Hello, little friend! 

                                 LAB TECH
                        Lucky for him, he was in the 
                        control group. 
                             (beat)
                        Anyway, he’s aged out of our study 
                        now, so...

           Michael reaches a gloved finger through the cage bars. 

                                 LAB TECHNICIAN 
                        I wouldn’t do that, sir, he might--

           Before he can say more, Bubbles wraps his tiny hand around 
           Michael’s finger. Michael beams with joy.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I love him.

           INT. LIMO - MOVING - LOS ANGELES - DAY  

           Michael rides in the back of a large limo. Bubbles sits in 
           his lap, looking out the window. BILLY BRAY (50s), Michael’s 
           beefy African-American chief of security, sits opposite them.

                                 MICHAEL
                        This is Los Angeles. This is where 
                        you’re going to live. 

           Michael points out the window at the Hollywood sign.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        That’s where they make movies. Have 
                        you ever seen a movie?

           He points in another direction.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        And over there is Disneyland. You 
                        can’t see it from here, but it’s 
                        the best place in the whole world! 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        You’ll love it here. Everyone is so 
                        friendly. Watch...

           The limo pulls to a halt at a stoplight. Michael Jackson 
           rolls down the window. The car next to them is filled with 
           TEENAGE GIRLS dressed in 80s mall gear.

           Jackson sticks his head out. One girl sees him, then another. 
           They grab each other, point, roll down their windows. A 
           frenzy of disbelief.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        Hey, girls.

           In unison they open their mouths and SCREAM. 

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        I had been among humans since birth 
                        yet never before had I heard a 
                        sound such as this.

           The noise terrifies Bubbles. He clings to Michael, who laughs 
           and rolls up the window, drowning out the sound of the still 
           screaming girls. Bubbles is shaken. 

                                 MICHAEL 
                        We’re going to have so much fun 
                        together.

           EXT. HAYVENHURST  - DAY

           The limo pulls into a long driveway as iron gates close 
           behind it. Ahead is Hayvenhurst - a large, mock Tudor mansion 
           with an ornate fountain in the front yard. Parked in the 
           driveway are several EXPENSIVE CARS.  

           Billy exits first, then Michael gets out carrying Bubbles.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Let’s go meet your new friends.

           EXT. HAYVENHURST MANSION - MENAGERIE - DAY

           Michael carries Bubbles through his private menagerie. They 
           encounter TWO PEACOCKS freely wandering the grounds.

                                 MICHAEL
                        This is Winter, and that one is 
                        Spring.

           Next they move onto TWO LLAMAS in an enclosure.
                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        This is Louis Armstrong and Lola 
                        Falana. Lola is the grumpy one.

           Next, a GIRAFFE.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        And this is Jabar.

           Moving on, a RAM.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        And his name is Mr. Tibbs.

           Now they approach a large PYTHON.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        And this is Madonna. She’s pretty, 
                        but she’s mean. 

           Bubbles recoils with atavistic fear. Michael laughs, pats 
           Bubbles’ head.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        It’s okay. No one will hurt you 
                        here. I would never let that 
                        happen. 

           A beat as Bubbles watches the snake flicker its tongue. 

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        Let’s go have ice cream.

           INT. HAYVENHURST - MICHAEL’S ROOM - DAY

           The room is a clutter of books, magazines, record albums, 
           stuffed animals. On the walls, pictures of Diana Ross, Barbra 
           Streisand, Shirley Temple.  

           Bubbles eats an ice cream cone as Michael looks on with a 
           smile. Then he hears a RUMBLE from outside. Michael leaps to 
           his feet, crosses to the window. He pulls back the shades and 
           looks out. His expression darkens.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Joe.

           He continues watching for a moment, then he races over and 
           SNATCHES up Bubbles, causing Bubbles to drop his ice-cream. 
           Cradling Bubbles to his chest, Michael dives under his bed. 
           MICHAEL AND BUBBLES’ POV

           ...as they look out from their hiding place. Bubbles WHIMPERS 
           at the sight of his ice-cream cone lying tantalyzingly out of 
           reach. Michael cups his hand over the chimp’s mouth.

           FOOTSTEPS approach. There’s a KNOCK at the door. A moment 
           passes and then FOOTSTEPS recede down the hallway. 

           BACK TO SCENE

           ...as Bubbles scampers out from beneath the bed, scoops his 
           ice-cream off the floor and resumes eating.

           INT. HAYVENHURST - PLAYROOM - NIGHT

           “The Wizard of Oz” plays on a large TV in the background 
           while Michael, now dressed in pajamas, blows soap bubbles 
           from a bubble wand.    

           Bubbles watches one float across the room. He is instantly, 
           utterly captivated. 

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        A name, a name, what is in a name? 
                        Would my fate would have taken some 
                        better turn had I shown greater 
                        interest in one of the many other 
                        playthings surrounding me in those 
                        days? 

           Bubbles follows the bubble across the room. 

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        Might I have earned a moniker more 
                        dignified? More regal? A name 
                        befitting the future king? 

           Bubbles climbs onto the couch as the soap bubble rises. He 
           leaps down to chase it as it drifts further away.

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        So much our lives are writ in our 
                        youth, a time largely beyond our 
                        control, a time when events unfold 
                        without our consent. Though perhaps 
                        all of life is ever thus.  

           Bubbles catches up with the bubble. He cautiously reaches out 
           to touch it. The moment his finger makes contact...POP! It 
           bursts, startling the chimp. 

           Michael cracks up, clapping his hands in delight.
                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        And so it was I became “Bubbles.”

           INT. HAYVENHURST - MOVIE THEATRE - DAY

           Michael shovels popcorn in his face as he watches “Peter 
           Pan.” Bubbles sits in the seat next him, examining a popcorn 
           kernel. He gives it a curious sniff.

           A shaft of light emerges from the back of the room as a door 
           swings open. Michael turns to see...

           LINDA (30s), an attractive if tired-looking member of the 
           house staff silhouetted in the doorway.

                                 LINDA
                        Sunday supper.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I already ate.

                                 LINDA
                        Your mom said to come get you. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Is Joe gonna be there?

                                 LINDA
                        All I know is Katherine told me to 
                        come tell you it’s Sunday supper.

           Bubbles turns in his seat. Linda startles at seeing him. Then 
           just shakes her head. Another day at Hayvenhurst.

           INT. HAYVENHURST - HALLWAY - DAY

           Holding Bubbles at his hip, Michael moves through a hallway 
           lined by trophy cases displaying gold records, framed Jackson 
           5 concert posters and various memorabilia. Michael doesn’t 
           spare them a glance as he crosses into the... 

           INT. HAYVENHURST - DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           ...where (almost) all of Michael’s brothers and sisters are 
           seated around a large table. They include: REBBIE (35), 
           JACKIE (34), TITO (32), JERMAINE (31), LA TOYA (29), MARLON 
           (28), and RANDY (24). 

           Also at the table, the family matriarch - KATHERINE (55), 
           prim, conservative.  
           All eyes are on Bubbles as they enter.

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        I had not until then understood The 
                        King had so many subjects living 
                        with us there in the castle.

           La Toya squeals with delight.

                                 LA TOYA
                        Oh my God!

                                 KATHERINE

                                 LA TOYA
                        He’s so cute! 

           Tito rolls his eyes. Jermaine smirks. 

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        I would later find it telling that, 
                        though he had introduced to me each 
                        member of his menagerie by name, he 
                        felt the people here seated to be 
                        beneath my acquaintance.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Where’s Janet?

           As Michael and Bubbles take a seat, JOE (57) enters. A large, 
           imposing man. Slick suit, lots of jewelry. 

                                 JOE
                        Out on tour. Her record just hit 
                        six million. What do you think of 
                        that, Michael? 
                             (noticing Bubbles)
                        Oh, hell no. Not in my house.

           Michael casts down his eyes. Afraid to look at Joe.

                                 LA TOYA
                        He’s adorable, Daddy.

           Joe simmers.

                                 JOE
                        At least put a diaper on him. I 
                        don’t need his monkey junk staring 
                        me in the face while I’m trying to 
                        eat my beanie weenies.
           Marlon and Randy snicker. A SERVER enters with a tray of 
           canned PEPSI soft drinks. Michael recoils at the sight of 
           them. 

           LATER

           The meal is finished. SERVERS cart the dishes away.

                                 JOE
                        I was on the phone with Don King 
                        today. And we both think it’s high 
                        time for another Jackson Five 
                        album.

           Randy, Tito, Marlon and Jermaine nod in agreement. Bubbles 
           reaches for a Pepsi. Michael moves it out of his reach.

                                 JOE (CONT’D)
                        Then next year we tour again. Make 
                        it even bigger than Victory. What 
                        do you say?

                                 MICHAEL
                        I don’t know. Maybe.

           The brothers exchange glances.

                                 JOE
                        Listen, Michael. We let you make 
                        that movie. We let you do solo 
                        records -- not just the one, but 
                        two. Now it’s time to start 
                        recording with your brothers again. 
                        Maybe you think you’re some kinda 
                        big star, but in this house--

                                 MICHAEL
                             (softly)
                        I own this house now. You keep 
                        forgetting that.

                                 JOE
                        And you keep forgetting that if it 
                        wasn’t for me and the rest of this 
                        family--

           Suddenly Michael springs from his seat, holding Bubbles 
           outstretched.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Oh no!
           Bubbles is in mid-urination. His stream SPRAYS onto the table 
           as Michael holds him aloft, panicky, unsure what to do. 

           Chaos erupts! Jackson brothers push back from the table. 
           GLASSES overturn, dishes CLATTER to the floor.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        No Bubbles! Stop! Bad!

           La Toya giggles. Katherine covers her eyes. Joe takes another 
           swig of Pepsi, unamused.

                                 JOE
                        Told you he needs a diaper.

           INT. HAYVENHURST - MICHAEL’S ROOM - NIGHT 

           Michael plays with Bubbles (now in a diaper) on the floor. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Who’s a bad little chimpanzee? 

           He points at Bubbles. Bubbles imitates him, points back.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        I’m bad? No. You’re bad. Let’s try 
                        again. Who’s bad? Who’s bad, 
                        Bubbles?

           Michael points at Bubbles. Bubbles points at Michael. And 
           then...their fingertips meet. Like the ceiling of the Sistine 
           chapel, or the poster for E.T. 

           Michael smiles. Bubbles smiles back.

           EXT. HAYVENHURST - ROOF - NIGHT

           Michael and Bubbles (now in a diaper) sit atop the roof, 
           gazing at the sky. It’s quiet. Peaceful. The stars bright, 
           the moon full. 

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        It was the first time I remember 
                        being fully immersed in the beauty 
                        of night. Stars spilling across the 
                        deep black expanse of the universe 
                        entire, the moon aglow, so massive 
                        and close it seemed like you could 
                        feel its reflective warmth upon 
                        your skin, seemed as if you could 
                        reach out and take it in your very 
                        hands.   
           Bubbles then sees that Michael is silently crying.

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        Having been delivered to this 
                        unexpected paradise, I was 
                        surprised to discover The King did 
                        not share my reverence for this 
                        place, this moment. It was then 
                        perhaps I first began to understand 
                        that fires silently raged within 
                        him, first began to fathom depth of 
                        his unhappiness and glimpse the 
                        immensity of his ambitions.

                                 MICHAEL
                        We’ve got to get out of this place. 
                        Go somewhere we can be free.

           MONTAGE - THE EDUCATION OF BUBBLES 

           -- Bubbles wears overalls (he will be clothed from here on 
           except where noted) and sits in Michael Jackson’s lap on the 
           couch. Michael reads aloud to him from “Great Expectations.”

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        But first, there was the matter of 
                        my education... 

           -- Michael reads Bubbles “Grimm’s Fairy Tales.”

           -- Bubbles looks through a ViewMaster at a reel of “Disney’s 
           Robin Hood.”

           -- Bubbles holds a paint brush. Michael guides his hand 
           across a canvas.

           -- Michael reads Bubbles “The Tales of King Arthur.”

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        ...much of which, despite his many 
                        duties, The King attended to 
                        personally...

           -- Bubbles scribbles in a “Wizard of Oz” coloring book.

           -- Bubbles thumbs through “The Complete Illustrated Works of 
           William Shakespeare.” He holds the book upside down.

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        Though he would occasionally 
                        commission others to assist with 
                        some of the more advanced lessons.
           -- La Toya teaches Bubbles how to use a spoon to eat 
           applesauce.

           -- A GROUNDSKEEPER lets Bubbles hold the hose to water 
           flowers.

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        Chief among these tutors was The 
                        Bearded One...

           EXT. HAYVENHURST - MENAGERIE - DAY

           Bearded animal trainer BOB DUNN (30s) kneels down to be at 
           eye level with Bubbles. He holds his hand out palm up in a 
           chimp gesture of submission. 

                                 BOB
                        How you doing there, fella?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Bubbles, this is your new friend 
                        Bob. He’s going to be teaching us 
                        sign language so we can talk to 
                        each other.

           Bubbles touches Bob’s hand. Bob smiles. 

           INT. ELIZABETH TAYLOR’S HOME - TEAROOM - DAY

           Michael and Bubbles have tea with Michael’s good friend, the 
           outsized former movie icon ELIZABETH TAYLOR (54).

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.) 
                        There was also Lady Teacups.

           Bubbles signs to Liz.

                                 MICHAEL
                        He’s saying ‘thank you.’

                                 LIZ
                        Sign language? Oh, that’s darling!

           They watch Bubble fumble with his teacup.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Maybe you can teach him how to 
                        drink tea properly, Liz.

           Elizabeth smirks.
                                 LIZ
                        Heaven knows I’m all about 
                        propriety.

           INT. HAYVENHURST  - DANCE STUDIO - DAY

           Music BLARES as Michael runs through some of his signature 
           moves in front of a wall of mirrors. He sweats. Working hard. 

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        My education also included physical 
                        training, which The King approached 
                        with the utmost rigor and 
                        discipline.

           As Michael spins, Bubbles mimics him, twirling on all fours. 
           Michael emits one of his famous high-pitched YELPS... 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Shamone!

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        As he loosed his war cry, I 
                        understood these sessions were not 
                        simply a matter of exercise. He was 
                        building strength and stamina. 

           Bubbles attempts the war cry, but manages only an awkward 
           CHIRP-GRUNT.

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        The King was preparing for battle. 

           INT. HAYVENHURST MANSION - MICHAEL’S BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Michael looks at the man in the mirror, unhappily inspecting 
           his face a moment before picking up a bottle of Porcelana 
           skin bleaching cream. 

           Bubbles sits on the stool next to him, watching as Michael 
           rubs the cream into his face. 

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        Before venturing forth to the 
                        battlefield, he would don war paint 
                        that turned his face a spectral, 
                        phantasmic shade meant to strike 
                        fear into the heart of his enemies. 
           LATER

           Michael faces the mirror again. A bandage covers his nose. 

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        Often he would return from these 
                        battles with bandages covering 
                        wounds received in combat.  

           Michael peels the bandage away to reveal a noticeably 
           narrowed nose.

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        But he had remarkable powers of 
                        self-healing, each time recovering 
                        from such injuries without so much 
                        as a scar. 

           LATER

           Michael picks up a tube of lipstick and writes a number 
           across the mirror:

                                      “100,000,000”

           Michael stands back to gaze at it. 

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        Each morning he would contemplate 
                        this royal edict scrawled upon the 
                        reflecting glass. I knew not its 
                        meaning, but it’s inscription 
                        seemed to mark the end of that 
                        cloistered phase of our lives 
                        together, and my introduction into 
                        the greater world beyond the castle 
                        walls.

           INT. FRANK DILEO’S OFFICE - DAY

           Michael’s manager, FRANK DILEO (40) -- undertall and 
           overweight, a cigar chomping, gregarious fast-talker -- sits 
           behind his desk in a swanky Beverly Hills office. 

           Covering the walls are framed pictures of him with Luther 
           Vandross, Gloria Estafan, Meatloaf and Ozzy Ozbourne -- and 
           of course, his biggest client of all, Michael Jackson. 

           Opposite him sit Bubbles and Michael. Bubbles plays with a 
           Rubik’s Snake toy. 
                                 FRANK
                        One hundred million?

                                 MICHAEL
                        It’s gotta be big, bigger than 
                        “Thriller.”

           Frank considers.

                                 FRANK
                        Well, you know I’ve always admired 
                        your ambition. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        But?

                                 FRANK
                        “Thriller” is the best selling 
                        album in the history of history! 
                        You captured lightning in a bottle 
                        and you know what they say about 
                        lightning striking the same bottle 
                        twice.   
                             (off his look)
                        Don’t get me wrong. If anyone could 
                        do it, it would be you. But...

           INT. JOHN BRANCA’S OFFICE - DAY

           Rock-n-roll lawyer JOHN BRANCA (35) sits behind his desk. 
           Beach Boys tour posters, photos of John with Neil Diamond, 
           Bob Dylan and Thriller-era Michael decorate his office.

           Bubbles concentrates on his Rubik’s Snake. Twisting, turning.

                                 JOHN
                        ...but why compete with yourself at 
                        this point? Why not do an album of 
                        cover songs? Pay tribute to the 
                        legends and influences who--

           Michael’s look stops him cold.

                        Unless you have new material you’re 
                        excited about.

                        I’ve got sixty songs. And I want to 
                        sing duets on this one.

                        Wait, sixty songs? With lyrics and--

                        Full multi-tracked demos.

           A beat as this sinks in. Frank clearly impressed.

                                 MICHAEL
                        And I want to tour. It’s gotta be 
                        bigger than Victory. The biggest 
                        tour the world has ever seen.

                        And your brothers, are they going 
                        to be involved with this, or--

           Bubbles twists his Rubik’s Snake into a cat-like shape.

                                 MICHAEL
                        No. Absolutely not.

           INT. FRANK DILEO’S OFFICE - DAY

                                 FRANK
                        You ever thought of maybe doing 
                        something with Janet? She’s pretty 
                        hot right now.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I don’t need her.

                                 FRANK
                        Just thinking out loud.

           Frank lights a cigar. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Uncle Tookie...

           Frank gives him an apologetic look, grinds out the cigar.    
                                 FRANK
                        Alright. You want to make an album, 
                        let’s make an album. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Not just an album. The perfect 
                        album. 

           Bubbles makes the final twist to shape his Rubik’s Snake into 
           a rhombicuboctahedron (a ball, basically). Puzzle complete.

           INT. WESTLAKE AUDIO RECORDING STUDIO - DAY

           Michael and Bubbles enter the top-of-the-line facility. 
           QUINCY JONES (44), producer extraordinaire and coolest cat 
           around, rises from his chair at the console as they enter. 

                                 QUINCY
                        There’s my man. How you doing, 
                        Smelly?

           Michael smiles. They high five, embrace. Old friends.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Man, why you always call me smelly?

                                 QUINCY
                        Because you got that nose that 
                        knows when a tune has the smelly 
                        jelly gonna make it a hit.
                             (on Bubbles)
                        Who is your friend?

                                 MICHAEL
                        This is Bubbles.

                                 QUINCY
                        How you doing, Bubs?

           Bubbles turns away, shy.

                                 MICHAEL
                             (to Bubbles)
                        This is Quincy, Bubbles. Shake his 
                        hand. He won’t bite you.

           Bubbles reluctantly reaches out a hand. Quincy gently shakes 
           it and smiles.

                                 QUINCY
                        I already like him better than that 
                        python you used to show up with. 
                        So...you ready to get funky? 
           Michael covers Bubbles’ ears.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Quincy! He’s just a little kid.

                                 QUINCY
                        Michael, I told you before, ‘funky’ 
                        is not a dirty word.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Yeah, but Bubbles doesn’t know 
                        that!

           Quincy just shakes his head and laughs.

           STUDIO MONTAGE

           -- Michael pins a note card reading “DIRTY DIANA” to a large, 
           empty corkboard. Then he pins another. And another. 

           -- Quincy and Michael stand in front of the corkboard, now 
           covered with sixty note cards, each representing a new song.

           -- Drummer OLLIE BROWN adjusts his ride cymbal.

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        In the days that followed, The King 
                        summoned forth a legion of 
                        courtiers...

           -- Bassist NATHAN EAST plugs into an amp. 
           -- GREG PHILLINGANES enters carrying a keyboard.
           -- DAVID WILLIAMS takes a guitar from its case.

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        ...who brought with them a great 
                        variety of implements, the purpose 
                        of which I could not immediately 
                        discern. 

           -- JERRY HEY pops a mouthpiece onto his trumpet. 
           -- Michael, alone in the vocal booth, taps a mic, testing it. 

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        But soon The King’s designs were 
                        made clear. 

           -- Engineer BRUCE SWEDIEN flips a power switch on the 
           console, bringing it to life.
           -- The drummer lays down a HEAVY BEAT. Bubbles startles at 
           the sound.
           -- Michael closes his eyes. Nods along. 
                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        I had, of course, been exposed to 
                        music before The King plucked me 
                        from obscurity. 

           -- The rhythm guitarist adds a chicken scratch.
           -- The bassist adds a FUNKY BASS LINE. 
           -- The keyboardist joins in. 
           -- Michael starts to move more loosely. Feeling the groove.

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        But no being I’ve ever encountered, 
                        before or since, had such an 
                        intimate relationship to this 
                        layered, mesmeric panoply of sound.

           -- The trumpet BLASTS a four note fill.
           -- Michael SPINS. Kicks. HOWLS into the mic. 

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        These subjects were here assembled 
                        to conjur magic from The King, to 
                        summon forth some new expression of 
                        movement and sound that would lead 
                        his people to even greater glory.

           -- Michael shuffles sideways...and BUMPS up against the wall 
           of the vocal booth.

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        Even if it meant putting himself in 
                        a cage.

           -- Michael frowns. Removes his headphones. Frustrated.
           -- Quincy motions to the musicians to stop playing.

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        Being under the weight of such a 
                        burden, The King was no easy man to 
                        please. 

           -- Quincy, Michael and Bruce sit huddled around the mixing 
           console, engaged in heated discussion. 
           -- Michael removes a card marked “CRACK KILLS” from the 
           corkboard. Tears it in half.
           -- He does the same with “BE ME 4 A DAY”
           -- And again with “GROOVE OF MIDNIGHT”

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        When The King tired of his 
                        courtiers, new ones were summoned 
                        forth.  
           -- PAULINHO DA COSTA sets up Samba drums.
           -- Guitarist STEVE STEVENS tunes his instrument.
           -- JOHN BARNES runs through scales on a synthesizer.
           -- Female BACK UP SINGERS harmonize around a mic.

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        And when his cage proved an 
                        impediment, a larger one was 
                        hastily commissioned.

           -- Michael slides across the parquet floor of the newly 
           expanded vocal room - no longer a booth, but a mini-dance 
           studio with multi-directional mics.  

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        If I was to win The King’s favor, 
                        and one day assume his crown, I 
                        would need to begin my musical 
                        training in earnest. 

           -- Bubbles picks up a tambourine. He SLAPS it and SHAKES it 
           arthymically to the delight of the Back Up Singers.

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        Alas, though my early efforts met 
                        with some enthusiasm...

           -- Bubbles reaches for a knob on the mixing console and sound 
           engineer Bruce swats his hand away.

           -- Bubbles PLUCKS the string of a guitar. Steve Stevens pulls 
           the instrument out of his reach.

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        ...my curiosity was largely 
                        unwelcome by the courtiers.

           -- Bubbles KNOCKS over the samba drums. As they CLATTER to 
           the floor Michael laughs. Quincy looks annoyed.

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        I began to fear I had no natural 
                        aptitude for these implements. That 
                        any musicality I possessed would 
                        have to be expressed through my 
                        voice alone. 

           -- Bubbles HOOTS in the vocal isolation booth. Bruce winces, 
           cuts his mic.

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        And yet that, too, was found 
                        wanting.

                        But The King was not one to leave 
                        possibilities for my betterment 
                        unexplored.

           INT. ARNOLD KLEIN’S OFFICE - DAY

           Bubbles and Michael on a couch in the office of DR. ARNOLD 
           KLEIN (40), dermatologist to the stars. An original Andy 
           Warhol painting hangs on the wall.

                                 DR. KLEIN
                        Great to see you, Michael. You’re 
                        looking fantastic. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Hello, Dr. Klein.

                                 DR. KLEIN
                        Arnie. Call me Arnie. Let me have a 
                        look at you.

           He moves in very close. Takes Michael’s face in his hands, 
           scrutinizes Michael’s skin. It’s kinda creepy.

                                 DR. KLEIN (CONT’D)
                        Amazing. You are my most beautiful 
                        work of art, you know that? My 
                        Michelangelo. 

           He releases Michael’s face.

                                 DR. KLEIN (CONT’D)
                        So what can I do for you? You need 
                        some more skin lightener? Some 
                        Valium?

                                 MICHAEL
                        I wanted to ask about Bubbles.

           Dr. Klein looks at Bubbles for the first time. 

                                 DR. KLEIN
                        Hmm. I suppose he could use some 
                        collagen around the eyes.

                                 MICHAEL
                        No, nothing like that. I want him 
                        to be able to speak. So he can 
                        share his thoughts and his 
                        feelings. I’ve read a lot about 
                        primates. They’re very smart.

                        They just don’t have the same kind 
                        of vocal cords we do and that’s why 
                        they can’t talk or sing. But what 
                        if Bubbles had human vocal cords 
                        put in him? Can they do that? 

           Dr. Klein narrows his eyes, considers.

                                 DR. KLEIN
                        An interesting question. But I’m a 
                        dermatologist. That’s a little 
                        outside my area of expertise.

           INT. STEVEN HOEFFLIN’S CLINIC - OPERATING ROOM - DAY

           DR. STEVEN HOEFFLIN (41) wears full surgical scrubs. A 
           bejeweled Beverly Hills HOUSEWIFE lies topless and 
           unconscious on an operating table behind him. 

           Michael stands across the room, holding Bubbles. Both wear 
           surgical masks.

                                 DR. HOEFFLIN
                        I’m a cosmetic surgeon, Michael. 
                        You should see a veterinarian or 
                        primatologist for this.

                                 MICHAEL
                        But do you think it’s possible?

                                 DR. KLEIN
                        In considered medical opinion... 
                        anything is possible, baby. 

           Dr. Klein winks. Michael smiles. Just the answer he was 
           hoping for. 

           INT. UC DAVIS SCHOOL OF VETERINARY MEDICINE - OFFICE - DAY

           DR. ANGELA OWENS (30s) sits behind a desk, her walls lined 
           with diplomas and animal pictures. She can barely contain her 
           horror at what Michael is proposing.

                                 DR. OWENS
                        Absolutely not. No. That’s 
                        just...no. No.

           Michael is crestfallen.

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        And so it was my musical career 
                        concluded before it commenced. 
           INT. HAYVENHURST - VIDEO ARCADE - NIGHT

           Child star EMMANUEL LEWIS (16, very small for his age) plays 
           Donkey Kong while Michael looks on. Bubbles watches from 
           across the room, clearly unhappy. 

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        My failure was made more stingingly 
                        acute by the increasing presence of 
                        a variety of pint-sized interlopers 
                        who began appearing inside the 
                        castle walls. 

           EXT. HAYVENHURST - FRONT YARD - DAY

           Costumed cowboy MACUALAY CULKIN (8), chases a Native American 
           headdress wearing Michael around a tree, firing a toy six 
           shooter at him. 

           Bubbles sits in the tree, looking down with disdain.

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        They were an unmannered lot, 
                        physically weak and given to 
                        clamorous entertainments. I did 
                        not, in those halcyon days, 
                        comprehend the threat they 
                        represented to the kingdom. 

           INT. HAYVENHURST MANSION - DANCE STUDIO - DAY

           COREY FELDMAN (15) -- dressed like a little mini-Michael -- 
           busts some lame breakdancing moves as music booms through the 
           studio. 

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        I knew only that they had usurped 
                        The King’s attention. I was 
                        determined to find some way to win 
                        it back. 

           Bubbles peeks in the doorway. Spying.

                                 COREY
                        Hey, Michael -- do that thing you 
                        did at the Motown show, man. The 
                        backward floating move. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        The moonwalk? You don’t want to see 
                        that.
                                 COREY
                        Come on, man. Do it!

           Michael shrugs and then...unleashes a perfect moonwalk. 
           Bubbles’ eyes widen. He’s mesmerized. 

                                 COREY (CONT’D)
                        That’s awesome!

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        And so it was.

           Corey attempts a moonwalk. It’s terrible. Michael laughs.

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        And now I knew the thing wherewith 
                        to earn the favor of The King.

           INT. HAYVENHURST - MICHAEL’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Michael sleeps on the floor next to the fireplace. He’s a 
           loud snorer.

           Bubbles lays in his crib, under a blanket. He takes off the 
           blanket. Sits up. Looks at Michael sleeping...

           ...then climbs out of his crib and makes his way quietly 
           across the room.

           INT. HAYVENHURST - DANCE STUDIO - NIGHT

           Bubbles knuckle-walks into the empty studio. Crosses and 
           stops in front of the mirror. He stands on two legs. Looks at 
           his reflection for a moment and then turns sideways.

           With great concentration, he takes a step back. And another. 
           And...falls on his butt. 

           Bubbles gets up. Readies himself for a second attempt. But 
           then he hears WHISPERING coming from the hallway.

           INT. HAYVENHURST - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Bubbles pokes his head out to investigate, where he sees...

           ...Joe embracing the maid, Linda. Pawing her. She tries to 
           wrestle free of his embrace.

                                 JOE
                        Come on, baby.
                                 LINDA
                        I’m working right now.

                                 JOE
                        You know this won’t take but a 
                        minute. Katherine is out with the 
                        Witness elders, so you don’t need 
                        to worry none about her. 

                                 LINDA
                        Joe...AAAHHHH!!!

           She screams as she spots Bubbles. The noise freaks Bubbles 
           out. He starts YELLING too.

           Joe releases Linda and charges towards Bubbles.

                                 JOE
                        You damn monkey!

           But Bubbles is too fast. He propels himself off a wall, grabs 
           a 1980s tracklighting unit overhead and SWINGS jungle gym 
           style from one light to the next right over the head of Joe.

           Bubbles then drops to the floor and races away as Joe fumes.

           INT. HAYVENHURST - JOE’S OFFICE - DAY

           Animal trainer Bob Dunn (the same guy we saw teaching ASL to 
           Michael and Bubbles) sits in Joe’s office. Pictures of Joe 
           with the likes of Don King, Berry Gordy, Muhammad Ali are on 
           display. 

                                 JOE
                        Thanks for coming. Michael didn’t 
                        see you, did he? 

                                 BOB
                        No, I didn’t run into him.

                                 JOE
                        Good. Listen, this chimpanzee of 
                        his? Bubbles. We need to do 
                        something about him.

                                 BOB
                        Do something?

                                 JOE
                        I can’t have a chimp running all 
                        around here. The other animals are 
                        bad enough, but at least they’re 
                        outside. Or in cages.

           Bubbles sits on the roof, listening to their conversation 
           through an open window.

                        Have you brought this up with 
                        Michael?

                                 JOE (O.S.)
                        Michael ain’t listened to me since 
                        he was nineteen years old. Anything 
                        I say, he’ll go and do the 
                        opposite. But you he trusts.

                                 BOB
                        I don’t know. He and Bubbles are 
                        pretty close. 

                                 JOE
                        You say that like it’s a good 
                        thing. 

                                 BOB
                        What I mean is, chimps are social 
                        animals. They develop very real, 
                        very complex relationships with the 
                        people around them. Just ripping 
                        him away from Michael could be 
                        psychologically damaging.  

                                 JOE
                        Damaging, huh? Let me ask you this - 
                        how long do these things live?

                                 BOB 
                        Up to sixty years.

                        I’m a 57-year-old man. So you’re 
                        telling me, that for the rest of my

                        I’m just saying be patient. Bubbles 
                        is growing. Getting bigger, 
                        stronger. More independent. It 
                        won’t be long until he is too 
                        powerful to handle.

           Bubbles swells with pride. Liking the sound of this. Until...

                                 BOB (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        There is no scenario where he 
                        doesn’t end up in a cage.

           These words hit Bubbles HARD.

                        That’s just the reality. By the 
                        time they’re seven or eight years 
                        old, chimps are unmanageable. And 
                        Michael will understand that when 
                        the time comes. Believe me, Bubbles 
                        will make him understand that.

           Michael wears a wide brimmed hat, big mirrored shades, a 
           surgical mask and a grey wig. His ‘old man disguise’ seems 
           crafted to both repel and invite attention.

           He holds Bubbles’ hand as they stroll through racks of high-
           fashion kids wear.
                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        But as I ventured further into the 
                        kingdom at large, my self-composure 
                        would be challenged in new ways.

           Manager Frank Dileo tags along. Michael picks up a pair of 
           overalls off the rack, holds them up.

                                 MICHAEL
                        You think these would look good?

           Frank looks across the room, sees the STORE MANAGER talking 
           quietly into the phone and giving the group pointed glances.  

                                 FRANK
                        I have no opinion, Michael.

                                 MICHAEL
                        You’re no fun. Bubbles, do you like 
                        this one?

           Bubbles nods. Michael takes three identical pairs off the 
           rack, hands them to a trailing star-struck SALES ASSOCIATE.

           Franks again eyes the Store Manager suspiciously. The Manager 
           gives him a weak smile as he hangs up the phone.

                                 FRANK
                        So I spoke to Barbra’s people this 
                        morning. She doesn’t want to do it.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Why?

                                 FRANK
                        She thinks it would look weird 
                        doing a love song with you. Because 
                        the age difference.

           Michael is a little hurt.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Fine. We’ll get Liza.

                                 FRANK
                        Liza is shooting a movie. Sequel to 
                        that alcoholic midget thing.

                                 MICHAEL
                        What about Whitney?

                                 FRANK
                        Whitney would love to do it. She’s 
                        crazy about the idea. Her people? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 FRANK (CONT'D)
                        Not so much. They think she’s 
                        overexposed. But I’ve got an idea. 
                        It may seem a little nutty at 
                        first, but--

           Billy Bray ducks his head in the store.

                                 BILLY 
                        We need to go. There’s a situation 
                        developing.

           Behind him, we see several ONLOOKERS peeking over his 
           shoulder, trying to get a glimpse of Michael. 

           Michael sighs. Turns to the Sales Associate.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Can you have these wrapped up and 
                        sent to my house?

                                 SALES ASSOCIATE
                        Of course, Mr. Jackson.

           Michael hands him a wad of cash.

                                 SALES ASSOCIATE (CONT’D)
                        Um, I’ll need an address. To send 
                        your purchases to?

           Michael gives him a blank look. He has no idea what his 
           address is. 

                                 FRANK
                         4641 Hayvenhurst Avenue. Encino.

           A couple TEENAGE KIDS press their faces up against the store 
           window. They point and grin. Bubbles is unnerved.

           As they make their way toward the exit, Frank calls out to 
           the Store Manager.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        You’re an idiot. He would’ve spent 
                        five times as much in here as 
                        whoever you tipped off is paying.

           Michael scoops up Bubbles, pushes the door opened.  
           EXT. CHILDREN’S CLOTHING STORE - CONTINUOUS

           Pademonium! A crowd has gathered, blocking the sidewalk. 
           Police are popping out of cars, trying to figure out what’s 
           happening. There’s a WHIR of SHUTTERS as the paparazzi snap 
           photos.

                                 TEENAGE GIRL
                        Oh my god! There he is!

           Another girl SCREAMS. Everyone in the crowd surges forward. 
           Michael’s BODYGUARDS take up positions and do their best to 
           wrestle Michael, Frank and Bubbles through the crowd.

           Bubbles clings to Michael, terrified. 

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        I feared then that I wouldn’t 
                        survive to see the inside of any 
                        prophesized cage but would instead 
                        be torn asunder by the incensed 
                        mob. But The King was unwavering, 
                        steadfast in his courage.

           Michael smiles and waves.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I love you. I love you all.

           The group makes it to the curb and ducks inside the awaiting 
           limo. People YELL and press their faces up against the 
           windows. Bubbles shows his teeth, afraid, as the limo slowly 
           pull away from the chaos. 

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        I had still much to learn about the 
                        art of valor.

           When it’s finally quiet...

                                 MICHAEL
                             (to Frank)
                        So what’s this idea of yours?

           INT. WESTLAKE RECORDING STUDIO - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Michael, Bubbles, Frank and Quincy sit on one side of a 
           conference table. Silent. Waiting.  

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        Even amidst relative quietude, 
                        danger was ever present. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 BUBBLES (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        For during my studies with The 
                        King, we read much about the 
                        histories of ancient civilizations. 
                        Tales rife with courtly 
                        machinations, royalty in exile, 
                        double-dealings and betrayals.  

           Frank checks his watch. Shrugs.

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        So naturally when I heard the name 
                        of the man who had been summoned 
                        forth, I felt some trepidation.    

           The door swings OPENED. Two gorgeous, scantily-clad AMAZONIAN 
           WOMEN (20s) enter followed by a diminutive fellow wearing a 
           flowing coat of regal purple. He is recognized the world over 
           as PRINCE (29). 

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        For I was precocious in the 
                        knowledge that one’s place in the 
                        world is never truly secure...  

           As he steps into the room, the Amazons remove his coat. One 
           pulls out a chair for him. He sits. They remain standing.  

           Prince and the King of Pop eye each other coolly. Two young 
           lions sizing each other up.

                                 PRINCE
                        Michael.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Prince.

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        ...and that there will always be 
                        aspirants to the throne.

                                 FRANK
                        Thanks for coming. This is really 
                        fantastic. Do you or the ladies 
                        need anything? Water? Champagne? 
                        Pepsi?

           Prince shakes his head.

                                 PRINCE
                        So what’s this idea of yours?

           Frank gives Quincy a nervous glance. Quincy nods 
           encouragement. 
                                 FRANK
                        A duet. You and Michael. You’re two 
                        young toughs, beefing over turf. 
                        And in the song - and the video, 
                        this is gonna be the first single 
                        and we’re thinking we can get 
                        Coppola to direct - the two of yous 
                        are trading barbs. Cutting heads. 
                        Battling it out on the streets 
                        through song and dance to see who 
                        is the baddest.  

                                 MICHAEL
                        But good bad. Not bad bad.

                                 PRINCE
                        Right. Got it.

                                 FRANK
                        Now here’s the genius part, if I 
                        may toot my own flag -- months 
                        before the song comes out, we leak 
                        to the tabloids that you and 
                        Michael are bitter rivals. That the 
                        two of yous can’t stand each other. 
                        I’ll say something mean to Rolling 
                        Stone about you, your camp says 
                        something terrible to People about 
                        Michael. 

                                 PRINCE
                        You want me to bad mouth your 
                        client?

                                 FRANK
                        Nothing about musicianship or 
                        dancing ability. Those will be off 
                        limits for both sides. But like, I 
                        dunno, what’s with the hyperbolic 
                        chamber he sleeps in -- 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Uncle Tookie!

           Frank holds up a hand - “hear me out.”

                                 FRANK
                        -- or what kind of nut would want 
                        to buy the Elephant Man, or why 
                        does he always hang around with 
                        some hairy chimpanzee when he could 
                        surround himself with beautiful 
                        women like you do, or--      
           Quincy clears his throat. Gives Frank a look.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Well, you get the idea. And then, 
                        once we get the press all in a 
                        lather? Bam! We drop the video. The 
                        two biggest superstars on the 
                        planet going head-to-head to see 
                        who...is...the baddest! 

           Prince considers a moment.

                                 PRINCE
                        But Michael wins, right?

           Frank defers to Quincy.

                                 QUINCY
                        Well, we haven’t broken it down 
                        line by line as far as who sings 
                        what. Maybe we’ll record two 
                        versions and--

                                 PRINCE
                        It’s his record, so he wins.

           Quincy and Frank reluctantly cede his point - Michael wins. 
           Prince lets them dangle for a moment before...

                                 PRINCE (CONT’D)
                        Let’s hear the demo.

           A relieved Quincy rises, crosses to a boombox set up in the 
           corner. He puts in a cassette tape labelled ‘BAD’, hits PLAY.

           The song’s intro BOOMS through the room. Michael (on tape) 
           starts singing the first verse. He gets three lines in 
           before...

           ...Prince raises a finger in the air. Quincy stops the tape.

                                 PRINCE (CONT’D)
                        What’s that first lyric?

           Quincy and Frank trade glances again.

                                 FRANK
                        ‘Your butt is mine.’

                                 PRINCE
                        Your butt is mine.

           Frank nods. An awkward silence ensues.
                                 PRINCE (CONT’D)
                        Nobody is going to sing that line 
                        to me. And I’m sure as hell not 
                        going to sing it to Michael 
                        Jackson. I think we’re done here.

           Prince snaps his fingers. The two Amazons rise, pull out his 
           chair, help him into his coat. Nobody says anything as Prince 
           and the ladies make their way toward the door. 

           Just before exiting, Prince stops. Turns around.

                                 PRINCE (CONT’D)
                        Besides, you don’t need me. That 
                        song is a hit already.
                             (nodding curtly)
                        Michael.

                                 MICHAEL
                             (returning the nod)
                        Prince.

           INT. WESTLAKE RECORDING STUDIO - DAY

           Only ten note cards remain on the corkboard.

           Bruce, Michael and Quincy sit huddled over the mixing 
           console, each wearing headphones. All are exhausted -- 
           they’ve been up for days. Bubbles practices his moonwalk in 
           the corner, unnoticed.  

           The men remove their headphones in unison.

                                 QUINCY
                        What do you think, Smelly? We got 
                        an album here?

           Michael thinks about it. Hard. Reluctant to let go.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I guess so.

           Quincy and Bruce are hugely relieved. Finally.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        You guys can go. But I want to 
                        listen to it one more time on the 
                        speakers.

                                 QUINCY
                        You got it.

           Bruce hits a button on the console and the tape REWINDS. 
           Quincy rises. Puts on his coat. Bruce stands. Follows Quincy 
           toward the door. Quincy turns off the lights as they go, 
           leaving the studio dimmed.

           Michael slumps into the couch. Bubbles climbs into his lap.

           The tapes STOPS rewinding. Playback begins and the room is 
           filled with a few seconds of TAPE HISS.

           Michael points at Bubbles. Bubbles points back. They bring 
           their fingers together.

                                 MICHAEL
                        One hundred million, here we come.

           EXT. HAYVENHURST - BACK YARD - DAY

           Little people dressed as the SEVEN DWARVES stand on a 
           portable stage set up in the backyard. A woman in a SNOW 
           WHITE costume lays in bed.

                                 GRUMPY
                        Angel, ha! She’s a female! And all 
                        females is poison! They’re full of 
                        wicked wiles!

                                 BASHFUL
                        What are wicked wiles?

                                 GRUMPY
                        I don’t know, but I’m against them!

           The handful of seated children watching the show LAUGH. 
           Michael, seated with them, laughs hardest of all.  

           PULL BACK TO REVEAL

           Katherine and Joe watching him. A mixture of love and concern 
           on Katherine’s face. 

                                 KATHERINE
                        That boy is a mystery to me.

           Joe grunts in unhappy agreement. Looks on as Bubbles walks by 
           with Bob Dunn.

           LATER

           The show is over. Michael stands near the empty stage 
           uncomfortably chatting with an ELDER (70s) from the Jehovah’s 
           Witnesses.
                                 ELDER
                        I wish you all the best with the 
                        new recording, Michael. May Jehovah 
                        bless and keep you.  

                                 MICHAEL
                        Thank you. That means a lot.

                                 ELDER
                        There won’t be any supernatural 
                        nonsense in the videos this time, 
                        will there?

           Behind him, a crowd gathers near the stage. There’s a growing 
           hubbub. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        No, sir. Nothing like that.

                                 ELDER
                        Well, that’s a comfort. Say, I’d 
                        like to talk about setting up an 
                        interview for The Watchtower.

           La Toya grabs Michael by the arm.

                                 LA TOYA
                        Michael, you’ve got to see this!

           See drags him over in front of the stage, where he takes up a 
           place next to manager Frank and lawyer John. And now we see 
           what all the fuss was over.  

           BUBBLES

           ...is onstage, “dancing.” The crowd, adults and kids alike, 
           are eating it up. And then, just as he’s whipped them into a 
           frenzy, he unleashes his... 

           ...moonwalk! It’s far from perfect, but the intention is 
           clear and the crowd LOVES it.

           Michael laughs, impressed. A proud parent. 

                                 JOHN
                        You should make him part of the 
                        act.

                                 FRANK
                             (to Michael)
                        Ideas like that are why he’s your 
                        lawyer and I’m your manager.
                                 JOHN
                        I don’t mean bring him onstage or 
                        anything. But put him in a video, 
                        or maybe on one of those animal 
                        shows. Promote the brand and you 
                        can claim him as an expense. Write 
                        off his care and feeding.

           Wheels turn in Michael’s head.

           ARCHIVE FOOTAGE - “LIVE! DICK CLARK PRESENTS”

           TV host DICK CLARK in front of a studio audience, mic in 
           hand. 

                                 DICK CLARK (V.O.)
                             (on TV)
                        Now, there’s a celebrity siting in 
                        our audience...

           There’s a HOOTING sound. Camera PULLS BACK to REVEAL...

           Bubbles in the front row, next to Dick. The audience laughs.

                                 DICK CLARK (V.O.)
                        As I was saying, there’s a 
                        celebrity in our audience here 
                        that’s been getting the full 
                        superstar treatment. He goes in the 
                        side entrances of hotels, hides out 
                        from teenage girls so they don’t 
                        smother him with kisses. He is 
                        Michael Jackson’s favorite 
                        companion, and he is bound to be 
                        the object of a lot of affection.  
                             (to Bubbles)
                        Did you bring the letter from your 
                        boss?

           Bubbles hands Dick a letter. Dick describes it.

                                 DICK CLARK (V.O.)
                        It comes on M.J.J. Productions 
                        stationary with a moonwalker at the 
                        top and says, ‘Dear Dick, I’m 
                        giving Bubbles the night off from 
                        his busy schedule so he can come 
                        and play on your show.’ There it 
                        is. And believe it or not, it’s 
                        signed ‘Micheal Jackson!’ 

           Dick holds up the letter for the cameras. The audience CLAPS 
           and CHEERS.
           INT. HAYVENHURST - MICHAEL’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Michael and Bubbles sit on the bed, watching the Dick Clark 
           broadcast on TV. Bubbles is munching M&M’s from a bag.

           ON TV

                                 DICK CLARK (V.O.)
                             (on TV)
                        Now, I met you about two years ago, 
                        Bubbles. And, you’ve had a lot of 
                        publicity in the meantime. Are you 
                        still the same sweet old chimp that 
                        you always were?

           Bubbles sticks out his tongue. The audience laughs.

           BACK TO SCENE

                                 MICHAEL
                             (jokingly)
                        That’s bad, Bubbles. You should 
                        respect Mr. Clark. No more candy 
                        for you. 

           He yanks the M&M bag out of Bubbles’ hand.

                                 BUBBLES
                             (signing)
                        Give back candy.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Nope.

           Bubbles tries to grab it back, but Michael raises it aloft, 
           out of reach. Bubbles LEAPS on Michael, playfully tackling 
           him off the bed and to the floor. 

           Michael and Bubbles roll around, wrestling. Bubbles grabs a 
           fistful of Michael’s curly locks. 

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                             (laughing)
                        Ow! No pulling hair!

           La Toya bursts into the room, in tears. 

                                 LA TOYA
                        You can’t go on tour.

           They stop wrestling. Michael stands. Turns off the TV. 
           Bubbles snatches back the M&M bag, scurries away.
                                 MICHAEL
                        What’s wrong?

                                 LA TOYA
                        I can’t take it anymore! They treat 
                        me like I’m a child. Don’t leave me 
                        here, Michael. Please.

                                 MICHAEL
                        You’ll be fine. I’ll be back in a 
                        few months and then everything will 
                        change. I promise.

                                 LA TOYA
                        Change how?

           Michael gives her an enigmatic smile. 

                                 LA TOYA (CONT’D)
                             (off his look)
                        What are you up to?

                                 MICHAEL
                        It’s a secret.

           Now she’s intrigued.

                                 LA TOYA
                        Tell me.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I can’t.

                                 LA TOYA
                        Don’t you trust me?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Oh my gosh, never. You’re a 
                        Jackson! 

           She WHACKS him on the shoulder half playfully, half in anger.

                                 LA TOYA
                        When have I ever betrayed you? I’ve  
                        always kept your secrets and always 
                        will. 

           Michael thinks about it. Looks at Bubbles quietly munching 
           M&M’s, watching himself on TV. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Alright. But you can’t tell a soul. 
                        Not even Bubbles knows yet.
           As she waits anxiously to hear his secret we...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. JUMBO JET - NIGHT

           Bubbles looks out the window at the rainy tarmac as workers 
           load a staggering number of giant amplifiers in hard, wheeled 
           cases stenciled “MICHAEL JACKSON.” 

                                 BOB
                        Time to put on your seat belt, 
                        Bubbles.

           Bubbles sits, Bob fastens his belt. 

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        I was determined to be on my best 
                        behavior in the presence of the 
                        Bearded Prophet. To prove that I 
                        was the very antithesis of 
                        ungovernable, and that I no more 
                        belonged in a cage than did The 
                        King himself. 

           Other members of Michael’s 132 member strong entourage file 
           past, stuff carry-ons into the overhead bins. There’s a 
           palpable air of excitement.

           Bubbles signs something in A.S.L. to Bob.

                                 BOB
                        Michael is on a different plane. 
                        Don’t worry, you’ll see him soon. 
                        Just sit tight and relax. You’ve 
                        got a big adventure ahead.

           LATER

           The plane shakes as it accelerates down the runway. Bubbles 
           grips the hand rests tightly. He watches scenery race by out 
           the window.  

           EXT. LOS ANGELES INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - NIGHT

           The plane lifts off the ground. We see Bubbles’ face framed 
           in a window as the plane pulls out of sight. 
           INT. JUMBO JET - DAY

           Bob, Bubbles and pretty much all the other passengers are 
           asleep as the plane touches down with a JOLT. 

           Bubbles opens his eyes, disoriented. The voice of a JAPANESE 
           STEWARDESS addresses them over the P.A.

                                 JAPANESE STEWARDESS (V.O.)
                        Ladies and gentleman, we have 
                        arrived at Narita International 
                        Airport. Welcome to Japan. We wish 
                        you much success and great 
                        happiness during your stay. Domo 
                        arigato gozaimasu!

           The passengers CHEER and whoop it up. Bubbles CLAPS.

           INT. NARITA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT (TOKYO) - HALLWAY - DAY

           Bubbles holds Bob Dunn’s hand as a JAPANESE HANDLER escorts 
           them down a private hallway. As they near a door at the end 
           of the hall, they can hear people CHANTING and CHEERING on 
           the other side. The noise gets louder as they near.

                                 BOB
                             (to handler)
                        Guess they thought Michael was on 
                        this flight, huh?

                                 JAPANESE HANDLER
                        Oh no, sir... 

           He opens the door...

           INT. NARITA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - ARRIVALS - CONTINUOUS

           And the gathered crowd goes NUTS! People CHEER, flashbulbs 
           POP. The handler has to shout to be heard above the 
           cacophony.

                                 JAPANESE HANDLER
                        They are here for Bubbles. He is 
                        big time star in Japan. Very big 
                        time success!

           A TEENAGE GIRL holds aloft a hand drawn picture of a Michael  
           and Bubbles. Another waves a sign that says “Bubbles I love!”

           Bubbles surveys the crowd, awestruck. Bob is tickled pink, as 
           are other members of the entourage. He leans down and speaks 
           into Bubbles’ ear.
                                 BOB
                        Better say hello to your fans, 
                        buddy.

           Bubbles hesitates a moment, and rises to full height. He 
           pushes out his chest proudly and gives them a big wave.

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        I had arrived.

           INT. TOUR BUS - NIGHT

           Neon light flickers over Bubbles’ face as he looks out the 
           window and takes in the crowded Tokyo streets. 

           As they approach the Capitol Tokyu Hotel, Bubbles spots a 
           crowd gathered on the sidewalk in front. They chant the 
           Japanese pronunciation of Jackson’s first name as a row of 
           policemen stand guarding the hotel entrance. 

                                 CROWD
                        My-ke-ru! My-ke-ru! My-ke-ru!

           The sound RATTLES the bus windows as they near. 

           INT. CAPITOL TOKYU HOTEL - 26TH FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT

           The elevator doors WHISK open and Bob and Bubbles exit, 
           followed by an immaculately dressed CONCIERGE. Two BELLHOPS 
           trail with luggage. 

           A velvet rope manned by HOTEL SECURITY GUARDS blocks the 
           hallway. 

           The concierge nods to the security guards and both of them 
           bow deeply to Bubbles and Bob and then pull the velvet rope 
           aside.

                                 BOB
                             (under his breath)
                        Jesus...he’s taken over the whole 
                        floor.

           INT. CAPITOL TOKYU HOTEL - JACKSON SUITE - NIGHT

           Half the luxurious suite has been converted into a makeshift 
           dance studio complete with portable hardwood floors and full-
           length mirrors. Michael is running through moves as...

           ...the DOOR OPENS and Bubbles and Bob enter. Jackson stops 
           dancing and turns to face them. 
                                 MICHAEL
                        Bubbles!

           Bubbles races across the room and leaps into Michael’s 
           awaiting arms. Michael laughs, rubs Bubbles’ head.

           Frank strolls in from an adjoining room. He’s carrying a 
           giant 1980s mobile phone, his hand cupped over the mouthpiece 
           to mute the sound.

                                 FRANK
                        Hey Michael, some bigwig from Pepsi 
                        corporate is begging for extra 
                        tickets and -- 

                                 MICHAEL
                        No.

                                 FRANK
                        Figured. Also, that school for the 
                        cripples?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Handicapped, Uncle Tookie.

                                 FRANK
                        Right. How many tickets we giving 
                        them?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Two hundred.

                                 FRANK
                        Really? 
                             (off his look)
                        Okay. Fine. Oh...some rock band 
                        from New Jersey are staying at the 
                        hotel and really want to meet you. 
                        You got a few minutes?

                                 MICHAEL
                        What do you think, Bubbles? You 
                        want to meet a rock band from New 
                        Jersey?

           Bubbles shrugs. Whatever.

           LATER

           Five shaggy headed young rockers in jean jackets and leather 
           enter the room. They are the members of Bon Jovi -- JON BON 
           JOVI (25), RICHIE SAMBORA (28), DAVID BRYAN (25), TICO TORRES 
           (34) and ALEC JOHN SUCH (34).
           Frank, alone on the couch, waves them over.

                                 FRANK
                        How you doing, fellas? Come on over 
                        and have a seat. Michael will be 
                        out momentarily.

           They cross. Sit. Look around at the giant room, awed. 

                                 RICHIE SAMBORA
                        Holy shit, man, this room is three 
                        times bigger than ours.

                                 JON BON JOVI
                        And there’s five of us in there.

                                 TICO TORRES
                        Not counting, you know, maybe some 
                        guests of the female persuasion 
                        later.

           The boys all have a laugh. Frank chuckles amiably. Jon Bon 
           Jovi lights up a cigarette.

                                 FRANK
                        Uh, better put that out. Michael is 
                        very protective of his voice.

                                 JON BON JOVI
                        Right. Sorry.

           He puts out the cigarette. Frank notices something across the 
           room. Rises hastily...

                                 FRANK
                        Gentleman, I present to you the 
                        King of Pop. Michael, this is Bon 
                        Jon and the Jovies.

           The guys turn to see...Bubbles stroll into the room clad in a 
           miniature Jackson-style military jacket with gold accents and 
           a sequinned glove. 

           The members of Bon Jovi look at Bubbles. Look at each other. 
           Look at Frank - who is totally deadpan. Just when its getting 
           uncomfortable...  

           ...Michael pops up from behind the couch with a half-crazed 
           smile.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Ha! You guys should see the looks 
                        on your faces! 
           The guys all laugh nervously. But Michael is just busting up. 
           Bubbles is confused.

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        Should I have been alarmed that the 
                        notion of myself as sovereign 
                        provoked such laughter from The 
                        King? Or that seeing me festooned 
                        in the regal accoutrements induced 
                        only befuddled discomfiture from 
                        these hirsute gentlemen of New 
                        Jersey?

           Michael comes around the couch, extends his hand. Jon Bon 
           Jovi rises, shakes it.

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        Perhaps.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I’m Michael. Nice to meet you.

                                 JON BON JOVI
                        Oh man, it is such an honor. I’m 
                        Jon. This is Richie, David, Tico... 
                        and Alec.

           The men rise in turn and shake Michael’s hand as they are 
           introduced.

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        But I took an instant liking to 
                        these fellows.

           Now Bubbles steps forward and offers his hand. Amused, each 
           member of Bon Jovi shakes hands with him.

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        Perhaps because they reminded me of 
                        orangutans.

           LATER

           Everyone is seated on the couch. The members of Bon Jovi are 
           drinking beer. Michael sips lemon tea.

                                 MICHAEL
                        So are you all brothers? 

                                 JON BON JOVI
                        No, no. We just named the band Bon 
                        Jovi because it sounds cool.
                                 MICHAEL
                        That’s good. I was in a band with 
                        my brothers for awhile. I wouldn’t 
                        recommend it.

           The guys all laugh. 

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        So where are you playing?

                                 JON BON JOVI
                        Oh, it’s crazy, man. We’re playing 
                        at Budokan! There’s gonna be like 
                        20,000 people there.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Wow. That’s great!

                                 JON
                        Where are you playing?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Um...some stadium.

                                 JON
                        Ticket sales going well, or..?

           Michael doesn’t want to brag. So...

                                 FRANK
                        We’ve sold out all three nights. 
                        One hundred thirty five thousand 
                        tickets. Actually, the whole tour 
                        is sold out. Fourteen dates.

                                 RICHIE SAMBORA
                        All stadium shows?

           Frank nods, nonchalant. Bon Jovi dudes exchange looks -- this 
           Michael Jackson cat is in a whole different league.

                                 JON BON JOVI
                        Well, hey man, we’re off tonight 
                        and we’re gonna be hanging if you 
                        want to come by. We’re two floors 
                        down. Nothing serious. You know, a 
                        few beers. Should be mellow.

           Michael sips his tea. Offers a shy smile.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Yeah. Thanks. That sounds fun.
           INT. CAPITOL TOKYU HOTEL - 24TH FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Bubbles POV as he moves down the hallway. Muted sounds of 
           ROCK MUSIC grow louder with each step he takes.

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        As it was, The King remained in his 
                        quarters. The Bearded Prophet and I 
                        were sent as his emissaries.

           They stop in front of Room 2436. Faint sounds of MUSIC from 
           the other side of the door. Light LAUGHTER. Bubbles looks up 
           at Bob. Hesitant.

                                 BOB
                        Just a quick beer for this jetlag 
                        and then we’ll go, okay? 

           Bubbles nods. Steps forward. Raps FEEBLY against the door. 

           INT. CAPITOL TOKYU HOTEL - BON JOVI ROOM - LATER

           HEAVY METAL BOOMS through the smoke-filled room. We’re in the 
           middle of a full-on they-don’t-make-them-like-that-anymore-
           hotel trashing 1980s rock star party. 

                                 PARTIERS
                             (chanting)
                        Bubbles! Bubbles! Bubbles!

           We move past the drunken ROADIES and drunken GROUPIES and 
           RANDOM PARTIERS. We pass...

           BOB

           ...passed out on the couch with a half-empty bottle of sake 
           in his hand and rice cracker crumbs in his beard.      

                                 PARTIERS (CONT’D)
                             (chanting)
                        Bubbles! Bubbles! Bubbles!

           We keep moving until we find...

           BUBBLES

           ...riding atop Richie Sambora’s shoulders. A RISING SUN 
           BANDANA wrapped kamikazi-style around his head, a pitcher of 
           beer in either hand.

           Richie steers over to two BUSTY GROUPIES in white T-shirts.
                                 RICHIE SAMBORA
                        Ready, ladies?

           They nod and giggle.

                                 RICHIE SAMBORA (CONT’D)
                        Now, Bubbles!

           Bubbles dumps the pitchers and beer SPLASHES over the 
           groupies’ chests.  Bubbles HOOTS! He tosses the pitchers in 
           the air, steals a beer out of Richie’s hand and chugs it. The 
           Partiers go nuts! Bubbles is the life of the party.

           INT. CAPITOL TOKYU HOTEL - 24TH FLOOR HALLWAY - LATER

           Bubbles rides on a LUGGAGE TROLLEY as the Bon Jovi guys push 
           it down the hall bobsled-style, running as fast as they can.

           Partiers CHEER as the trolley ZOOMS toward its target - an 
           open stairwell at the end of the hall.

           Jon Bon Jovi trips and the other guys fall over him, spilling 
           drunkenly across the floor. 

           The trolley FLIES down the hall. Just as it is about to enter 
           the stairwell, Bubbles LEAPS and...

           ...grabs onto the door frame as the trolley SAILS down the 
           stairs and CRASHES. 

           Bubbles swings back and forth in the doorframe for a moment 
           and then drops to safety as the partiers CHEER and CLAP!

           LATER

           Bubbles stands alone in the empty hallway. Sounds of 
           WHISPERING and giggling down the hall. Jon Bon Jovi pokes his 
           head around the corner.

                                 JON BON JOVI
                             (stage whispering)
                        Do it, Bubbles!

           Bubbles knocks on the door to room 2421. A moment later...a 
           SALARYMAN (40s) in pajamas answers.

           He stares dumbfounded at Bubbles. Bubbles gives him a big 
           smile and then...

           ...whips out a fire extinguisher concealed behind his back 
           and SPRAYS.
           The Salaryman sputters and curses as he’s enveloped in the 
           thick fog. The partiers CRACK UP as Bubbles drops the fire 
           extinguisher and scampers off down the hall.

           INT. CAPITOL TOKYU HOTEL - SWIMMING POOL - NIGHT

           Partiers encircle the hotel swimming pool.

                                 PARTIERS
                        Bubbles! Bubbles! Bubbles!

           Bubbles stands at the edge of the pool, gathering his nerve.

                                 PARTIERS (CONT’D)
                        Bubbles! Bubbles! Bubbles!

           Then he leaps...

           Bob walks in on the scene just as Bubbles SPLASHES into the 
           water.

                                 BOB
                        Jesus, you guys! Chimps can’t swim!

           He pushes past them and DIVES into the water after Bubbles.

           UNDERWATER

           ...Bubbles can still hear the muffled sound of the partiers 
           CHANTING his name as Bob swims to his rescue. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CAPITOL TOKYU HOTEL - JACKSON SUITE - DAY

                                 MICHAEL
                        Bubbles...Bubbles...

           Bubbles is passed out on the floor. Michael -- in a bathrobe, 
           his face covered in skin bleaching cream -- gently rocks his 
           shoulder. Bubbles opens his eyes. Blinks against the harsh 
           morning light. Smacks his lips. Hungover. 

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        Wake up. We’ve got a show to do.

           EXT./INT. KORAKUEN STADIUM - DAY

           A procession of semi-trucks pulls into the parking lot 
           outside the stadium.
                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        Having survived the numerous 
                        attempts on my life made by the 
                        gentlemen of New Jersey, I was the 
                        following day summoned to the 
                        battlefield...  

           ROADIES wheel dozens of huge amplifiers out of a truck. 
           Bubbles hops aboard one, taking a ride as it goes into a...

           TUNNEL

           ...leading into the stadium proper, where the amplifier 
           procession joins more roadies carrying lighting equipment, 
           cables, scaffolding.

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        ...where I would first witness the 
                        sheer scale of The King’s crusade.

           Bubbles continues his ride into the...

           BACKSTAGE

           ...area, past racks of glittery costumes. Techs unload 
           instruments from their cases and Bubbles moves past them and 
           onto the... 

           STAGE

           ...where people are assembling scaffolding, rigging lights, 
           taping down cables.

           Bubbles hops from the amp. He scampers over and expertly 
           ascends a wall of speakers, making his way to the top in no 
           time.

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        I assumed the role of sentinel, 
                        resolute in my duty to warn of any 
                        sign of approaching enemy forces. 

           Bob strolls onstage below, looks around. Sees Bubbles atop 
           the speakers.

                                 BOB
                        Bubbles...lunchtime!

           Bob holds up a pair of apples.
                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        Alas, hunger soon overtook me.   

           Bubbles climbs down. Races to Bob. 

           INT. KORAKUEN STADIUM - BACK STAGE - NIGHT

           The audience CHANTS so loud the ground shakes.

                                 AUDIENCE
                        My-ke-ru! My-ke-ru! My-ke-ru!

           Bubbles, Michael, and fifteen PERFORMERS (MUSICIANS, BACK-UP 
           SINGERS, and DANCERS) stand huddled in a circle, their arms 
           around each other’s shoulders as Michael leads them in a pre-
           show ritual.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Thank you, dear God, for giving us 
                        this chance to put on a great show 
                        for all these wonderful people here 
                        tonight and spread your message of 
                        love.

                                 PERFORMERS
                        Amen!

           They break the circle and begin clapping. A palpable air of 
           excitement. 

           Bubbles follows as the performers jog onto the stage, is 
           about to take the stage himself when Michael stops him in the 
           wings. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        You have to wait here, Bubbles. 

           Bubbles is disappointed but puts up a stoic front. Michael 
           leans closer.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        Who’s bad?

           They bring the tips of their pointer fingers together in 
           their special ritual. Bob emerges to take Bubbles’ hand.

           Michael jogs onstage and disappears into the fog being pumped 
           by smoke machines.

           Then the stage lights reveal him and the audience ERUPTS. The 
           sound is DEAFENING. 
           HELICOPTERS circle overhead. The stadium floodlights come on 
           to reveal a vast sea of people in the audience, all of them 
           whipped up into a frenzy. It’s breathtaking and terrifying. 

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        As I looked upon their screaming 
                        faces, feverish and contorted, I 
                        feared for The King’s life. Their 
                        numbers were so vast that there 
                        could be no escape should they turn 
                        against him.

           Michael and his back up singers bust some choreographed moves 
           as a song intro BOOMS through the speaks.

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        But he held them completely in his 
                        thrall. It was then I began in some 
                        small way to comprehend just what 
                        The King meant to his subjects. And 
                        slowly, to grasp the immensity of 
                        the kingdom itself, and the weight 
                        of the crown I would one day 
                        inherit. 

           INT. OSAKA CITY HALL - DAY

           Bubbles and Michael (in sunglasses) stroll into a conference 
           room and sit at a table. A FUNCTIONARY bows and smiles. 
           Another brings a cup of tea.

           Opposite them are about fifty photographers.

                                 FUNCTIONARY
                             (to Michael)
                        Welcome to Osaka. We are very 
                        honored. Did you know Bubbles is 
                        the first animal ever allowed 
                        inside Osaka City Hall?

           Michael offers a polite smile.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Did you hear that, Bubbles? It’s a 
                        historic occasion. You better 
                        behave.

           Bubbles reaches for the tea. Puts the cups to his lips. The 
           photographs oooh and ahhh. SHUTTERS WHIR, flashbulbs STROBE.
                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        Lady Teacups had taught me well. 
                        But it was during this tea party 
                        that I began to get my first 
                        inklings of unfavorable effect 
                        those flashing devices were having 
                        upon The King’s ever fading skin.

           EXT. SYDNEY AIRPORT (AUSTRALIA) - DAY   

           Michael (in sunglasses) steps off airplane on the tarmac. 
           Flash bulbs STROBE as Michael waves.

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        He wore eye protection in their 
                        presence to prevent being blinded, 
                        but these thin shields could not 
                        entirely fortify him against their 
                        deleterious effects.

           INT. CHILDREN’S HOSPITAL (AUSTRALIA) - NIGHT

           Michael signs autographs and poses for pictures with sick 
           children in hospital beds.

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        The popping lights were clearly 
                        leeching his skin of color.

           INT. OLYMPIC PARK STADIUM (MELBOURNE) - DRESSING ROOM - NIGHT

           A MAKE-UP ARTIST works on Michael’s face in front of a 
           mirror. Bubbles focuses on his own reflection.

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        Oddly, as his skin became lighter, 
                        my own grew darker. And I was 
                        changing in other ways, too. 

           Bubbles through the backstage area and onto...

           EXT. OLYMPIC PARK STADIUM (MELBOURNE) - STAGE - CONTINUOUS

           ...the darkened stage. He leaps, does a somersault...

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        My body was growing stronger. My 
                        spirit bolder.
           ...and heads for the scaffolding. He clamors upwards, 
           graceful, agile...

           EXT. PARRAMATTA STADIUM (SYDNEY) - CONTINUOUS

           ...and reaches the top of the scaffolding. Perched at the 
           pinnacle, he looks out over the empty stadium and the night 
           sky beyond.

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        My star was in ascendance.

           Bubbles sees a storm approaching on the horizon.

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        But I could not say the same of The 
                        King’s.

           INT. RADIO CITY MUSIC HALL (NYC) - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

           Bubbles and Bob watch the 1988 Grammy Awards on a small TV in 
           a backstage dressing room. Bubbles eats popcorn. 

                                 BOB
                        Check it out, Bubbles...Michael and 
                        Quincy are about to get a Grammy.

           ON TV

           Presenters AL JARREAU (48) and RUBEN BLADES (40) stand on 
           stage at the mic.

                                 RUBÉN BLADES 
                        And the producer of the year is...

           He opens the envelope.

                                 RUBÉN BLADES (CONT’D)
                        Narada Michael Walden.

           There’s a shot of Michael in the audience. He’s upset. 

           LATER

           Presenters JODY WATLEY (29) and the three members of LaVert - 
           SEAN LAVERT (30), GERALD LAVERT (19) and MARC GORDON (21) are 
           onstage. 
                                 GERALD LAVERT
                        And the winner for best R&B Male 
                        Vocal Performance is...”Just to See

           INT. LIMO - MOVING - NIGHT

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        So much for the Bearded Prophet’s 
                        powers of divination.

           Bubbles, Michael, Quincy and Frank ride in the swanky limo 
           making its way through NYC. A chilled bottle of champagne 
           sits untouched in half-melted ice. No one feels like 
           celebrating.

           Finally, Frank breaks the silence.

                                 FRANK
                        It’s the Grammys, Michael. Nobody 
                        cares about the Grammys. 

           Michael says nothing.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        The only reason Smokey Robinson won 
                        is because everyone thought he was 
                        gonna die from all the crack he was 
                        smoking two years ago. Now he gets 
                        clean and makes a record and people 
                        are like, ‘Good for you, pal. Way 
                        to not die! Here’s a Grammy.’
           INT. HELMSLEY HOTEL (NYC) - ELEVATOR - NIGHT

           As the elevator ascends...

                                 FRANK
                        U2? Okay, they’ve got a sound. I’ll 
                        give them that. But why did they 
                        win? Because people feel bad about 
                        what’s happening in Ireland, that’s 
                        why. IRA bombs and whatnot. ‘Oh, 
                        you’re a band from Ireland? We’re 
                        sorry. Here’s a Grammy. Please 
                        don’t blow us up.’ 

           Quincy smirks. Michael remains inscrutable behind his 
           mirrored shades.

           INT. HELMSLEY HOTEL (NYC) - HALLWAY

           Quincy and Bob wave good night, head off the other direction. 
           Now it’s just Bubbles, Michael and Frank. As they walk down 
           the hall... 

                                 FRANK
                        And Sting? You think he could draw 
                        half a million people in Japan? Not 
                        even if the tickets included all 
                        you can eat sushi and a handjob 
                        from Hello Kitty! He stole Wynton 
                        Marsalis’ entire band and still 
                        sounds about as funky as Margaret 
                        Thatcher addressing Parliament. So 
                        why did he win? I don’t know. That 
                        one is a mystery. One that will 
                        forever remain unsolved 
                        because...no one cares about the 
                        fucking Grammys!

           They arrive at Michael’s room. Michael unlocks the door.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Good night, Frank.

           Michael goes into the room. Bubbles follows and closes the 
           door behind him.

                                 FRANK
                        ‘Frank’? What happened to ‘Uncle 
                        Tookie’?
           INT. HELMSLEY HOTEL (NYC) - MICHAEL’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           The moment the door closes, Michael removes his sunglasses 
           and bursts out crying. He lurches across the floor and dives 
           face first into the bed. His crying turns into deep, heaving 
           sobs.

           Bubbles climbs onto the bed and sits next to Michael. He 
           holds out his pointer finger to initiate their little ritual, 
           but Michael is too upset to notice.  

           Bubbles reaches out and pats Michael gently on the head.

           INT. HEATHROW INT’L AIRPORT (LONDON) - ARRIVALS - DAY

                        But the defeats of that evening 
                        would soon be put behind us as The 
                        King embarked upon another crusade 
                        in a far off land.

           Bubbles, Michael and his entourage wait in line at UK 
           Customs. A British CUSTOMS AGENT looks over Michael’s 
           passport, checks some of his paperwork. Wrinkles his brow.

                                 CUSTOMS AGENT
                        One moment, Mister Jackson, sir.

                                 FRANK
                        Is there a problem?

           The customs agent slips out of his booth, taking Michael’s 
           paperwork with him.

           INT. HEATHROW INT’L AIRPORT - BACK OFFICE - LATER

           Frank berates an agent from the Ministry of Agriculture, 
           Fisheries and Food, as Michael looks on, worried.

                                 FRANK
                        Do you have any idea who you are 
                        dealing with here?

                                 MINISTRY AGENT
                        I am quite aware of who Mr. Jackson 
                        is, sir. And I’m aware that he 
                        greatly enjoys the companionship of 
                        his chimpanzee. But the law is 
                        quite clear.

           Bubbles plays with one of the many buckles on Michael’s 
           boots.
                                 MINISTRY AGENT (CONT’D)
                        Animals entering the U.K. must be 
                        quarantined for six months until 
                        proven free of diseases.

                                 FRANK
                        Diseases?! It’s not like we’re 
                        bringing him from some African 
                        jungle. Bubbles is from Los 
                        Angeles! It’s one of the least-
                        diseased places on the planet!

           The Ministry Agent raises a doubtful eyebrow.

                                 MINISTRY AGENT
                        Be that as it may.

           Frank storms toward the door and digs his brick-sized mobile 
           phone out of his jacket pocket.

                                 FRANK
                        Don’t you worry, Michael. I will 
                        take care of this in two phone 
                        calls. 

           Frank holds up two fingers to the The Ministry Agent - the 
           British equivalent of flipping someone off. The agent 
           maintains a stiff upper lip as Frank exits and SLAMS the door 
           behind him.

           LATER

           Frank quietly opens the door. Walks back in with a hangdog 
           expression. He looks at Michael and shrugs. Michael nods to 
           Bob. Bob approaches Bubbles.

                                 BOB
                        Come on. We have to go home.

           Bubbles doesn’t want to go. He clings to Michael’s legs.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I’ll be back real soon, Bubbles.

           Bob reaches out..but Bubbles SWATS his hand away.

           Bob tries again. Bubbles WHIRLS on him. Bob backs away as 
           Bubbles rears up on his hind legs and puffs out his coat, 
           angry. Bubbles SLAMS his palms against the floor and then 
           rises again. 

                                 BOB
                        Easy, now. Take it easy.
           A tense moment as everyone in the room realizes they’re 
           dealing with an angry, wild animal.

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        But not a moment too soon, I 
                        remembered the prophesy, and my 
                        hunger to overcome it.

           Bubbles regains his composure. Lowers himself to all fours. 
           Ashamed, he shuffles over to Bob. He looks away and offers 
           his palm in a simian gesture of docility, submission.

           INT. AIRPLANE - NIGHT

           The cabin lights are off and all the passengers alseep. 
           Except for Bubbles. He sits next to Bob, silently brooding.

           EXT. HAYVENHURST - DRIVEWAY - NIGHT

           Bob’s pickup truck pulls up in the private driveway. He exits 
           the vehicle, opens the passenger side door. Bubbles hops out, 
           takes Bob’s hand.

           La Toya stands by the front door, gesturing them to hurry 
           inside before anyone sees.

           INT. HAYVENHURST - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Bubbles and Bob follow La Toya as she moves quickly down a 
           hallway.  

                                 BOB
                        Just for a few days. Until I can 
                        free up a space for him at the 
                        ranch. 

                                 LA TOYA
                        Don’t worry, I love Bubbles! Plus, 
                        Michael is going to owe me big time 
                        after this.

           INT. HAYVENHURST - LA TOYA’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           A canopy bed, lots of pink, girly decor.

                                 LA TOYA
                        Welcome home, Bubbles!

           Bubbles stands at the center of the room, befuddled. This is 
           not home.
           LATER

           La Toya sits on her bed, watching “The Cosby Show.” Next to 
           her, Bubbles plays with a stuffed PANDA BEAR toy. 

           There’s a KNOCK on the door. 

                                 JOE (O.S.)
                        We need to talk, Toya.

           La Toya rolls her eyes. Bubbles CHIRPS at the stuffed panda. 
           She claps a hand over his mouth.

                                 JOE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        What was that?

                                 LA TOYA
                        It’s called a TV.

                                 JOE (O.C.)
                        Don’t make me break down this door. 

           Exasperated, La Toya gets out of bed. She puts a finger to 
           her lips to shush Bubbles. Then she takes him by the hand and 
           guides him into her...

           CLOSET

           ...an empire of tacky 80s outfits on hangers. 

                                 LA TOYA
                             (whispering)
                        Stay here. I’ll be right back.

           Bubbles nods. La Toya exits, partially closing the closet 
           door, leaving it open just an inch to let in light. 

           LATER

           Bubbles sleeps on the closet floor, cuddling his panda. 

           LATER

           La Toya BURSTS back into her bedroom and SLAMS the door 
           behind her, startling Bubbles awake. He spies her through the 
           crack in the door. She yells at no one in particular.

                                 LA TOYA
                        You don’t own me! I’m a grown 
                        woman!
           Mascara runs down La Toya’s face. She crosses to the bed, 
           drops to her hands and knees and YANKS loose a suitcase from 
           under the bed. UNZIPS it.

           She opens a dresser drawer, grabs clothes, shoves them in the 
           suitcase. Then she heads for her closet. She yanks open the 
           door.

                                 LA TOYA (CONT’D)
                        Oh, Jesus! 

           La Toya startles at seeing Bubbles looking up at her. 

                                 LA TOYA (CONT’D)
                        I forgot you were in here.

           Bubbles emerges from the closet. He offers her the panda toy. 
           La Toya is touched by the gesture.

                                 LA TOYA (CONT’D)
                        You’re so sweet. But you keep it. 
                        Tell Michael I just couldn’t wait 
                        anymore. You’ll be okay, right?

           She pats his head. Then zips up her suitcase and heads out 
           the door. Then she closes the door and is gone. The only 
           sound is CANNED LAUGHTER from The Cosby Show. 

           LATER

           It’s late at night. Bubbles has climbed on top of the canopy 
           over La Toya’s bed, where he flips through Vogue magazine. 
           From the TV he hears...

                                 REPORTER (O.S.)
                        The King of Pop met with some 
                        fellow royals today...

           Bubbles LEAPS off the canopy and lands on the floor. He walks 
           up for a closer look. 

           ON TV

           Michael shakes hands with PRINCESS DIANA (27) and PRINCE 
           CHARLES (36).

                                 REPORTER (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        ...prior to the first of his three 
                        sold-out shows at London’s Wembley 
                        Stadium. 
           Michael, Diana, Charles and PEPSI EXECS pose for photos 
           behind a giant check.

                                 REPORTER  (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Jackson used the occasion to donate 
                        $450,000 to the Prince’s Trust and 
                        Great Ormond Street Children’s 
                        Hospital. 

           Michael performs onstage at Wembley.

                                 REPORTER (CONT’D)
                        Jackson had reportedly removed his 
                        controversial song “Dirty Diana” 
                        from the night’s set list, only to 
                        reinstate it when the Princess of 
                        Wales told him it was her favorite.

           Michael and JIMMY SAFECHUCK (10) exit Hamley’s toy store, 
           each clutching a giant shopping bag of toys as the paparazzi 
           go nuts. The smiling boy is dressed just like Michael.

           BACK TO SCENE

           Bubbles tightens his grip on the magazine.

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        While I was hidden away in this 
                        lonely castle tower, banished to 
                        some pink hell, The King roamed a 
                        farflung corner of the realm 
                        accompanied by some whelp of no 
                        consequence. 

                                 REPORTER (O.S.)
                        Jackson is now midway through the 
                        European leg of his record-breaking 
                        Bad tour, which will return to the 
                        U.S. this September.

           Bubbles THROWS the magazine at the screen. 

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        I experienced what can only be 
                        described as a terrible urge to 
                        defecate on the floor and hurl my 
                        feces willy-nilly about the room.

           Bubbles squats. And then quickly rises.
                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        But I understood the necessity of 
                        resisting such impulses. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           Feces are splattered all over the walls. La Toya’s room is 
           utterly destroyed. Bubbles sits in the middle of the 
           aftermath, a potrait of calm after the storm.

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        Alas, some impulses prove 
                        irresistible.

           Footsteps THUNDER down the hallway outside.

                                 JOE (O.S.)
                        What the holy hell is going on in 
                        there? It’s one in the goddamn 
                        morning! 

           Joe THROWS open the door...and stands frozen at what he sees.

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        But fate is a fickle mistress, and 
                        my moment of madness had delivered 
                        opportunity to my door.

           Bubbles CHARGES. Joe backs away as Bubbles darts past him, 
           out of the room.

           INT. HAYVENHURST - VARIOUS - CONTINUOUS

           Bubbles RACES through the house, CATAPULTING over furniture, 
           LAUNCHING himself off the walls, SWINGING on chandeliers as 
           he heads to...  

           INT. HAYVENHURST - MICHAEL’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           ...where he calmly climbs into his crib. Comfortable. 
           Content. At home.

                                                               FADE TO:

           INT. HAYVENHURST - MICHAEL’S ROOM - DAY

           Bubbles hits random buttons on a Speak-n-Spell toy as Joe 
           cautiously enters. He holds a banana in one hand, an open can 
           of Pepsi in another.
                                 JOE
                        Good morning, Bubbles.

           Bubbles recoils. Suspicious. 

                                 JOE (CONT’D)
                        Now don’t get excited. I’m not 
                        upset about last night. Just 
                        figured you might be hungry is all. 

           Joe sets the Pepsi and the banana on the floor. Smiles as he 
           backs away.

                                 JOE (CONT’D)
                        Enjoy your breakfast.

           Joe closes the door. Bubbles hesitates a moment and then...

           ...lopes across the room. He picks up the banana, examines 
           it, SNIFFS it. Nothing amiss. He peels it, takes a bite. 
           Yummy. He stuffs the rest in his mouth.

           Then he picks up the Pepsi. Takes a sip. SMACKS his lips. Not 
           bad. Then he CHUGS the whole thing and tosses the empty can 
           over his shoulder.

           He goes back to pick up his Speak-n-Spell...but STUMBLES. 
           LURCHES...and COLLAPSES unconscious to the floor.

           EXT. HAYVENHURST - MENAGERIE - DAY

           Bubbles wakes up groggy and disoriented. He’s inside a small, 
           metal cage. He rises and finds himself face-to-face with a...

           BENGAL TIGER

           ...in the adjacent enclosure. Bubbles scrambles back in 
           fright. He scans for an escape, but there is none. He is 
           trapped. The tiger regards him a moment, then turns away with 
           feline disinterest.

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        And so it was The Bearded Prophet’s 
                        words were made manifest. I had 
                        done my utmost to demonstrate 
                        obedience, yet the prophecy had 
                        been realized nonetheless. 

           Bubbles slumps to the floor of his cage. Defeated.
           EXT. HAYVENHURST - MENAGERIE - NIGHT

           A GROUNDSKEEPER pushes a bowl of food into Bubble’s cage and 
           then closes the door.

           Bubbles saunters over. Finds the bowl filled with mushy dog 
           food. He SNIFFS it, grimaces in disgust, and pushes it aside.

           HEADLIGHTS SWEEP over the cage. Bubbles sees...

           BOB’S PICKUP TRUCK

           ...motoring up the driveway and pulling to a halt. Bob gets 
           out and begins walking toward the house.

           Bubbles GRUNTS. Bob halts in his tracks - did he really just 
           hear that? 

           Bob turns, hustles towards the menagerie. He spots Bubbles 
           and is clearly dismayed at finding him caged.

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        I expected the Bearded Prophet to 
                        revel at witnessing his conjecture 
                        proven correct. But he betrayed no 
                        jubilation at my present state.

                                 BOB
                        La Toya put you in there?

           Joe steps out of the shadows.

                                 JOE
                        No. That was me. La Toya’s gone. 
                        Flew the coop. 

                                 BOB
                        Oh. Well, I’m here to pick up--

                                 JOE
                        We like him right where he is.

           Joe unleashes a chilling smile.

                                 BOB
                        I think Michael would be upset if 
                        he knew Bubbles was in a cage.

                                 JOE 
                        Would he, now? You think maybe 
                        Michael might be so upset that he’d 
                        actually speak to his father? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JOE  (CONT'D)
                        Because as it stands, I can’t even 
                        get that little ingrate to return 
                        my damn calls.

                                 BOB
                        Look, whatever is between you and 
                        Michael-- 

                                 JOE
                        I’ll tell what’s between us. Eight 
                        million dollars. That’s how much 
                        them Moonies are offering for the 
                        Jackson 5 to perform four shows in 
                        Korea. But without Michael, there’s 
                        no deal.

           Bob puzzles through it.

                                 BOB
                        You’re holding Bubbles for ransom?

                                 JOE
                        I’m negotiating. You tell Michael 
                        it’s up to him what happens next. 

           Joe turns and trudges back toward the house. Bob gives 
           Bubbles a look of sympathy.

                                 BOB
                        Be patient. We’ll get this get 
                        sorted out.

           Bubbles turns away in disappointment and retreats into the 
           shadows of his cage and turns his back.. 

           Over his shoulder, we see Bob walk back and get in his truck. 

           Bob drives the truck to the gate and then stops. The gates 
           open. Bob leans out and says something to the security guard 
           manning the gatehouse and then...

           ...throws the truck in REVERSE. It races back up the driveway 
           and then Bob throws on the brakes. 

           Bob jumps from the car. Scans to make sure Joe isn’t around, 
           and then sprints to the menagerie.

                                 BOB (CONT’D)
                        Pssst. Bubbles.

           Bubbles turns. Sees Bob. Waves him off. Bob UNLOCKS the cage. 
           Now he has Bubbles’ attention.
                                 BOB (CONT’D)
                             (signing)
                        Climb tree. Go over fence. Find Bob  
                        other side.

           Bubbles nods - he’s down with the plan.

                                 BUBBLES 
                             (signing)
                        Thank you, Bearded Prophet. Your 
                        gallantry and loyalty to The King 
                        restore my faith in the court.

           Bob is mystified. Bubbles simplifies it.

                                 BUBBLES (CONT’D)
                             (signing)
                        You go now. Me follow. 

           INT. BOB’S TRUCK - MOVING - NIGHT

           Bob approaches the security gate. Shows the security guard 
           his watch. The security guard chuckles, waves him through. 

           EXT. HAYVENHURST - NIGHT

           Bubbles deftly ascends a tree at the edge of the property. He 
           reaches the top and then leaps down, freefalling before he...

           ...grabs a low branch and slingshots himself over the fence.

           EXT. ADJACENT STREET - CONTINUOUS

           Bubbles hits the ground and somersaults down a short 
           embankment to break his fall before...

           ...he hits the street and bounds into the open window of 
           Bob’s awaiting truck. The truck PEELS OUT in a cloud of 
           exhaust and ZOOMS away. 

           EXT. BOB’S RANCH (SYLMAR, CA) - DAY

           CU on Bubbles happily munching on a mango.

           PULL BACK TO REVEAL:

           He’s in a small enclosure, not much bigger than the one at 
           Hayvenhurst. 
                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        Yes, I was again behind bars. But 
                        now I was no prisoner. As the heir 
                        apparent, I had to be protected 
                        from usurpers who sought to do me 
                        harm. The temporary loss of my 
                        freedom was a small sacrifice to 
                        preserve the royal succession. To 
                        uphold the very kingdom itself. And 
                        my new confinements were not 
                        without their amenities.        

           Bubbles turns to face...a FEMALE CHIMP, slightly older, in an 
           adjacent cage.  

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        Her name was Daisy. Though she 
                        lacked the educational advantages 
                        bestowed upon me in my youth, she 
                        enjoyed a rudimentary grasp of sign 
                        language and was a kind and noble 
                        spirit.

           Bubbles hands Daisy a hunk of mango through the bars. She 
           stuffs it in her mouth.

                                 DAISY 
                             (signing)
                        Thanks, yo. Tastes good shit.

                                 BUBBLES
                             (signing)
                        You are most welcome, my good lady.

           Daisy motions to Bubbles. He turns around, backs toward her. 
           She reaches through the bars of her cage and begins grooming 
           him. 

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        After much clumsy discourse and 
                        daily observation of her behavior, 
                        I ascertained she’d been raised in 
                        a circus... 

           INSERT SERIES OF SHOTS

           -- Daisy stands on her hands.

           -- Daisy cartwheels around her cage. 

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        ...where she had mastered a variety 
                        of talents...
           -- Daisy bends over, sticks her butt in the air and BLOWS A 
           RASPBERRY.

           BACK TO SCENE

           Bubbles motions to Daisy - his turn to groom. Daisy turns to 
           reveal DEEP SCARS crisscrossing her back.

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        ...acquired at a very hefty price.

           Bubbles picks the nits from her back. CRUNCHES them between 
           his teeth.

                                 DAISY
                             (signing)
                        Thanks, yo. Feels shit good.

           LATER

           Bubbles and Daisy lean against the bars closest each other, 
           watching the sun set. 

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        My banishment served as interlude. 
                        A caesura of peaceful 
                        contemplation, wherein, unburdened 
                        by courtly responsibilities, I was 
                        free to muse upon the mysteries of 
                        the stars, to ruminate upon the 
                        nature of life and fate. 

           Daisy bores of the sunset. She GRUNTS, retreats to the corner 
           of her cage and begins MASTURBATING. 

           Bubbles watches her for a moment, then turns his attention to 
           HEADLIGHTS from an approaching car as it nears, passes, and 
           snakes away in the distance.

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        But I grew weary of tranquility. My 
                        heart longed for the next movement 
                        to begin. For the beating of the 
                        drums, the howling of the mob, the 
                        dizzy thrum of my own blood 
                        coursing thick and wild inside my 
                        veins. I longed for the resumption 
                        of my tale. 

           Daisy climaxes with a SQUEAL. Snorts.
                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        I longed for his return.

           EXT. BOB’S RANCH - DAY

           Bubbles blinks awake. Yawns. And then sees...

           Michael looking at him through the cage bars. Bubbles blinks 
           in disbelief. Michael smiles.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Wake up, lazybones. 

           INT. LIMO - MOVING - DAY

           Bubbles looks out the window as the car winds through a 
           deserted stretch of hills. Nothing but dust and scrub brush.

           They arrive at an ornate gate that reads “NEVERLAND” and is 
           decorated with the heraldic Michael Jackson coat of arms. 

           The gates open and the car goes inside.

           EXT. NEVERLAND - MAIN RESIDENCE - DAY

           Two dozen smiling SERVANTS are lined up in formation on the 
           front steps of the massive main house. 

                                 SERVANTS
                             (in unison)
                        Good morning, Michael.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Good morning, everyone. This is 
                        Bubbles. He’s going to live here.

                                 SERVANTS
                             (in unison)
                        Good morning, Bubbles. 

           Bubbles is nervous with so many eyes upon him. He and Michael 
           continue into the...

           INT. NEVERLAND - FOYER - DAY  

           ...where stands a statue of a butler holding a tray of real 
           cookies. Michael grabs one and hands it to Bubbles. They 
           continue into the... 
           DEN

           ...a room crammed with expensive marble statuary, kitschy art 
           and weirdly life-like MANNEQUINS.   

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        In this new dwelling, there was 
                        much of the beautiful, much of the 
                        bizarre, something of the terrible, 
                        and not a little of that which 
                        might have excited disgust.

           They move toward a grand piano. On top, Disney memorabilia 
           and dozens of framed photos of friends and family (Joe is 
           conspicuously absent), as well as head shots of yesteryear 
           child actors Shirley Temple, Jackie Coogan, Spanky McFarland. 

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        The new castle was a manifestation 
                        of The King’s own psyche, a 
                        portrait rendered in wood and 
                        stone, ceramic and plastic.

           Michael points out a photo of Bubbles.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Look, there’s you.

           It’s a shot of Bubbles as a very young chimp. Bubbles is 
           embarrassed by it, turns away. Next they move into the...

           KITCHEN

           Airy, spacious, modern - the only kitsch-free room of the 
           house. Two COOKS in immaculate white uniforms chop 
           vegetables. They nod greetings as Michael and Bubbles enter.

                                 MICHAEL
                        This is where you can get ice-
                        cream, peach cobbler.  Whatever you 
                        want. Anyway, you can explore the 
                        rest of the house later. Let’s go 
                        outside and have fun.

           NEVERLAND MONTAGE

           -- Michael drives Bubbles in a golf cart down a gravel path, 
           pointing out a sculpture of kids playing ring-around-the-
           rosie.

           -- They ride in a small train. Michael points out a pond with 
           an island populated by pink flamingos.
           -- They stroll through the zoo, past giraffes, sheep, 
           orangutans, tigers, an elephant.

           -- They ride painted wooden horses aboard a gaudy carousel.

           -- They climb a tree. Bubbles leaps from branch to branch 
           with ease while Michael struggles to ascend.

           EXT. NEVERLAND - AMUSEMENT PARK - NIGHT

           Bubbles and Michael sit in the car of a Ferris wheel. As the 
           car reaches the apex of the ride, it shudders to a a halt.

           They gaze at the moon and stars.

                                 MICHAEL
                        You can do whatever you want here. 
                        Neverland is a place where we can 
                        finally be free.

           Michael smiles at Bubbles and then...

           SIZZLE....POP!

           Fireworks explode across the night sky. 

           EXT. NEVERLAND - VARIOUS - DAY

           Dozens of KIDS (8-12) LAUGH and SQUEAL as they file out of 
           school buses.    

           Michael wears dark glasses and carries an umbrella as he 
           makes his way down the stairs outside the Railway Station, 
           holding Bubbles by the hand.

           Bubbles winces at the noise from the kids.

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        Evidently, Neverland’s liberties 
                        did not extend to being free from 
                        aural assault...

           LATER

           Michael and Bubbles ride the train, surrounded by boisterous 
           children. Michael looks like he’s in heaven. Bubbles is 
           annoyed.
           LATER

           Flashbulbs POP as Michael and Bubbles pose for pictures with 
           the kids.

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        ...nor the freedom from subjecting 
                        oneself to dozens of portraits in 
                        the company of pocket-sized, 
                        grinning cretins. I knew not 
                        whether this practice was brave or 
                        foolish on behalf of The King, 
                        given that his visage grew daily 
                        more ashen and bloodless.

           LATER

           Michael and Bubbles sit on a park bench, watching kids ride 
           the Pirate Ship. Michael sneaks a prescription PILL BOTTLE 
           out of his pocket. It’s labeled “Valium.”

                        This despite his increasing self-
                        administration of nostrums I 
                        hypothesized were concocted to slow 
                        the rapid decoloration of his skin. 

           Michael dumps a couple pills into his palm, pops them in his 
           mouth and swallows.

           EXT. NEVERLAND - POOLSIDE - NIGHT

           Christmas lights and decorations abound. Adult PARTY GUESTS 
           chit-chat and tipple champagne. 

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        On rare festive occasions, various 
                        courtiers and royal advisors would 
                        assemble inside the castle walls to 
                        attend lavish banquets.     

           Bubbles, dressed in an elf costume, moves through the crowd 
           past lots of familiar faces - Elizabeth Taylor, Quincy Jones, 
           John Branca, Dr. Klein, Dr. Hoefflin, etc. 

           Noticeably absent -- any members of the Jackson family. 
                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        I relished such occasions as I 
                        found their company a great deal 
                        more desirable than that of the 
                        screeching guttersnipes with whom 
                        The King increasingly preferred to 
                        fraternize.

           Bubbles spots Bob chatting with Frank DiLeo and runs to greet 
           him. Bob scoops Bubbles up and rubs him on the head.

                                 BOB
                        How you doing, Bubbles?

                                 BUBBLES
                             (signing)
                        Tolerably well, thank you. And 
                        yourself, my Bearded Prophet?

                                 FRANK
                        What did he say?

                                 BOB
                        I don’t know. Something about my 
                        beard.

           Bob sets Bubbles down, then reaches into his pocket and 
           produces a candy cane. He hands it to Bubbles. Frank admires 
           the Ferris wheel turning in the distance.

                                 FRANK
                        Place is something, huh?

                                 BOB
                        Yeah, it’s something alright. I 
                        just wonder if it’s good for him.

                                 FRANK
                        Bubbles?

                                 BOB
                        Michael. Out here in the middle of 
                        nowhere. Isolated. Insulated from 
                        the real world. Just him and... 

           A live REINDEER strolls by wearing a blanket that reads 
           “MERRY CHRISTMAS” and is imprinted with the Michael Jackson 
           coat of arms.

                                 BOB (CONT’D)
                        ...all of this.
                                 FRANK
                        Gee, I don’t know, Bob. You think 
                        maybe the kid still has a shot at a 
                        normal life? 

           Frank chuckles and lights his cigar.

           INT. NEVERLAND - DEN - NIGHT

           The party is over. Bubbles, Michael and Elizabeth Taylor, all 
           in pajamas, sit by a crackling fire listening to Christmas 
           music. Bubbles plays around with Liz’s white Maltese terrier, 
           SUGAR. 

           Elizabeth passes Michael a present. She’s a little wasted.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Open it.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Santa Claus bring this?

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Yeah. Santa Claus of Bel Air.

                                 MICHAEL
                        You shouldn’t have.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        If anyone deserves a gift, it’s 
                        you. You give so much to so many. 
                        Open it.

           Michael blushes. Hesitates.

                                 MICHAEL
                        It’s weird, celebrating Christmas. 
                        It still feels wrong.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        If the Jehovah’s Witnesses didn’t 
                        want you to celebrate Christmas, 
                        they shouldn’t have kicked you out 
                        of their church. Go on, open it.

           Michael rips open the present.

                                 MICHAEL
                        A Super Soaker!

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I thought you’d like it.
                                 MICHAEL
                        It’s the best! I know how I’m 
                        waking up Bubbles tomorrow.

           He points the water gun at Bubbles, makes a spraying sound. 

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        I got something for you, too.

           Michael hands her an unwrapped jewelry box.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        You’re not proposing again, are 
                        you?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Liz! No! 

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I’ve had so much wine tonight, I 
                        just might accept.

           She opens the box to reveal a huge diamond ring.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        My goodness, Michael. This is... 
                        heavens. This is lovely.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I know girls like diamonds, so...

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Divine. So beautiful. Thank you.

           She slips on the ring. Michael passes Bubbles a present.

                                 MICHAEL
                        And Bubbles, I got this for you. 
                             (to the dog)
                        I didn’t get anything for you, 
                        Sugar.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        She’d just chew it up, anyway. 
                        She’s a bitch like that.

           Bubbles unwraps his present to reveal...

           ...a STUFFED ANIMAL from the “Michael’s Pets” line. It’s a 
           little chimpanzee wearing a jacket imprinted with the Michael 
           Jackson coat of arms - the same one both Michael and Bubbles 
           have on their pajamas.
                                 MICHAEL
                        It’s you, Bubbles! I gave you to 
                        you!

                                 ELIZABETH
                        Oh, that’s so cute.

           INT. NEVERLAND - MICHAEL’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        “So cute.”

           Michael sleeps alone in his giant bed, snoring. Bubbles sits 
           on the floor outside his crib, staring intently at the 
           stuffed Bubbles toy. He’s sad, confused, ANGRY.

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        This was me? This! A round-bellied 
                        weakling with a pusillanimous grin? 
                        “So cute.” 

           Bubbles SMACKS the doll, sends it tumbling across the floor. 
           It lands on its side facing him. Seems to stare up at Bubbles 
           with...

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        Two vacant eyes affixed to an  
                        expanse of bovine imbecility 
                        parenthesized by deaf ears of 
                        outrageous proportion? This was me? 
                        This was how the sovereign chose to 
                        portray his successor? Was this 
                        merely some inefficacious jest, a 
                        wayward witticism not worthy of 
                        consideration?  

           Bubbles expression darkens with the next thought.

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        Or...was this in fact how the 
                        sovereign truly viewed me? 

           Tears form in his eyes. 

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        Had I mistaken my place entirely?

           His body begins to tremble.
                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        Was I but the fleshy, blood-filled 
                        twin of this smiling rag doll, 
                        mute, inert and sideways prone 
                        before me? Was I -- had I always 
                        been -- a mere plaything? An 
                        amusement? A toy? 

           Enraged, Bubbles seizes the doll. He RIPS its head off. 
           THROWS it across the room. He TEARS the torso to shreds, 
           obliterating the doll in a matter of seconds.

           Then he sees his reflection in a darkened window. Focuses the 
           coat of arms on his pajamas. 

           He TEARS off his pajamas in a flurry. 

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        “I gave you to you?” 

           Bubbles stands naked and proud before his reflection.

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        Who dares tell me who I am?

           INT. NEVERLAND - DINING ROOM - DAY 

           Michael sits at a large table. Behind him hangs a cheesy oil 
           portrait of Michael himself dressed as a knight in shining 
           armor carrying a golden sword. 

           Bubbles sits nearby -- unclothed -- munching on an apple.  
           Frank enters.

                                 FRANK
                             (on Bubbles)
                        Jesus, he’s growing fast. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Yeah, getting to big for his 
                        britches. He fights me when I try 
                        to put clothes on him now. Don’t 
                        you, Bubbles?

           Bubbles shrugs. Continues eating.

                                 FRANK
                        So what can I do for you, boss?

           Michael produces a stack of tabloids. He pushes a copy of The 
           National Enquirer across the table.
                                 MICHAEL
                        They’re saying I bleach my skin...

           He slides across a copy of Star.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        ...that I have hormone treatments 
                        to keep my voice high...

           Michael slaps down a copy of The Globe.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        ...that I only bathe in Evian 
                        water...

           And then another National Enquirer.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        ...that I’ve had cheekbone 
                        implants...  

           And then News of the World. 

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        ...that I’m terrified Prince is 
                        using purple E.S.P. to control 
                        Bubbles’ mind in a plot to kill me. 

           Bubbles digs a finger into his nose.

                                 FRANK
                        Purple E.S.P.? How is that 
                        different from regular E.S.P.?

                                 MICHAEL
                        It’s not funny. It’s ignorant. You 
                        need to put a stop to these lies!

           Frank chews his cigar. Shifts his weight, tugs up his pants. 
           Now has come the Time for Uncomfortable Truths.

                                 FRANK
                        All due respect, Michael? You 
                        started this whole shebang. That 
                        stunt with the oxygen chamber? Your 
                        idea. The story we planted about 
                        the Elephant Man? Funny at the 
                        time. But once that ball gets 
                        rolling, you can’t just turn around 
                        and put the genie back in the 
                        bottle.
                                 MICHAEL 
                        They’re making me look like a 
                        freak. Why do they want to hurt me? 
                        I’m just a normal person.

           Frank takes in the grandiose portrait hanging behind Michael. 
           The weird costumed mannequins in the corners of the room. He 
           chooses his next words carefully.

                                 FRANK
                        OK. You want to come across as a 
                        normal guy? Here are some pointers. 
                        One, stop taking Bubbles out in 
                        public.

                                 MICHAEL
                        But he’s my friend.

                                 FRANK
                        I understand that. But it looks 
                        weird, the biggest celebrity on the 
                        planet running around with an ape. 

           Bubbles shoots Frank a look.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Sophisticate though he may be.

           Bubbles is mollified.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Two -- and you’re not gonna like 
                        this, but I’m gonna say it anyway -- 
                        stop hanging out with kids all the 
                        time. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        You don’t understand, I never had --

                                 FRANK
                        -- a childhood. I know. I get it. 
                        But you’ve spent more time trying 
                        to recreate this mythical lost 
                        childhood of yours than a real 
                        childhood even lasts. Take it from 
                        me, I had a childhood. They’re 
                        overrated.

           Michael grinds his teeth. Frank continues, undeterred.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Three -- whatever you’re doing to 
                        your skin, stop already. You look 
                        like a ghost. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        And enough with the plastic 
                        surgeries. You’re a healthy, 
                        attractive guy. But you keep going 
                        down this path, you’re gonna fuck 
                        up your face beyond all 
                        reparations.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I’ve only had two--

                                 FRANK  
                        Save the two procedure bullshit for 
                        People Magazine. Speaking of 
                        which...number four -- make 
                        yourself accessible. Give 
                        interviews. Go on TV. Go on 
                        Arsenio, talk to Oprah. Speak with 
                        reporters. Half the reason these 
                        tabloid hacks make up so much crazy 
                        shit is because you insist on 
                        hiding from the world. Show them 
                        the Michael Jackson I know. Because 
                        the Michael I know is not some 
                        reclusive weirdo. He’s a funny, 
                        caring, energetic, thoughtful guy. 
                        A great guy to be around.

           This is painful for Michael to hear. But it resonates.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        And okay yes, he happens to be the 
                        most talented singer and dancer 
                        maybe of all time. I certainly 
                        think so, and millions of people 
                        all over this planet feel the same. 
                        But for me, he’s also a real 
                        person, a man who -- and I think 
                        you will agree here -- grew up in 
                        an absolutely crazy situation 
                        within a tragic cartoon of family, 
                        and yet, despite all that, turned 
                        out basically okay. A lot better 
                        than most. 

           Tears run down Michael’s face. A heavy, cathartic moment.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        That’s you. That’s Michael Jackson. 
                        That’s who you are.

           Frank stops pacing. Sits across from him and leans close.  
                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        So be who you are. That’s all 
                        people want. Because you give them 
                        a false Michael? This man-of-a-
                        thousand-masks thing? Okay, they’re 
                        entertained for awhile. There’s a 
                        mystique there, a value in keeping 
                        them guessing. But eventually they 
                        get tired of guessing. Of having to 
                        think. People don’t want to think. 
                        They want answers. Categories. 
                        Definitions. Comfort. You know a 
                        lot about animals, right?

           Michael sniffs, nods. 

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Many of them are bigger than us, 
                        stronger than us. Like whatsername, 
                        that elephant Liz gave you...

                                 MICHAEL
                        Gypsy.

                                 FRANK
                        Gypsy. How do you keep Gypsy from  
                        smashing through her cage, breaking 
                        down the front door of this house 
                        and trampling both of us to death? 
                        Because she could do it.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Gypsy would never do that.

                                 FRANK
                        Because you feed her. By feeding 
                        her, you keep her from having to 
                        think. ‘Where’s my next peanut 
                        coming from, the fuck am I doing in 
                        San Ynez instead of the Serengeti? 
                        Why is Dumbo more famous than me?’  

           Michael snort-laughs.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        She’s satisfied, these thoughts 
                        never enter her mind. It’s the same 
                        with the public. The media. You 
                        feed the beast, you control the 
                        beast. But if you starve the beast? 
                        It starts thinking. And thinking 
                        hurts. And so it turns this pain on 
                        you. And when it does, and you try 
                        to fight it? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        You find the beast is bigger than 
                        you. Stronger than you ever 
                        imagined. You discover the beast 
                        never sleeps. And the beast will 
                        trample you underfoot without a 
                        second thought. 

           A long beat as Michael takes this all in. 

           EXT. NEVERLAND - AMUSEMENT PARK - DAY

           Michael drives a customized golf cart complete with a 
           portrait of himself as Peter Pan airbrushed on the hood. John 
           Branca rides next to him, Bubbles rides in back.

           Michael waves at CHILDREN standing in line for the ICE-CREAM 
           MAN. Then he turns to John.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I need you to fire Frank.

           John can’t believe his ears.

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        And so the purge began...

                                 JOHN
                        You kidding? Why?

           Michael hesitates, as if searching for a reason. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        He promised “Bad” would sell one-
                        hundred million copies.

                                 JOHN
                        Michael, I have a hard time 
                        believing he “promised” any such 
                        thing.

                                 MICHAEL
                        But that was the goal. And we 
                        didn’t even come close. 

                                 JOHN
                        You had five number one hits on 
                        that album!

                                 MICHAEL
                        Which means I did my part. He 
                        dropped the ball.

           John is dismayed.
                                 JOHN
                        No one is more loyal to you than 
                        Frank. That guy would take a bullet 
                        for Michael Jackson.

           Michael says nothing. John looks sick to his stomach. 

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Fine. I’ll call him this afternoon.

           INT. NEVERLAND - STUDY - DAY

           Michael paces his book-lined study as Bubbles thumbs through 
           the picture book Koko’s Kitten. Accountant RICHARD SHERMAN 
           (40s) sits on a couch, taking notes. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Also, I need you to fire John.

                                 SHERMAN
                        Hold on...John Branca?

                                 MICHAEL
                        He has too many other clients. And 
                        he always questions my decisions.

                                 SHERMAN
                        John orchestrated that thing with 
                        Beatles catalogue and --

                                 MICHAEL
                        But it was my idea.

                                 SHERMAN
                        OK, but he’s made you hundreds of 
                        millions of dollars, and as your 
                        accountant, I can’t --

                                 MICHAEL
                        I made that money, not him. And I’m 
                        not asking for your advice. I’m 
                        asking you to fire John.

                                 SHERMAN
                        That’s a little outside the realm 
                        of the services I normally provide.

           Michael just looks at him, not saying a word.

                                 SHERMAN (CONT’D)
                        Ok. I’ll draft a letter tomorrow.
           EXT. NEVERLAND - GATE HOUSE - NIGHT 

           Bubbles sits atop a nearby tree. Looking through the window 
           of the gate house, he sees Michael standing next to security 
           chief Billy Bray, scrutinizing a bank of security camera 
           monitors.

           Michael points at a screen.

                                 MICHAEL
                        That guy. The one running the 
                        Zipper ride.

                                 BILLY
                        Yeah?

                                 MICHAEL
                        He never smiles. Neverland is a 
                        happy place. A magical place. 

                                 BILLY
                        You want me to...make him smile?

                                 MICHAEL
                        No. Make him disappear.

           EXT. NEVERLAND - POOL - DAY

           Michael wears a bathrobe as he passes by the pool, Bubbles at 
           his side. The GROUNDS CREW works nearby.

           Bubbles beelines for the high dive and quickly scales the 
           ladder as Michael continues into the pool house.

           We hear a high pitched SCREAM...

           ...and then Michael charges out holding a... 

           PICTURE OF LA TOYA

           ...clipped from Playboy Magazine. She’s naked, her legs 
           wrapped around a giant white python. Michael is livid.

                                 MICHAEL
                        You think this is funny? This is 
                        disgusting! You’re all ignorant! 
                        Which one of you did this?

           No one says anything. Michael rages.
                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        Let me tell you something. If 
                        Bubbles spoke Spanish, I would have 
                        him fire all of you. So thank your 
                        lucky stars he doesn’t!

           He RIPS up the photo, tosses the pieces in their faces.

           INT. JEEP - MOVING - DAY

           Michael wears a cheap gorilla mask. Bubbles sits shotgun as 
           they race towards Los Angeles.

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        When governance of the castle 
                        proved too burdensome, The King 
                        would at times disguise himself and 
                        venture forth among his people.

           EXT. WILSHIRE BLVD (LOS ANGELES) - DAY

           The car is pulled to the side of the road, steam coming out 
           from underneath the hood. Michael, still masked, labors to 
           pry open the hood. 

           But it’s hot to the touch. He looses a signature one note 
           yelp... 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Ooowww!

           ...kick turns and angrily struts back to the driver’s side 
           door. 

           He opens it, grabs his early 90s car phone. Pulls up his mask 
           and dials 9-1-1. A moment later...

                                 DISPATCHER (V.O.)
                             (on phone)
                        9-1-1, what is your emergency?

                                 MICHAEL
                             (into phone)
                        Steam is coming out of my car.

                                 DISPATCHER (V.O.)
                        Sir, is the vehicle on fire?
                                 MICHAEL
                        It’s stopped moving. I’m on 
                        Wilshire Boulevard in Beverly 
                        Hills, California. There are a lot 
                        of people around. Please hurry!

                                 DISPATCHER (V.O.)
                        Sir, an overheated vehicle does not 
                        constitute an emergency.

                                 MICHAEL
                        What if I told you I was Michael 
                        Jackson?

                                 DISPATCHER (V.O.)
                        Then I’d tell you to call up Tito 
                        or Jermaine, because I don’t have 
                        time for this.

           CLICK. DIAL TONE.

           Michael HURLS the phone back into the Jeep. He kicks the 
           tires in frustration. 

           He rips the gorilla mask off just as an old pickup truck 
           passes and we...

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        Let us now ponder the vicissitudes 
                        of fate, she of domineering hand 
                        and ruthless will who can with but 
                        one easeful turn of her mighty 
                        wheel depose even the most fearsome 
                        of kings.

           UNFREEZE

           As the pickup truck driver SLAMS on the brakes. Angry 
           motorists HONK. Swerve around it. 

           The driver is DAVE SCHWARTZ (53), once described by the LA 
           Times as the “Jewish Steve McQueen.” He gazes at Michael 
           through the rearview mirror of the truck. 

           A beat and then the truck slowly reverses.

           EXT. RENT-A-WRECK LOT - DAY

           Bubbles hops out of the bed of the truck. Michael exits - now 
           wearing a silken black hood and veil. Dave guides them 
           through a lot filled with both classic cars and junkers. 
           Michael glances at the store sign. 

                                 MICHAEL
                             (impressed)
                        Wow, this is Rent-a-Wreck? I’ve 
                        seen your commercials on TV. 
                        They’re funny!

                                 DAVE
                        Yeah? Maybe we could get you to 
                        star in one sometime.

           Michael smiles uneasily. 

                                 DAVE (CONT’D)
                        Kidding. C’mon inside.

           Dave pushes open the door to...

           INT. RENT-A-WRECK - RECEPTION AREA - CONTINUOUS

           ...where his EMPLOYEES have formed a star-struck welcoming 
           committee.   

           Also with them is Dave’s wife JUNE CHANDLER-SCHWARTZ (late 
           30s), Eurasian, a former model and actress. She steps 
           forward, offers her hand. Michael shakes it.

                                 JUNE
                        Michael, I’m June. Dave’s wife. You 
                        probably don’t remember this, but I 
                        saw you once about five years ago 
                        at a restaurant. Tommy Tang’s on 
                        Melrose? I waved at you.  

                                 MICHAEL
                        Oh? That was sweet of you.

                                 JUNE
                        I’m a big fan. But my son here, he 
                        is, like, a superfan. 

           She pushes forward JORDAN CHANDLER (12) - a shy, bright, good-
           looking kid. 

                                 JUNE (CONT’D)
                        This is Jordie.

           Michael’s eyes light up. He removes his veil. Bends down to 
           be at eye level with the boy.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Jordie. It’s wonderful to meet you.
           Bubbles eyes the kid suspiciously.

                                 JORDAN
                        It’s great to meet you, too. I 
                        really like your music. And your 
                        videos and stuff.

                                 MICHAEL
                        It warms my heart to hear you say 
                        that. Are you interested in music?

                                 JUNE
                        Oh, he’s very creative. You know, 
                        when you were in the hospital after 
                        the Pepsi thing, Jordie here wrote 
                        you a get well card and sent you 
                        his picture. He was only four years 
                        old. 

                                 MICHAEL
                             (to Jordan)
                        I thought you looked familiar.

           Everybody laughs. Jordan blushes. 

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        There had been others like him, 
                        yes, many others. But upon seeing 
                        this little Worm, my ill-diving 
                        soul shuddered and grew suddenly 
                        cold.

           Bubbles urgently tugs at Michael’s sleeve. Michael shakes him 
           off. He simply can’t take his eyes off the kid. 

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        I knew at first sight he was a 
                        worthy rival. And I instantly hated 
                        him for it.

                                 DAVE
                        Alright, this man needs an 
                        automobile, so everybody quit 
                        acting like they’ve never seen a 
                        Jackson before and get back to 
                        work. 

           Michael tears his attention from Jordan long enough to give 
           nods and waves to the employees as they file back into their 
           offices.

                                 DAVE (CONT’D)
                        So what do you think, Michael, 
                        Pontiac Fiero suit you?
           EXT. RENT-A-WRECK LOT - DAY

           Dave guides Bubbles and Michael to their car.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Are you sure I can’t pay?

                                 DAVE
                        Forget it. But there is a favor you 
                        can do for me.

           He hands Michael a phone number written on a slip of paper.

                                 DAVE (CONT’D)
                        Just give Jordie a call sometime. 
                        My stepson is a good kid, and he’s 
                        going through some tough times 
                        right now.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Does he have cancer?

                                 DAVE
                        No. Jesus, no, nothing like that. 
                        Just, you know, conflicts with his 
                        biological father and...normal 
                        growing up kinds of stuff. But 
                        hearing from you would mean the 
                        world to him.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Sure. I’ll call him sometime.

           Dave smiles and hands Michael the keys to the Fiero.

           INT. NEVERLAND - FOYER - NIGHT

           Michael picks up his Mickey Mouse phone. Dials a few numbers. 
           Quickly hangs up. 

           He takes a bottle out of his pocket. Shakes out a couple 
           pills. Swallows. Steels his nerves. He dials again. On the 
           other end, the phone RINGS. Once...twice...

                                 JUNE (V.O.)
                        Hello?

                                 MICHAEL
                             (on phone)
                        Hi, this is Michael. Is Jordan 
                        there?
                                 JUNE (V.O.)
                        Yes! Oh my God, yes. Just second. 
                        Thank you so much. Hold on.

           Bubbles looks on from the balcony above, peering between 
           balustrade railings. Not amused. 

           EXT. NEVERLAND - AMUSEMENT PARK GROUNDS - DAY

           The usual chaos -- kids run around, LAUGH and YELL. Bubbles 
           sits on a tree branch, dozing in the sun.

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        For a time, life continued much as 
                        before. While The King busied 
                        himself charting a new crusade, I 
                        spent much time in easeful repose, 
                        death’s counterfeit being the chief 
                        nourisher in this rich banquet of 
                        life. 

           Bubbles hears WHISPERING below. His eyelids just open when...

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        But I was in for a rude awakening.

           SPLAT! Bubbles is hit in the face with a WATER BALLOON. He 
           scrambles to his feet, looks down. His assailants disperse 
           and flee the scene. Bubbles focuses on the only kid holding a 
           water balloon and... 

           ...begins his pursuit, SWINGING and LEAPING from limb-to-limb 
           in the canopy of trees. 

           The kid looks over his shoulder. Bubbles is nowhere to be 
           seen. The kid starts to run again when...

           THUMP! Bubbles SWINGS down and lands directly in his path. 
           Bubbles realizes this now terrified kid is...

           JORDAN CHANDLER

           Bubbles rises to full height -- and we see how large and 
           muscular he’s grown. Jordan is petrified with fear. Bubbles 
           steps forward. Leans close and SNIFFS.

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        The Worm had wriggled his way 
                        inside the castle walls.

           Jordan drops the water balloon. It hits the ground and 
           wobbles, but does not break. 
           Bubbles picks it up. Holds it level to Jordan’s waist and 
           SQUEEZES. The balloon POPS, SPLASHING water all over Jordan’s 
           pants. 

           INT. NEVERLAND - ARCADE - NIGHT

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        In the coming days, The Worm’s 
                        presence became a constant.

           Children play video games in Michael’s two story arcade. 
           Michael stands next to Jordan, coaching him through a game of 
           Donkey Kong.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Watch out, Jordie. That gorilla is 
                        mean!

           Michael is approached by Corey Feldman -- now twenty-years-
           old, noticeably matured since last we saw him.

                                 COREY
                        Hey, Michael! Long time no see, 
                        man. How’s it hanging?

           Michael doesn’t even look up.

                                 COREY (CONT’D)
                        Man...this place is crazy! 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Yeah. Thanks.

                                 COREY
                        Dude, I tried calling you like a 
                        hundred times, bro. You never call 
                        me back. What’s up with that?

           Corey smiles, playing it off like he’s just giving his buddy 
           a little good-natured shit.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Guess I lost your number.

           Corey’s smile wilts and dies. Bubbles tries to offer him a 
           video game token, but Corey slinks off, deflated.  

           EXT. NEVERLAND - BUMPER CARS - NIGHT

           A helmeted Bubbles races around in a bumper car. Children 
           pilot several other cars, ZIPPING about.
           Bubbles spots Jordan in a car across the floor. He HITS the 
           accelerator, RACING toward him. Just as he is about to smash 
           his rival...

           BAM!

           Michael’s car T-bones him. Bubbles body recoils from the 
           impact. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Ha ha! Got you good, Bubbles!

           EXT. NEVERLAND - GO CART TRACK - NIGHT 

           Bubbles and Jordan poised at the starting line. They REV 
           their go cart motors, give each other their best intimidating 
           glances as they wait for the...

           GREEN LIGHT!

           Jordan hits the gas and ACCELERATES. Bubbles hits the gas 
           and...

           ...goes ZOOMING backward and SMASHES into a pile of tires. 
           Michael laughs and laughs.

           INT. NEVERLAND - MICHAEL’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Jordan and Michael are having a pillow fight on Michaels 
           giant bed. Jordan WHACKS Michael over the head.  

           Bubbles springs to his master’s defence. He leaps across the 
           room, somersaults to grab a big pillow and...

           ...CRACKS Jordan across the face, knocking him off the bed. 
           Bubbles HOOTS in victory.

                                 MICHAEL
                        That’s too rough, Bubbles!

           Michael goes to Jordan, who holds his hand over his mouth. 

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        Are you okay, Jordie? 

           Jordan’s hand comes away bloodied.

                                 JORDAN
                        It’s just a bloody lip.
                                 MICHAEL
                        Bubbles, you have to be gentle. 
                        That’s dangerous! You could hurt 
                        him.

           Bubbles stands defiant.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        If you can’t play nice, you have to 
                        leave. Go on, get out of here.

           Bubbles shoots Jordan a disdainful look then saunters out.

           EXT. NEVERLAND - TRAIN STATION - DAY

           Dozens of kids are gathered around as Michael hands out toys 
           and stuffed animals from the bed of a pick-up truck.

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        I determined I must once again win 
                        the favor of The King. Of late I 
                        had been working towards perfecting 
                        a more recent of his signature 
                        movements. 

           Bubbles scampers over and climbs on top of the truck cab.

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        As my previous effort had proven 
                        such a rousing success, there was 
                        no reason to imagine this addition 
                        to my repertoire would not be met 
                        with great praise.   

           Bubbles starts dancing on top of the truck. A kid below 
           laughs and points. Soon all eyes are on him. Michael turns 
           around to watch just as...

           ...Bubbles grabs his genitals in imitation of Michael’s 
           famous crotch yank move. But when Bubbles does it, it just 
           looks wrong. Obscene.   

                                 KID
                        The monkey is grabbing his wee wee!

           All the kids LAUGH. Bubbles redoubles his efforts - hopping 
           up and down, yanking on his dick.

                                 MICHAEL
                        No, Bubbles! Stop it! That’s nasty!

           Michael jabs his umbrella towards Bubbles. Bubbles jumps off 
           the truck. He runs away to the sound of laughter. Humiliated.
           EXT. NEVERLAND - AMUSEMENT PARK - NIGHT

           Michael and Jordan sit in the car of a Ferris wheel. As the 
           car reaches the apex of the ride, it slows to a a halt.

                                 MICHAEL
                        There are no rules in Neverland. 
                        Neverland is where you can be who 
                        you really are.

           Michael smiles at Jordan and then...

           SIZZLE....POP!

           Fireworks explode across the night sky and illuminate...

           BUBBLES

           ...who has stealthy ascended the Ferris wheel and now sits on 
           top of the car behind them. Murder in his eyes.

           EXT. NEVERLAND - MAIN RESIDENCE - NIGHT

           Bubbles sits on the roof just above Michael’s bedroom. He 
           listens to Michael and Jordan whisper and giggle through the 
           open window.

           Then Michael, clad in pajamas, shuts the window and draws the 
           curtains closed. Moments later, the light goes out.

           INT. NEVERLAND - KITCHEN - DAY

           Jordan is in the kitchen with his mother June, eating a bowl 
           of ice-cream. Bubbles has one, too. Watching Bubbles eat is 
           EVAN CHANDLER (48). He has slicked back hair and wears 
           aviator shades.

                                 EVAN
                        So he just lets this chimpanzee 
                        wander all over the house?

           Jordan nods. He finishes his ice-cream and picks up a Game 
           Boy.

                                 EVAN (CONT’D)
                        Does he sleep with him? Like in the 
                        same bed?

                                 JORDAN
                        Sometimes. But last night it was 
                        just me and Michael.
                                 EVAN
                        Wait -- what?

           Michael enters. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Hope these two didn’t eat all the 
                        ice-cream.

                                 JUNE
                        Hi, Michael. I want you to meet 
                        Evan. Jordan’s father.

           Evans smiles and extends his hand, though he still looks  
           shocked, confused. They shake.

                                 EVAN
                        Thought I should come say ‘hello’ 
                        to the man who is spending so much 
                        time with my son.

                                 MICHAEL
                        He’s great. So kind and sensitive. 
                        I feel like our relationship is 
                        cosmic.

           Michael ruffles Jordan’s hair. Evan notes it. A member of the 
           KITCHEN STAFF brings Michael a bowl of ice-cream. He sits 
           down next to Jordan and starts eating.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        So Jordie says you’re a dentist?

                                 EVAN
                        Screenwriter, actually. Although I 
                        do have a dental practice. Did some 
                        work recently on Carrie Fisher’s 
                        teeth. You know her? 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Princess Leia, right?

                                 EVAN
                        Great set of teeth. But like I 
                        said, these days I’m focusing on 
                        screenwriting. I’m more the 
                        creative type. Like you.

           Michael shovels a large scoop of ice-cream into his mouth.

                                 MICHAEL
                        That’s great. 
                             (to Jordan)
                        Help me finish this. 
           Jordan puts down his Game Boy, picks up his spoon. 

                                 EVAN
                        I wrote Robin Hood: Men in Tights.

           Michael whispers something to Jordan. Jordan giggles. Evan 
           looks on, suspicious, not liking this at all.

                                 JUNE
                        Evan, Michael is thinking of taking 
                        Jordie along on tour in Europe next 
                        fall. Wouldn’t that be amazing?

           Bubbles’ expression darkens. He eyes the unattended Game Boy.

                                 EVAN
                        What about school?

                                 JUNE
                        School will still be there when he 
                        gets back.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I love to visit the museums when 
                        I’m in Europe. I dress up as a 
                        little old man and go around in a 
                        wheelchair looking at the 
                        paintings. 

                                 JUNE
                             (to Evan)
                        See? It’ll be educational.

           Bubbles snatches the Game Boy and sneaks out of the room.

           EXT. NEVERLAND - POND - DAY

           Bubbles tosses the Game Boy into the water. 

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        If the Worm accompanied The King on 
                        his next crusade I was certain it 
                        would spell my ouster. 

           EXT. NEVERLAND - MAIN RESIDENCE - DAY

           Bubbles walks sadly back toward the house.

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        But what could I do to prevent such 
                        an eventuality? All my stratagems 
                        had thus far proven fruitless.

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        Perhaps I was simply unfit to be 
                        the future ruler.

           Just then Evan comes barreling out the front door with June 
           following close on his heels. Bubbles quickly ascends a tree 
           as they approach. 

                                 EVAN
                        My son is not going to Europe or 
                        anywhere else with that man, I’ll 
                        tell you that right now.

           Bubbles is intrigued.

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        It seemed that in my desperate hour 
                        I had been delivered an unexpected 
                        ally.

                                 JUNE
                        Oh, so now you’re just going to 
                        swoop back in to his life and start 
                        making the rules? 

                                 EVAN
                        You let him sleep in the same bed 
                        with an adult stranger? What kind 
                        of parent are you?

                                 JUNE
                        He’s not a stranger, he’s Michael 
                        Jackson! 

           Evan reaches his car. Opens the door.

                                 EVAN
                        I’m well aware of who and what he 
                        is. And you better believe I’m 
                        going to be exploring my options. 
                        You haven’t heard the last of this. 

           He jumps in his car and SLAMS the door. 

           INT. NEVERLAND - FOYER

           Michael talks on his Mickey Mouse phone. Bubbles dangles from 
           a chandelier above.

                                 MICHAEL
                             (on phone)
                        What? That’s crazy!
                                 JUNE (V.O.)
                        I know. I know. But Evan has filed 
                        for a modification of the custody 
                        agreement. My lawyer thinks we 
                        should comply for now.

                                 MICHAEL
                             (on phone)
                        If he can’t come here, I’ll just 
                        visit him there.

                                 JUNE (V.O.)
                        Actually, Evan requested that you 
                        not be allowed to see Jordie at 
                        all.

                                 MICHAEL
                             (on phone)
                        That’s just cruel. 

                                 JUNE (V.O.)
                        Michael, I don’t know what he has 
                        planned exactly, but I think you 
                        should get a lawyer.

                                 MICHAEL
                             (on phone)
                        Oh, I’ve got lawyers. Don’t you 
                        worry about that.

           INT. LIMO - MOVING - DAY

           Meet Michael’s legal team - dapper entertainment attorney 
           BERT FIELDS (64), thuggish private investigator ANTHONY 
           PELLICANO (49), and charismatic attorney JOHNNIE COCHRAN 
           (55). 

           Opposite them sit Michael and Bubbles, the latter drinking 
           orange juice from a sippy cup. 

           The car pulls up to the Westwood Marquis Hotel. 

                                 PELLICANO
                        We’re here.

           Michael takes the sippy cup from Bubbles’ hand.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Alright, Bubbles. Time to go 
                        inside.

           The lawyers exchange glances.
                                 FIELDS
                        I don’t think it’s a good idea to 
                        bring your, uh, friend along.

                                 MICHAEL
                        We want to make a show of strength. 
                        Bubbles is strong.

           Bubbles swells his chest with pride.

                                 FIELDS 
                        Right, right. But --

                                 JOHNNIE
                        Actually, I like it. This will show 
                        them exactly how seriously we take 
                        this whole clown show.

           Bert shrugs. Maybe Johnnie has a point.

           INT. MARQUIS HOTEL - CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Seated at large conference room are Evan and his lawyer  
           BARRY ROTHMAN (50s), a sleazeball. 

           As Michael and his team enter, Evan leaps from his chair, 
           comes around the table and hugs Michael like they’re old 
           pals.

                                 EVAN
                        Hey, Michael. Thanks for coming.

           Michael is too confused to say anything. His legal team look 
           equally puzzled. 

           Rothman offers his hand to Johnnie Cochran.

                                 ROTHMAN
                        Mr. Cochran.

           Cochran doesn’t take it. Rothman moves down the line.

                                 ROTHMAN (CONT’D)
                        Mr. Fields.

           Fields doesn’t take it either. Next up...

                                 ROTHMAN (CONT’D)
                        Anthony.

           ...who at least gives him a wise guy nod of acknowledgment.
           All parties take their seats. Rothman produces a letter from 
           his briefcase and slides it across the table.

                                 ROTHMAN (CONT’D)
                        This was written by a board 
                        certified psychiatrist after Mr. 
                        Chandler described to him - using 
                        no names, mind you - the nature of 
                        the relationship between Mr. 
                        Jackson and my client’s son, Jordan 
                        Chandler.

           Michael’s team refuse to even acknowledge the letter’s 
           presence. After a beat, Rothman picks it back up.

                                 ROTHMAN (CONT’D)
                        OK. I’ll help you. This medical 
                        professional is of the opinion 
                        that, and I’m quoting here, “A 
                        minor in this type of relationship 
                        is in a state of clear and present 
                        danger. An adult male sleeping with 
                        a young, unrelated child is not 
                        only perverse, but meets the legal 
                        definition of lewd conduct.”

           Evan dramatically whips off his sunglasses. There are tears 
           in his eyes, but he is otherwise a terrible actor.

                                 EVAN
                        You had sex with my son! How could 
                        you, Michael? How could you!

           Michael remains calm.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Evan, this is a big mistake.

                        occurred, and he knew the names of

           Cochran walks out first. Evan shoots out of his chair and 
           jabs an angry finger at Michael.

                                 EVAN
                        I will bury you! Your whole world

           Fields walks out next. Pellicano follows, giving a jack-off 
           gesture to Evan as he passes.

           Bubbles rises to follow, but sees Michael is still seated. He 
           looks stunned, stricken. Bubbles gently tugs his sleeve.

           At length Jackson rises, unsteady on his feet.

           INT. NEVERLAND - MICHAEL’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Bubbles wakes in his crib. Michael paces the room like a 
           caged animal.

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        The Worm had been vanquished, but 
                        there was no joy in my victory. 
                        Seeing The King brought so low 
                        caused me only sorrow.

           EXT. NEVERLAND - AMUSEMENT PARK - DAY

           Neverland is empty. Bubbles watches as Michael rides the 
           carousel alone. 

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        I believed the passing of time 
                        would heal his wounded heart, but 
                        instead it only fed his mounting 
                        disconsolation, and thus, my own.

           NIGHT

           Michael still on the ride, going around and around.
                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        Guilt gnawed at me. Had I elevated 
                        my own contentment above that of my 
                        sovereign? Had the envy provoked by 
                        the Worm rendered me disloyal to 
                        the crown? Or was I just attempting 
                        to preserve the kingdom by 
                        shielding The King from his own 
                        worst impulses? Such questions met 
                        no easy answers, and more questions 
                        were soon to come.  

           EXT. NEVERLAND - DAY 

           It’s a beautiful summer morning. Bubbles sits in a tree 
           enjoying a cool breeze and an apple when he sees...

           ...flashing lights on the horizon. As they reach the gates, 
           he sees they belong to two POLICE CARS leading a procession 
           of white VANS. 

           Bubbles watches, concerned, as one of the cars pulls up to 
           the gatehouse. A policeman rolls down the window and hands 
           Billy Bray a warrant.

           The Neverland gates open and the vehicles enter. Bubbles 
           leaps from the tree, and hurries toward the house.

           INT. NEVERLAND - MICHAEL’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Bubbles bursts in and races to the upper loft, where he finds 
           Michael is not in his bed. And then he remembers...

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        The King, despite his weakened 
                        condition, had embarked on a 
                        crusade. The cunning invaders had 
                        timed their attack to coincide with 
                        his absence.

           INT. NEVERLAND - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Bubbles sits on the bench of the grand piano, watching POLICE 
           OFFICERS file into the room carrying arm loads of empty 
           cardboard boxes.

           INT. NEVERLAND - STUDY - DAY

           Bubbles watches as a POLICE TECH drills into a large safe in 
           the corner of the study. 
           INT. NEVERLAND - FOYER - DAY

           Bubbles looks down from the landing above as police file out 
           with boxes of videotapes, notebooks, scrapbooks, address 
           books, pictures, audio recordings. Garbage bags filled with 
           with clothes, bed sheets, towels.  

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        They ransacked the castle entire, 
                        leaving no stone unturned in 
                        pursuit of The King’s riches and 
                        not absconding with their plunder 
                        until several hours later.  

           EXT. NEVERLAND - MAIN RESIDENCE - NIGHT

           Bubbles sits on the roof, watching as the police load their 
           vehicles and begin filing out.

           Beyond the Neverland gates, he can now see NEWS VANS parked 
           on the adjacent street. 

           Then he hears a HELICOPTER approach. The chopper’s spotlight 
           shines down on Bubbles, frightening him. He scurries down a 
           rain gutter on the side of the house.

           INT. NEVERLAND - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           All members of the STAFF -- cooks, maids, security -- stand 
           in the kitchen, gathered around a small TV as Bubbles enters. 

           ON TV

           ...the Jackson family (with the notable exception of La Toya) 
           hold a press conference. Katherine Jackson reads from a 
           prepared statement as the rest look on, grim-faced. 

           A crawl at the bottom of the screen reads: “POLICE RAID 
           MICHAEL JACKSON’S HOME” 

                                 KATHERINE (V.O.)
                        Michael has been made a victim of a 
                        cruel and obvious attempt to take 
                        advantage of his fame and success. 
                        We know, as does the whole world, 
                        that he has dedicated his life to 
                        providing happiness for young 
                        people everywhere. We are confident 
                        that his dignity and humanity will 
                        prevail.
           Flashbulbs POP, shutters WHIR. 

           INT. NEVERLAND - VARIOUS - NIGHT

           Michael wanders through the rooms of his home late at night, 
           talking to himself...

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        When The King returned from his 
                        crusade, he arrived a much 
                        diminished figure. Despite the 
                        turmoil facing the kingdom... 

           Michael occasionally stops to argue with the many lifelike 
           mannequins posed throughout his house.

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        ...his chief occupations were 
                        debating the statuary and... 

           INT. NEVERLAND - MASTER BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Bubbles watches as Michael washes down a handful of pills, 
           shielding his eyes from his own reflection in the mirror. 
           He’s so high he can barely stand up.

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        ...administering nostrums at such 
                        an accelerated pace that...

           INT. NEVERLAND - MICHAEL’S BEDROOM

           Michael lays passed out on the floor. Bubbles plays with an 
           empty pill bottle.

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        ...they sometimes left him for 
                        hours in death-like repose.

           Elizabeth Taylor enters.

                                 ELIZABETH
                        I know you’re in here. Now come on 
                        out and tell me why you’ve been 
                        avoiding my calls.

           Then she sees Michal passed out on the floor. Sees Bubbles 
           playing with the pill bottle. With a rising sense of panic, 
           she holds out her hand to Bubbles.
                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        Can I see that?

           Bubbles hands it to her. She looks at the label, relieved.

                                 ELIZABETH (CONT’D)
                        Pfft. Lightweight.

           Elizabeth spies the Super Soaker squirt gun in the corner. 
           She retrieves it, aims, and SPRAYS Michael in the face. 

           He wakes, annoyed. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Go away.

                                 ELIZABETH

                        minutes.

           INT. NEVERLAND - DINING ROOM - DAY

           Elizabeth Taylor sits next to Michael, holding his hand. On 
           the other side of the table are Cochran and Fields. Bubbles 
           lingers nearby.

                        You need to put this behind you, 
                        Michael. It’s killing you.

           Michael stands. Paces the room, thinking, trying to calm his 
           mounting anger. And then...

                                 MICHAEL
                        No. 

           Michael’s voice is suddenly, masculine, deep. The legal team 
           exchange glances -- they’ve never heard him speak like this. 

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        If I settle, everyone will think I 
                        did these terrible things. 

                                 COCHRAN
                        Any settlement will include 
                        language denying any wrongful--

                                 MICHAEL
                        They’ll think I’m guilty, anyway. 
                        All my fans around the world. 
                        Everything I’ve done or ever will 
                        do will be seen as the work of a 
                        man -- a monster -- who takes 
                        advantage of children. The media 
                        will turn me into a boogeyman. And 
                        this place, Neverland, they’ll say 
                        I created this whole magical, 
                        wonderful place just to lure 
                        children in. Like it’s some giant 
                        spiderweb.   
                                 FIELDS
                        They’re saying these things 
                        already. And the longer this goes 
                        on, the more chances they have to 
                        say it.

                                 MICHAEL
                        I pay Evan Chandler, all the 
                        wicked, conniving parents of every 
                        kid who ever stepped foot in 
                        Neverland are going to be thinking 
                        they just won the lottery. I’m not 
                        giving him or anyone else my hard-
                        earned money.

                                 COCHRAN
                        It’s not really your money.

                                 MICHAEL
                        What do you mean it’s not my money?

                                 COCHRAN
                        Your insurance company is prepared 
                        to pay a liability settlement. But 
                        if you go to court and lose? Then 
                        you’ll be deemed negligent, and 
                        that they won’t cover. That money 
                        will be yours. 

           Michael slumps into a chair. Ponders the whole mess.

           INT. NEVERLAND - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           A drugged Michael wanders into the kitchen, skin bleaching 
           cream covering his face. He opens the fridge to get a glass 
           of milk. Someone has left the small TV on. 

           ON TV

           MTV News plays a news item under the banner “La Toya Speaks 
           Out.” She looks just as chemically zonked as Michael.

                                 LA TOYA (V.O.)
                        Michael is my brother and I love 
                        him a great deal. But I cannot, and 
                        will not, be a silent collaborator 
                        to his crimes. I have seen checks 
                        payable to the parents of these 
                        children. My mother has shown me 
                        these checks, and they were for a 
                        great amount...
           BACK TO SCENE

           Bubbles enters. Sees tears streaming down Michael’s face. He 
           approaches. Climbs up on the counter, tries to initiate their 
           finger-touch ritual. 

           But Michael just stares off into space.

           INT. NEVERLAND - HALLWAY - DAY

           Johnnie Cochran and Billy Bray stand outside Michael’s room, 
           looking unhappy. Bubbles lingers some distance behind them.

                                 COCHRAN
                        How long has it been?

                                 BILLY
                        An hour.

           Cochran grimaces and KNOCKS on the door.

                                 COCHRAN
                        Come on out, Michael. Let’s just 
                        get this over with.

                                 MICHAEL (O.S.)
                        Don’t make me go down there. 
                        Please.

                                 COCHRAN
                        They have a court order. Our hands 
                        are tied.

           A moment later the door opens and an anguished, sickly 
           looking Michael emerges wearing a bathrobe. Billy shoos 
           Bubbles away.

                                 BILLY
                        Go outside and play or something.

           EXT. NEVERLAND - BACK YARD

           Bubbles chases a butterfly in the backyard. Then he sees a 
           FLASH coming from the living room window. Curious, he sneaks 
           over and peaks inside where he sees...

           MICHAEL

           ...standing on a raised platform in the living room, naked. A 
           police PHOTOGRAPHER points his camera. More flashes go off.
                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        The invaders had returned, this 
                        time bearing instruments of 
                        torture, which they purposed 
                        mercilessly against The King. 

           Michael turns and Bubbles sees the utterly humiliated look on 
           his face. Bubbles can’t watch any longer. He backs away from 
           the window in dismay.

           INT. NEVERLAND - FOYER - NIGHT

           Michael lumbers down the stairs, still wearing his bathrobe. 
           Impossible to tell how much time has past since last we saw 
           him. He looks completely defeated, a broken man.

           Bubbles watches from the study as Michael picks up a phone, 
           dials.

                                 MICHAEL
                        It’s over. They win. I’ll pay.

           EXT. NEVERLAND - GAZEBO - DAY

           Bubbles sits in the gazebo, overlooking the house and the 
           valley below. It’s peaceful, gorgeous.

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        If there was a silver lining to the 
                        tempestuous clouds that had so long 
                        shadowed the kingdom, it was the 
                        absence of the guttersnipes. I 
                        dared then imagine a life of 
                        tranquility, one free from their 
                        obstreperous ways. Began to hope 
                        that this peace now glimpsed upon 
                        would settle over the kingdom for 
                        good.

           In the distance, Bubbles sees the gates of Neverland parting 
           to admit...

           SCHOOL BUSES

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        But hope so often serves only to 
                        prolong our torments.
           EXT. NEVERLAND - MAIN RESIDENCE - DAY

           Michael hands out lollipops to all the boys and girls. 

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        The King had learned nothing.

           Bubbles wants one, too...but by the time he reaches Michael, 
           all the lollipops are gone. 

           EXT. NEVERLAND - AMUSEMENT PARK - DAY

           Bubbles glowers as Michael leads a delegation of kids down a 
           path toward the amusement park. There is a manic quality to 
           his movements.

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        He was as some mad Pied Piper, 
                        determined not to drive the snakes 
                        away but lead them instead to the 
                        very heart of his kingdom. 

           Michael laughs a little too brightly as he rides atop a 
           carousel horse with all his noisy little friends.

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        Determined to lower the drawbridge 
                        for these pint-sized Trojan horses 
                        and let them carry him away in a 
                        stampede of frivolity.  

           A hungry Bubbles picks up a discarded lollipop. CRUNCHES the 
           candy between his teeth.

           INT. NEVERLAND - MOVIE THEATRE - DAY

           Michael sits front and center in his packed theatre, 
           shoveling popcorn into his mouth and watching “Dennis the 
           Menace” (1993).  

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        I knew then no ordeal would change 
                        him. 

           Bubbles reaches for the popcorn. Michael pulls it away.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Get your own. You know where it is.
           INT. NEVERLAND - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           A bunch of kids are finishing eating ice-cream. Bubbles looks 
           on, hungry, jealous, more angry by the second. 

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        No brush with ignominy, no 
                        humiliation, no torture, no trial, 
                        no punishment.  

           He again approaches Michael, tugs on his sleeve. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        Not now.
                             (to the gathered kids)
                        Who wants to have a slumber party?

           The kids CHEER their approval.

           INT. NEVERLAND - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Bubbles stands just outside the opened door of Michael’s 
           bedroom, watching all the kids in pajamas enjoying a massive 
           pillow fight. Down feathers from ripped pillows drift through 
           the air like falling snow. 

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        He had waded so far into a sea of 
                        infamy that returning was as 
                        tedious as continuing to the other 
                        side. 

           Michael shuts the door in Bubbles’ face.

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        But that did not mean that I had to 
                        stand by and idly watch. 

           INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Michael, alone, pours himself a glass of white wine. He corks 
           the bottle, puts the bottle back in the cabinet and turns to 
           see... 

           BUBBLES

           ...hunched on the counter. Watching.

                                 MICHAEL
                        Get down, Bubbles. You’re not 
                        supposed to be up there.
           As if to give him one last chance, Bubbles rubs his own 
           stomach. Points to the freezer.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        You can have ice-cream tomorrow. 
                        Now get down from there.

           Instead, Bubbles rises to his full height. Steps forward. 
           Michael looks a little frightened now. He uses his seldom-
           heard masculine voice...

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        Down!

           And that’s when Bubbles SCREAMS and...

           ...SPRINGS from the counter with terrifying speed and 
           delivers a powerful KICK to Michael’s chest with both feet at 
           once. 

           Michael tumbles backward, his wine glass SHATTERING to the 
           floor. He struggles to his feet, tries to back away.

           Bubbles LEAPS, grabs Michael’s hair in one hand and HURLS him 
           into...

           INT. NEVERLAND - LIVING ROOM (CONTINUOUS)

           ...where Bubbles instantly seizes him again, raises Michael 
           over his head like a rag doll and...  

           ...SLAMS him down on top of the grand piano, sending photos 
           CLATTERING to the floor.   

           Michael rolls off the piano and HITS the ground. He makes a 
           feeble attempt to rise but Bubbles swings a fist into his 
           face... 

           ...BREAKING Michael’s nose pretty much off. Michael HOWLS in 
           pain as Bubbles grabs a ceramic statue of Peter Pan. 

           Bubbles raises it above his head, prepared to bring it 
           smashing down on Michael in what will surely be a fatal 
           blow...

                                 MICHAEL
                        Please, Bubbles. No...

           Bubbles bares his fangs. Tightens his grip on the statue... 

           ...then spots a painting hanging on the far wall - it’s a 
           self-aggrandizing oil portrait of Michael dressed as a king, 
           sitting upon a throne.
           Bubbles wavers and then...HURLS the statue at the painting. 

           Michael moans feebly from the floor. All at once Bubbles 
           realizes what he has done. A wave of guilt washes over him. 
           He goes on all fours, cowering in shame as he slinks out of 
           the destroyed room. 

                                                               FADE TO:

           EXT. NEVERLAND - DAY

           An ANIMAL CONTROL AGENT from Santa Barbara County loads a 
           tranquilizer dart into the breech of his rifle. He raises his 
           weapon.

           THROUGH THE RIFLE SCOPE

           He sees Bubbles calmly sitting in a tree, looking right at 
           him. The crosshairs wander as the agent tries to steady his 
           aim. 

                                 MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        There’s no need for that.

           BACK TO SCENE

           The agent lowers his weapon. We see the voice belongs to Bob 
           Dunn. Bob walks toward the tree.

                                 BOB
                        Come on down. It’s time to leave.

           Bubbles scurries from the tree. He calmly walks across the 
           yard to the driveway where Bob’s truck is parked. 

           There’s a cage in the back. Bubbles hops into the truck bed, 
           then climbs into the cage and shuts the door behind him.

           INT. BOB’S TRUCK - MOVING - DAY 

           Bubbles watches out the back, bittersweet as the gates of 
           Neverland close and recede into the distance.

                                                               FADE TO:

           EXT. BOB’S RANCH - DAY   

           Bob leads Bubbles by the hand past rows of cages. Bob has 
           clearly expanded his business, and now houses a variety of 
           birds, dogs, reptiles, and chimpanzees. 
           He leads Bubbles to a cage and opens the door. But this cage 
           isn’t empty -- inside is his old friend, Daisy. As Bubbles 
           moves inside...

                                 BUBBLES
                             (signing)
                        Hello, good lady Daisy.

                                 DAISY
                        I knowed you would come back, yo.

           Bubbles nods. Mixed emotions.

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        Perhaps in my inmost heart, I knew 
                        so, too.

           Bob Dunn closes the cage door. Locks it. 

           EXT. BOB’S RANCH - DAY

           CU on Bubbles’ eyes as he watches the sunset. 

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        And I knew my great adventure with 
                        The King had come to an end. I had 
                        crossed a boundary beyond which 
                        there was no return. With little 
                        else now to occupy my mind, one 
                        might think I spent my days 
                        reminiscing about life in the 
                        castle, replaying all those events 
                        over and over again if hoping the 
                        very act of recollection would 
                        render their outcomes more 
                        favorable. 

           PULL BACK TO REVEAL Daisy happily picking nits from Bubbles’ 
           back. 

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        But I had no desire to suffer 
                        twice, once in reality and once in 
                        retrospect. What was done was done.
           PULL BACK FURTHER to reveal all the animals at Bob’s Ranch 
           behind the bars of their respective cages.

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        My heart still did beat. I had food 
                        and water. There was light enough 
                        to see and air enough to breathe. I 
                        had the friendship of Daisy, who, 
                        though she would never spark a 
                        tempest in my soul, proved a good 
                        and reliable companion.

           And then Daisy FADES OUT of the picture.

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        Alas, time’s winged chariot raced 
                        ever onward and the disadvantages 
                        of Daisy’s youth were too great for 
                        her hearty spirit to overleap. She 
                        succumbed to an early, though 
                        easeful death.   

           Other animals start FADING OUT - chimps, gorillas, dogs, etc. 

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        And then our community began 
                        disappearing, little by little. 
                        Some shuffling off to their great 
                        reward, or simply being led out of 
                        their cages one day by the Bearded 
                        Prophet never to return. Their 
                        homes stood empty for a time...

           And now the empty cages themselves begin to FADE OUT. 

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        ...but soon, they, too, were taken 
                        away. Only myself and a few others 
                        of my ilk remained constant. 

           Two chimpanzees and a ragged tiger look out from their cages.

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        But I knew that constancy was an 
                        illusion. That one night my eyes 
                        would close, never to open again.

           The sun has dropped now and its almost completely dark as 
           Bubbles slowly closes his eyes. 

                                                               FADE TO:
           EXT. BOB’S RANCH - DAY

           Bob -- now gray haired and worn out -- leads Laura (we met 
           her way back on page 2) towards the cages holding Bubbles and 
           the remainder of the chimpanzees. 

                                 BOB
                        I found homes for most of the 
                        little guys, but placing these 
                        older ones has been tricky.

                                 LAURA
                        Why are you closing up shop, 
                        anyway?

                                 BOB
                        No market. People don’t need real 
                        animals in their movies now. They 
                        just make them on a computer. 
                        Besides... 

           They reach Bubbles’ cage. Bob eyes him sadly. 

                                 BOB (CONT’D)
                        I don’t know. I guess it’s just 
                        time to move on.

           Laura leans over. Looks in the cage. Smiles at Bubbles.

                                 LAURA
                        Hi, Bubbles. How would you like to 
                        come live with me in Florida?

           INT. BUBBLES’ CAGE - DAY

           Bubbles draws patterns in the dusty floor of his cage. 

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        But while travel arrangements were 
                        being completed, I did receive one 
                        final visitor.  

           He hears approaching footsteps and looks up to see...

           A little girl wearing a strange, feathered MASK. This is 
           PARIS JACKSON (7).  

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        Or should I say ‘visitors.’

           A boy in a similar mask runs up and stands next to Paris. 
           This is PRINCE JACKSON (8). 
                                 PRINCE
                        Daddy, is this him?

           Bubbles rises slowly to his feet, anxious as...

           Michael comes into view. He’s older, paler, thinner, his 
           reconstructed nose like that of Peter Pan. He pushes a 
           stroller with a blanket draped over it. The legs of PRINCE 
           “BLANKET” MICHAEL JACKSON THE SECOND (2) stick out. 

                                 MICHAEL
                        How you doing, Bubbles?

           Bubbles stands frozen in disbelief.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        I wanted my children to meet you 
                        before you went to your new home. 
                        I’ve told them a lot about you. All 
                        the fun we had back in the day. 

           He puts a hand on his daughter’s shoulder.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        This is Paris.

           And then pats the head of his eldest son.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        And this is Prince. The little one 
                        in the stroller here, he’s Prince 
                        Michael Jackson the Second. But we 
                        just call him “Blanket.”

           Bubbles struggles to control his emotions. Paris turns her 
           head, points off to another cage. 

                                 PARIS
                        Is that a tiger?

                                 PRINCE
                        Can we go and look at it?

                                 MICHAEL
                        Sure. Take Blanket with you.

           Paris takes the stroller and the children move out of frame. 
           Now it’s only Michael and Bubbles. Alone again together after 
           all these years. Neither can maintain eye contact.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        I want you to know...I’m sorry. It 
                        was a crazy time. But I should have 
                        been better to you.
           Bubbles blinks. Rubs his nose. His hands shake. He SNIFFS.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        Well, I should go. Before Paris 
                        feeds Blanket to that tiger. 

           Bubbles nods.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        But if I’m ever in Florida...on 
                        tour or whatever...maybe I’ll stop 
                        by, see how you’re doing. Would 
                        that be okay?

           Bubbles SNORTS. Looks away. Looks back. Looks away.

                                 MICHAEL (CONT’D)
                        Well, I guess this is goodbye. You 
                        take care, Bubbles.

           Michael turns to walk away. He takes three steps before 
           Bubbles emits a lone HOOT.

           Michael turns back around. Bubbles walks to the front of his 
           enclosure. He wriggles his hand through the bars. Extends his 
           pointer finger toward Michael.

           Michael removes his sunglasses. He walks back to the cage. 
           Kneels. Reaches one hand toward Bubbles pointer finger 
           extended until...

           Their fingers touch. 

                                                               FADE TO:

           EXT. APE SANCTUARY - DAY

           SUPER: Center for Great Apes - Wachula, Florida - Present Day

           Bubbles turns away as Laura continues giving Dr. Arnold Omar 
           the tour.

                                 LAURA
                        This is another one of our chimp 
                        habitats. We have seven adults in 
                        this dome, plus the two youngsters 
                        you see over there...  

           Her voice trails off as Bubbles walks away. 
                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        No, it was not the King. I have not 
                        seen him since leaving the Bearded 
                        Prophet. But one day, he shall 
                        come.  

           Bubbles passes the wrestling young chimps.

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        It will be difficult to abdicate my 
                        throne, to leave this modest 
                        kingdom to which I have grown 
                        accustomed to ruling. My subjects 
                        are as faithful and true as any 
                        king could wish for, and have 
                        treated me well. In turn, I hope I 
                        have proven a wise and capable 
                        leader over these many years.

           Bubbles ascends the wooden jungle gym. Takes up his perch. 
           His throne. Looks down upon his domain.

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        But if he asks me to serve, I shall 
                        again answer his call. Because 
                        though there are many rulers, and 
                        many realms, there is no king like 
                        my king. 

           Bubbles gazes out over the treetops to the greater world 
           beyond.

                                 BUBBLES (V.O.)
                        And so I await the return of the 
                        once and future king, the greatest 
                        king the world has ever known. This 
                        time nothing shall come between us. 
                        This time no cage shall be strong 
                        enough to hold us back. This time, 
                        together, we shall conquer all.  

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.
