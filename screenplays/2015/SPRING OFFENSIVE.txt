           INT. LIZ’S APARTMENT - NIGHT (MARCH 2010)

           DR. LIZ SCOTT, an attractive and resourceful British woman in 
           her mid 40s, drops her suitcase at the front door of her 
           modern apartment. She looks tired, with bags under her eyes 
           and rumpled clothes. 

           There is a pile of mail sprawled on the ground. She picks it 
           up and puts in on the counter. 

           Liz goes to the fridge and opens it. She takes out the milk 
           container like it is radioactive and looks at the sell by 
           date, which is early January. She throws it out. She rummages 
           through the fridge. There is nothing edible. She eyes the 
           wine rack. 

           INT. LIZ’S APARTMENT - LATER

           Liz is eating Chinese food and drinking a glass of wine. She 
           is on the phone. 

                                 LIZ
                        I’m coming over this week. I 
                        promise. I can’t wait. Can you make 
                        the salmon?...I know I’m not in the 
                        position to make demands.

           Liz takes another big sip of wine. Laughs.

                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                        This week I promise. Please don’t 
                        excommunicate me from your dinner 
                        parties.

           INT. LIZ’S APARTMENT - MORNING

           Liz is lying in bed, it is 5:45 AM. Her phone rings. She 
           wakes slowly. She looks at the message:

           From: Helene Lund

           URGENT meeting at 8:00 AM.

           INT LIZ’S APARTMENT - LATER

           The clock says 8:15 AM.

           Liz rummages through an unpacked suitcase for her toothbrush. 
           On her way to the bathroom she knocks over the stack of 
           untouched mail on the table. 
                                 LIZ
                        Shit.

           Liz starts brushing her teeth while sorting mail into two 
           piles.

           EXT. GENEVA/WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION  - DAY

           Liz bikes through downtown Geneva, the picturesque and clean 
           beacon of central European prosperity. She rides up to The 
           World Health Organization - an imposing grey glass structure 
           that stands atop a never ending field of perfectly manicured 
           green grass.

           INT. WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION - CONTINUOUS

           Inside the impressive WHO building Liz is looking for her 
           I.D. pass when she is met by JURGEN SCHNEIDER, a stern 
           looking Swiss-German in his 50s. He waves her through 
           security. 

                                 JURGEN SCHNEIDER
                        You are late. 

                                 LIZ
                        I arrived back at half past nine 
                        last night.

           They walk through the sterile hallways of the WHO with 
           purpose.

                                 JURGEN SCHNEIDER
                        There is an outbreak in Afghanistan-

                                 LIZ
                        Why isn’t the Cairo office-

                                 JURGEN SCHNEIDER
                        We are taking the lead. 

           INT. WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

           The two get on a packed elevator of business suit clad 
           workers. Dr. Scott’s bike-wear stands out. Jürgen is looking 
           through a file.

                                 LIZ
                        Can I change before we see Helene? 
                                 JURGEN SCHNEIDER
                        Reports from Helmand are that 
                        patients experienced hemorrhaging 
                        from the eyes, ears, nose, mouth, 
                        and rectum before death. The first 
                        symptoms presented around 10 days 
                        ago.

                                 LIZ
                        No then.

           Elevator dings onto floor six. Jürgen and Dr. Scott exit. 

           INT. WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION 6TH FLOOR HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Liz takes the file from Jürgen. Her forthrightness makes him 
           bristle. She scans it as they walk down the hallway. 

                                 LIZ
                        Initial symptoms are fever, 
                        myalgia, vomiting, extreme 
                        diarrhea, chest pain, cough, 
                        pharyngitis, photophobia, 
                        lymphadenopathy which leads to 
                        wasting, petechiae, hemorrhaging, 
                        ecchymosis resulting in multi-organ 
                        dysfunction, liver failure and 
                        ultimately death.

           Liz looks through pictures of Afghan men with blood soaked 
           mouths and hemorrhaging blisters. 

                                 JURGEN SCHNEIDER
                        That is why Dr. Lund wanted you 
                        here at 8 sharp.

                                 LIZ
                        It has been confined to the 
                        intravenous drug population there? 
                        Could it be the results of bad 
                        heroin?

                                 JURGEN SCHNEIDER
                        Unlikely. 

           Liz looks at a map of Afghanistan. Helmand is highlighted: an 
           arrowhead sliver in the South of the country with Lashkar 
           Gah, its capital, in the centre. 

                                 LIZ
                        The symptoms don’t sound like 
                        diseases endemic to the region. 
                                 JURGEN SCHNEIDER
                        No.

           They come up to a large office. A SECRETARY lets them right 
           in.

           INT. DIRECTOR’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           The two enter the office of DR. HELENE LUND, a Danish doctor 
           roughly the same age as Dr. Scott. 

                                 HELENE LUND
                        You’re late. 

           Liz and Helene kiss each other on the cheek. These old 
           friends and their approach to each other stands in stark 
           contrast to the formality of their interactions with Jürgen.  

                                 LIZ
                        If it was urgent we could have met 
                        at mine. 

           Helene takes Liz to a conference table overlooking the WHO’s 
           perfectly manicured grass. 

                                 HELENE LUND
                        You could have grabbed a cab, or we 
                        could have sent a car.

                                 LIZ
                        A cab on my salary?

           Helene presses a button which projects an image of a man in 
           bed surrounded by doctors in hazmat suits.

                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                        The Boost hospital?

           Helene nods.

                                 HELENE LUND
                        It is the only functional hospital 
                        in Helmand for a population of 
                        around a million...and we can 
                        organize cab money in your next 
                        contract review. 

                                 LIZ
                        That’s assuming I can take another 
                        twenty years with the Swiss. 
                        Present company excluded Jürgen. 

           Helene laughs. 
                                 JURGEN SCHNEIDER
                        I have briefed Dr. Scott. 
                        Preliminarily. And -

           Helene flashes another set of images up of hemorrhaging 
           wounds and wasted bodies.

                                 HELENE LUND
                        This is looking bad. We need you 
                        there.

                                 LIZ
                        I just got back from six months in 
                        India dealing with TB. I haven’t 
                        even unpacked.

                                 HELENE LUND
                        Then you don’t have to pack.

           Liz laughs.

                                 HELENE LUND (CONT’D)
                        You will be coordinating with the 
                        CDC. Your number two will be Dr. 
                        Malik Bencharif who has been our 
                        man in Helmand for the last year. 
                        Also a young Swede from our office, 
                        Dr. Karin Andersson. I have the 
                        utmost confidence in your team. 

                                 LIZ
                        Well, as always, your confidence 
                        means a great deal.

           Helene laughs and rolls her eyes.

                                 HELENE LUND
                        Karin’s a little green, but don’t 
                        go easy on her, we need to toughen 
                        her up.

                                 LIZ
                        Are we too important now to train 
                        our own protégés? 

                                 HELENE LUND
                        This is a conflict zone so 
                        containment protocol is different.

                                 LIZ
                        I am aware.
           Helene hands her another large folder. Helene splashes 
           security protocol in all its boring, minute, and bureaucratic 
           beauty on the projection screen.

                                 HELENE LUND
                        Be more aware.

                                 LIZ
                        Right. 

                                 HELENE LUND
                        Containment is first priority, but 
                        we need to know what this thing is 
                        and how it got there. Samples have 
                        been sent to the Pasteur Institute 
                        for genetic sequencing, but that 
                        will take a few weeks. I don’t have 
                        to tell you how unstable the region 
                        is, but an outbreak originating 
                        from a war zone-

                                 LIZ
                        Could lead to the big one.

                                 HELENE LUND
                        Exactly. Contain. Figure out what 
                        this is, and where it came from. 

                                 LIZ
                        I do remember how to do my job. 
                        Anything else?

                                 JURGEN SCHNEIDER
                        The security detail.

           Helene’s interactive map of Helmand shows the military bases 
           and in circles the presence of American, British, Danish, 
           Georgian, Bahraini, and Estonian troops marked by their 
           respective flags. 

                                 HELENE LUND
                        You will have a British forces 
                        security detail. Any issues with 
                        NATO, if they give you any trouble, 
                        let us know. This is a joint 
                        effort. We are here to support you.

                                 LIZ
                        Institutional support, the two most 
                        dreaded words in the English 
                        language.

           Helene smiles. She motions for Jürgen to leave them alone.
                                 HELENE LUND
                        Liz I wouldn’t ask you if we didn’t 
                        need the best.

                                 LIZ
                        I thought I made my position clear. 
                        I’ve been in the field for twenty 
                        years. Last year I spent six weeks 
                        at home.

                                 HELENE LUND
                        Because you’re the best. 

                                 LIZ
                        I’m forty six. I can’t keep putting 
                        my life on hold -

                                 HELENE LUND
                        You seeing anyone?

                                 LIZ
                        Jealous?

                                 HELENE LUND
                        Always.

                                 LIZ
                        How could I possibly be in a 
                        relationship when I can’t even 
                        unpack.

           Helene puts her hand on Liz’s.

                                 HELENE LUND
                        Nothing was as fulfilling as field 
                        work.

                                 LIZ
                        You could always go back.

                                 HELENE LUND
                        There is no going back.

           Liz takes away her hand. 

                                 LIZ
                        We’ll contain this thing. Save the 
                        world, then I want an office with a 
                        fucking view like this.

                                 HELENE LUND
                        Ok.
           INT. GENEVA AIRPORT - NIGHT

           Dr. Scott is intensely reviewing a large packet of documents 
           in a clean and modern departure lounge. DR. KARIN ANDERSSON, 
           a strikingly beautiful young woman, approaches Liz 
           tentatively.

                                 LIZ
                        Dr. Andersson? 

                                 KARIN ANDERSSON
                        It is such an honour Dr. Scott. We 
                        studied your field work in the ‘94 
                        DRC cholera outbreak at university.

           Dr. Scott takes her in and goes back to looking at her case 
           notes.

                                 LIZ
                        Your looks are going to work 
                        against you. In Afghanistan doubly 
                        so.

           Karin awkwardly stands trying to find something to say.

                                 KARIN ANDERSSON
                        I assure you I am qualified.

                                 LIZ
                        No one knows if they are qualified 
                        to deal with an epidemic before 
                        they have faced one. Your degrees 
                        and glowing references mean nothing 
                        on the ground. 

           Karin does not know what to say.

                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                        I have narrowed the list of 
                        possible diagnoses to falciparum 
                        malaria, typhoid fever, 
                        shigellosis, typhus, cholera, gram-
                        negative septicemia, borreliosis, 
                        relapsing fever, EHEC enteritis, 
                        leptospirosis, scrub typhus, 
                        plague, Q fever, candidiasis, 
                        histoplasmosis, trypanosomiasis, 
                        visceral leishmaniasis, hemorrhagic 
                        smallpox, measles, and fulminant 
                        viral hepatitis. Clinically it 
                        could also be snake envenomation or 
                        warfarin intoxication.
                                 KARIN ANDERSSON
                        None of the patients have reported 
                        snake bites, and even if one had 
                        bit - 

                                 LIZ
                             (annoyed)
                        It is not the snake. Twelve people 
                        are dead in ten days. The first 
                        reported death was two days ago. 
                        There is one symptomatic person out 
                        of thirteen still alive. What does 
                        it sound like? 

                                 KARIN ANDERSSON
                        Ebola. But that is not on your 
                        list.

                                 LIZ
                        It is. I just wanted to know what 
                        type of doctor we were sending into 
                        a war zone with no previous 
                        experience: one who would pick from 
                        a list or an epidemiologist. 

                                 KARIN ANDERSSON
                        Do you think it’s Ebola?

                                 LIZ
                        It could be anything. If we’re 
                        really unlucky it’s a whole new 
                        disease with a pathology we have no 
                        understanding of.

                                 KARIN ANDERSSON
                        Ebola is endemic to Sub-Saharan 
                        Africa. 

                                 LIZ
                        The ‘91 Peruvian cholera outbreak 
                        was brought over by a commercial 
                        Chinese ship. Communicable diseases 
                        don’t respect borders. Also Dr. 
                        Wolf from the CDC is bringing along 
                        an Ebola specialist, so it looks 
                        like he has the same theory.

           Karin is pleased with herself.

                                 KARIN ANDERSSON
                        Great.

                                 LIZ
                        Not for Lashkar Gah. 
           INT. AIR INDIA FLIGHT - NIGHT

           The plane is experiencing intense turbulence. Liz is buried 
           deep into the case files while Karin is white knuckling her 
           seat. Liz looks over momentarily and then continues reading 
           the files, slightly annoyed by Karin’s timidity. 

           The plane drops 10 feet and Liz hardly reacts, but Karin 
           almost has a panic attack. 

                                 KARIN ANDERSSON
                             (Swedish)
                        Vad i helvete?

                                 LIZ
                        You should use this time to either 
                        work or to rest up, you can’t waste 
                        13 hours.

                                 KARIN ANDERSSON
                        I’ll try...

           She puts her head down. 

                                 LIZ
                        Do you have lorazopam? 

                                 KARIN ANDERSSON
                        I am usually fine on planes.

           Liz takes out sedatives. 

                                 LIZ
                        This is a flight to Kabul, not 
                        Stockholm for god’s sake. This job 
                        is impossible without self-
                        medication.

           INT. AIR INDIA PLANE - DAY

           The plane is about to land, with the whole thing shaking. Liz 
           remains unperturbed, but Karin is roused out of her drug 
           induced sleep feeling like she has been hit by a bus. Liz 
           takes out her hijab (headscraf) and wraps her head. Karin 
           looks over and a sudden realization crosses her face. 

                                 LIZ
                        Don’t tell me -

                                 KARIN ANDERSSON
                        I only had six hours to look over 
                        the case notes, pack, and let-
                                 LIZ
                        You came to the land of the Taliban 
                        and you didn’t bring any form of 
                        hijab?  

           Karin starts to look through her carry on. The plane shakes 
           making the whole process virtually impossible. 

                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                        I realize this is your first field 
                        mission but we are here to contain 
                        an outbreak of something that at 
                        this point has a ninety-two percent 
                        mortality rate and kills in under 
                        ten days. We can’t carry you, we 
                        can’t train you. Sort yourself out.

           Karin’s eyes well up like she is going to cry, but she is 
           fighting it. 

                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                        And if one of those tears falls you 
                        might as well stay on this plane 
                        and go back to Geneva. 

           Karin holds herself together as Liz pulls out another 
           headscarf from her bag. The plane lands like a tonne of 
           bricks, forcing Karin to grab the armrests again. Liz shakes 
           her head. 

           EXT. KABUL INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT RUNWAY - DAY

           Liz and Karin, now wearing headscarves, disembark their Air 
           India flight onto a runway, surrounded by snowdusted brown 
           flatlands, rolling mountains and a distant cityscape.  

                                 KARIN ANDERSSON
                        Feels like Stockholm. 

                                 LIZ
                        That’s where the similarities will 
                        end. 

           INT. KABUL AIRPORT - LATER

           Liz and Karin make their way through the insane bustle of 
           Kabul’s airport. 

           The women are dressed mostly with hijab and tunics, but there 
           are a few wearing the full burqa. Like most developing world 
           airports it has the bustle of a marketplace.
           DR. MALIK BENCHARIF, a self-possessed French-Algerian in his 
           30s with a baby face that he compensates for with sternness, 
           is there to greet the pair. 

                                 MALIK BENCHARIF
                        Dr. Scott? 

           Malik leads the duo through the crowds of people.

                                 LIZ
                        Dr. Bencharif. This is Dr. 
                        Anderssson. 

                      KARIN ANDERSSON
           Pleasure to meet you. 
                                                           LIZ
                                              You didn’t have to come all 
                                              the way to Kabul to meet us.

                                 MALIK BENCHARIF
                        I needed to pick up supplies, plus 
                        it gives us a chance to discuss 
                        what we know. We have identified 
                        fifteen more cases, three of them 
                        related to the third patient in a 
                        village in the Tribal region in 
                        South-Central Helmand. The others 
                        are addicts from a squat outside 
                        the city on the banks of the 
                        Helmand River, Mirwais Nika.

                                 LIZ
                        The same squat as the original 
                        cases! How long until we can get to 
                        Lashkar Gah?

                                 MALIK BENCHARIF
                        We have ten minutes to make a 
                        military flight South.

           They make their way through the throng of Afghanis, NGO 
           workers, Afghan National Police, and the International 
           Security Assistance Forces (ISAF) that guard the airport. 
           They are met by AN AMERICAN SOLDIER who ferries them back out 
           onto the runway.

           EXT. KABUL INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT RUNWAY - DAY

           The trio are quickly ushered into a military vehicle which 
           speeds down the runway towards a military plane which opens 
           in the back for access. 
           On the plane is military equipment, British soldiers and two 
           other civilians: DR. DANIEL WOLF, a gay American in his late 
           50’s, and DR. THERESE DIOP, a Senegalese women in her early 
           30’s. 

           Malik and Liz stride up the ramp towards the plane with 
           purpose while Karin tentatively boards.

                                 LIZ
                        Dr. Wolf.

                                 DANIEL WOLF
                        Good to see you, it’s been a long 
                        time. 15 years since-

                                 LIZ
                             (to Thérèse)
                        Are you the Ebola specialist?

           Daniel is a little taken back by her abrupt business like 
           nature. Karin waves awkwardly.

                                 THERESE DIOP
                        Yes, good to meet you. 

           AN ARMY OFFICER comes over. 

                                 ARMY OFFICER
                        You need to take your seats and 
                        strap-in. The flight down isn’t 
                        always easy.

           They take seats and begin to strap themselves in. Thérèse and 
           Daniel struggle with the mechanics.

                                 LIZ
                        Dr. Andersson also feels like we 
                        are dealing with Ebola.

                                 KARIN ANDERSSON
                        All the clinical signs match, as 
                        does the mortality rate and the 
                        incubation period.

                                 LIZ
                        I think it is too early at this 
                        stage to rule out anything. 
                        Containment is first priority.

           Thérèse figures out her seatbelt, while Daniel continues to 
           struggle. 
                                 DANIEL WOLF
                        Can we get a soldier over here to 
                        help me out?

           A STURDY BRITISH SOLDIER comes to help.

                                 THERESE DIOP
                        Ask and you shall receive.

           Liz turns towards Daniel.

                                 LIZ
                        As I was saying- now we need access 
                        to a lab to test samples. The field 
                        office isn’t -

                                 THERESE DIOP
                        We brought our own.

                                 DANIEL WOLF
                        Welcome to working with the 
                        resources of the American 
                        government. 

                                 LIZ
                        Thank god.

                                 DANIEL WOLF
                        Thank Obama. 

           The plane begins to take off. The relative comfort of the Air 
           India flight is replaced with the power of a military grade 
           vehicle’s take off. As the other doctors brace themselves, 
           Liz takes out her notes.

           INT./EXT. PLANE: LASHKAR GAH AIRPORT - DAY

           The back of the plane opens up to reveal the long expanses of 
           arid desert that is Helmand Province. The temperature is ten 
           degrees higher than Kabul. The five doctors exit alongside 
           the throng of soldiers. They are met by two young soldiers 
           PTE. JIMMY TARR and CPL. ROBBIE TURNER.

                                 CPL. ROBBIE TURNER
                        Dr. Scott? 

                                 LIZ
                        Yes. 

                                 CPL. ROBBIE TURNER
                        I’m Cpl. Turner, this is Pte. Tarr, 
                        we are your security detail. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 CPL. ROBBIE TURNER (CONT'D)
                        We have instructions to take you to 
                        Camp Bastion to be briefed on the 
                        security situation and protocol by 
                        Col. Kinross.  

                                 LIZ
                        Sorry I don’t have time for a 
                        security debrief.

                                 CPL. ROBBIE TURNER
                        These are orders ma’am. 

                                 LIZ
                        Good thing I don’t work for the 
                        army. We are going to the WHO field 
                        office.

           The two soldiers look to each other perplexed.

                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                        Do you need the address?

                                 CPL. ROBBIE TURNER
                        Ma’am I’m afraid I have to take you 
                        to Camp Bastion. 

           Liz goes to leave. The army men stop her. Liz looks to Malik 
           for support.

                                 MALIK BENCHARIF
                        I’ll take Diop to the office to set 
                        up the equipment and test the 
                        samples.

                                 LIZ
                        I’m coming!

                                 CPL. ROBBIE TURNER
                        Our orders are that YOU attend a 
                        security debrief. 

                                 LIZ
                        So they can go, just without a 
                        security detail?

                                 PTE. JIMMY TARR
                        Yes ma’am.

                                 LIZ
                        What if I take that military 
                        convoy? And you protect those 
                        doctors?
                                 DANIEL WOLF
                        Malik can drop Karin and I off at 
                        the Boost hospital.

           Liz turns to the soldiers.

                                 CPL. ROBBIE TURNER
                        Ma’am, if you could follow us. 

           Liz follows the soldiers.

                                 LIZ
                        What is the point of having a 
                        security detail if you aren’t 
                        actually providing security to the 
                        people out in the field?

                                 CPL. ROBBIE TURNER
                        Orders are orders ma’am.

           EXT. LASHKAR GAH - DAY

           The security detail drives through Lashkar Gah, one of the 
           most dangerous parts of Afghanistan. The city is battle 
           scared and battle weary from fighting between ISAF forces and 
           Taliban insurgents.

           The cityscape is a hectic collage of sand colored buildings 
           and the streets are filled with Soviet era vehicles. The 
           women here dress mostly in full burqa while the men wear 
           traditional dress as opposed to the more Western clothes seen 
           in the capitol. 

           The air is thick with sand which foreign soldiers refer to as 
           moon dust. The military vehicle prompts some looks of 
           derision from the locals, but for most it has just become a 
           fact of everyday life.

           EXT. BOOST HOSPITAL - LATER

           Malik drives up to the large, but rundown, white gates of the 
           Médecins Sans Frontières-run Boost hospital whose logo adorns 
           the side of the entrance alongside Pashto signs and 
           instructions.

           The truck is stopped at the checkpoint but once the guards 
           see it is Malik, they waive him through. 
           EXT. BOOST HOSPITAL - MOMENTS LATER

           Daniel and Karin get out of the truck. The outdoor waiting 
           area is filled with throngs of sick Afghans. Daniel and Karin 
           are met by the gregarious AMIT KHAN, a Pashto-speaking Indian 
           doctor in his 30’s, who is in charge of the Boost Hospital.

                                 DANIEL WOLF
                        Mr Khan I presume?

           Mr. Khan shakes his hand vigorously.

                                 AMIT KHAN
                        Hello! Let me show you around!

           INT. MILITARY VEHICLE: CAMP BASTION CHECK POINT - DAY

           Before the military vehicle can get into Camp Bastion it has 
           to pass a number of check points. Each one with a couple of 
           armored guards on each side.

           EXT. WHO LASHKAR GAH FIELD OFFICE - DAY

           The unassuming and small WHO field office is in a sand 
           colored building in the center of the city. Its simplicity 
           stands in stark contrast to the grandiose Geneva headquarters 
           in almost every way. 

           INT. WHO LASHKAR GAH FIELD OFFICE - LATER

           The small field office comprising one floor of an Afghan 
           office building is not the place where one would expect a 
           potential global pandemic to be fought. It is bustling with 
           both foreign and Afghan workers. 

           Malik and Thérèse squeeze through the office holding the 
           suitcases containing the portable lab.

           INT. WHO LASHKAR GAH FIELD OFFICE LAB - MOMENTS LATER

           The lab comprising of one room is clean but small.

                                 THERESE DIOP
                        This is what we have to-

                                 MALIK BENCHARIF
                        It is the best medical lab in 
                        Helmand.
                                 THERESE DIOP
                        You should have seen the one in 
                        Kananga. At least this looks 
                        sterile.

           Thérèse starts to set up.

           INT. BOOST HOSPITAL QUARANTINE SECTION - DAY

           Inside the Boost Hospital the walls are painted green and the 
           ceiling white. While the paint is new, the hospital is not. 
           Although money has been put into making this hospital 
           operational, it is still looks tired, rural and underfunded.

           Amit is wearing the full protection against Ebola, facemask, 
           gloves, and total medical coveralls, as he takes the 
           similarly suited Daniel and Karin around. 

           While there are numerous patients, they are led to the 
           extremely sick HAFIZ SHERZAI (20’s).

                                 DANIEL WOLF
                        Tell him we need to talk to him 
                        about his illness and interactions.

                                 AMIT KHAN
                             (Pashto)
                        These doctors need to ask you some 
                        questions.

           EXT. CAMP BASTION - CONTINUOUS

           Liz gets out of the military vehicle and is completely taken 
           aback by the enormity of the camp, which is the size of a 
           village. She looks around and sees military personnel as far 
           as the eye can see. Liz is met by LT. PARKINSON, a hard-as-
           shit soldier in his late twenties. 

                                 LT. PARKINSON
                        Dr. Scott follow me. 

           The two walk in silence towards a simple looking military 
           building. 

           INT. CAMP BASTION COMMAND - CONTINUOUS

           Liz and Lt. Parkinson walk through the well guarded hallways 
           of a building one would never guess held the office of the 
           Head of British Forces in Helmand. The only giveaway is the 
           fact that at the back lies the office of COL. WALTER KINROSS, 
           a military man in his 50’s. 
                                 COL. KINROSS
                        Dr. Scott, pleasure.

                                 LIZ
                        Sir, every moment I am here is 
                        dangerous for the Afghan people, 
                        the NATO mission, and could abet a 
                        global pandemic which would 
                        facilitate the spread of terrorism 
                        and the destabilization of 
                        Afghanistan.

                                 COL. KINROSS
                        Then I won’t keep you.

           Dr. Scott wants a fight, but Col. Kinross is not going to 
           give it to her. 

                                 LIZ
                        Let’s get on with it then. 

                                 COL. KINROSS
                        We are coming up to spring, which 
                        is when the Taliban launches its 
                        Spring Offensive. It is the most 
                        dangerous part of the year. These 
                        men have been hiding out in caves 
                        working themselves up-

                                 LIZ
                        Yes I am familiar with the 
                        Taliban’s Spring Offensive.

           Col. Kinross takes out a map of Helmand.

                                 COL. KINROSS
                        NATO forces control Lashkar Gah and 
                        Northern Helmand. The rest of the 
                        province is contested. You and your 
                        team are not to go anywhere, from 
                        this moment, without your security 
                        detail. Any area outside of Lashkar 
                        Gah you will have to clear with 
                        ISAF.

                                 LIZ
                        That’s you I assume. 

                                 COL. KINROSS
                        Yes.

           Dr. Scott points to an area on the map that appears blank.
                                 LIZ
                        There is a village in South-Central 
                        Helmand, Deshu, where three new 
                        cases have emerged. We need to get 
                        down there to contain the spread. 
                        In rural areas where family members 
                        take care of the sick the risk of 
                        exposure goes up exponentially.

                                 COL. KINROSS
                        Deshu is contested territory. 

                                 LIZ
                        Osama bin Laden himself could be in 
                        Deshu and I’d still need access.

                                 COL. KINROSS
                        We will put together a team, loop 
                        in the Americans.

           Col. Kinross goes to his phone, about to make the call 
           immediately.

                                 LIZ
                        Really?

                                 COL. KINROSS
                        Yes.

                                 LIZ
                        I expected more of a fight.

                                 COL. KINROSS
                        ISAF works with the WHO, we are all 
                        here to WIN this thing. 

                                 LIZ
                        Contain.

           He smiles at this correction. 

           INT. WHO LASHKAR GAH FIELD OFFICE LAB - LATER

           Thérèse is in a Hazmat suit because of the contagion risk 
           even samples of Ebola present. The lab is now filled with 
           state of the art research equipment.

           INT. MILITARY VEHICLE: LASHKAR GAH - EARLY EVENING

           Liz is being driven through Lashkar Gah by Cpl. Turner and 
           Pte. Tarr. 
           They stop in front of the WHO field office and Malik is 
           talking to A FRENCH REPORTER. He ends the conversation and 
           gets in.

                                 MALIK BENCHARIF
                        How did it go?

                                 LIZ
                        He wanted to let me know what the 
                        Spring Offensive was.

                                 MALIK BENCHARIF
                        It’s nice to know the colonizers 
                        even look down on their own 
                        sometimes.

                                 LIZ
                        The British or NATO?

                                 MALIK BENCHARIF
                        Both. 

                                 LIZ
                        You’re French aren’t you?

                                 MALIK BENCHARIF
                        French-Algerian, which means no 
                        Frenchman would consider me one. 

                                 LIZ
                        Like no Algerian would consider you 
                        Algerian. 

           Malik looks at her with barely contained anger. She has 
           overstepped the mark in his books.

                                 LIZ(CONT’D)
                        We need the colonizers help on 
                        this. Also, media should go through 
                        Geneva. We are here to contain the 
                        epidemic, not spin it.

           INT. BOOST HOSPITAL - LATER

           Liz and Malik meet Daniel and Karin with Dr. Khan.  

                                 LIZ
                        How is our quarentine? 
                                 DANIEL WOLF
                        Pretty top notch.

                                 AMIT KHAN
                        Mostly thanks to Malik.

           Malik looks at her and does a sarcastic bow. Liz doesn’t 
           react. The others notice the tension.

                                 DANIEL WOLF
                        Want to see it?

                                 LIZ
                        Please.

           Daniel leads the way. 

                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                        Have you talked to the surviving  
                        patient? 

                                 KARIN ANDERSSON
                        Yes.

           As they walk through the hospital they pass throngs of sick 
           Afghans. People seeking treatment for malnourishment, broken 
           bones, and things like TB which have almost been eradicated 
           in the developed world.

                                 LIZ
                        How was patient zero identified? 

                                 MALIK BENCHARIF
                        First person to present symptoms.

                                 LIZ
                        This is through -

                                 MALIK BENCHARIF
                        Testimony from two of the patients 
                        before their death and the 
                        surviving patients. 

                                 LIZ
                        You have the first symptomatic 
                        patient as the seventh to have 
                        died, while the fourth patient to 
                        present symptoms as the first 
                        fatality. I doubt the seventh death 
                        is patient zero. I would hazard a 
                        guess it is the patient who died a 
                        full two days before any of the 
                        others. 
                                 MALIK BENCHARIF
                        Patient four had the weakest immune 
                        system that is why he died first.

           The doctors get to the outside of the quarantine area. It has 
           one small sink. Dr. Scott begins to wash her hands.

                                 LIZ
                        You are relying on sources who 
                        claim every other infected patient 
                        from this squat presented symptoms 
                        at the same time while death seven, 
                        your patient zero, had a noticeable 
                        cough earlier, but if this is Ebola 
                        or a slow acting cholera mutation, 
                        fever would be the first symptom.

                                 MALIK BENCHARIF
                        Fever is impossible to pinpoint. 
                        These are heroin addicts we’re 
                        dealing with, they wouldn’t notice 
                        the onset of fever if they were 
                        high.

           Then Malik starts to wash his hands. Liz starts dressing in 
           the coveralls for the quarantine area.

                                 LIZ
                        Malik -

                                 MALIK BENCHARIF
                        Dr. Bencharif.

                                 LIZ
                        Alright if you prefer, Dr. 
                        Bencharif, you have made the wrong 
                        hypothesis. You think the cough 
                        followed these individual’s fevers, 
                        while I would argue that it 
                        predated whatever killed them, and 
                        that the first mortality’s diarrhea 
                        is the first concrete symptom. I 
                        think we have the wrong patient 
                        zero.

                                 MALIK BENCHARIF
                        We have no way to prove -

                                 LIZ
                        Then we follow up on both lines of 
                        inquiry. If anyone else believes 
                        another case is a candidate -
           Daniel starts to wash his hands as Malik gets dressed for 
           quarentine. 

                                 KARIN ANDERSSON
                        Patient three was the source of a 
                        few of the early patients’ heroin. 
                        If that was the source of 
                        contamination he most likely 
                        ingested it first and would be our 
                        link to origin. 

                                 LIZ
                        Add patient three to our list.

           EXT. BOOST HOSPITAL - NIGHT

           As the group of doctors are leaving the facility they are met 
           by Cpl. Turner and Pte. Tarr. An overweight Afghan in his 
           50’s, ABDUL JALLAL, appears with Dr. Khan. He is stopped by 
           Pte. Tarr which clearly annoys Jallal.

                                 MALIK BENCHARIF
                             (to Liz)
                        This is not good. Head of Helmand’s 
                        Health Ministry.

           Liz motions for the soldiers to allow him forward which 
           angers the prideful Jallal further.

                                 ABDUL JALLAL
                        What do you think you are doing?

                                 LIZ
                        I am Dr. Scott, head of the WHO’s 
                        mission -

           Liz puts out her hand to shake but he does not take it.

                                 ABDUL JALLAL
                        I know who you are. My office is 
                        supposed to be informed of all of 
                        your-

                                 LIZ
                        I am sorry-

                                 ABDUL JALLAL
                        Do not interrupt me. This is our 
                        hospital and you need our 
                        permission to enter.
                                 LIZ
                        This hospital is run by Médecins 
                        Sans Frontières.

                                 ABDUL JALLAL
                        With our permission. You can not 
                        circumvent the authority of the 
                        Afghan people. 

                                 LIZ
                        Of course Mr. Jallal.

                                 ABDUL JALLAL
                        The last time you people went 
                        marching around Lashkar Gah with no 
                        supervision, 15 Afghans died.

                                 LIZ
                        I’m not aware-

                                 MALIK BENCHARIF
                        The cholera deaths.

           Liz gestures for him to leave this up to her, Jallal 
           registers this as a sign of disrespect and as Malik’s 
           emasculation. 

                                 LIZ
                        There was a quarentine in place.

                                 ABDUL JALLAL
                        15 people were denied treatment by 
                        your people and they died. So now 
                        you go through me. I approve your 
                        actions. I will not let innocent 
                        people die.

                                 LIZ
                        Then we are on the same page.

           The rest of the doctors, except Malik, get in the military 
           truck while the two military personnel stand by Liz’s side.

                                 ABDUL JALLAL
                        And I find it very disturbing that 
                        they would appoint someone that 
                        does not respect our cultural 
                        traditions and differences. 

                                 LIZ
                        I assure you I respect-
                                 ABDUL JALLAL
                        Do you know the Afghan practice of 
                        purdah? 

                                 LIZ
                        Gender apartheid. 

                                 ABDUL JALLAL
                        We believe a woman should be 
                        covered in public to protect her 
                        from being harassed or seen as a 
                        sexual object. You are a doctor. I 
                        can see your arms, neck, ankles. 
                        Please respect our customs because 
                        only then will people here respect 
                        you.

                                 LIZ
                        I will ensure Malik liases with 
                        your office. Please feel free to 
                        contact me directly if you have any 
                        issues. 

           Malik looks pissed at being assigned something. Liz gets in 
           the truck and the soldiers follow her.

                                 ABDUL JALLAL
                             (Pashto)
                        You let her disrespect you. 

                                 MALIK BENCHARIF
                             (Pashto)
                        These people are not great at 
                        respecting local cultures. 

                                 ABDUL JALLAL
                             (Pashto)
                        Just as you are not great at 
                        respecting yourself. 

           Jallal turns and walks away.

           INT. MILITARY VEHICLE: LASHKAR GAH - LATER

           The exhausted doctors sit in the backseat. 

                                 LIZ
                        He believes sexism to be a cultural 
                        tradition we should respect.
                                 MALIK BENCHARIF
                        When you disrespect me in front of 
                        the Afghans, they lose respect for 
                        me and I am less able to do my job.

                                 LIZ
                        I am not here to protect you or 
                        Jallal’s manhood.

           Karin looks at Malik sympathetically. 

                                 KARIN ANDERSSON
                        I think cultural sensitivity-

                        if you cannot take orders from a 
                        woman you have spent too much time 
                        in Afghanistan. 

           Everyone remains silent.

                        I want status reports before we

           INT. WHO LASHKAR GAH FIELD OFFICE LAB - NIGHT

           Thérèse is performing an ELISA test. There is a plate the 
           size of a hand where 21 (out of 96) microtiers are filled 
           with different antigens corresponding to the different 
           possible diseases. Thérèse puts the microtiers in a plate 
           photometer machine which will read and graph the samples.

           Thérèse now out of her hazmat suit rushes out. Pte. Tarr is

                        I should have been woken. 

                                 KARIN ANDERSSON
                        You said sleep or work. You 
                        couldn’t work anymore -

                                 LIZ
                        It is not your place to make 
                        executive decisions. 

                                 KARIN ANDERSSON
                        What could you have accomplished at 
                        3 am that would have placed you in 
                        a better position for Deshu than 
                        you are now?

           Liz thinks for a second. She gets up. 

                                 LIZ
                        That isn’t your call to make.

           She gets up, followed by Daniel as they walk out of the hall.

           EXT. CAMP BASTION - CONTINUOUS

           They walk through endless army officers in the morning Afghan 
           sun.

                                 DANIEL WOLF
                        She’s right.
                                 LIZ
                        Of course she’s bloody right, 
                        that’s not the point. 

                                 DANIEL WOLF
                        Never is. Better kiss and make up 
                        before Deshu. She might be the last 
                        person you see.

                                 LIZ
                        Don’t be melodramatic.

                                 DANIEL WOLF
                        It’s the tribal regions, they are 
                        melodramatic.

                                 LIZ
                        I should leave her here.

                                 DANIEL WOLF
                        I worked with her all day yesterday 
                        and she’s a hell of a doctor, and 
                        the only epidemiologist who 
                        connected the heroin source to 
                        patient zero. 

           Liz turns towards the female barracks.

                                 LIZ
                        I want a full report on the Mirwais 
                        Nika cleanup by the time I’m back 
                        from Deshu.

           She heads off from Daniel. He gives her the finger behind her 
           back. 

           INT. MILITARY VEHICLE: SOUTH-CENTRAL HELMAND - MORNING

           Liz, Karin and Thérèse sit in the back of an army hummer. TWO 
           SOLDIERS are in the front. The ride is bumpy but Liz 
           continues to look through case notes while Karin and Thérèse 
           try to keep their stomachs from ending up on their laps.

           EXT. SOUTH-CENTRAL HELMAND - CONTINUOUS

           A parade of six armored trucks, one medical evacuation 
           (MedEvac) vehicle, and one tank traverse the desolate desert 
           of Southern Helmand. The roads are sand, and the only 
           difference from the terrain around them is that the road has 
           been packed down by army vehicles and thirty year old busses.
           INT. MILITARY VEHICLE FRONT: SOUTH-CENTRAL HELMAND - 
           CONTINUOUS

           TWO MILITARY COMMANDERS’ eyes are peeled because of the ever-
           present threat of Taliban fighters.

                                 MILITARY COMMANDER #1
                        Come in. All clear out front. Over.

           INT. MILITARY VEHICLE BACK - CONTINUOUS

           There is a gun mounted on the back of an armored truck. 
           SOLDIER ON REAR guard the back. FIVE SOLDIERS ride inside.

                                 MILITARY COMMANDER #2
                        Affirmative. Reading you five. All 
                        clear out back. Out.

           EXT. SOUTH-CENTRAL HELMAND - LATER

           As the military vehicle drives the treacherous roads TWO 
           TALIBAN FIGHTERS watch from a rock perch above the road. 

           INT. HELMAND HEALTH MINISTRY LASHKAR GAH - DAY

           Malik and Daniel sit in the waiting room. The office is 
           overcrowded with boxes and Afghan staff. Abdul Jallal comes 
           out, still angry from the day before. They speak in Pashto to 
           each other while Daniel looks on confusedly. 

                                 ABDUL JALLAL
                        Dr. Bencharif, errand boy.

           Malik holds his tongue.

                                 MALIK BENCHARIF
                        Mr. Jallal, our deepest regrets 
                        about yesterday. These new 
                        Westerners don’t know how it works 
                        down here. 

                                 ABDUL JALLAL
                        They better learn. 

                                 MALIK BENCHARIF
                        Firstly we have discerned the 
                        outbreak to be Ebola.

                                 ABDUL JALLAL
                        That is not an Afghan disease.
                                 MALIK BENCHARIF
                        As we discussed, we need your 
                        ministry to quarantine the house in 
                        Mirwais Nika where the infected 
                        addicts resided.

                                 ABDUL JALLAL
                        Then the addicts will be out on the 
                        street, infecting children. 

                                 MALIK BENCHARIF
                        If we do not stop addicts from 
                        using the house the disease will 
                        spread. 

                                 ABDUL JALLAL
                        Drugs are contrary to Allah, maybe 
                        it is his will. Let me ask you how 
                        you think this foreign disease got 
                        here.

           EXT. HELMAND HEALTH MINISTRY LASHKAR GAH - LATER

           A frustrated Malik leaves with a confused Daniel. 

                                 MALIK BENCHARIF
                        As long as it is confined to drug 
                        users the Ministry is unconcerned.

                                 DANIEL WOLF
                        Well if we don’t quarantine that 
                        house it won’t be confined to drug 
                        users for long.

                                 MALIK BENCHARIF
                        These are faithful people Dr. Wolf.

                                 DANIEL WOLF
                        You know when the first AIDS 
                        patients started dying, the junkies 
                        and faggots, that is the exact same 
                        thing American politicians said. 
                        That isn’t faith, it’s bigotry.

           INT. MILITARY VEHICLE: LASHKAR GAH - CONTINUOUS

           They get into their army vehicle, Cpl. Turner and Pte. Tarr 
           are in the front. 

                                 MALIK BENCHARIF
                        Camp Bastion. 
                                 DANIEL WOLF
                        We need to go to Mirwais Nika. 

                                 MALIK BENCHARIF
                        If Jallal won’t quarantine that 
                        house the British will. If the 
                        British won’t then the Americans 
                        will. If they are too short sighted 
                        we will go to the Danes.

                                 DANIEL WOLF
                        I think you and Liz are going to 
                        get along just fine. 

                                 MALIK BENCHARIF
                        When she stops treating me like an 
                        incompetent Arab, maybe.

                                 DANIEL WOLF
                        She thinks we’re all incompetent 
                        somethings. 

                                 MALIK BENCHARIF
                        When this is contained, Jallal is 
                        going to have me removed. 

                                 DANIEL WOLF
                        When this is contained you can get 
                        any field job you want.

           EXT. DESHU HUT - LATER

           Liz, Thérèse, and A TRANSLATOR are in full hazmat suits in a 
           small mud house besides two extremely sick women, AFGHAN 
           MOTHER and AFGHAN AUNT. On the floor is a wrapped body of the 
           FATHER, and a YOUNGER AFGHAN MAN is watching from the 
           sidelines. 

                                 LIZ
                        Ask her if they have had any 
                        visitors since Aazar came home to 
                        visit?

                                 TRANSLATOR
                             (Pashto)
                        Have you had any visitors since 
                        your son was home?

                                 A MOTHER
                             (Pashto)
                        No one has come. He was sick so 
                        they stayed away. 
                                 TRANSLATOR
                        No.

                                 LIZ
                        Have they been in any contact with 
                        anyone since becoming ill?

                                 TRANSLATOR
                             (Pashto)
                        Have you been in contact with 
                        anyone. Anyone been to visit?

           EXT. DESHU VILLAGE - LATER

           Liz, Thérèse, and Karin help the sick into the medevac. It is 
           the only military vehicle close to town, for contamination 
           purposes. THE DRIVER is in a hazmat suit. They start walking 
           towards the other trucks.

                                 KARIN ANDERSSON
                        There are no doors.

                                 LIZ
                        They are poor.

                                 THERESE DIOP
                        She means it would make cross 
                        infection easier. Someone does not 
                        necessarily need to enter to visit. 
                        The whole area around their home is 
                        potentially contaminated.

                                 LIZ
                        Let’s split up, go door to door, in 
                        a sense. Do we have another 
                        translator? 

           Liz takes off her hazmat suit.

                                 KARIN ANDERSSON
                        No.

                                 LIZ
                        You think that with a billion 
                        pounds of military equipment out 
                        here they could spare another 
                        fucking translator.

                                 KARIN ANDERSSON
                        We can decontaminate the hut, while 
                        you - 
                                 LIZ
                        Get some of those soldiers to put 
                        on a suit and help.

           A parade of British forces’ trucks manned with Malik, Daniel, 
           and the vast majority (10) of people from WHO’s Lashkar Gah’s 
           field office drive up to the drug den at Mirwais Nika.

           Malik and Daniel find TWO ADDICTS using the drug den. This

           mixture of needles, joint roaches, and bodily refuse on the 
           floor. This is the perfect breeding ground for a pandemic. 
           The two drug addicts are taken into medical care.

           INT. MIRWAIS NIKA - DAY

           WHO workers begin decontaminating the drug den. The beginning 
           of a long and arduous process.

           INT. MILITARY VEHICLE: SOUTH-CENTRAL HELMAND - EARLY EVENING

           Back in the truck and on the way back North the soldiers and 
           the three women are beginning to loosen up. 

                                 YOUNG SOLDIER
                        My parents saw it on the news. 

                                 NERVOUS SOLDIER
                        Is it as bad as all that?

                                 LIZ
                        We got lucky on containment. The 
                        societal stigma of drug abuse 
                        helped.

                                 NERVOUS SOLDIER
                        How’d you get it?

           The drive is bumpy. 
                                 LIZ
                        It is not easy to transmit. You 
                        need to come into contact with 
                        fluid of the sick, but if you do, 
                        even a small drop on your skin can 
                        infect you. 

                                 KARIN ANDERSSON
                        Doctors, people preparing dead 
                        bodies for burial, and those who 
                        care for the sick are most at risk. 

                                 THERESE DIOP
                        It doesn’t travel through air and 
                        dies fairly quickly on surfaces. 

                                 LIZ
                        It is not easy to transmit, but 
                        once it is transmitted, it is 
                        painful and most often deadly.

                                 NERVOUS SOLDIER
                        You think you can stop it?

           The soldier looks at her with pleading eyes. Karin steps in.

                                 KARIN ANDERSSON
                        She has contained three of the 
                        biggest cholera epidemics in the 
                        last fifty years.

           This makes the soldier breathe a sigh of relief. Liz looks at 
           Karin and smiles. Karin smiles back at her. 

                                 NERVOUS SOLDIER
                        Good, I was getting right nervous.

           Liz leans back into the seat and relaxes for the first time 
           since landing in Helmand.

           EXT. RIDGE SOUTH-CENTRAL HELMAND - CONTINUOUS

           The TWO TALIBAN FIGHTERS from earlier raise a rocket launcher 
           onto a man made perch on the ridge. They aim it at the 
           MedEvac vehicle, which is the least reinforced. 

           INT. MILITARY VEHICLE: SOUTH-CENTRAL HELMAND - CONTINUOUS

           Liz is looking out the window when she sees a rocket EXPLODE 
           into the MedEvac truck ahead. 
           The bomb is so loud all that can be heard is RINGING, and the 
           armored truck shakes with the force of the nearby explosion. 
           Frantic soldiers start yelling over the radio. 

           Gunfire breaks out from the side of the mountain and is 
           returned by the British forces. 

           The three doctors are helpless in the back of the truck. 
           Gunfire hits the side of their vehicle but it is reinforced. 
           Karin starts to hyperventilate, Liz grabs her arm firmly but 
           with reassurance.

                                 LIZ
                        Breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe. 
                        Look at me. Just concentrate on my 
                        eyes. Everything will be fine.

                                 KARIN ANDERSSON
                             (breathing)
                        Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

           EXT. MILITARY VEHICLE: SOUTH-CENTRAL HELMAND - CONTINUOUS

           The trucks start to move. The doctor’s vehicle has to 
           manoeuver around the charred remains of the MedEvac. 

           INT. MILITARY VEHICLE: SOUTH-CENTRAL HELMAND - CONTINUOUS

           As Karin’s breathing begins to return to normal Liz looks out 
           of the window. 

                                 LIZ
                        That entire crash site is now a 
                        contaminated area. You need to tell 
                        them that.

           The soldiers ignore her and drive on. 

                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                        That needs to be decontaminated, 
                        there can’t be Ebola on the middle 
                        of the fucking highway. 

                                 YOUNG SOLDIER
                        Ma’am please, we need to get out of 
                        here! I’m going to need you to be 
                        quiet.

           The three epidemiologists look at the sight with fear.
           EXT. SOUTH-CENTRAL HELMAND - DUSK

           The exploded MedEvac truck is spewed across a desolate 
           highway.

           INT. CAMP BASTION COMMAND - NIGHT

           Liz unexpectedly enters the office of Col. Kinross who is on 
           the phone. Lt. Parkinson goes to her. 

                                 LT. PARKINSON
                        You can’t be in here.

                                 LIZ
                        Do you understand what just 
                        happened?

                       COL. KINROSS
                                                      LT. PARKINSON
                 (to phone)
           Prepare a debrief. There is 
           something I need to handle.
                                              Two British soldiers just 
                                              died because of a mission you 
                                              requested. 

           Liz tries to push past Lt. Parkinson, who stops her. Col. 
           Kinross hangs up the phone. 

                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                        The site of the explosion is now 
                        contaminated and-

                             (loud and firm)
                        AND that area is contested. Not to 
                        mention the two men I lost out 
                        there.

                                 LIZ
                        I am sorry about your men, but 
                        Ebola transmits through contact 
                        with bodily fluid and that is 
                        literally all over the main road to 
                        Deshu. 

                                 COL. KINROSS
                        Understood. When it is safe you and 
                        your people, with the full support 
                        of the British military, will de-
                        contaminate the area. Until then, 
                        the area is a no go. That is all.

                        Enough.

           Lt. Parkinson shows a distressed Liz out.

           EXT. CAMP BASTION - LATER

           Liz leaves the command center and is confronted by Malik and 
           Daniel.

                                 DANIEL WOLF
                        We heard. How are-

                                 LIZ
                        What happened with the cleanup?

                        Success and the heroin users we 
                        picked up are in quarantine.

                                 MALIK BENCHARIF
                        We had to go around Jallal.

                        Go around? I thought your job was 
                        to appease.

                                 DANIEL WOLF
                        We couldn’t-

           Liz stops him. This upsets Malik. 

                                 LIZ
                        As the one who was tasked with 
                        keeping him in the loop and on side 
                        you are telling me you went around 
                        him and pissed him off more.
                                 MALIK BENCHARIF
                        Is that my job? I thought I was a 
                        doctor.

                                 LIZ
                             (angry and frustrated)
                        Your job is to do whatever the fuck 
                        I tell you. You making my job

                        You made my job harder. You 
                        disrespected me in front of Jallal 
                        which makes him unable to respect 
                        me. 

                                 LIZ
                        Are you quite done?

           Malik does not respond.

                        then I will find someone who can. 
                        Jallal does not respect you because 
                        you don’t know when to stand up for 
                        yourself and when to admit you made 
                        a mistake.

           Malik says nothing. Daniel hands her his report.

                        I’ve been in Helmand for five

           INT. CAMP BASTION: WOMEN’S QUARTERS - LATER

           Liz enters her room to find Thérèse comforting an upset Karin 
           on the edge of her bed. When she sees Liz she tries to pull 
           herself together. Liz notices this. She goes to her suitcase, 
           rummages, and takes out a bottle of whiskey. She sits down 
           besides the women, opens the bottle and takes a swig and 
           passes it to Karin.

                                 LIZ
                        What you went through today no

                        to go through.

           Karin takes a swig.

                                 KARIN ANDERSSON
                        I know you don’t like weakness.

           Liz puts her arm around Karin who bristles. Karin passes the 
           bottle to Thérèse. 

                                 LIZ
                        For your first field mission you

                        parts of the world to fight 
                        something which we knew nothing 
                        about. Now we have it virtually 
                        contained and we know what it is. 
                        We are winning and that is thanks 
                        to you. That isn’t weakness.

           Karin smiles. Thérèse passes the bottle to Liz.

                        I first went into the field at 24. 
                        It was so long ago the Berlin Wall 
                        was still up for god’s sake. I 
                        cried every night. I hid it because 
                        I had to- I was the only woman on 
                        the team. But I was scared and 
                        lonely and unsure. And then when I 
                        went to the Congo in 94 for that 
                        cholera outbreak and 3000 people a 
                        day were dying I didn’t think I 
                        could take it.

                        I ran myself into the ground. I 
                        worked myself half to death, my 
                        girlfriend who is now my boss, left 
                        me. I proved myself on that 
                        mission, and now she sends me on 
                        new ones half because I’m the best, 
                        half to punish me I think. The 
                        point is I didn’t know I had a 
                        choice, I was too young to know I 
                        had a choice. You can leave Karin 
                        and I will write you the most 
                        fantastic reference. You have done 
                        real good here. Know that. You have 
                        a choice.

           Karin takes the bottle and takes a swig.

                        I can still smell their flesh 
                        burning. You won’t forget that. And 
                        that will make you a better doctor, 
                        and a better field worker. Now you 
                        get what these people face. That is 
                        good.

           Karin hands the bottle to Thérèse.

                                 KARIN ANDERSSON
                        I am not going home.

                                 KARIN ANDERSSON
                        I can be an asset...I am an asset.

                             (to Karin)
                        You see connections others don’t.

           Thérèse hands the bottle to Liz, she takes a swig. She 
           rummages again through her bags and finds a pack of 
           cigarettes.

                                 KARIN ANDERSSON
                        We can’t in here.

                                 THERESE DIOP
                        Smoking is bad for you doctor.

                        That’s the fun.

           Liz lights up and passes it to Karin. She takes a drag.

                                 THERESE DIOP
                        Pass it here.

           Karin passes it to Thérèse.

                                 LIZ

           INT. DRUG SQUAT - MORNING

           Liz, Thérèse, Karin all in Hijab, and TWO TRANSLATORS make 
           their way through an abandoned factory. Light streams in 
           through broken windows which have been badly covered by a 
           patchwork of rags. The floor is covered in dirt and the 
           refuse of addiction.

           Men are crouched on the ground in various states of lucidity. 
           Some men are injecting, while others are blitzed out of their 
           minds; some are coming out of the haze; while others still 
           are itching for a fix. 

           The drug squat is eerily silent, broken only by the footsteps 
           of the WHO workers and the sound of lighters either melting 
           heroin for injection or lighting heroin joints for smoking.

           Each WHO worker takes a translator and they approach the 
           addicts.

           Daniel does rounds of the infected Ebola patients, taking

           British Fighter jets litter the area around the crash site

           A cave with a few AFGHAN MEN AND A WOMAN is blasted by a

           Malik is still waiting, now looking extremely annoyed. A 
           HEALTH MINISTRY WORKER walks by.

                                 MALIK BENCHARIF
                             (Pashto)

                             (Pashto)
                        He is busy. He requests you wait.

           INT. DRUG SQUAT - AFTERNOON

           Liz and her translator are looking worse for wear: dirt 
           smudged faces, and hair starting to peak out from their 
           hijab. The day in the drug squat is beginning to take it’s 
           tole. She is talking to an extremely skinny HEROIN ADDICT #1 
           who could be anywhere from 35-55.

                                 LIZ
                        Have you ever been to Mirwais Nika 
                        to inject heroin? 

                                 TRANSLATOR
                             (Pashto)
                        Have you been to Mirwais Nika to do 
                        what you do here?

           The heroin addict picks at a scab on his arm as he ties it up 
           readying for injection.

                                 HEROIN ADDICT #1
                             (Pashto)
                        No. Never.

                                 TRANSLATOR
                        No.

           He takes a piece of brown heroin and puts it on a piece of 
           foil. He lights underneath so the heroin melts.
                                 LIZ
                        Do you know of anyone who goes to 
                        Mirwais Nika? Or does anyone from 
                        Mirwais Nika come here?

                                 TRANSLATOR
                             (Pashto)
                        Do you go or do any people come 
                        from Mirwais Nika?

           The addict takes out a dirty syringe. The addict uses the 
           syringe to take up the melted heroin off the foil. 

                                 HEROIN ADDICT #1
                        No.

           He puts the needle in a vein between his toe and injects.

                        Anyone who was around in the days 
                        before the people at Mirwais Nika 
                        got sick? Anyone unfamiliar?

                        A while ago there was a man who 
                        spoke Pashtu odd. Not Afghan. Not 
                        like you either, not Indian Pashto. 

                                 AMIT KHAN
                        He says a man spoke Pashto like a 
                        foreigner before people started 
                        becoming sick.

           Daniel’s eyes light up.

                             (Pashto)
                        Sorry Doctor but he left twenty 
                        minutes ago.

                        He looked Afghan but he sounded 
                        foreign. Not a native Pashto 
                        speaker but he knew regional slang. 

                                 LIZ
                        So he either lived here for a while 
                        or he was raised by parents from 
                        Helmand.

                                 DANIEL WOLF
                        Seems so.

                                 KARIN ANDERSSON
                        We should all learn a phrase in 
                        Pashto and see which accent most 
                        resembles -
           Jallal is upon them. The two soldiers hold their guns in 
           front of them. 

                                 ABDUL JALLAL
                        I thought I made myself clear that 
                        you do no come to this hospital 
                        unless I have said ok.

                        foreign health worker stationed in 
                        Helmand.

                                 ABDUL JALLAL
                        You closed Mirwais Nika without-

                                 LIZ
                        That was a military operation that 
                        we had no control over. 

                                 ABDUL JALLAL
                        You lie. Get out of here! You are 
                        banned.

           Liz shakes her head.

                                 ABDUL JALLAL (CONT’D)
                        Do not disrespect me.

                                 DANIEL WOLF
                        She is telling you the truth.
                                 ABDUL JALLAL
                        I told you sir in my office not to 
                        close Mirwais Nika. Now there are 
                        sick drug takers on the streets. 
                        Your actions insult Allah.

                                 LIZ
                        Cpl. Turner can you get Col. 
                        Kinross on the phone for me. Tell 
                        him it is an emergency.

                                 CPL. ROBBIE TURNER
                        Right away ma’am.

           Cpl. Turner goes towards his vehicle, while Pte. Tarr 
           continues to provide support for the doctors. 

                                 ABDUL JALLAL
                        This is not your country. You come 
                        here and say you are here to save 
                        us, but how did Ebola get here? 

                                 KARIN ANDERSSON
                        That is what we are trying to find 
                        out.

                                 ABDUL JALLAL
                        You invaders brought it. I don’t 
                        need you to tell me more lies.

                                 LIZ
                        Mr. Jallal-

                                 ABDUL JALLAL
                        Call off your army men! But I want 
                        you to know this is not how things 
                        are done here.

                                 LIZ
                        I apologize it has come to this.

                                 ABDUL JALLAL
                        Your hair is showing. At least 
                        respect your modesty.

           Liz begrudgingly adjusts her headscarf. Cpl. Turner comes 
           back. Jallal walks away still angry.

                                 CPL. ROBBIE TURNER
                        I couldn’t get a hold of him. You 
                        ok ma’am?
                                 LIZ
                             (to Daniel)
                        Find Khan and let’s learn some 
                        Pashto.

           EXT. CAMP BASTION - NIGHT

           Liz, Karin, Thérèse, and Daniel exit the truck. They are met 
           by Lt. Parkinson.

                                 LT. PARKINSON
                        Dr. Scott, follow me. 

           INT. CAMP BASTION COMMAND - NIGHT

           Col. Kinross and A NUMBER OF SOLDIERS are on one side of the 
           room facing Liz. There is a sharp divide.

                                 COL. KINROSS
                        If the road to Deshu is going to be 
                        decontaminated. It happens tonight.

                                 COL. KINROSS (CONT’D)
                        You will show my men what to do-

                                 LIZ
                        Col. we can’t show your men what to 
                        do. Decontamination has to be 
                        supervised by professionals.

                                 COL. KINROSS
                        The insurgency is destabilized, but 
                        they are regrouping. We can use the 
                        cover of darkness, but we can’t put 
                        you at risk. 

                                 LIZ
                        I have to go to ensure proper 
                        protocol is followed.

                                 LT. PARKINSON
                        We can handle spraying some 
                        chemicals on the ground. 

                                 LIZ
                        That attitude is why I need to go. 
                        Please Col.

           Col. Kinross turns to the other men.

                                 COL. KINROSS 
                        If you insist. 
           INT. CAMP BASTION - LATER

           Liz is being shown how to use Night Vision Devices (NVD) 
           while being suited up with a bullet proof vest under her 
           hazmat suit.

           INT. MILITARY VEHICLE: SOUTH-CENTRAL HELMAND - NIGHT

           In the dead of night Liz sits in the military convoy not 
           saying a word. She is mentally preparing herself to return to 
           the crash site.

           INT. MILITARY VEHICLE: SOUTH-CENTRAL HELMAND - LATER

           The military vehicle approaches the crash site. Soldiers exit 
           vehicles in front of them. 

           EXT. SOUTH-CENTRAL HELMAND ROAD - CONTINUOUS

           Soldiers take protective positions all around the crash site 
           with guns trained on the ridge. Soldiers are mounted on the 
           back of armored trucks with heavy duty artillery trained into 
           the darkness. 

           Liz and 5 SOLDIERS similarly suited up get out of the truck 
           and begin to spray sodium hypochlorite over the crash site. 

           The hazmat-clad decontaminators work on different areas. Liz 
           points to areas every so often, and the soldiers follow her 
           lead. Despite their night-vision goggles and cumbersome 
           mixture of protective medical and army gear they work quickly 
           and efficiently. 

           Suddenly A FLARE goes up and the whole area is bathed in a 
           bright red light. The soldiers are taken by surprise, but 
           immediately start FIRING towards the ridge. 

           A MASSIVE SOLDIER grabs Liz. Other SOLDIERS start ushering 
           the unarmed soldiers towards the armored trucks. A bullet 
           cuts through Liz’s backpack of sodium hypochlorite. 

                                 MASSIVE SOLDIER
                        You need to get in the truck.

                                 LIZ
                        We aren’t finished.

           BULLETS continue to rain down on the crash site. 
                                 MASSIVE SOLDIER
                        We have to get you back to base 
                        camp. 

           Liz is thrown into the armored truck along with the others.

           INT. MILITARY VEHICLE: SOUTH-CENTRAL HELMAND

           Liz tries to get her bearings while her back package of 
           sodium hypochlorite is leaking everywhere. A soldier grabs 
           the pack off her back and throws it outside. Cpl. Turner gets 
           in and starts to drive the truck away as the fire fight 
           remains outside.

                                 LIZ
                        How did they know we were there?

                                 CPL. ROBBIE TURNER
                        Don’t know ma’am.

                                 LIZ
                        I thought you bombed the place to 
                        hell today?

           As the truck drives it leaves the fire fight behind.

                                 CPL. ROBBIE TURNER
                        We did.

                                 SOLDIER
                        How much did we have left?

                                 LIZ
                        Five percent. The outer ring of the 
                        potential contaminated zone.

                                 SOLDIER
                        That’s not too bad.

                                 LIZ
                        Not good enough.

           INT. CAMP BASTION COMMAND - MORNING

           Liz is shown into Col. Kinross’s office.

                                 COL. KINROSS
                        I know what you are going to say 
                        and the answer is no.

           Liz goes to protest.
                                 COL. KINROSS (CONT’D)
                        The answer is no. That is the 
                        second mission of yours which has 
                        lost me a man. 

           Liz takes this in.

                                 LIZ
                        I’m sorry about your soldier but 
                        partial decontamination is not good 
                        enough. 

           Col. Kinross comes over and guides her towards the door.

                                 COL. KINROSS
                        For now it is going to have to be. 
                        We don’t know how they knew our 
                        position. How well do you know the 
                        Arab?

                                 LIZ
                        I don’t like what you are 
                        insinuating. He is French and was 
                        unaware of the mission.

                                 COL. KINROSS
                        You didn’t call him. 

                                 LIZ
                        The only person who knew about this 
                        mission on my team was on that 
                        road.

           Col. Kinross nods.

           INT. WHO LASHKAR GAH FIELD OFFICE - MORNING

           The room is bustling as the doctors work. Liz approaches 
           Malik. 

                                 LIZ
                        Can I speak to you for a moment?

           Malik sighs and nods. The two walk out into the stairwell.

           INT. WHO LASHKAR GAH FIELD OFFICE: STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

           The two go out to the stairwell. There is an awkward beat. 

                                 LIZ
                        I just wanted to...
           She stops, searches for the words.

                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                        I apologize. I should not have 
                        undermined you, let alone in front 
                        of Jallal and-

           Malik smiles. 

                                 MALIK BENCHARIF
                        Don’t worry. 

                                 LIZ
                        You were right.

                                 MALIK BENCHARIF
                        Thank you.

           Another beat. 

                                 MALIK BENCHARIF (CONT’D)
                        I guess we should get back-

                                 LIZ
                        Yes.

           INT. WHO LASHKAR GAH FIELD OFFICE - DAY

           Liz is at a desk, making a phone call. 

                                 LIZ
                             (to phone)
                        And those records will be faxed 
                        over immediately?

           She listens. Points at Karin to get Thérèse. Karin stops 
           working. She gets up and walks over to the lab. She knocks on 
           the window between the lab and rest of the offices.

           INT. WHO LASHKAR GAH FIELD OFFICE LAB - CONTINUOUS

           Thérèse puts away her sample carefully, being hypersensitive. 

           INT. WHO LASHKAR GAH FIELD OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Liz is rooting through files. 
                                 LIZ
                             (to phone)
                        No I need a list of soldiers 
                        stationed in the Congo for the last 
                        five years. FIVE.

           Thérèse and Karin approach. 

                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                             (to Thérèse)
                        Can I work on the assumption that 
                        this outbreak is related to the 
                        Congo strains?

                                 THERESE DIOP
                        Mortality rate indicated yes, but 
                        we have to wait for the genetic 
                        sequencing. It should be ready any 
                        day now.

                                 LIZ
                        Get a flight back to Geneva to 
                        supervise, let me know the minute 
                        you hear. Also where is Turner? And 
                        make sure Daniel has that list of 
                        NGOs in Helmand.
                             (to phone)
                        I don’t care how many soldiers it 
                        is. List. Faxed. Now.

           in her 40s. The office is makeshift, but neat, which stands 
           in contrast to the hubbub of the WHO field office.

                                 LIZ
                        Thank you for meeting us. 

                                 MADELINE
                        No problem. I guess you want to 
                        talk Ebola.

           They sit down.

                                 LIZ
                        Yes. Have any of your staff-

                                 MADELINE
                        There is a rumor going around that 
                        you brought it. 

                                 DANIEL WOLF
                        Are you kidding? 

                                 MADELINE
                        Seems like you pissed off the wrong 
                        people.

                                 LIZ
                        Have any of your staff traveled 
                        between the two regions recently? 

                                 MADELINE
                        No.

           INT.  MILITARY VEHICLE: LASHKAR GAH - LATER

           Liz and Daniel look tired. They sit in silence.

                                 PTE. JIMMY TARR
                        No luck ma’am.

                                 LIZ
                        No.
                                 DANIEL WOLF
                        Like any of these fucking do-
                        gooders are going to admit to being 
                        responsible for an Ebola outbreak.

           The military vehicle drives up to Camp Bastion.

                                 PTE. JIMMY TARR
                        At least no one’s getting sick, 
                        right ma’am?

                                 DANIEL WOLF
                        You raise a valid point Jimmy. 

                                 LIZ
                        Containment is only half the job.

                                 PTE. JIMMY TARR
                        Why’s that ma’am?

                                 LIZ
                        Containment deals with the 
                        immediate danger of the disease. 
                        But tracking the source and finding 
                        out as much as you can about the 
                        initial outbreak is what prevents 
                        further outbreaks, and helps 
                        contain new ones.

                                 PTE. JIMMY TARR
                        Right, well, hope you find out 
                        then.

                                 DANIEL WOLF
                        Thanks Jimmy!

           EXT. CAMP BASTION - MOMENTS LATER

           Lt. Parkinson is waiting for Liz and Daniel. As they get out 
           of the truck Liz spots her.

                                 LIZ
                             (to Daniel)
                        This can’t be good.

                                 LT. PARKINSON
                        Dr. Scott follow me. 

           Daniel pantomimes a silent scream of terror. Lt. Parkinson 
           marches Dr. Scott off towards command. 
           INT. CAMP BASTION COMMAND - MOMENTS LATER

           Col Kinross is behind his desk. He is more formal than he has 
           been previous. Liz enters with apprehension. 

                                 COL. KINROSS
                        Do you have any idea how dangerous 
                        the game you’re playing is?

                                 LIZ
                        Excuse me.

                                 COL. KINROSS
                        Why did you ask for military 
                        personnel files?

                                 LIZ
                        Since we seem to have containment 
                        under control. Now it is up to us 
                        to discern how this outbreak 
                        occurred Col.

                                 COL. KINROSS
                        You know that even the mere 
                        implication foreign troops were 
                        involved in this and the whole 
                        region could go up in smoke. 

                                 LIZ
                        My job is to find out how this 
                        spread from the Congo to Lashkar 
                        Gah. That is it.

                                 COL. KINROSS
                        Your job is to avoid pandemics, not 
                        destabilize regions. Rule out the 
                        military. I think your job is done 
                        here.

                                 LIZ
                        Excuse me? 

           Liz is stunned.

                                 COL. KINROSS
                        We are your partner in this. Rule 
                        out-

                                 LIZ
                        This is beyond the scope of your-

                                 COL. KINROSS
                        While you are in Afghanistan 
                        nothing is beyond my scope. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 COL. KINROSS (CONT'D)
                        There are rumors your team brought 
                        it in. Working to infect locals, 
                        not help- 

                                 LIZ
                        We ARE done here.

                                 COL. KINROSS
                        YOU are indeed.

           Liz storms out. 

           EXT. CAMP BASTION - MOMENTS LATER

           Liz is on a mission. She reaches Daniel. 

                                 LIZ
                        Let’s get to the field office. 
                        Karin needs more than one set of 
                        eyes. 

           She looks over and sees Pte. Tarr.

                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                        Jimmy let’s go.

           She looks in the other direction and sees Lt. Parkinson. 
           Jimmy comes over, they all get in the truck. 

           INT. MILITARY VEHICLE - CONTINUOUS

           Pte. Jimmy and the two doctors strap in. Jimmy turns on the 
           car. Lt. Parkinson knocks on the window, which Jimmy opens.

                                 LT. PARKINSON
                        These two are not to leave the base 
                        until further notice. We are going 
                        to get the Swede, follow me.

                                 LIZ
                        Is this a joke?

                                 LT. PARKINSON
                        Col. Kinross is talking to your 
                        superior as we speak.

           INT. CAMP BASTION - WOMEN’S QUARTERS - DAY

           Liz calls Karin.
           INT. WHO LASHKAR GAH FIELD OFFICE - DAY

           The phone rings in the bustling field office. Malik picks up.

                                 MALIK BENCHARIF
                        Hello.

           INTERCUT BETWEEN THE TWO ON THE PHONE

           Liz is frantically pacing as Daniel watches with 
           anticipation.

                                 LIZ
                        We are getting railroaded by the 
                        military. Get Karin to hide the 
                        military personnel files. 

           Malik goes to Karin who is working intently on comparing the 
           last remaining files.

                                 MALIK BENCHARIF
                        Karin you need to stop.

           Karin looks up.

                                 KARIN ANDERSSON
                        I’m almost done.

                                 MALIK BENCHARIF
                        The Brits are coming and they want 
                        those files. 

           Karin jumps up.

                                 MALIK BENCHARIF (CONT’D)
                        Liz it’s handled.

           END OF INTERCUTTING

           INT. WHO LASHKAR GAH FIELD OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Malik and Karin start to get all the files together. They are 
           frantic. Malik beckons over SAFIYA KAPOOR (30’s) a Western 
           raised Afghan.

           EXT. LASHKAR GAH DOWNTOWN STREET - CONTINUOUS

           A military convoy is stuck in traffic. An old soviet era 
           sedan has broken down, and no one can get around them.
                                 LT. PARKINSON
                        We are two blocks away. Let’s head 
                        on foot.

           INT. WHO LASHKAR GAH FIELD OFFICE

           Malik, Karin, and Saifya start putting the files into two 
           large bags.

                                 MALIK BENCHARIF
                        Take these files home. The Brits 
                        are coming for them. 

                                 SAFIYA KAPOOR
                        Yes.

           EXT. LASHKAR GAH DOWNTOWN STREET - CONTINUOUS

           Lt. Parkinson, Pte. Tarr, Cpl. Turner, and TWO OTHER SOLDIERS 
           head down the street on foot. The WHO office building coming 
           up. 

           INT. WHO LASHKAR GAH FIELD OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Safiya puts on her headscarf and heads to the exit. 

           INT. WHO LASHKAR GAH FIELD OFFICE: STAIRWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Safiya starts walking down the stairs as the soldiers enter. 
           As an Afghan woman they barely take notice of her.

           EXT. WHO LASHKAR GAH FIELD OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Safiya walks by the military convoy towards a car parked on 
           the street. 

           INT. WHO LASHKAR GAH FIELD OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Pte. Tarr and Lt. Parkinson enter. Karin is sitting waiting 
           for them. 

                                 KARIN ANDERSSON
                        Hello Lt. Parkinson. 

                                 LT. PARKINSON
                        Where are the files?
                                 KARIN ANDERSSON
                        What files?

                                 LT. PARKINSON
                        The military personnel files?

                                 KARIN ANDERSSON
                        I don’t know what you are talking 
                        about.

           INT. CAMP BASTION - WOMEN’S QUARTERS - LATER

           Karin and Liz are in discussion when Col. Kinross enters. Liz 
           stands.

                                 COL. KINROSS
                        We have talked to your superiors 
                        and your mission will remain. 
                        Although the British government and 
                        ISAF forces are withdrawing 
                        institutional support as long as 
                        your inquiry into our personnel 
                        continues.

                                 LIZ
                        May we go then? 

                                 COL. KINROSS
                        Cpl Turner and Pte. Tarr will take 
                        you to the WHO office, after that 
                        your security detail will be 
                        relieved.

           INT. WHO LASHKAR GAH FIELD OFFICE - LATER

           Amit meets Liz, Karin, Daniel, and Malik. He is looking 
           worried.

                                 AMIT KHAN
                        Jallal is getting revenge. Your 
                        team is banned as long as you are 
                        in the army’s bad books.

                                 LIZ
                        Fuck.

           Liz throws a bunch of files off of a table. People start to 
           clean up Liz’s mess.
                                 KARIN ANDERSSON
                        I have a day’s work left on the 
                        files. Let me clear them or 
                        implicate them. 

           Liz starts to sheepishly help them. 

                                 DANIEL WOLF
                        She’s right. 

           Liz gets up and starts dialing a phone number.

                                 LIZ
                        Get her to Safiya’s. Have we heard 
                        anything from Deshu? 

                                 MALIK BENCHARIF
                        Nope.

                                 LIZ
                             (to phone)
                        Helene please. It’s Dr. Scott from 
                        the Helmand team.

                                 MALIK BENCHARIF
                        You think someone needs to go back 
                        there? 

                                 LIZ
                        I KNOW someone does.

                                 DANIEL WOLF
                        You can’t go without military

                        I could. I speak Pashto. I look 
                        local.

                                 LIZ
                        I can’t ask you to do that.

                                 MALIK BENCHARIF
                        You didn’t. 

           Liz squeezes his arm as if to say thank you, Malik nods his 
           head.

                        I have a request from the Helmand 
                        Health Ministry to recall your 
                        mission.

           INTERCUT BETWEEN THE TWO ON THE PHONE

                                 LIZ
                        I have told you Mr. Jallal-

                                 HELENE LUND
                        I have the same request from NATO 
                        and the British government. Give me 
                        one reason I should let you stay.

                                 LIZ
                        Because with or without your 
                        support I am finding out how Ebola 
                        got here.

                                 HELENE LUND
                        Is that a threat?

                                 LIZ
                        It’s a fact.
                             (to Malik)
                        I’m coming with you. I can’t let 
                        team members put themselves in risk 
                        on my orders.

           Malkik goes to respond, but she holds up her hand as Helene 
           speaks. He rolls his eyes at her rude action, she gives him a 
           knowing smile back.

                                 HELENE LUND
                        Find out what happened, patch 
                        things up with the army and the 
                        ministry and anyone else you’ve 
                        angered. I don’t care how much 
                        pride you have to swallow. Get them 
                        to withdraw their requests or I 
                        will pull you.

                                 LIZ
                        Yes boss.

                        Yes Dr. Bencharif.

                                 MALIK BENCHARIF
                        You will not be coming.

                                 MALIK BENCHARIF
                        You don’t speak Pashto.

                                 LIZ
                        I won’t speak.

           The team laughs, Karin and Malik the hardest.

                                 MALIK BENCHARIF

                                 THERESE DIOP
                        Dr. Menken can I get a second 
                        opinion?

                                 DR. MENKEN
                        Of course.

                                 THERESE DIOP
                        Have a look at these two sequences 
                        and let me know what you see.

           Dr. Menken takes a long hard look.
                                 DR. MENKEN
                        They are the same genetic sequence.

                                 THERESE DIOP
                        I’m not going crazy? They are 
                        identical?

           Looking closely.

                                 DR. MENKEN
                        They are identical.

           INT. CAR: LASHKAR GAH DOWNTOWN STREET

           Daniel is driving through the bustling streets of Lashkar 
           Gah. 

                                 BBC NEWSCASTER
                        An Al-Quada video appeared today 
                        blaming the recent Ebola outbreak 
                        in Afghanistan’s Helmand Province 
                        on foreign healthcare workers. The 
                        World Health Organization, Red 
                        Cross, and Doctors Without Borders 
                        were named. Government forces have 
                        condemned the video as fear 
                        mongering.

           Liz turns off the radio. 

           INT. JOURNALIST OFFICE - DAY

           Daniel and Liz meet with FRENCH, BRITISH, and GERMAN 
           journalists and Canadian journalist JOHN ROY from the region. 

                                 DANIEL WOLF 
                        Yes we just need a list of all the 
                        places you’ve travelled in the last 
                        five years.

           Liz’s phone rings.

                                 LIZ
                        Excuse me.
                             (to phone)
                        Liz speaking. 

                                 FRENCH JOURNALIST
                        Have you heard the rumours you 
                        brought Ebola ici?

           Daniel rolls his eyes as Liz moves out of their conversation.
           INT. WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION - CONTINUOUS

           Thérèse looks worried.

                                 THERESE DIOP
                        We have an issue.

           INTERCUT Between Thérèse and Liz.

                                 LIZ
                        What?

                                 THERESE DIOP
                        The sample from Karin’s patient 
                        zero is identical to the 1976 
                        original outbreak.

                                 LIZ
                        So it is part of the Zaire strain? 

                                 THERESE DIOP
                        It is more than part of the Zaire 
                        strain. It has the exact genetic 
                        sequence as the first outbreak. It 
                        is not a mutation, it is as if our 
                        patient zero was part of that 
                        original outbreak.

                                 LIZ
                        What does that mean?

                                 THERESE DIOP
                        It means that either our outbreak 
                        lay dormant in patient zero for 34 
                        years before clinical 
                        manifestations or...

                                 LIZ
                        You aren’t saying what I think 
                        you’re saying? 

                                 THERESE DIOP
                        Or someone used the original virus 
                        to knowingly infect the Afghan 
                        cases.

                                 LIZ
                        What is the likelihood a new 
                        outbreak would have the same 
                        genetic sequence as a previous 
                        outbreak? 

                                 THERESE DIOP
                        Identical?
                                 LIZ
                        Yes.

                                 THERESE DIOP
                        You would have to have around 19000  
                        pearls of nucleotide in exactly the 
                        same formation. So I would say the 
                        chances are 1 in a few trillion.

           Liz goes further out of earshot of the reporters.

                                 LIZ
                        Find out which labs have samples of 
                        the original virus and who had 
                        access. This stays between us.

           Daniel interrupts excitedly and Liz quickly hangs up the 
           phone. 

                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                        What?

                                 DANIEL WOLF
                        John Roy’s photographer-

                                 JOHN ROY
                        He’s actually a photojournalist.

                                 DANIEL WOLF
                        He came from Eastern Congo to 
                        document social conditions in 
                        Afghanistan, including the heroin 
                        population, and he has gone back to 
                        the DRC.

           Liz looks at him, she doesn’t respond.

                                 LIZ

                                 DANIEL WOLF
                        Other than my husband might leave 
                        me? No. 

                                 LIZ
                        Good.

                                 DANIEL WOLF

                        Something relevant on the Ebola 
                        outbreak. Sending now.

           INT. N’DJILI AIRPORT, KINSHASA - DAY

           Daniel is surrounded by a sea of Congolese airport staff, 
           travellers, and NGO workers in the hectic and decaying 
           beige/yellow aiport which has not seen any improvements in 
           the decades since the end of Belgian colonial rule. Daniel is 
           met by LAURENT (30’s), a Congolese doctor.

                                 LAURENT
                        Welcome to Kinshasa. 

                                 DANIEL WOLF
                        I had to pay the customs official 
                        to let me in.

                                 LAURENT
                        The legacy of Mobutu. Steal, and 
                        steal often.

           EXT. KINSHASA - CONTINUOUS

           He leads him outside into the muggy, overcast, and humid 
           heat. Kinshasa is like a rainforest, but with crumbling and 
           neglected buildings in place of trees. 

           INT. ABDUL JALLAL’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Jallal is sitting with NAZDANA, a woman in her 20’s covered 
           in a burka and her older husband MAIWAND. Jallal motions for 
           her to sit. Liz looks at Nazdana. 

                                 ABDUL JALLAL
                        This is Nazdana.

                                 LIZ
                        Hello. 

           Nazdana does not respond to the foreign tongue, and looks at 
           the floor. MAIWAND looks only at Jallal, out of respect for 
           Liz’s honour.
                                 ABDUL JALLAL
                        Her brother used to frequent 
                        Mirwais Nika.

                                 LIZ
                             (worried)
                        Is he sick?

                                 ABDUL JALLAL
                        No. He came to her after it was 
                        closed. They took him in.

           Nazdana begins to cry again slightly.

                                 ABDUL JALLAL (CONT’D)
                        He stole from them. Everything. 
                        They cannot eat.

           Liz reacts with real emotion. She goes to touch Nazdana on 
           the hand, but she pulls away.

                                 ABDUL JALLAL (CONT’D)
                        Do you see why I didn’t want 
                        Mirwais Nika closed?

           Nazdana continues to cry.

                                 LIZ
                        I understand that the situation was 
                        not ideal-

                                 ABDUL JALLAL
                        You sound so unfeeling.

                                 LIZ
                        I assure you that isn’t the case.

                                 ABDUL JALLAL
                        Westerners are always so 
                        businesslike, even when it concerns 
                        peoples lives.

                                 LIZ
                        Why did you call me Mr. Jallal?

           Jallal indicates for the couple to leave. They do, promptly, 
           leaving the door open as not to have the unmarried man and 
           woman alone together.

                                 ABDUL JALLAL
                        There are reports, whispers at this 
                        point, that there are sick in 
                        Malakhan.
                                 LIZ
                        What reports?

                                 ABDUL JALLAL
                        People have heard stories of people 
                        bleeding to death in their homes.

                                 LIZ
                        We need to get a team down there.

                                 ABDUL JALLAL
                        We can’t send anyone down. The 
                        fighting is too intense.

                                 LIZ
                        The military?

                                 ABDUL JALLAL
                        They need more than whispers.

           EXT. DESHU - DAY

           Malik walks through the village talking to locals.

           INT. KINSHASA HOTEL - DAY

           Daniel is met by GUY LANCOT (40’s), the picture of a what a 
           photojournalist of conflict zones would look like: faded 
           khakis, button up rumpled white shirt, and long hair tied 
           into a pony tail. 

                                 DANIEL WOLF
                        Where did you visit in your last 
                        trip to the DRC? 

                                 GUY LANCOT
                        North and South Kivu.

           Guy goes over to the minibar and opens a beer.

                                 DANIEL WOLF
                        How did you get there?

                                 GUY LANCOT
                        By plane. Only way from Kinshasa. 
                        The roads don’t go that far.

           Guy paces as Daniel takes notes.

                                 DANIEL WOLF
                        Did you come into contact with 
                        anyone that was sick?
                                 GUY LANCOT
                        It’s central Africa, of course I 
                        did. 

                                 DANIEL WOLF
                        Could you explain to me their 
                        symptoms?

           Guy chugs the remainder of the beer.

                                 GUY LANCOT
                        Poverty, oppression, war.

           Daniel is not having it.

                                 DANIEL WOLF
                        Physical symptoms. 

                                 GUY LANCOT
                        There has never been Ebola in the 
                        Kivus or Kinshasa.

                                 DANIEL WOLF
                        You went to the drug den at Mirwais 
                        Nika? 

                                 GUY LANCOT
                        No. 

                                 DANIEL WOLF
                        Where?

                                 GUY LANCOT
                        Kabul. None in Lashkar Gah.

                                 DANIEL WOLF
                        I am going to need to see your 
                        photos.

           Daniel picks up the phone.

                                 DANIEL WOLF (CONT’D)
                             (to phone)
                        Could we have a few more beers sent 
                        up?
                             (to Guy)
                        To thank you.

           Liz comes into Col. Kinross’ office. 
                                 COL. KINROSS
                        How can I help you?

                                 LIZ
                        We have cleared the military.

                                 COL. KINROSS
                        The issue is insubordination.

                                 LIZ
                        There are reports of more sick in 
                        Malakhan.

                                 COL. KINROSS
                        So you and Jallal have kissed and 
                        made up?

                                 LIZ
                        We need to get someone down there 
                        right away.

                                 COL. KINROSS
                        It’s too dangerous, the area around 
                        there has seen heavy fighting and 
                        there is still no concrete 
                        evidence. Once there is evidence-

                                 LIZ
                        Once there is evidence it could be 
                        too late. 

                                 COL. KINROSS
                        Dr. Scott this isn’t the tail 
                        wagging the dog. You do not make 
                        decisions here. I do. You want ISAF 
                        support, respect chain of command, 
                        respect that there are more things 
                        at play here than an outbreak, and 
                        respect me.

                                 LIZ

           Thérèse disembarks the plane. Waiting at the gate are two CIA 
           Agents, MILLER (female, white, 40’s) and HERNANDEZ (male, 
           Hispanic, 30’s). Thérèse does not notice them. They stop her.

                        Could you follow us?

           Malik makes his way towards his truck. He gets in. Waddan is

           EVENING

           Thérèse is seated at a table across from Hernandez and Miller 
           in a room with nothing but seats, an interview table, and a 
           one-way mirror. Thérèse is visibly nervous. Hernandez starts 
           recording. 
                                 MILLER
                        Interview with Thérèse Diop, March 
                        24th. What is your reason for being 
                        in Paris? 

                                 THERESE DIOP
                        I am here to compare lab samples-

                                 MILLER
                        The Pasteur Institute informed us 
                        you are looking at security 
                        footage.

           Thérèse does not know what to say.

                                 HERNANDEZ
                        You have also been looking into who 
                        had access to EBOV-1 samples in 
                        London and Atlanta.

                                 MILLER
                        Would you like to tell us again 
                        what you are doing in Paris?

           Thérèse thinks. 

                                 THERESE DIOP
                        Can I make a call?

                                 HERNANDEZ
                        Please answer the question.

                                 THERESE DIOP
                        The samples from Afghanistan 
                        matched exactly samples from the 
                        original 1976 outbreak in Zaire. 

           EXT. DESHU - EVENING

           Malik drives up the dirt road highway from Deshu. Another 
           beaten up white truck appears and starts to gain on Malik. It 
           drives up beside him and four men with guns waive for him to 
           pull over. He tries to increase his speed but his truck 
           cannot pull away from the insurgents. 

           The man in the driver’s seat shoots a warning shot. Malik 
           breaks quickly, out of reflex. The insurgent’s truck lurches 
           in front of him, cutting him off and blocking his ability to 
           go forward. 

           Malik puts the truck in reverse, but one of the insurgents 
           BLOWS out his front tire causing him to skid off the dirt 
           road. 
           Malik tries to put the car in drive but the wheels just spin 
           in the sand. 

           Two insurgents with guns come up to his side of the door. He 
           climbs over the seats as they break his window, unlock the 
           door, and drag him out.

           One of the insurgents puts a bag over his head and they put 
           him in the trunk of their truck. They drive away along the 
           desolate dirt road. 

           INT. WHO LASHKAR GAH FIELD OFFICE - NIGHT

           The office is almost empty. Liz is making a call. A woman in 
           a burqa is escorted by Calum (20’s), an Irish private 
           security guard. He carries a gun prominently. The woman takes 
           off the burqa, it is Karin. Liz hangs up the phone. 

                                 LIZ
                        Calum, can you put the gun away 
                        while in the office please?

                                 CALUM
                        It’s for your own safety miss.

                                 LIZ
                        I can’t think with it in the 
                        office.

                                 CALUM
                        I’ll wait in the hall. 

           Calum leaves. 

                                 KARIN ANDERSSON
                        At least this one doesn’t call you 
                        ma’am.

                                 LIZ
                        Thérèse never showed up at the 
                        Pasteur Institute and there is a 
                        fresh outbreak in Malakhan that we 
                        have no proof of.

                                 KARIN ANDERSSON
                        How many in Malakhan?

                                 LIZ
                        We don’t know.

                        Is Malik back?

           Liz realizes.

                                 LIZ
                        No.

                                 KARIN ANDERSSON
                        He should be.

           Liz gets up and starts to pace.

                                 LIZ
                        This is all we need.

                                 KARIN ANDERSSON
                        This is Malik’s life we’re talking 
                        about.

           Liz stops pacing.

                                 LIZ
                        I know.

                                 KARIN ANDERSSON
                        Then what are we going to do?

                                 LIZ
                        Go to his house and check he isn’t 
                        there. I’ll make some calls.

           INT. HELMAND HOUSE - NIGHT

           Malik, with his head still covered, is brought into a dark 
           house. He is led by two insurgents into the house, one is 
           Waddan and the other is PARWAIZ (20’s).  There is a senior 
           man DAOUD (30’s) waiting. Their conversation is in Pashto. 
           Malik is scared but trying to remain calm.

                                 DAOUD
                        You are a doctor?

                                 MALIK BENCHARIF
                        Yes. Please I was just checking-

                                 DAOUD
                        We need you to look at two of our 
                        men. They are sick.

                                 MALIK BENCHARIF
                        With?
                                 DAOUD
                        The disease the Westerners brought. 
                        These men spent two nights in 
                        interrogation and when they were 
                        released they got sick. Blood out 
                        of their mouths, blood bubbles on 
                        their feet.

                                 MALIK BENCHARIF
                        It’s highly contagious. I need 
                        medical-

           Daoud throws some doctor cover-alls and plastic gloves.

                                 MALIK BENCHARIF (CONT’D)
                        This is not good enough.

           Daoud emphasizes the gun he is holding.

                                 DAOUD
                        Yes it is.

           Malik looks terrified, but holds his ground.

                                 MALIK BENCHARIF
                        I would rather be shot than die of 
                        Ebola.

           Daoud nods. Malik braces for a gun shot.

                                 DAOUD
                        What else do you need?

                        They think it was Al-Qaeda.

           EXT. HELMAND PROVINCE UNKNOWN - NIGHT

           Malik, with the bag back over his head and wearing the 
           medical gear, is being guided through a small village by 
           Waddan and Parwaiz. 

           The village is at the base of a ridge. The only thing that 
           can be heard is the sound of the wind, and the crunching of 
           the ground under their feet. They come to a small hut whose 
           windows have been sealed by towels.

           INT. HELMAND HUT - CONTINUOUS

           Malik enters. There are two very sick AFGHAN MEN. They can 
           barely react to his presence. He approaches them slowly.

                        I had to deal with the American 
                        Ambassador last night. Completely 
                        unaware that apparently we have 
                        identified the outbreak’s 
                        morphology-

                        We have a problem.

                        Dr. Bencharif is missing and we 
                        have reports of a new outbreak.

           Helene looks incredibly frustrated.

                                 HELENE LUND
                        How many newly infected? 

                                 LIZ
                        No proof, just rumors at this point 
                        but Jallal must have been pretty 
                        certain to reach out.

           Karin wakes up, her neck is sore from the weird sleeping 
           position.  She looks over to Liz. 

                                 HELENE LUND
                        What happened with Malik? Why 
                        wasn’t-

                        He went to Deshu yesterday and he 
                        has not returned.

                                 HELENE LUND
                        With a security detail?

                                 LIZ
                        He thought travelling without would 
                        raise the least questions.

           Helene bangs the table with her fists.

                                 HELENE LUND
                        How long?

                        I’ll call the French Ambassador.

                        I’m not leaving with a new outbreak-

                        If it is confirmed, I might rethink 
                        my position.

                                 LIZ
                        I won’t go.

                                 HELENE LUND
                        The Americans want our report, they 
                        have a leak suspect, and they want 
                        it by tomorrow. Then you are being

                        You have been blacklisted by the 
                        military and the fucking Afghans. 
                        One of your men has disappeared ON 
                        YOUR WATCH, and I had to find out 
                        that this outbreak is BIOTERRORISM 
                        from a man whose job it is to pour

                                 HELENE LUND
                        A Tunisian, Dr. Abdessalem, had 
                        access. He has been under 
                        surveillance. I will send you the 
                        file. All checks out. He met with 
                        an Afghan man with connections to 
                        Al-Qaeda. This operative travelled 
                        with a British born Afghan who 
                        spent time, three years ago, in a 
                        rehab centre in the Cotswolds for 
                        Opiate addiction. 

                                 LIZ
                        You’re kidding me?

                                 HELENE LUND
                        No.

           Liz is trying to piece everything together.

                                 LIZ
                        The logs were missing though.

                                 HELENE LUND
                        Write the report, have it on my 
                        desk by midnight. 
                                 LIZ
                        What about Dr. Bencharif?

                                 HELENE LUND
                        I think you have done enough on

                        Fuck! FUCK! FUUUUUUUCK!

           INT. HELMAND HOUSE - MORNING

           Daoud is eating. Malik is sitting on the ground, on a bright 
           patterned rug. They speak in Pashto. 

                                 MALIK BENCHARIF
                        They will die if they don’t get 
                        medical treatment. There is-

                                 DAOUD
                        No. 

                                 MALIK BENCHARIF
                        I can take them with me. All I need 
                        is a truck. 

                                 DAOUD
                        You will stay here. Help them get 
                        better.

                                 MALIK BENCHARIF
                        I can’t do anything. 

                                 DAOUD
                        They are wanted men.

                                 MALIK BENCHARIF
                        They were let go.

                                 DAOUD
                        To infect us.

                                 MALIK BENCHARIF
                        They will die here.
                                 DAOUD
                        This is their home.

                                 MALIK BENCHARIF
                        It will spread.

                                 DAOUD
                        It already has.

           INT. NORTH KIVU - DAY

           Daniel gets off a small, barely functional plane, on a single 
           strip airfield in the middle of the central African 
           rainforest. He is fanning himself with his case files. You 
           can almost see the humid heat in the air it is so thick. 
           Laurent accompanies him.

           INT. WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION HELENE’S OFFICE - DAY

           Helene greets Thérèse. 

                                 HELENE LUND
                        How was Paris?

                                 THERESE DIOP
                        We should have informed you. I 
                        apologize. 

                                 HELENE LUND
                        You are not to blame. You 
                        identified the strain similarities. 
                        Impressive.

                                 THERESE DIOP
                        Not similarities. They are 
                        identical.

                                 HELENE LUND
                        Yes. Well I think your work really 
                        speaks for itself.

                                 THERESE DIOP
                        Thank you.

                                 HELENE LUND
                        I would like you to take over the 
                        mission in Helmand.

                                 THERESE DIOP
                        I work for the CDC.

           Helene takes out a contract. 
                                 HELENE LUND
                        I’d like to offer you a job here.

           INT. CAMP BASTION COMMAND - DAY

           Liz is being shown into Col. Kinross’ office by Lt. 
           Parkinson.

                                 COL. KINROSS
                        I’m sorry to hear about your 
                        doctor. I just received a call from 
                        the French Foreign Minister. 

           Col. Kinross looks at some files. He takes out a picture of 
           Malik’s truck. 

                                 COL. KINROSS (CONT’D)
                        Tires shot out, window broken. Is 
                        this his?

           Liz clutches the back of a chair. Her knees go weak for a 
           second and then she grabs hold of herself.

                                 COL. KINROSS (CONT’D)
                        No body found. That is a good sign. 
                        Please sit down, you’ve had a 
                        shock.

           Liz sits.

                                 LIZ
                        We need to look for him.

                                 COL. KINROSS
                        I’ve been informed bioterrorism was 
                        the cause of the outbreak.

                                 LIZ
                             (confused)
                        Umm, yes, that is...our hypothesis 
                        at this point.

                                 COL. KINROSS
                        I was under the impression a report 
                        was imminent.

                                 LIZ
                        We can’t release a report blaming 
                        insurgents while they have one of 
                        our own.
                                 COL. KINROSS
                        That’s unfortunate since the 
                        reinstating of ISAF support is 
                        conditional on the report.

           Liz cannot believe it.

                                 LIZ
                        And if the report-

                                 COL. KINROSS
                        Not if, once the report is issued 
                        we will send a team into Malakhan, 
                        and as an allied organization we 
                        would be able to appropriate funds 
                        for a search mission. It is all so 
                        very bureaucratic. I do wish there 
                        was another way.

           Liz can barely contain her anger. Col. Kinross puts his hand 
           out for a shake, she looks at it, swallows her anger and 
           shakes it.

           INT. MALAKHAN HUT - DAY

           Malik, in protective gear, is examining TWO YOUNG BOYS. Their 
           FATHER is stretched out on a mattress on the floor. He is 
           very weak, and sweating. They speak in Pashto.

                                 MALIK BENCHARIF
                        You need to go to a hospital.

                                 FATHER
                        No.

                                 MALIK BENCHARIF
                        Your sons are sick too. 

                                 FATHER
                        No hospital. They will make us more 
                        sick. Western doctors come here to 
                        infect us. No.

           Malik continues examining the two children.

           INT. HELMAND HOUSE - LATER

           Malik is led into the house wearing the cloth bag over his 
           head. Waddan takes it off, and he is facing Daoud. They speak 
           in Pashto.
                                 MALIK BENCHARIF
                        I need to take them back to Lashkar 
                        Gah where we can quarantine-

                                 DAOUD
                        These men cannot go- 

                                 MALIK BENCHARIF
                        The family then. 

                                 DAOUD
                        They will not go. Some can’t, some 
                        won’t. Either way they are not-

                                 MALIK BENCHARIF
                        I need to let people know-

                                 DAOUD
                        No.

                                 MALIK BENCHARIF
                        Ninety two percent of people who 
                        have contracted this strain have 
                        died. Less than a 1 in 10 chance of 
                        survival.

           Daoud paces.

                                 MALIK BENCHARIF (CONT’D)
                        If it spreads 90 percent of the 
                        tribal region could die. It is easy 
                        to stop in the cities, but here is 
                        where it would flourish.

                                 DAOUD
                        Malakhan. That is where the sick 
                        are.

           INT. CAR: LASHKAR GAH - LATER

           Liz is on her phone being driven by Calum. 

                                 LIZ
                        I will do the report on the 
                        condition it is not released until 
                        Bencharif is located, and I remain 
                        here. Non-negotiable.

           Helene is standing in her office.
                                 HELENE LUND
                        The Americans are releasing this 
                        news tomorrow. They want it backed 
                        up by our office. Write the thing. 
                        The facts check out. You are on a 
                        military flight out of Camp Bastion 
                        tomorrow morning. Non-negotiable.

           She hangs up.

           INT. CAR: LASHKAR GAH - CONTINUOUS

           Liz bangs her phone on the door handle in anger. The screen 
           cracks. Calum puts on the radio.

                                 BBC NEWSCASTER (O.S.)
                        Reports that a French Doctor 
                        working for the World Health 
                        Organization has gone missing-

                                 LIZ
                        Turn it off for fuck’s sake!

           He does so quickly.

           EXT. NORTH KIVU HOSPITAL - MORNING

           Daniel is walking. He is speaking into a phone. 

                                 DANIEL WOLF
                        Guy Lancot did not bring Ebola to 
                        Afghanistan. None of the areas he 
                        visited are potential transmission 
                        zones.

           EXT. HELMAND PROVINCE UNKNOWN - DAY

           Malik is dropped off on the side of the road. There is 
           nothing around. An OLD MAN comes from afar and waits next to 
           him.

           INT. WHO LASHKAR GAH FIELD OFFICE - DAY

           Liz arrives at the office which is still buzzing with nervous 
           energy. Safiya comes up to Liz upset. Liz is looking for 
           Karin.

                                 SAFIYA KAPPOR
                        Have you heard anything?
                                 LIZ
                        No, I...

           She spots Karin, so she brushes off Safiya and goes to her.

                                 KARIN ANDERSSON
                        What did the Brits say?

                                 LIZ
                        We need to file the report blaming 
                        Al-Qaeda.

                                 KARIN ANDERSSON
                        What if they are the ones who have 
                        Malik?

                                 LIZ
                        The army does nothing until the 
                        report is published. Including 
                        containment in Malakhan.

                                 KARIN ANDERSSON
                        What do we do?

           Liz stops, shakes her head.

                                 LIZ
                        We write the report.

           Karin looks at her, not knowing what to answer.

                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                        The Americans are coming out with 
                        the bioterrorism angle either way.

                                 KARIN ANDERSSON
                        But Malik-

                                 LIZ
                        We are here to contain.

           Karin steps away. 

                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                        Once we write the report he becomes 
                        their priority.

                                 KARIN ANDERSSON
                        This is a friend’s life.

                                 LIZ
                        It is so much more than-
                                 KARIN ANDERSSON
                        We are doctors, we help.

                                 LIZ
                        That’s what we are trying to do.

                                 KARIN ANDERSSON
                        Then why does it feel...

                                 LIZ
                        What do the files they sent over 
                        say?

                                 KARIN ANDERSSON
                        That it was Al-Qaeda.

           INT. HELMAND HEALTH MINISTRY LASHKAR GAH - NIGHT

           Liz enters Jallal’s office. He leaves the door open.

                                 LIZ
                        We found the source of the 
                        outbreak. 

                                 JALLAL
                        Your photographer.

                        While he was in the Congo he did 
                        not visit any of the hotspots-

                                 JALLAL
                        Then who?

                                 LIZ
                        Al-Qaeda.

                                 JALLAL
                        No. Not to their own people.

                                 LIZ
                        We believe it was accidental. They 
                        were planning to use it in Europe 
                        or America but one of operatives 
                        handling it had a former drug 
                        problem-

                                 JALLAL
                        Are you saying this publicly?

                                 LIZ
                        We are releasing a report tomorrow.
           Jallal is angry.

                                 JALLAL
                        Do you know what that will do? You 
                        are making yourself, all of us, a 
                        target.

           Liz bows her head in apology.

                                 LIZ
                        Just keeping you in the loop.

                                 JALLAL
                        Why haven’t you gone to Malakhan?

                                 LIZ
                        That is the next step.

                                 JALLAL
                        I see.

           Jallal gets up, indicating the meeting is over.

           EXT. HELMAND PROVINCE UNKNOWN - NIGHT

           Malik and The Old Man continue to wait. Finally an old Soviet-
           era van comes up. It is the bus to Lashkar Gah. The two men 
           file into the already overcrowded van.

           EXT. WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION - MORNING

           A BBC Newscaster stands outside on the manicured grass.

                                 BBC NEWSCASTER
                        The World Health Organization today 
                        released a controversial report 
                        blaming the recent Ebola outbreak 
                        on Al-Qaeda operatives. The WHO 
                        asserts the disease was accidently 
                        passed from a member of the group 
                        to a heroin addict in Lashkar Gah. 
                        This echoes similar reports last 
                        year of the bubonic plague 
                        spreading through an Al-Qaeda 
                        training camp in Algeria after 
                        accidental exposure. 

           INT. WHO LASHKAR GAH FIELD OFFICE - MORNING

           Liz and Karin come in together. Safiya stops them.
                                 LIZ
                        Any word?

                                 SAFIYA KAPOOR
                        No, but Dr. Lund from Geneva has 
                        been trying you for the last hour.

                                 LIZ
                        God what time is it there?

                                 KARIN
                        6:45 Am. I bet she’s been up since 
                        4:30.

                                 LIZ
                        I’m sure she’s not happy we weren’t 
                        on that plane.

           Liz goes over to her desk, starts dialing the phone. 

           INT. WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION HELENE’S OFFICE

           Helene is sitting in front of her prime view. Angry but calm.

                                 HELENE LUND
                        You missed your flight. 

           INTERCUT BETWEEN THE TWO ON THE PHONE

                                 LIZ
                        We were up all night finishing that 
                        report. 

                                 HELENE LUND
                        There is another flight this 
                        afternoon and if you aren’t on it I 
                        swear to god I will fire you, and 
                        Karin too. Thérèse is going to run 
                        the field office and can handle it 
                        from here. Am I making myself-

                                 LIZ
                        Crystal.
                             (to Karin)
                        She says she’ll fire you if you’re 
                        not on the plane this afternoon. 

           Karin gives a middle finger to the phone. Malik walks in 
           sweaty and tired, but alive. 

                                 KARIN ANDERSSON
                        I can’t-
                                 LIZ
                             (unbelieving)
                        I have to go, Bencharif just walked 
                        in the front door. 

           Liz hangs up.

                                 HELENE LUND
                        Hello?

           She gets a dial tone. Tries to call back. Nothing.

                                 HELENE LUND (CONT’D)
                             (yelling to her assistant)
                        GET DR. SCOTT ON THE PHONE!

           END OF INTERCUTTING

           INT. WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION - CONTINUOUS

           Malik is hugged by a bunch of staff members. Liz stands off 
           to the side watching, relieved. Karin hugs Malik, and then a 
           big one from Safiya. He tries to go towards Liz, but people 
           keep hugging him and talking to him. Finally he breaks free 
           and makes it over to Liz. 

                                 LIZ
                        You don’t know how happy I am to 
                        see you. 

                                 MALIK BENCHARIF
                        There are more cases. 

                                 LIZ
                        You saw them?

                                 MALIK BENCHARIF
                        Yes in-

           Liz picks up the phone. She starts dialling. 

                                 LIZ
                        Malakhan. 

           He looks at her shocked. Dr. Lund starts yelling on the 
           phone. 

                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                             (to phone)
                        Malik has confirmed the new cases.

           Liz passes Malik the phone.
                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                        You tell her.

           INT. MALIK’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Malik is sleeping. He is freshly showered, and fast asleep. 
           There is a stern knock at the door. He wakes slightly, the 
           knocking gets louder. He gets out of bed and puts on a shirt. 
           He opens the door. Miller and Hernandez are standing at his 
           door, there are American soldiers behind them. 

                                 HERNANDEZ
                        Sir, could you come with us? We 
                        need to ask you a few questions.

                                 MILLER
                        If you could get dressed.

                                 MALIK BENCHARIF
                        Questions about what?

           Hernandez steps inside the apartment forcing the door open. 
           It is intimidating.

                                 MILLER
                        Get dressed sir. 

           INT. CAMP BASTION COMMAND - DAY

           Liz is in a meeting with Col. Kinross, CRP WILLIAM GREGGS 
           (American, 50’s), and MAJORGENERAL HENRIK SOGAARD (Danish, 
           60’s).

                                 COL. KINROSS
                        This village is close to the 
                        Helmand River. We have a concern if 
                        it contaminates the water supply it 
                        could spread to Pakistan. We need 
                        to act fast on this.

                                 MAJORGENERAL SOGAARD
                        Why have there been no other 
                        reports of Ebola?

                                 LIZ
                        The Health Ministry has heard 
                        rumors of new cases, but locals 
                        have been apprehensive to travel to 
                        hospitals. The rumors of this being 
                        a Western plot have convinced some 
                        people in the tribal regions.

                        Also violence along the roads from 
                        the Spring Offensive hasn’t helped. 

                                 MAJORGENERAL SOGAARD
                        The Taliban has put out a video 
                        blaming The WHO for the outbreak in 
                        response to the report.

                                 CRP. GREGGS
                        Before launching a mission we need 
                        confirmation-

                                 LIZ
                        Dr. Bencharif treated cases, he 
                        assures-

                                 CRP. GREGGS
                        How did he just walk out of an Al-
                        Qaeda cave?

           Col. Kinross tries to get the group back on track.

                                 COL. KINROSS
                        We will send a team down to 
                        confirm, and once we have word we 
                        can start planning on how to 
                        CONTAIN this.

                                 LIZ
                        That’s a waste of time.

                                 COL. KINROSS
                        Due diligence.

                                 LIZ
                        Unfortunately outbreaks are not 
                        bureaucratic.

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT

           Malik is being questioned by Hernandez and Miller in a small 
           room that is usually used for insurgent interrogations.

                                 HERNANDEZ
                        Our difficulty is that these people 
                        don’t usually let Western workers 
                        walk out.

                                 MALIK BENCHARIF
                        Their people are dying.

                                 MILLER
                        From a disease they released.
           Malik is being pushed, and he is taking the bait.

                                 MALIK BENCHARIF
                        They say their men were infected 
                        with it when they were interrogated 
                        by the Americans. 

                                 HERNANDEZ
                        You believe the American government 
                        engages in bioterrorism?

                                 MALIK BENCHARIF
                        I am just saying what they told me.

                                 MILLER
                        Have you told anyone else of these 
                        allegations?

                                 MALIK BENCHARIF
                        No.

                                 HERNANDEZ
                        But you believed them?

                                 MALIK BENCHARIF
                        They believed it.

                                 HERNANDEZ
                        How do you know?

                                 MALIK BENCHARIF
                        If this was an Al-Qaeda accident 
                        they work in cells right, so other 
                        cells wouldn’t be made aware-

                                 HERNANDEZ
                        You seem to know an awful lot about 
                        their organization. 

                                 MALIK BENCHARIF
                        I’ve been here for a year. It’s my 
                        job to know. 

                                 HERNANDEZ
                        Start from the beginning.

           Liz and Karin are working together. Looking over a map of the 
           village in question. Pte. Tarr and Cpl. Turner are standing 
           in the back. Their security detail has been reinstated. 
           Safiya comes over.

                        The Taliban just released a video 
                        condemning the report, the WHO, and 
                        calling for our deaths.

                                 KARIN ANDERSSON
                        Like they didn’t want us dead a few 
                        days ago.

           Liz goes back to studying the map.

                                 SAFIYA KAPOOR
                        Any news on Malik?

                                 LIZ
                        I’ve been assured it’s just a 
                        routine debrief.

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Malik looks worn out from hours of questioning. Hernandez and 
           Miller look as fresh as when they showed up at his door. 

                                 MILLER
                        Start from the beginning. 

           INT. WHO LASHKAR GAH FIELD OFFICE - NIGHT

           Liz and Karin are still at the desk working. Karin’s leaning 
           her head on her hands. Her eyes shut, and her head starts to 
           bob, her head slips and she wakes back up with a jolt. Liz 
           smiles.

                                 LIZ
                        I think we’re done. 

                                 KARIN ANDERSSON
                        Yes, I think you’re right.

           Liz stretches. Looks over to Cpl. Turner and Pte. Tarr, both 
           asleep.

                                 LIZ
                        You wake them up. 

                                 KARIN ANDERSSON
                        You do it, they already hate you. 

           Liz laughs. 
                                 LIZ
                        True enough. Forward the office 
                        phone to my Skype.

                                 KARIN ANDERSSON
                             (sarcastic)
                        I’m always impressed at the time 
                        you give yourself to disengage from 
                        the office.

                                 LIZ
                        It’s always been a strength of 
                        mine.

           Liz walks over to the soldiers at the door.

                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                             (yelling)
                        Wake up!

           Both men wake up and grab their guns. The two women laugh. 

                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                        We’re going home. 

           EXT. WHO LASHKAR GAH FIELD OFFICE - NIGHT

           Pte. Tarr and Cpl. Turner head out, followed by Liz and 
           Karin. A SECURITY GUARD locks the doors behind them. Liz 
           shivers. 

                                 LIZ
                        Cold tonight.

                                 KARIN ANDERSSON
                        I love this weather. 

           Pte. Tarr goes to a truck across the street and he gets in, 
           when TWO MEN appear out of a car. Cpl. Turner is distracted,  
           still not fully awake.

                                 KARIN ANDERSSON (CONT’D)
                        Imagine wearing hijab in the height 
                        of summer.

           The two men aim their guns, Cpl. Turner notices, goes for his 
           gun when they OPEN FIRE. Cpl. Turner is immediately hit and 
           killed. Karin goes running towards the doors while Liz goes 
           in the opposite direction towards the truck. Pte. Tarr gets 
           out of the truck as Karin fights with the locked door. She is 
           SHOT repeatedly. 
           Gunman 2 aims at Liz but he is taken out by a BULLET from 
           Tarr. Liz jumps in the truck. Gunman 1 gets behind a parked 
           car.

                                 LIZ
                        Karin? Oh my god.

           Pte. Tarr and Gunman 1 trade SHOTS from behind their 
           vehicles. Gunman 1 SHOOTS Tarr in the shoulder, but Tarr 
           keeps SHOOTING. Karin lying on the ground bleeding out is 
           reaching for the door handle. Liz is crouched in the 
           backseat. 

                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                        You are going to be ok. 

           Gunman 1 walks towards Karin from behind the protection of 
           the car, Tarr SHOOTS at him, while he SHOOTS Karin. Her body 
           goes limp. Tarr continues SHOOTING until the gunman falls. 

           Liz goes to get out of the truck, but Tarr instructs her to 
           stay in. Tarr is bleeding out of his shoulder. He bangs on 
           the door to the Field Office but the Security Guard does not 
           open it. He scans the area. No one. 

           Tarr gets down and checks Karin’s pulse. Nothing. 

           Liz in the back seat sees him signal nothing, so she gets out 
           of the truck and goes towards Karin’s body. Tarr checks 
           Turner. Nothing.

                                 PTE. JIMMY TARR
                        Stay in the vehicle. 

           Liz does not obey and continues walking. Tarr goes towards 
           her and grabs her with his good arm.

                                 PTE. JIMMY TARR (CONT’D)
                        When I say stay in the vehicle. You 
                        stay.

           He roughly shoves her in the truck. 

           INT. CAMP BASTION WOMEN’S QUARTERS - NIGHT

           Liz sits on the end of her bed, it is the same room her, 
           Karin and Thérèse shared. For the first time she cries. Her 
           cell phone rings. It is Helene. She stops crying and picks 
           up. 

                                 LIZ
                        Hello.
           INT. HELENE’S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           Helene is standing with a glass of wine. It looks like she 
           might also have been crying.

                                 HELENE LUND
                        How are you?

           INTERCUT BETWEEN THE TWO

                                 LIZ
                        She was a good doctor, you know.

                                 HELENE LUND
                        That’s why I sent her. 

                                 LIZ
                        What was she, 28?

                                 HELENE LUND

           Liz tears up again but fights it. 

                                 LIZ
                        You remember 27?

                                 HELENE LUND
                        Come home.

           Liz gets up and paces.

                                 LIZ
                        We went to Antibes that year. We 
                        took three weeks off. I think that 
                        was the last time I went on 
                        holiday. Your tits in that black 
                        bikini...

                                 HELENE LUND
                        Please Liz, just come home.

                                 LIZ
                        You know I can’t. 

                                 HELENE LUND
                        I could recall you. 

                                 LIZ
                        I would stay anyways. 

                                 HELENE LUND
                        Come back to that office and that 
                        life on hold.
                                 LIZ
                        We can never go back. You said 
                        that. This is my life.

                                 HELENE LUND
                        You can. We can. Thérèse can handle 
                        Helmand. You are not-

                                 LIZ
                        I’m staying Helene. You know that.

           Helene now fights back tears.

                                 HELENE LUND
                        I’m asking...I’m asking for me. 
                        Please, let this go.

                                 LIZ
                        Is Bencharif still in debrief? 

                                 HELENE LUND
                        As far as I know.

                                 LIZ
                        Get him out. Do that for me?

                                 HELENE LUND
                        I’ve put my neck out for you-

                                 LIZ
                        No you haven’t. Not once. Ever. GET 
                        HIM OUT. I don’t care what you do. 
                        Call that fucking Ambassador and 
                        stand up for YOUR team, not theirs.

           Helene goes back to business.

                                 HELENE LUND
                        I’ll do what I can. Thérèse arrives 
                        tomorrow.

           Liz hangs up, she breaks down.

           INT. WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION - MORNING

           Liz comes in. The office is empty except for Malik. They both 
           look like shit. 

                                 MALIK BENCHARIF
                        How are you?

                                 LIZ
                        Let’s not.
           Malik nods. 

                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                        We have confirmation of cases.

                                 MALIK BENCHARIF
                        I know I saw them with my own eyes.

                                 LIZ
                        Official.

           Liz passes him a file. He looks through it.

                                 MALIK BENCHARIF
                        They got all of this in under 24 
                        hours? The houses, the people 
                        infected, where they are in 
                        relation-

                                 LIZ
                        Or they needed me to sign off on 
                        the report and it was more likely 
                        using containment as their 
                        bargaining chip.

                                 MALIK BENCHARIF
                        Do you believe that report?

                                 LIZ
                        The facts check out.

                                 MALIK BENCHARIF
                        Others are saying-

                                 LIZ
                        You believe the insurgents?

                                 MALIK BENCHARIF
                        I don’t think either tells the 
                        truth.

                                 LIZ
                        You haven’t been cleared for the 
                        mission.

                                 MALIK BENCHARIF
                        Are you kidding?

                                 LIZ
                        I’m sorry.

                                 MALIK BENCHARIF
                        It’s not you. 
           Malik goes to his desk. Liz goes to hers.

           EXT. CAMP BASTION - MORNING

           Liz greats Thérèse warmly, as Amit comes over.

                                 AMIT KHAN
                        Sorry about Dr. Andersson.

                                 LIZ
                        Malakhan. 10 km north of Deshu. 
                        Military has identified houses with 
                        suspected sick with the help of 
                        elders. So we get the patients and 
                        decontaminate the dwellings. In and 
                        out.

           Lt. Parkinson walks up.

                                 LT. PARKINSON
                        You ready? 

           EXT. SOUTH-CENTRAL HELMAND - DAY

           The convoy of military vehicles, MedEvacs, and tanks makes it 
           way down the same dirt highway where the last convey was 
           attacked. The area looks battle scared. Evidence of bombing 
           is all around. The desert is scarred with war.

           EXT. MALAKHAN - DAY

           The military convoy drives up to this small town at the base 
           of a sand colored ridge. About a hundred dwellings make up 
           the village. Soldiers begin to make protective formations. 
           Liz gets out of her military vehicle followed by Thérèse, and 
           Khan. There are other doctors from WHO, and MSF.

           The doctors suit up in their protective medical coverings. So 
           do soldiers and translators. They disperse through the 
           village.

           INT. MALAKHAN HUT - DAY

           Liz enters a house. There is a woman on a bed. Two other dead 
           bodies. PTE. KEARNS and Translator follow.

                                 LIZ
                        Get body bags.
                                 PTE. KEARNS
                        Right.

           Pte. Kearns leaves.

           EXT. MALAKHAN - CONTINUOUS

           Doctors and soldiers lead sick to MedEvacs.

           Liz, Thérèse, and Khan lead soldiers with decontamination 
           equipment (hoses with spray bags attached to their back) to 
           different dwellings. 

           Men from the village start to congregate near the doctors. 
           Soldiers push them back. One of them is restrained.

           More sick are helped into the MedEvacs. Others who fear the 
           Westerners are being forced into the MedEvacs. This angers 
           locals.

           People who have possibly come into contact with Ebola are put 
           in protective suits and put in the back of the MedEvacs with 
           the sick. 

           The young men start to push at the soldiers. A fight breaks 
           out between four YOUNG MEN and a soldier at the far end of 
           the village. The soldier’s gun accidentally DISCHARGES in one 
           of the young men’s feet. The locals start to congregate, 
           yelling in Pashto.

           INT. MALAKHAN HUT - CONTINUOUS

           Liz is decontaminating the hut when she reacts to the 
           gunshot. She comes outside-

           She is faced by a growing mob of people from the village, 
           they start to throw stones. Soldiers start SHOOTING into the 
           air to disperse the crowd. They do not. 

           Khan is helping the young man who was shot in the foot. Lt. 
           Parkinson approaches Liz.

                                 LT. PARKINSON
                        We need to get the MedEvac’s out.

                                 LIZ
                        I have one more to evacuate.
                                 LT. PARKINSON
                        Get on with it.

           Liz runs towards Thérèse. 

                                 LIZ
                        How many do you have left?

                                 THERESE DIOP
                        Just decontamination.

                                 LIZ
                        Make sure everyone’s cleared their 
                        area! 

           The soldiers FIRE some more rounds. This buys them some time, 
           but the riot is picking up. Men start to form on the ridge. 
           Liz runs back into her hut.

           Trucks appear in the distance.

                                 LT. PARKINSON 
                        This isn’t good! 

           Some Medevac and a portion of the convoy start making their 
           way out of the village. 

           Khan has to leave the shot boy, because the crowd is now 
           throwing rocks at him too.

           Liz reaches a group of SOLDIERS.

                                 SOLDIER
                        You have to go back!

                                 LIZ
                        There are more patients.

                                 SOLDIER
                        We are evacuating.

           Liz pushes past the soldier. He follows her. Stones are 
           raining down all around them.

                                 LIZ
                        Either help me or fuck off.

           Soldiers start to trade GUNFIRE with insurgents on the ridge. 
           The riot continues, and the men in trucks arriving in the 
           distance start shooting. It is chaos.

           Liz reaches a hut. 
           INT. MALAKHAN HUT - CONTINUOUS

           Liz enters, followed by the soldier. There is a sick looking 
           older woman. No one else.

           Liz motions for her to come with. The old woman shakes her 
           head. Stands strong.

                                 LIZ
                        We need a translator.

                                 SOLDIER
                        You won’t get someone through that 
                        lot.

                                 LIZ
                        Wait outside.

           EXT. MALAKHAN - CONTINUOUS

           Thérèse cannot get back into the village. She is held by 
           soldiers at the armored trucks.

                        Where is Liz?

           Soldiers and medical personnel are making their way into the 
           trucks. 

           Lt. Parkinson is rounding up the soldiers. She speaks into 
           her radio. Thérèse approaches.

                                 LT. PARKINSON
                        We need air cover. Over.

                                 THERESE DIOP
                        Liz is still in the village.

                                 LT. PARKINSON
                        She has two minutes or we leave 
                        without her. Get in a vehicle.

           Thérèse goes towards the village. Lt. Parkinson grabs her. 

                                 LT. PARKINSON (CONT’D)
                        Get in the truck. That is an order.
           INT. MALAKHAN HUT - CONTINUOUS

           Liz tries to usher the old woman out of the hut but she won’t 
           move off the bed. 

                                 SOLDIER (O.S.)
                        The trucks are leaving Doctor!

           Liz puts her hands together like she is praying. This does 
           nothing to move the old woman. A shot comes through the 
           window startling Liz. She makes a decision and grabs the 
           woman’s arm and forces it behind her back in an armlock. The 
           woman yells out in pain. Liz forces her to her feet. 

                                 LIZ
                        Sorry.

                                 SOLDIER (O.S.)
                        WE NEED TO GO!

           EXT. MALAKHAN - CONTINUOUS

           The last of the trucks start to leave. Liz and the soldier 
           are running through as stones from the riot and GUNFIRE from 
           the ridge rain down. The soldiers are retreating, and the old 
           woman is fighting Liz. 

           A stone flies down and hits Liz in the face. Under her 
           medical gear her nose starts to bleed. Gun fire breaks out 
           between soldiers and people in the village. The men from the 
           trucks have reached the village. 

           An Afgahn woman carrying a crying child runs away from the 
           chaos. A stray bullet HITS the woman. It is impossible to 
           tell from which side it came. Liz wants to go towards the 
           screaming child, but she cannot with the old woman fighting 
           her. Liz reaches the last MedEvac and motions for the 
           soldiers to get the old woman in. She spits at Liz and it 
           lands on her protective gear.

           A soldier is SHOT. Other soldiers drag him into a vehicle. 

           Liz gets into the vehicle watching the chaos.

           The armored trucks starts to move out of the area. It 
           receives GUN FIRE. 

           A TALIBAN INSURGENT raises a rocket launcher and aims it at 
           the truck. When two planes appear in the distance.

           The Taliban insurgent tries to aim for the planes. This 
           allows the truck to get out of range. 
           INT. ARMORED TRUCK: OUTSIDE MALAKHAN - CONTINUOUS

           Liz is bleeding from her nose, but has to keep in her 
           protective gear.

                                 LT. PARKINSON
                        They were fucking waiting for us. 
                        We were sitting ducks. No wonder 
                        they let your doctor go.

           She looks out the window to the village disappearing in the 
           background. The planes drop bombs on the ridge 
           indiscriminately. One hits the village. 

           Liz starts to feel sick, but she has to hold it in. She is 
           chocking on the blood in her hazmat helmet and begins to 
           panic. Lt. Parkinson notices, but Liz gets herself together, 
           gasping for breath but eventually able to steady her 
           breathing. 

           She looks back out the window and all she can see is smoke 
           rising from the ridge and village.

           INT. CAMP BASTION - LATER

           Liz gets out of the truck, she removes her hazmat suit 
           carefully. There is dried blood all over her puffy face. She 
           is feeling and looking sick. She is on a mission. 

           She is met by Col. Kinross.

                                 LIZ
                        There were kids in that village.

                                 COL. KINROSS
                        We walked into an ambush.

                                 LIZ
                        What about the civilians?

                                 COL. KINROSS
                        None were targeted.

                                 LIZ
                        The village isn’t decontaminated.

                                 COL. KINROSS
                        All the sick are out. We can send 
                        in a team to disinfect-

                                 LIZ
                        You can’t drop bombs on a village 
                        with civilians.
                                 COL. KINROSS
                        I heard you forced an old woman 
                        into a MedEvac with an armlock. Is 
                        that in the doctor’s code?

                                 LIZ
                        How can you compare?

           Thérèse approaches Liz. Liz leans over and vomits.

                        Let me look at your nose.

                        I’m fine.

                                 COL. KINROSS 
                        Take her to medical.

           Liz is being examined by Thérèse.

                                 LIZ
                        What just happened?

                                 THERESE DIOP
                        I thought you understood the Spring 
                        Offensive.

                                 LIZ
                        Why do I feel like I just took part 
                        in a war crime?

           Thérèse shakes her head.

           Liz stands at the front door of an apartment in a heavily 
           guarded compound. She knocks on the door. Malik opens, he 
           looks weary.

                                 LIZ
                        How are you?

                        I just spent twenty four hours with 
                        the Americans.

                                 LIZ
                        Have they cleared you?
                                 MALIK BENCHARIF
                        They let me out. I don’t know if 
                        that is the same thing.

                                 LIZ
                        You resigned?

                        I’m happy for you.

                                 MALIK BENCHARIF
                        The Malakhan mission was a success 
                        then?

                                 LIZ
                        In some ways.

                                 MALIK BENCHARIF
                        Containment?

                                 LIZ
                        Yes. No new reports of cases.

                                 MALIK BENCHARIF
                        That is what you came here to do.

           Malik goes to close the door. Liz stops it.

                                 LIZ
                        I released that report knowing it 
                        could get you killed.

                                 MALIK BENCHARIF
                        I know.

                                 LIZ
                        I’m sorry.

                                 MALIK BENCHARIF
                        Would you do it differently?

           Liz doesn’t respond.

                                 MALIK BENCHARIF (CONT’D)
                        If you wouldn’t change your actions 
                        you shouldn’t apologize.

                                 LIZ
                        More died than they’re saying. 
                                 MALIK BENCHARIF
                        Goodbye Liz.

           Liz holds the door open.

                                 LIZ
                        It wasn’t just the military. They 
                        played you too.

           You can see Malik knows it’s true and it hurts him.

                                 MALIK BENCHARIF
                        We are supposed to help, not harm.

                                 LIZ
                        Greater good.

                                 MALIK BENCHARIF
                        That’s not in the oath.

                                 THERESE DIOP
                        I need you here.

                                 DANIEL WOLF
                        Scott will leave me if I come back. 

                                 THERESE DIOP
                        I can’t do this without you.

                                 DANIEL WOLF
                        After what happened to Karin. I 
                        don’t...

                                 THERESE DIOP
                        You have the experience.

           He says nothing. 

                                 THERESE DIOP (CONT’D)
                        If you tell me you do not want to 
                        come help, then ok. But don’t use 
                        Scott as an excuse.

           Daniel thinks.
                                 DANIEL WOLF
                        If he leaves me you better pull 
                        some strings to get me a job in 
                        Geneva.

                                 THERESE DIOP
                        I owe you.

           INT. WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION - MORNING

           Liz arrives at the office at 6:00 AM. The sun is coming up. 

           Liz goes to a desk in an open plan office, there is no name 
           on it. She picks up the phone.

                                 LIZ
                        I’m sorry. It seems my desk has 
                        been moved, can you tell 
                        me...eighth floor?

           Liz walks up to a large office with her name. She goes 
           inside. It has a beautiful view of the perfectly manicured 
           grass. She sits down in her seat. A knock at the door.

                                 LIZ (CONT’D)
                        Come in.

           Helene enters. Liz smiles.

                                 HELENE LUND
                        I didn’t think you would be in 
                        today.

                                 LIZ
                        I couldn’t stay at home.

                                 HELENE LUND
                        You need the rest.

           Helene comes around the desk and sits on it next to Liz. She 
           kisses Liz, Liz reciprocates then pulls out.

                                 LIZ
                        This office is bigger than my 
                        apartment.

                                 HELENE LUND
                        We made a deal. You held up your 
                        half.

                                 LIZ
                        Malakhan.
                                 HELENE LUND
                        I heard you were quite the hero.

                                 LIZ
                        They dropped bombs IN the village.

           Helene gets up. She looks at Liz with concern.

                                 HELENE LUND
                        You should talk to someone, you 
                        have just been through hell. 

                                 LIZ
                        I think I should tell someone-

                                 HELENE LUND
                        Like who?

                                 LIZ
                        The newspaper or-

                                 HELENE LUND
                        Liz that operation was done under 
                        your supervision.

                                 LIZ
                        I can’t be ok with this.

                                 HELENE LUND
                        Then there goes your career. There 
                        goes this organizations ability to 
                        do good. 

           Liz shakes her head.

                                 LIZ
                        The greater good?

                                 HELENE LUND
                        Yes.

                                 LIZ
                        Someone once told me that’s not in 
                        the Hippocratic Oath. NEVER DO HARM 
                        is.

                                 HELENE LUND
                        That person wasn’t a pragmatist. A 
                        realist. And a great fucking 
                        doctor. You are.

           Helene goes to the door.
                                 HELENE LUND (CONT’D)
                        I have meetings all day, but 
                        dinner?

                                 LIZ
                        I saw a mother shot as she was 
                        holding her child.

           Helene looks at Liz with concern.

                                 HELENE LUND
                        Call me if you want dinner.

           Helene leaves. Liz sits alone in her large office overlooking 
           the manicured grass. She opens up a document on her computer 
           with WHO letterhead. She types quickly: I hereby resign, 
           effective immediately.

           Liz pauses. Thinks. 

           An email comes up. Subject line: Cholera Cases Identified in 
           Gabon. 

           Liz deletes the resignation letter.

           End.
