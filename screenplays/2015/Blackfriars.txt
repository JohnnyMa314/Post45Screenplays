           TIGHT ON: The face of WALTER ROBINSON, early 40’s, cold blue 
           eyes and a kind smile, bald, handsome, not pretty.

                                 WALTER 
                        Look, I’m not gonna bullshit you. 
                        I’ll talk, you write what you want.
                        I got nothing to hide. I lost 
                        everything. Loyalty. Code of 
                        silence. None of these guys backed 
                        me up when I got in the shit. None 
                        of them cared. So I don’t care. 

           REVEAL: INT. A FACTORY FLOOR - DAY

           Walter sits at a grim factory table opposite an AUTHOR. Empty 
           rows of sewing machines stretch behind him into the dark. 

                                 WALTER
                        Everything I tell you is the truth. 
                        My whole life is the truth.

                                 AUTHOR 
                        Your whole life is the truth? 

           Walter nods plainly.

                                 AUTHOR (CONT’D)
                        That’s a good line. I like that.

                                 WALTER
                        Go ahead and use it.

                                 AUTHOR
                        I will. 

           The Author opens his briefcase on the table, the top 
           obscuring Walter’s view of its contents. 

           He removes a TAPE RECORDER. As the Author closes the 
           briefcase, we see a HAND GUN inside. Walter does not.

                                 WALTER
                        What you want to hear about first?

           The Author presses RECORD. A cassette begins to spin.

                                 THE AUTHOR
                        I don’t know. How about getting 
                        started at the force? Chapter 1.

           The Author smiles nervously. Walter eyes his listener. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           Hendrix’s ALL ALONG THE WATCHTOWER plays over...

           EST. BOSTON - NIGHT - 1973

           Fenway, Charlestown High Bridge - the gritty industrial 
           predecessor to the Zakim, The Gillette Factory, Dunkin’ 
           Donuts in 1970’s narrow letter font...

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        Well I came on the job in 1973. 
                        Assigned to District 5.

           EXT. BOSTON POLICE DISTRICT 5 - CONTINUOUS

           A YOUNG WALTER, 32, a fresh-faced, hulking block of a kid in 
           BPD blue, walks up the stairs to a hulking block of concrete.

           INT. BPD DISTRICT 5 - PROCESSING DESK - LATER

           Walter sits in a chair, waiting.

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        Showed up with my uniform brushed, 
                        spit shine shoes. I had been 
                        waiting for this.

           Walter nods to some passing COPS. They ignore him.

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        I was finally part of the oldest 
                        and most prestigious police force 
                        on the planet.

           INT. BPD DISTRICT 5 - PROCESSING DESK - CONTINUOUS

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        First night on the job. I was 
                        assigned the morning watch. Man, I 
                        thought we were gonna bust some 
                        heads. 12pm to 8am shift. Great 
                        shift. Bars empty out, brawls. I 
                        was ready. 

           Walter sits, hand on the holster of his gun, fucking ready.
                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        They assigned me to Eddie Green. 

           Walter looks up, as...an older cop, handsome, maybe drunk, 
           EDDIE GREEN approaches and stares blankly.

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        Nice guy. Good shape. Rugged guy. 
                        40’s. Probably on the job 10 to 15 
                        years. Handsome looking guy. 

                                 EDDIE GREEN
                        Robinson?

           Walter stands eagerly.

                                 WALTER
                        That’s me, sir.

                                 EDDIE GREEN
                        We’re takin’ the paddy wagon.

           INT. BPD PADDY WAGON - MOVING - LATER

           Eddie drives, Walter shotgun, eyeing the shotgun locked 
           between them for the real shit.

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        I get in the wagon with him. We’re 
                        ridin’ around, get a cup a coffee.

           Eddie sits at a red light, glances at the clock--12:20am.

                                 EDDIE GREEN
                        Alright we’ve fucked around enough.

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        And I’m thinkin’, alright, here we 
                        go, we’re gonna get into it.

                                 EDDIE GREEN
                        Gotta go to the cemetery. 

           EXT. GETHSEMANE CEMETERY - LATER

           The Paddy turns into the gates of the GETHSEMANE CEMETERY.

                                 WALTER (O.S.)
                        Where we going?

                                 EDDIE GREEN (O.S.)
                        We’ll see. We’ll see.
           EXT. GETHSEAMNE CEMETERY - HILL PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

           The Paddy Wagon pulls in and joins 30 some-odd other BPD 
           CRUISERS, all sitting with their lights off. Parks alongside.

           INT. PADDY WAGON - PARKED - CONTINUOUS

           Walter sits a beat, Eddie fiddling with his bag.

                                 WALTER
                        What is this?

                                 EDDIE GREEN
                        You want the front or the back?

           A beat.

                                 WALTER
                        The front or the back what? 

                                 EDDIE GREEN
                        We’re gonna get a little rest.

                                 WALTER
                        Rest? I just got up. I just took a 
                        fucking shower.

           Eddie opens a bag, and takes out his FLANNEL PAJAMAS.

           INT. PADDY WAGON - MOMENTS LATER

           Eddie Green changes into his pajamas in the back of the 
           wagon, a sheet, pillow and egg crate mattress all set up.

                                 EDDIE GREEN
                        If there’s a call, wake me up.

                                 WALTER
                        How you gonna get dressed?

                                 EDDIE GREEN
                        I’ll get dressed. I’ll get dressed.

                                 WALTER
                        This is...we’re on the job here.

                                 EDDIE GREEN
                        You want to get ahead in this job, 
                        kid? 

           Eddie reaches for the dome light...
                                 EDDIE GREEN (CONT’D)
                        Do nothing, and do it well.

           He hits it, Walter left in the dark, looking out over the 
           graves, wide awake.

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        I was ready to kick ass. Bust 
                        heads. This was NOT...

           INT. BPD DISTRICT 5 - CAPTAIN’S OFFICE - DAY

           Walter at the desk of the gigantic CAPTAIN MOOSE HANLEY.

                                 WALTER
                        ...what I signed up for.

           Moose eyes his tough rookie cop.

                                 WALTER (CONT’D)
                        I’d like a transfer.

                                 MOOSE
                        What’s the problem?

           Walter says nothing.

                                 MOOSE (CONT’D)
                        No one gets a transfer. Unless they 
                        got a damn good reason.
                             (beat)
                        You don’t have anything to tell me? 
                        About what’s going on? On the 
                        morning watch?

           Walter eyes his Captain.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. FACTORY FLOOR - DAY

                        My father, one thing he said to me, 
                        don’t be a tattle-tale. It was in 
                        your blood growin’ up in 
                        Charlestown. Just didn’t snitch.

           The Author narrows his eyes, sizing up Walter.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. BPD DISTRICT 5 - CAPTAIN’S OFFICE - DAY

           Moose narrows his eyes, sizing up Walter.

                                 MOOSE
                        Is it cause the guys are drunk? 
                        Sleeping? Digging in? Is that it?

                                 WALTER
                        I just want to see a little more 
                        action.

           Moose smiles at Walter’s loyalty. Then-

                                 MOOSE
                        You working out, kid?

                                 WALTER
                        Yeah. Yeah, I’m working out.

                                 MOOSE
                        Tell you what, you beat me in arm 
                        wrestling, I’ll find something for 
                        you.

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        He used to ask all the guys that, 
                        and then have them arm wrestle him. 
                        Moose was a monster guy.

           Moose moves a bunch of papers aside on his desk.

                                 MOOSE
                        Come on, let’s see what you got.

           Walter sits, rolls up his sleeve, an EAGLE TATTOO on his 
           powerful looking forearm, he locks hands with the Captain...

           And beats him handily.

                                 MOOSE (CONT’D)
                             (pissed, flustered)
                        Shit. What the fuck, Robinson?

           Moose gets himself under control. He eyes Walter a beat, 
           thinking, and then hands Walter a file with a wry smile.

                                 MOOSE (CONT’D)
                        Report to SCIP unit. They got some 
                        action for ya. Undercover. Big 
                        opportunity.

                                 WALTER
                        Thank you, sir.
           INT. SCIP UNIT - BRIEFING ROOM - DAY

           Walter sits with a bunch of other YOUNG COPS in uniform, 
           listening to a couple of DETECTIVES in street clothes.

                                 DETECTIVE
                        We’re lookin’ for volunteers to go

                        Prison as gods.

                                 DETECTIVE
                        Guards.

           The room BUSTS up.

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        Guy there, from St. Louis, thought 
                        they wanted us to go in as gods.
                             (beat)
                        Job was to go undercover as prison 
                        guards, and figure out which guards 
                        were dealing drugs to the 
                        prisoners. Totally on your own, on 
                        the island. Brass balls shit.

                        If you’re not interested, you can 
                        get out of here.

           Everybody gets up to leave. Every single cop. Except Walter.

           Walter patrolling cell blocks in GUARD CLOTHES, alert.

                        I was under for six months.

           Walter working out with INMATES, getting stronger.

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        Which, at the time, meant that they 
                        had to make you detective. 

           Walter hanging out with GUARDS in the break room, one 
           counting more CASH than a guard should have.
           EXT. DEER ISLAND PRISON - SIX MONTHS LATER

           Walter escorts TWO GUARDS out in cuffs with BPD BRASS, Moose, 
           the Detectives from the SCIP Unit.

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        I was made. Done with the uniform. 
                        Could operate on my own.

           NEWSPAPER FLASHES, REPORTERS swarming Walter at the arrests.

           INT. BPD DISTRICT 5 - DAY

           Detective Robinson sits at his desk, in street clothes.

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        I was on my way to being the best.

           REPORTER JACK KELLY, a bright-eyed investigative reporter 
           sits opposite Walter.

                                 JACK KELLY
                        You’re the youngest detective in 
                        the history of the Boston Police.

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        And it was right about then I met 
                        Jack Kelly. He did a big piece on 
                        me. Good guy. Standup guy. But 
                        Jack’s story really starts with the 
                        Blackfriars, and that came later. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           The Coasters’ YAKETY-YAK plays over...

           EXT. ROOFTOP - SOUTH BOSTON - DAY

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        There’s a couple things in my years 
                        as a detective up to the 
                        Blackfriars that’s important here 
                        to understand-

           Walter glasses a DRUG DEAL in progress on the streets below 
           with his binoculars. A DEA AGENT beside him.
                                 WALTER
                        My guy’s about to make the buy. 

           WALTER’S GUY, a bell-bottomed Latino heroin addict, 
           approaches a long fur coated DEALER on the street. 

           EXT. STREET BELOW - SOUTH BOSTON CONTINUOUS

           The Dealer pulls a DIME BAG from his furs. 

                                 DEALER
                        Show the dough, daddy-o.

           Walter’s Guy takes out a THICK WAD OF CASH.

                                 WALTER’S GUY
                        Aquí, hombre.

           And out of nowhere, SIRENS. A BLACK and WHITE rushes up.

           EXT. ROOFTOP - SOUTH BOSTON

           Walter and the DEA Agent share a confused look.

                                 DEA AGENT
                        The hell is that? They with you?

           Out of the BPD cruiser steps JOHN PUMPFORD, a large, golden-
           retriever of a man. Walter recognizing him...

                                 WALTER
                        Pumpford?

           EXT. STREET BELOW - SOUTH BOSTON - CONTINUOUS

           The Dealer and Walter’s Guy are cornered, nowhere to run.

                                 PUMPFORD
                        Pppput yyy-your hands ag-ggainst 
                        the w-www-wall.

           The Dealer and Walter’s Guy share a look.

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        Pumpford stuttered when he talked.

                                 PUMPFORD
                        Ddd-dddoo it.
           Pumpford proceeds to frisk them, finds the drugs, puts them 
           back in the pocket, keeps frisking...and finds THE WAD OF BUY 
           MONEY. 

                                 WALTER’S GUY
                        That’s-

                                 PUMPFORD
                        K-k-keep your mm-mmouth sh-sh-sh-sh-
                             (melting down on the ‘sh’)
                        Sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-

                                 WALTER’S GUY
                        I got it. 

           EXT. ROOFTOP BELOW - SOUTH BOSTON - CONTINUOUS

           The DEA Agent and Walter watch dumbfounded as Pumpford TAKES 
           THE WAD OF BUY MONEY, gets in his car, pulls off. 

                                 DEA AGENT
                        What the fuck? Did you see that? 
                        That fucking cop. He just stole our 
                        buy money. 

           The DEA Agent goes for his radio. Walter puts a hand out.

                                 WALTER
                        Let me handle it. I know the guy.

           EXT. BOSTON STREET - MOMENTS LATER 

           Walter talking with Pumpford on the street.

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        And I did handle it. But that’s 
                        what you gotta understand. How 
                        something like this Blackfriars 
                        debacle happens. 

                                 WALTER
                        Pumpford, we got a problem.

                                 PUMPFORD
                        What’s the p-p-problem?

                                 WALTER
                        You just robbed some guy.

                                 PUMPFORD
                             (not hiding it at all)
                        Ohhh. Who’s the g-g-guy?
                                 WALTER
                        He’s an informant for the DEA. Give 
                        me the money.

                                 PUMPFORD
                        Oh-oh-oh. I was just h-h-holding it 
                        for s-s-safe k-k-k-keeping.

                                 WALTER
                        Give me the money.

                                 PUMPFORD
                        Th-th-th-anks, W-w-walter.

           INT. A DRUG DEALER’S CONDOMINIUM - NIGHT

           Walter on a RAID with other DETECTIVES, rifling through a 
           drug dealer’s super chic mid-70’s pad.

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        The opportunity to put a little 
                        cream in your coffee. It was just 
                        everywhere. 

           Walter notices BOSTON COPS pocketing JEWELRY, WATCHES, MAKE-
           UP, VCR’s, rifling through a RECORD COLLECTION.

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        Nobody took their coffee black.

           INT. DRUG DEALER’S CONDOMINIUM - BEDROOM - LATER

           Walter walks into the Drug Dealer’s bedroom.

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        One raid, I go into a bedroom. I’m 
                        all alone. And I see a foot locker 
                        at the bottom of the bed.

           Walter sees a BIG FOOT LOCKER at the bottom of the bed.

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        And I open up the foot locker, and 
                        went Jesus Christ. 

           Walter lifts the lid without revealing the contents to us.

                                 WALTER
                        Jesus Christ.

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        I opened it again, and Holy Jesus. 
                                 WALTER
                        Holy Jesus.

           REVEAL: It is FULL OF CASH. 

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        It was full to the brim of packets 
                        of hundred dollar bills. 10,000 
                        packets. To the brim. I’m thinking 
                        in my mind...My god, I don’t know 
                        how much money is here. What do I 
                        do? Do I say there’s nothing in 
                        here, and come back later and steal 
                        it? This could be the thing of a 
                        lifetime. 
                             (beat)
                        Nah, I can’t do this. I just can’t 
                        do this. It doesn’t sit right. I 
                        thought, I could never be one of 
                        those guys.

           Walter closes the foot locker.

           INT. BPD DISTRICT 5 - CAPTAIN’S OFFICE - LATER

           Moose, Walter and OTHER COPS stand around as the cash is 
           counted out on an AUTOMATIC BANK COUNTER.

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        They counted it with a counter. 
                        870,000 in cash. They counted. Back 
                        then, that’s five, six million. 

           DA GARRETT BYRN, late 70’s, walks in in a gray double 
           breasted. Everyone gets serious.

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        DA Garrett Byrn, long time DA of 
                        Boston, he came in, wanted to know 
                        who found the money.

                                 MOOSE
                        Robinson.

                                 GARRETT BYRN
                        Are you fucking nuts?

           Walter looks nervously to Byrn. Everyone watching, tense.

                                 WALTER
                        What do you mean?
                                 GARRETT BYRN
                        Have you lost your fucking marbles? 
                        There’s almost a million dollars in 
                        there. Cash. 

                                 WALTER
                        What do you want me to do?

                                 GARRETT BYRN
                        I don’t know. Could’ve called me.

           Everyone LAUGHS. Walter trying to smile, nodding.

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        Byrn was joking...I think. But you 
                        gotta understand, it was the Wild 
                        Wild East.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BOSTON GUN CLUB - DAY

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        And it was a blast!

           BLAST! BLAST! Walter practices his shooting with ear muffs 
           on. He unloads six rounds, DIRECT HITS on a SITUATION TARGET.

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        Summer of ‘78, it was a great time. 
                        I was on top of the world. I’m not 
                        a guy who likes to brag, I’m not 
                        about that, but I was the best.

           Walter looks around the empty gun club, no one else there. 

           He reloads his pistol, and tucks it into the side of his 
           pants...and draws like a cowboy, fast and precise.

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        Wyatt Earp of the East.

           INT. WALTER’S CAR - MOVING - LATER

           Walter cruising on his own, in plain clothes.
                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        I was making busts, working on my 
                        own as a detective. I didn’t even 
                        have to report to headquarters 
                        anymore. I don’t know what happened 
                        to Eddie Green, doing nothing...
                             (beat)
                        I was doing everything, and doing 
                        it well.

           Walter nodding along to the radio, the king of Bean Town.

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        Headed right to the top. And that’s 
                        when this Blackfriars thing hit. 

           EST. THE BLACKFRIARS PUB - SUMMER STREET - LATE NIGHT

           Downtown Boston. The Blackfriars Pub stuck between the Green 
           Cigar Co. Smoke Shop and Arch Tavern Men’s Bar. 

           A wood facade, Blackfriars, in black font. Windows 
           advertising “After Work Disco” “Saturday Night Live!”

           The awning missing above the door, just a skeleton of black 
           metal bars. Summer Street is deserted at this hour.

           We follow a LONE MAN in through the wooden front door.

           INT. THE BLACKFRIARS PUB - CONTINUOUS

           The Man passes through the empty upstairs, booths on his 
           right, the old bar on his left...

           And heads down the stairs to the basement.

           INT. THE BLACKFRIARS PUB - BASEMENT - MOMENTS LATER

           Filled with CIGAR SMOKE, so thick you can barely see, a table 
           sits under a single light where FOUR MEN play backgammon.

                                 JACK KELLY
                        How much you down, Solmonte?

           The Man we’ve been following takes a seat at the table, and 
           we recognize him as...

           Jack Kelly, the reporter who interviewed Walter earlier.

           SOLMONTE, the overweight Italian owner of the establishment, 
           makes a move on the board.
                                 VINCENT SOLMONTE
                        Keeps going like this, gonna have 
                        to crack open the safe.

           A SMALL SAFE in the corner. DELAVEGA hands Kelly the dice.

                                 DELAVEGA
                        Roll for me, Jack.

           Jack takes the dice.

                                 DELAVEGA (CONT’D)
                        You call that number I left?

                                 JACK KELLY
                        Nah. Not yet.

                                 DELAVEGA
                        Guy called like five or six times.

                                 VINCENT SOLMONTE
                        Bobby gets antsy, huh. 

                                 JACK KELLY
                        Like James fucking Brown. 

           Jack shakes the dice, blows on them, and is about to roll, as-

           Vincent Solmonte’s HEAD EXPLODES, blood and brains scattering 
           everywhere. The table turns to the stairs, as-

           BOBBY ITALIANO and BILLY IERARDI, two wise guys with 12 
           gauges, walk in without a word.

           Delavega SHOT point blank as he rises, he flies back into a 
           closet, chest spraying red.

           TWO OTHER PLAYERS, MEROTH and MEGARIAN frozen in their seats.

                          MEROTH
                                                        MEGARIAN
           Oh please god.
                                              No. No.

           Ierardi and Italiano BLOW THEM AWAY simultaneously, both 
           FLYING back from the backgammon table, chairs tumbling into a 
           growing pool of blood.

           Jack Kelly sits alone, holding the dice...shaking.

                                 BOBBY ITALIANO
                        Where is he, Jack?

                                 BILLY IERARDI
                             (hint of a lisp)
                        Where’sth your friend at?
                                 JACK KELLY
                        I don’t know.

           INT. BUICK SKYLARK - SUMMER STREET - SAME

           Opposite Blackfriars, BOBBY ZACHARY, mid-30’s, a handsome, 
           dark Italian, hair slicked back, intelligent eyes staring...

           AS TWO LOUD SHOTS RING OUT, finishing off Kelly. A THIRD 
           SHOT, a horrific and gratuitous statement.

           Bobby Zachary swallows, and pulls off into the night.

           EXT. THE BLACKFRIARS PUB - DAY

           The Pub is surrounded by COP CARS, REPORTERS, SPECTATORS. 

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        I was cruising, and it came on the 
                        radio, so I headed down there.

           INT. THE BLACKFRIARS PUB - UPSTAIRS - CONTINUOUS

           Walter sees UNIFORMED COPS everywhere.

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        Scene was a mess. Blood everywhere.

           A Cop passes Walter, leaving a trail of bloody footprints.

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        Guys leaving bloody footprints.

           INT. THE BLACKFRIARS PUB - BASEMENT - MOMENTS LATER

           Walter walks down the stairs, and stops, taking in the scene.

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        I’ll never forget the scene. It was 
                        a massacre. I’ve seen many guys 
                        shot, heads off. But nothing in 
                        mass like this. It was nauseating.

           Walter sees a piece of Jack Kelly’s face.

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        And then I saw Jack.

           Walter fights a gag, and goes up the stairs for air.
           EXT. THE BLACKFRIARS PUB - MOMENTS LATER

           Walter walks back out into the sunlight.

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        To see a guy I knew, and respected 
                        in there. We weren’t close, but a 
                        guy I’d have called a friend, like 
                        that. It just, it got personal. But 
                        I wasn’t homicide. Wasn’t my case.

           INT. WALTER’S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Walter gets in his car, shell shocked. 

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        So I left. That was as much as I 
                        knew. Except what I was reading 
                        about in the Newspaper.

                        There was a lot of buzz, but the 
                        truth was, no one knew anything.

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        It was an election year, and the 
                        DA, Byrn, needed arrests.

           Those same ADA’s shouting at various POLICE CHIEFS in their

                        They were turning up the pressure.

                        But nothing was stirring. Not a 
                        mouse. Much less a rat. Nobody knew 
                        anything.

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY

           Bobby Zachary, the Italian we saw outside Blackfriars on the 
           night of the shooting, sits alone at a steel table. He’s 
           sweating heavily, leg shaking, looking at the 2-way mirror, 
           head POUNDING, we hear it, BOOM-BOOM, BOOM-BOOM, BOOM-
                                 HOMICIDE DETECTIVE (PRE-LAP)
                        Boom.

           INT. OBSERVATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           On the other side of the mirror, TWO HOMICIDE DETECTIVES 
           stand with DA Garret Byrn and some other SUITS.

                                 HOMICIDE DETECTIVE
                        Just got the call out of the blue. 
                        Guy was in the Charles Street Jail.

                                 GARRETT BYRN
                        What was he held on?

                                 HOMICIDE DETECTIVE 2
                        BPD picked him up on a B&E, trying 
                        to crack a safe in Back Bay.

           Byrn eyes Bobby Zachary, he looks twitchy, sweating.

                                 GARRETT BYRN
                        He looks like an addict.

                                 HOMICIDE DETECTIVE
                        Oh, he’s definitely a user.

                                 GARRETT BYRN
                        Says he knows who did the murders?

                                 HOMICIDE DETECTIVE 2
                             (prideful)
                        He says he can get ‘em on tape.

           Byrn looks to Detective 2, notices he’s posturing for 
           approval...and not giving the slightest.

                                 GARRETT BYRN
                        What’s he want?

                                 HOMICIDE DETECTIVE
                        Don’t know, probably drop the B&E. 
                        Look the other way on the narcotics-

                                 GARRETT BYRN
                        Find out and get the tape.

           Byrn walks out. The Detectives left feeling less than heroes, 
           nodding at each other, they turn back and eye Bobby Zachary.
           INT. BOSTON POLICE HEADQUARTERS - HOMICIDE - LATER

           Zachary stands with his shirt off as Detectives 1 and 2 TAPE 
           a MASSIVELY CONSPICUOUS RECORDER to his chest.

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        Way I heard it, they taped him up 
                        with a Kel-Set.

           Zachary puts back on his silk shirt, the bulge still obvious. 

           He puts on a fancy scarf, his leather jacket. Zachary turns 
           to the side, back to front. The Detectives nod, satisfied.

           INT. UNMARKED DETECTIVE CAR - LATER

           Zachary in the back, Homicide Detectives 1 and 2 up front, 
           all staring at a CROWD filing into Fenway.

                                 HOMICIDE DETECTIVE 1
                        Come on, let’s go.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        Let’s? Oh no. I go alone or I ain’t 
                        going.

                                 HOMICIDE DETECTIVE 2
                        Like hell. It’s against procedure.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                             (shaking his head, sweaty)
                        Ass and his Shadow, man. Ass and 
                        his Shadow.

                                 HOMICIDE DETECTIVE
                        What’d you call me?

           Zachary twitches, and eyes them a beat. Then leans forward to 
           the front seats, getting familiar...

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        A guy wants to cross a desert. So 
                        he takes an Ass, a donkey, cause he 
                        can’t walk that far, you know.

           The Detectives share looks, confused.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY (CONT’D)
                        But the guy he gets hot. I mean 
                        it’s a desert, dig? There’s no 
                        shade and he’s real hot so he 
                        dismounts his Ass and cools off in 
                        its shadow. Ahh nice. Smart right?
           Zachary wipes his nose, eyes watering. 

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY (CONT’D)
                        No. Not smart. Ass fell over dead. 
                        Heat stroke. The guy had to walk 
                        now. And he dies too, dig?

                                 HOMICIDE DETECTIVE 2
                        What’s this junkie talking?

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        Get your donkey killed, you ain’t 
                        gettin’ what you need anyway. So 
                        fuck your procedure.

           Zachary eyes them, and then abruptly gets out of the car.

           The Homicide Detectives share a look, and stay put, 
           reluctantly watching Zachary disappear into the crowd.

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        Zachary claimed he was friends with 
                        Billy Ierardi from growing up. 
                        Could get him talking.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Byrn and his ADA’s stand with Zachary and the Detectives. 

                                 HOMICIDE DETECTIVE 1
                        He got him talking alright. 

           A hand places a TAPE into a TAPE PLAYER on the desk, plays:

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY (ON TAPE)
                        It was you?

                                 VOICE (ON TAPE) 
                             (with a weird lisp)
                        ...yeah, me and Italiano. Went in 
                        there. We thot him. Thot ‘em all. 

           Byrn stops the tape, looks to Bobby Zachary. 

                                 GARRETT BYRN
                        That’s William Ierardi on there?

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        None other brother.
           The Homicide Detectives posture for praise. Garrett nods, 
           bestows it this time.

                                 GARRETT BYRN
                        You boys know what to do.

           The Homicide Detectives grin.

           They surprise Italiano in bed, cuff him, slamming him into a

                        And Ierardi. I made sure I went on 
                        that one.

           INT. SINGLE FAMILY HOME - EAST BOSTON - CONTINUOUS

           Walter runs into the bedroom upstairs, a PALE TOPLESS WOMAN 
           screaming, as Billy Ierardi climbs out the window, and leaps, 
           Walter aims, and BANG!

           Billy Ierardi GRUNTS and contorts as he falls to the yard,

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        Shot him in the air. Right in the 
                        ass. Kaboom. The guys loved that.
           SWAT Officers wave in PARAMEDICS, all LAUGHING.

           INT. DISTRICT ATTORNEY’S OFFICE - DAY

           Garrett Byrn toasts his ADA’s, the GLOBE HEADLINE on his desk-

           ARRESTS MADE IN BLACKFRIARS MURDERS. BYRN FAVORED TO WIN.

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        Byrn had his arrests. He was a lock 
                        for re-election. He was gonna 
                        defeat Newman Flanagan no problem.

           EXT. STREETS OF BOSTON - DAY

           A COUPLE OF BPD COPS in uniform walking confidently. 

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        BPD prestige and honor were 
                        restored.

           LOCALS not really paying any attention to their bravado.

           INT. BPD DISTRICT 5 - CAPTAIN’S OFFICE - LATER

           Garrett Byrn and Moose meet with other BRASS.

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        Now everything hung on keeping 
                        their key witness, Zachary, alive 
                        for trial to back up that tape.

                                 GARRETT BYRN
                        They’ve gotten to guys before. We 
                        need someone incorruptible. 

                                 MOOSE
                        Yes, sir.

                                 GARRETT BYRN
                        This is the BPD at stake for 
                        chrissakes. The prosecutor’s 
                        office. All our heads will roll.
                        Now who can we trust?

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        And that’s when they called me.

           Walter just walks right into the scene, and sits down.
                                 GARRETT BYRN
                        You understand the situation here, 
                        Robinson?

                                 WALTER
                        I think so, sir.

                                 GARRETT BYRN
                        I don’t think you do. They’re gonna 
                        come after the snitch. Try to kill 
                        him. They will. This is for real.

           Byrn eyes Walter. Walter takes the stakes stoically, unafraid-

                                 GARRETT BYRN (CONT’D)
                        This guy Zachary, he means 
                        everything to this department. He 
                        doesn’t testify to back up that 
                        tape, case falls apart. They walk. 
                        We keep him safe, we keep him 
                        happy. No matter what.

                                 WALTER
                        Of course.

                                 GARRETT BYRN
                        I’m counting on you, son. This 
                        whole city is.

           Walter nods, solemn.

                                 WALTER
                        I’ll protect him.

                                 GARRETT BYRN
                        Good.

                                 MOOSE
                        This guy’s a tough guy, don’t 
                        worry. You been working out, 
                        Walter? Want to do a rematch?

                                 WALTER
                        In front of the DA?

           Moose clears his desk. Other COPS coming in, placing bets in 
           the bg. Walter sits opposite Moose, and goes over the top.

                                 MOOSE
                        DAMNIT! 

                                 GARRETT BYRN
                        You got a big future, kid.
           INT. WALTER’S CAR - MOVING - LATER

           Walter drives, as Bobby Zachary sits shotgun, high, and 
           singing along to Fleetwood’s Dreams, he’s pretty good...

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                             (singing)
                        Now here you go again. You say, you 
                        want your freedom. Oooo oooo oooo. 
                        Well, who am I to keep you down?

           Walter glances at him, annoyed. Zachary seemingly oblivious.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY (CONT’D)
                        It’s only right that you should 
                        play the way you feel it. But-

           Walter turns off the radio.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY (CONT’D)
                        Hey, this is my time.

                                 WALTER
                        This is our time, buddy. 

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        Thought I did a nice Stevie Nicks.

                                 WALTER
                        You some kind of impersonator?

           Bobby wipes his nose, watery eyes taking Walter in.

           EXT. A CHARMING BRICK HOUSE - QUINCY - LATER

           Walter pulls up to a charming little row house in Quincy.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        I’ll be right back.

                                 WALTER
                        Take your time.

           Zachary heads into the house.

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        I was told I was taking him to say 
                        goodbye to somebody, before we got 
                        out a town for a while to lay low.
           INT. WALTER’S CAR - PARKED - LATER

           Walter reading the paper, he looks up, as Zachary staggers 
           from the house, high out of his mind, waves casually, 
           stumbles over to the car, and gets in.

                                 WALTER
                        Are you fucking kidding me? 

           Zachary eyes him a long beat, craning his neck forward to see 
           Walter, and then collapses back, looking out the window as he 
           whirls a finger--let’s go.

                                 WALTER (CONT’D)
                        Are you kidding me? I work 
                        narcotics, pal.

           Zachary doesn’t look at Walter, just whirls his finger again.

                                 WALTER (CONT’D)
                        You don’t whirl me let’s go.

           Zachary whirls his finger again, closing his eyes, asleep.

           EXT. PHONE BOOTH - MOMENTS LATER

           Zachary asleep in the back, Walter on the phone.

                                 WALTER
                        He went and got high. 

           INTERCUT WITH: INT. BPD DISTRICT 5 - CAPTAIN’S OFFICE - SAME

           Moose is lifting a weight at his desk, on the phone.

                                 MOOSE
                        Relax, I know.

                                 WALTER
                        You know?

                                 MOOSE
                        Yeah, we gotta keep this guy happy. 
                        The drugs are part of it.

                                 WALTER
                        I’m not laying down my life for a 
                        junkie, Moose.

           Moose annoyed, drops the weight. It’s very loud.
                                 WALTER (CONT’D)
                        What was that?

                                 MOOSE
                        Nothing. Look, this comes from on 
                        high. You know that. 

                                 WALTER
                        It’s my job to put these guys away.

                                 MOOSE
                        Your job’s to protect him. Think of 
                        it as a leash, way to control the 
                        guy. We control his high, we 
                        control him.

           Walter looks back to Zachary sleeping in the back of his car.

                                 MOOSE (CONT’D)
                        Just get him back here, you got a 
                        flight to catch.

           EST. BOSTON LOGAN AIRPORT - DAY

           Back in the day. Red and white tail fins of Trans World 
           Airlines all over the tarmac.

           INT. BOSTON LOGAN AIRPORT - DEPARTURES TERMINAL - LATER

           Walter and Zachary walk through the Departures Terminal, up 
           to Moose, who is holding THREE TICKETS...and standing with a 
           GIANT OFFICER--BUTCHY O’NEAL.

                                 MOOSE
                        You’re going to Sacramento.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        Sacramento? Byrn said-

                                 MOOSE
                        Sacramento.

                                 WALTER
                        Why Sacramento?

                                 MOOSE
                        Furthest place from Boston. 

                                 WALTER
                        This is a real CIA operation. How 
                        long we going for?
                                 MOOSE
                        Not really sure right now. Butchy 
                        O’Neal here’s going with you. Help 
                        you out watching him and stuff.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        What the hell? This-this is not 
                        what me and Byrn talked about.

           Walter looks to Zachary confused. Moose interrupts the moment-

                                 MOOSE
                        We’re flying ya first class, pal.

           INT. TRANS WORLD AIRLINES - IN FLIGHT - LATER

           A BUMPY FLIGHT. Walter and Zachary seated together in First 
           Class. Walter looks out the window. Zachary beside him. 
           Butchy across the aisle, holding a vomit bag.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. SACRAMENTO - DAY

           Walter, Zachary and Butchy drive into the city.

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        They told me when I got there, I’d 
                        go see the Assistant DA, and I’d 
                        get my marching orders.

           INT. SACRAMENTO MOTOR INN - LATER

           Butchy collapses on the bed, exhausted from the flight, so 
           big, his feet hang off by half a foot. Zachary pacing.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        I don’t like this. I don’t. 
                             (parts the hanging blinds)
                        This is not what I agreed to. 

                                 WALTER
                        Just relax. Anything you want to 
                        eat, drink, don’t worry about it.

           Walter leaves. And Zachary picks up the HOTEL PHONE.
           EXT. SACRAMENTO SUPERIOR COURT - LATER

           Walter walks up the steps of the courthouse.

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        So I go to get my marching orders. 
                        See this ADA, Tommy...Can’t 
                        remember his last name. 

           INT. SUPERIOR COURT - DA’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Walter walks into see ADA TOMMY -- the NAMEPLATE on his desk 
           only says “TOMMY.”

                                 WALTER
                        How are you, sir? Nice to meet you.

                        What?

                                 TOMMY THE SACRAMENTO DA
                        Didn’t you talk to your DA? We 
                        don’t want you here. I got enough 
                        problems, I don’t want wise guys 
                        coming from Boston to kill someone.

                                 WALTER

           Walter on the phone with Moose.

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        I get back to the room, call up 
                        Moose. This was before portable

                        Yeah really. What do I do now?

                                 MOOSE (O.S.) (FILTERED)
                        I’ll call you back.

           Walter hangs up. Walter takes in Butchy, snoring...Zachary 
           getting fidgety. The PHONE a moment later. Walter picks up.

                                 MOOSE (O.S.) (FILTERED) (CONT’D)
                        You’re on a flight tonight. We’ll 
                        meet you at Logan.

           Walter hangs up. Zachary smiles, satisfied.

           EXT. TRANS WORLD AIRLINES - IN FLIGHT - BLUE SKY

           TWA flies back East towards Boston over the Rockies.

           INT. TRANS WORLD AIRLINES - IN FLIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           Walter sits on the plane, annoyed. Zachary’s knee shaking, he 
           waves over the FLIGHT ATTENDANT for another coffee.

                                 WALTER
                        You just had a coffee? What’s the 
                        matter with you?

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        I’m hurtin’, man.

                                 FLIGHT ATTENDANT
                        Sir? Can I bring you something?

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        Coffee. Black. Four sugars.

                                 WALTER
                        You don’t look much like a junkie.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        What does that mean?
                                 WALTER
                        You know, skinny, scrawny. I work 
                        with a lot of addicts. You 
                        got...good color. You look fit.

           The Attendant brings the coffee. Walter watches, disgusted as 
           Zachary opens FOUR SUGAR PACKETS, putting them one by one 
           into his tiny little airplane coffee.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        What are you saying, Walter? 

                                 WALTER
                             (not amused)
                        What are you saying I’m saying? 
                        Don’t smile. Don’t smile at me.

           INT. BOSTON LOGAN AIRPORT - BAGGAGE CLAIM - LATER

           Walter, Butchy, Zachary, Moose and a COUPLE DETECTIVES stand 
           around in a circle in their coats in the baggage claim. 
           RANDOM TRAVELERS collecting their bags behind them.

                                 MOOSE
                        Give me your guns.

                                 WALTER
                        Guns? What for?

                                 MOOSE 
                        Well, cause you’re going to Bermuda-

                                 WALTER
                        The hell am I going to Bermuda for?

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        Alriiight, man. Going to Bermudaaa.

                                 BUTCHY O’NEAL
                        I can’t go to Bermuda. 

                                 MOOSE
                        Well, we can’t make you go. That’s 
                        fine, Butchy.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        What? I was supposed to go with the 
                        other guy. This wasn’t part of the 
                        thing. I want the other guy.

                                 WALTER
                        What thing?
           Moose notably responds to Zachary instead of Walter.

                                 MOOSE
                        Robinson here would lay down his 
                        life for you, there’s no one who’s 
                        gonna protect you better.

                                 WALTER
                        Why no guns?

                                 MOOSE 
                        Bermuda doesn’t allow ‘em. Police 
                        don’t even carry guns. Nobody gets 
                        a gun through their customs, you 
                        just can’t do it.

                                 WALTER
                        I don’t have any clothes. I don’t 
                        have any shaving gear.

           Moose hands Walter an ENVELOPE OF CASH.

                                 MOOSE 
                        Buy whatever you need. Now every 
                        Friday-

                                 WALTER
                        Every Friday? How long am I gonna 
                        be there for?

                                 MOOSE 
                        We don’t know. But every Friday 
                        we’re gonna send you 500 dollars 
                        for you, and 500 dollars for 
                        Zachary. Spending money. Come on. 
                        You gonna miss your plane.

           Walter looks to Zachary, to Moose, and takes out his GUN. 
           Moose wraps up the gun, hands Walter THE TICKETS TO HAMILTON.

           INT. THE MONTE CARLO RESTAURANT - BOSTON - LATER

           THE BOSS sits obscured in the chiaroscuro light plan of this 
           old school haunt, lit much like the painting hanging on a 
           wall beside--a reproduction of Caravaggio’s ominous, almost 
           gratuitous masterpiece: JUDITH BEHEADING HOLOFERNES. 
           Only The Boss’s HAIRY HANDS extend from dark into the light 
           as they pick at a plate of ZITI. 

           TIGHT: As one hand STABS a tube with a fork, marinara oozes.

                                 BOSS (O.S.)
                        Should have been the sixth body.

           TWO COSA NOSTRA SOLDIERS in orange FILA 70’s track suits, 
           CARMINE MCCLANE and NICO WINTER sit opposite, not eating.

                                 CARMINE MCCLANE
                        He was supposed to be.

                                 NICO WINTER
                        We’ll get him, boss.

           They gaze into the unreadable dark. It’s unsettling.

                                 BOSS 
                        Yeah? Where?

                                 NICO WINTER
                        We’re working on it.

           The Boss’s hand stabs another piece of ziti, takes it back 
           into his darkness, presumably chewing. 

                                 BOSS 
                        He talks. We all go down. That 
                        happens. We don’t protect you 
                        inside. 

           Winter and McClane unsure, then realize the meeting is over.

           Walter and Zachary step onto the disembarking stairs in

           Walter and Zachary watch as BERMUDA CUSTOMS open their bags, 
           unrolling shirts, checking shoes, under the foot pads, 
           incredibly thorough...and incredibly slow. The guys sweating.

           Walter and Zachary exit CUSTOMS into a portico area to be 
           greeted by THE BERMUDA POLICE.

           Walter eyes them in their custodian British police hats, navy 
           Bermuda shorts, and knee socks, very tan, walking up.

           Zachary just nods.
           EXT. LF WADE INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

           Carl Rose leads them to his POLICE VEHICLE, very excited.

                                 CARL ROSE
                        They didn’t tell us what’s going 
                        on. It’s all been quite hush hush 
                        on our end. 

           Walter and Zachary follow him through the sunny car park.

                                 CARL ROSE (CONT’D)
                        I suppose it would be inappropriate 
                        for me to ask, wouldn’t it?

                        see a lot of action.

           Zachary eyes a SEXY WOMAN walking past in a wrap.

                        Looks to be plenty of action.

           Rose grins a mouthful of poorly cared for British teeth.

                                 WALTER
                        All yours. Hungry?

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        Not really.

                                 WALTER
                        Fine. I’m gonna go get something.

           Zachary looks around, runs his hand through his hair. A beat.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        Look, man. I know you don’t like 
                        it, but I gotta get a fix here. 
                        Boston talked to Bermuda PD on 
                        this. They got a lot of dealers 
                        here. It was part of my deal.

                                 WALTER
                        You make your deals with me.

           Walter walks out of the bedroom. Zachary follows.
                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        I’m hurting, man. You dig? I can’t 
                        just...One of Rose’s guys told me 
                        there’s guys down on Front Street.

                                 WALTER
                        No way am I taking you to buy.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        It’s Bermuda, man. Chill. Alright, 
                        just be chill. Bermuda High, baby. 

           Walter ignores him, opening the ROOM SERVICE MENU. 

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY (CONT’D)
                        You want to take me to the hospital 
                        then? Cause that’s where I’m at 
                        right now, man, I-

           Zachary sits. Stands. Sits. Stands. Sniffs... Sits. Stands.

                                 WALTER
                        Christ. Alright. Get out of here.

           Zachary wipes his watering eyes, nods, and goes.

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        Honestly, I wanted some time free 
                        from the prick. I figured it was 
                        safe. It was...at that time.

           EST. FRONT STREET - HAMILTON - DAY

           The center of night life and seedy activity on the island -- 
           it’s still picturesque, full of TOURISTS, but you can pick 
           out a few JUNKIES and LADIES OF THE NIGHT in the hoi polloi.

           EXT. FRONT STREET - SAME

           Bobby Zachary steps out of a store in a NEW WHITE PEAK-LAPEL 
           SUIT, and GREEN FERRAGAMO DRIVING LOAFERS, BELT to match.

           He starts down the street, confident, strutting. 

           Zachary looks around, his intelligent eyes flashing, finds...

           A MAN IN A PANAMA HAT with a small mustache leaning against a 
           PINK BUILDING. 

           The Man in the Panama Hat holds eye contact, and then turns, 
           and goes into the pink building. Zachary heads over to the 
           building, and disappears inside.
           INT. ENGELBERT HUMPERDINCK SUITE - VARIOUS - SAME

           Walter inspects the bar, restless. Sits on one balcony. Then 
           the other balcony.

           Walter lies on Zachary’s water bed, wiggles briefly, the bed 
           starts to roll, he stops, letting it roll him.

           Walter checks his watch, picks up the phone, dials ROSE.

                                 WALTER
                        Rose? 

                                 CARL ROSE (O.S.) (FILTERED)
                        Walter. How are you settling in?

                                 WALTER
                        He’s been down on Front Street for 
                        an hour. You know about the drugs?

           A SILENCE over the phone.

                                 CARL ROSE (O.S.) (FILTERED)
                        Boston said to look the other way.

                                 WALTER
                        I’m not so comfortable with that.

                                 CARL ROSE (O.S.) (FILTERED)
                        It’s nothing to worry about. Long 
                        as he doesn’t overdose. 
                             (LAUGHS)
                        It’s mostly middlemen here, moving 
                        product through. Not a rough scene 
                        at all. Really. You should go out, 
                        enjoy yourself.
                             (beat)
                        Do you golf?

                                 WALTER
                        It’s my job to look after him.

                                 CARL ROSE (O.S.) (FILTERED)
                        Mate, thousand miles of ocean on 
                        every side’ll take care of that.

           Walter stares out at the ocean, torn.

           EXT. CASTLE HARBOR GOLF COURSE - LATER

           Walter walks up to the first hole with his rental clubs and 
           red Bermuda shorts bought from the pro shop. His muscular 
           thighs very pale.
                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Mind if I join?

           Walter turns, takes in an icon in the flesh--FRANKIE AVALON. 
           Walter looks over his shoulder. Avalon is talking to him?

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        Frankie Avalon. It was Frankie 
                        Avalon!

           EXT. THE FIRST TEE - MOMENTS LATER

           Walter and Frankie walk up to the tee...Walter keeps eyeing 
           Frankie out of the corner of his eye, not saying anything.

                                 FRANKIE AVALON
                        You wanna go ahead?

                                 WALTER
                        You’re Frankie Avalon, aren’t you?

                                 FRANKIE AVALON
                        Yeah.

                                 WALTER
                        I knew it. I am a HUGE fan.

                                 FRANKIE AVALON
                        No kidding. 

                                 WALTER
                        Frankie Avalon, just out on the 
                        links. Wait til they hear.

                                 FRANKIE AVALON
                        So I’ll go first then?

                                 WALTER
                        Oh please. Absolutely, Mr. Avalon. 

           Frankie tees up his ball, and hits a mediocre drive.

                                 WALTER (CONT’D)
                        Hoah! Better golfer than a singer! 

           Walter tees up, stretches a bit with his club, and SLICES the 
           shit out of the ball. Avalon clears his throat.

                                 WALTER (CONT’D)
                        Feel like I’m golfin’ for the queen 
                        here. Mind if I take a mulligan?
                                 FRANKIE AVALON
                        I’d prefer you not.

                                 WALTER
                        Oh...I can’t tell if you’re joking.

                                 FRANKIE AVALON
                        No mulligans in life. Why should 
                        there be in golf?

                                 WALTER
                        Good point. I respect that.

           EXT. CASTLE HARBOR GOLF COURSE - HOLE 3 - LATER

           Walter hits from a trap, SPRAYS sand. The wind sends it right 
           in Avalon’s face. Walter turns back, unaware.

                                 WALTER
                        On the green, baby.

                                                           TIME CUT TO:

           Avalon holds the flag for Walter on a putt. Walter makes it, 
           high-fives Frankie Avalon.

                                 WALTER (CONT’D)
                        YES!

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        I was just high-fiving him and 
                        everything. Like old buddies. I 
                        started to realize what kind of 
                        place I was in. A magical one. 
                        Where anything could happen.

                                 WALTER
                        You playing any shows down here or 
                        anything?

                                 FRANKIE AVALON
                        Just one at The Empire Room. Not 
                        really a big deal.

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        Guy was offering me a table, 
                        tickets, the whole thing.

                                 WALTER
                        Think you could you get me a table?

                                 FRANKIE AVALON
                        ...sure.
           INT. ENGELBERT HUMPERDINCK SUITE - LATER

           Walter walks into the suite, amped.

                                 WALTER
                        You’ll never believe who I just-

           Walter looks around. Zachary is still gone. 

                                 WALTER (CONT’D)
                        What the...?

           Walter grabs the phone, dials...Moose.

                                 WALTER (CONT’D)
                        Moose, this is craziness. 

                                 MOOSE (O.S.) (FILTERED)
                        It’s Bermuda. He’ll be fine. Just 
                        let him do his thing. This was the 
                        deal. You stay out of Zachary’s 
                        face. It’s how he wants it. He’s 
                        not going anywhere. Just enjoy.

           The line goes dead. 

           INT. THE EMPIRE CLUB - NIGHT

           Walter at his table--sitting on a plush, ocean blue bench 
           with a massive SEASHELL back...he sips a Dark N’Stormy.

           The MAITRE’D approaches with a SULTRY RED HEAD in a onesy 
           split neck to navel in a wide V of tan flesh. 

                                 MAITRE’D
                        Captain Rose wanted me to introduce 
                        you to a dinner companion.

           She sits beside Walter, and the Maitre’d steps back to reveal 
           a sight line to Carl Rose, in a jacket, shorts and knee socks 
           (Bermuda Formal). He toasts Walter from the bar, grinning.

                                 SULTRY RED HEAD
                        So Captain Rose tells me you’re a 
                        private detective on vacation?

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        So I go to this broad-

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. FACTORY FLOOR - DAY

           The Author, getting impatient, interrupts his subject.

                                 AUTHOR
                        Let’s move things along. 

                                 WALTER
                        Oh. I thought you wanted color and 
                        stuff? You said details.

                                 AUTHOR
                        The details are great, but Zachary, 
                        let’s stay with him. Zachary.

           Walter considers the Author, checks his watch.

                                 WALTER 
                        Okay. Well what happened next with 
                        him was so weird. Should have been 
                        a sign to me now, looking back. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. THE EMPIRE CLUB - NIGHT

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        My pal Frankie Avalon, he came on 
                        stage.

           Frankie Avalon at the mic...Walter leans to his Red Head.

                                 WALTER
                        I golfed with him today.

           The Red Head smiles, impressed.

                                 FRANKIE AVALON
                        Ladies and gentlemen. There are a 
                        couple people I want to acknowledge 
                        in the audience tonight. First of 
                        all, I want to introduce, a special 
                        guest, very special guest, the lead 
                        guitar player from the group Boston- 

           The crowd BUZZES. Even Walter cranes his neck, looking around-

                                 FRANKIE AVALON (CONT’D)
                        Ladies and gentlemen, Bobby 
                        Zachary! 

           A SPOTLIGHT lights up Bobby Zachary, who stands, waving.
                                 WALTER
                        What the fuck?

           Walter takes in Zachary, in a gaudy white panama suit.

                                 WALTER (CONT’D)
                        You gotta be shitting me.

                                 SULTRY RED HEAD
                        What’s the matter?

                                 WALTER
                             (covering)
                        Nothing. Nothing. Just shocked to 
                        see a Boston band member here.

                                 SULTRY RED HEAD
                        I know, it’s so cool right.

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        Everyone knows the band, but no one 
                        knows the guitarist’s name. They 
                        all believed it. I mean, who’s 
                        gonna look that up?

                                 FRANKIE AVALON
                        Can we get you to come up and play 
                        a number with us?

           Bobby Zachary politely demurs, sitting at his own SHELL TABLE 
           between TWO GORGEOUS WOMEN.

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        And Zachary was sitting with two 
                        broads. One was pretty. Tan, with a 
                        long white dress. But the other. Oh 
                        man. The other was a knockout. 
                        Classy. Dressed to the nines. White 
                        halter, the whole thing. Hoah.

           Walter stares at this BLONDE as Avalon starts his VENUS...

                                 WALTER
                        With a fucking junkie.

                                 SULTRY RED HEAD
                        What?

           Walter eyes narrow, he looks back over at Zachary, furious.
           INT. ENGELBERT HUMPERDINCK SUITE - LATE NIGHT

           Walter sits in the dark, nursing a glass of Rum, the better 
           part of his way through a bottle of Gosling’s.

           And the door opens...Bobby Zachary walks in with the women, 
           LAUGHING. They don’t see Walter in the dark.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        It’s a water bed.

                                 WOMAN 1
                        Oooo. You know they say there are 
                        two things that are better on a 
                        water bed.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        Think I heard that somewhere.

           A lascivious giggle, Zachary starts making out with the 
           Brunette as the Blonde Walter had his eye on goes for the bar-

           And Walter leaps out, grabbing Zachary off the Brunette.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY (CONT’D)
                        AHHHH!

                                 WOMEN
                        Oh my god!/Bobby?!

           Walter SLAMS him into the wall.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                             (relieved)
                        It’s you?!

                                 WALTER
                        Yeah, it’s me. Who you expect? I 
                        got a mind to break your fucking 
                        head. You’re supposed to be laying 
                        low. The lead guitar player from 
                        Boston? 

           Zachary pushes Walter off.

                                 WALTER (CONT’D)
                        Don’t push me, man.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        You’re drunk.

                                 WALTER
                        Drunk? You’re high.
           Zachary just looks at Walter. And Walter pushes Zachary, who 
           is surprisingly quick, and gets Walter in a headlock, Walter 
           drives his legs...they slam into a TABLE, knock over a VASE.

           And hit the floor as it SHATTERS, start rolling, GRUNTING.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        Get...someone.

           The Women run out.

                                 WALTER
                        You think you can just prance 
                        around? While you got guys putting 
                        their lives on the line? You think 
                        this is a joke!? You junky piece of 
                        shit. People are dead! I’m not 
                        dying for you!

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        Get off a’ me!

           Carl Rose runs in with a couple of his Bermuda PD guys, all 
           in jackets and shorts and knee socks. They take in the scrum, 
           and start LAUGHING.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY (CONT’D)
                        Get him off me.

           Carl grabs Walter, a couple of his guys have to help, and 
           they drag the two apart. Somebody finds the LIGHTS.

           REVEAL: The living room is wrecked. Zachary pacing, his suit 
           jacket torn. Walter is red, a mess, his head bleeding.

                                 CARL ROSE
                        You two are a couple of wild chaps 
                        then, aren’t you?

                                 WALTER
                             (spits blood)
                        Fuck.

           Rose tosses Walter a chunk of ICE from the bar. Walter holds 
           it to his mouth.

                                 WALTER (CONT’D)
                        He blew our goddamn cover. Boston?!

                                 CARL ROSE
                             (fixing himself a G&T)
                        Just band troubles. Nothing the 
                        Castle Harbor hasn’t seen before. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 CARL ROSE (CONT'D)
                        Humperdinck once tried to castrate 
                        Manilow on that very couch.

                                 BERMUDA POLICE GUY
                        Really?

                                 CARL ROSE
                        No, Clive. 

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        Manilow was castrated at birth. 

           A beat. Carl Rose starts GIGGLING. They all start CHUCKLING.

                                 CARL ROSE
                        This guy’s a laugh. Can’t you just 
                        enjoy him?

                                 WALTER
                        While he’s blowing our cover?!

                                 CARL ROSE
                        Cover’s in tact. I told the girls 
                        you were the drummer.

                                 WALTER
                        You think this is funny? 

                                 CARL ROSE
                        No. No, come on, boys. Let’s go.

           They exit, stifling LAUGHS. Leaving Walter and Zachary alone. 
           A long, tense beat, the two men eyeing each other.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        Why you care so much about me, man?

                                 WALTER
                        I care about Jack Kelly. I care 
                        about this trial. 

           Walter spits more blood, dabs his cut lip with the ice again.

                                 WALTER (CONT’D)
                        You? I hope they find you in an 
                        alley soon as this shit blows over. 
                        But until then, you’re the asshole 
                        who can put the bastards who blew a 
                        good man away. We’re going back to 
                        Boston to start deposing you, and I 
                        swear to god, I’m bringing you back 
                        here over my dead body.

           OFF Zachary’s look.
           EXT. ISLAND OF BERMUDA - SUNRISE

           Dawn’s rosy fingers reach up from the watery horizon as a TWA 
           flight jets back West for New England.

           INT. BOSTON LOGAN AIRPORT - CUSTOMS - LATER

           Walter passes through CUSTOMS AGENTS, Zachary, following with 
           a SMALL DUFFLE, sweating. Moose waiting on the other side.

                                 MOOSE
                        You’re late. Grand Jury’s waiting.

           EXT. SUFFOLK COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT - BOSTON - DAY

           The large gray blocks of the house of justice stand quietly.

           INT. CHAMBER OF THE GRAND JURY - DEPOSITION ROOM 3 - DAY

           Zachary gives testimony before DA Garrett Byrn, STAFF, and 
           THE GRAND JURY, its 23 serving members listening intently.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        I knew Ierardi from growing up. Our 
                        fathers managed some books together-

                                 GARRETT BYRN
                        Can you lay out again why Ierardi 
                        was willing to speak with you?

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        I told ‘em I was hearing things. 
                        Rumors, that Solmonte’s boys were 
                        looking to get even. I made it out 
                        that I was warning him.

           A GRAND JUROR, Cambridge-type in tweed, raises their hand.

                                 GARRETT BYRN
                        You can just ask the question, you 
                        don’t need to raise your hand.

                                 GRAND JUROR
                        Okay sorry. So that’s when Ierardi 
                        confirmed he did the killings, when 
                        you were warning him?
                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        I mean we were just chatting. I 
                        said, you know, shit Billy, there’s 
                        people out there, looking to do you 
                        harm. You know what about, right?

           Byrn interrupts.

                                 GARRETT BYRN
                        And that’s when we got this.

           Byrn’s Assistant plays the TAPE AGAIN:

                                 VOICE (ON TAPE) 
                             (with a weird lisp)
                        ...yeah, me and Italiano. Went in 
                        there. We thot him. Thot ‘em all. 
                        We can handle Solmonte’s people. 

           Byrn stops the tape. 

                                 GRAND JUROR
                        People?

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        Yeah, Solmonte’s got a couple sons. 
                        Rough fellas. 

           A SECOND GRAND JUROR raises his hand.

                                 SECOND GRAND JUROR
                        Mr. Zachary, we understand you’re 
                        an addict?

           Byrn looks to his Staff, shifting uncomfortably.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        That’s correct. I have an addiction 
                        I am currently managing.

                                 SECOND GRAND JUROR
                        I respect that. God be with you on 
                        your journey. But is there a 
                        reliability issue there? 

           A long, tense beat.

                                 THIRD GRAND JUROR
                        Were you on drugs when you met with 
                        Ierardi?
                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        No, ma’am. 
                             (winks)
                        Neither was the tape. 

           The Jury CHUCKLES, charmed. Byrn relieved, smiles at Zachary.

           INT. SUFFOLK SUPERIOR COURT - OUTSIDE THE CHAMBER - SAME

           Walter in a heated conversation with Moose.

                                 WALTER
                        I didn’t sign up for this, alright. 
                        This guy’s a true piece a’ shit. 
                        Put him in Bermuda jail, he can sit 
                        on his ass until we go to trial, or 
                        get someone else, you hear me-

                                 MOOSE 
                        No you hear ME.

           A COUPLE OF PASSERSBY look over, Moose lowers his voice.

                                 MOOSE (CONT’D)
                        This guy means everything now. He 
                        talked to Byrn. You keep 
                        antagonizing him, we are gonna 
                        bring you back here, and put you on 
                        traffic for the rest of your 
                        miserable fucking career! Clear?!

           Walter speechless, looks up as Zachary exits with Byrn, who 
           is patting him on the back. Zachary sees Walter, and smiles. 

           EXT. SUFFOLK COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT - BOSTON - LATER

           Walter, silent and pissed, loads Zachary into Moose’s car. 
           They pull off. And a MAROON OLDS’ pulls out after them.

           REVEAL: Nico Winter and Carmine McClane at the wheel.

           EXT. BOSTON LOGAN AIRPORT - DROP-OFF AREA - LATER

           Moose fighting through the drop-off traffic, it’s a mess. 

           INT. MAROON OLDMOBILE - CONTINUOUS

           McClane trying to follow, the airport is insane.
                                 NICO WINTER
                        Stay closer.

                                 CARMINE MCCLANE
                        You wanna fuckin’ drive? 

                                 NICO WINTER
                        I hate the airport.
                             (sees them pull over)
                        There. Get me closer.

           Carmine is cut off by a GIANT BUS.

                                 CARMINE MCCLANE
                        Fuck.

           Nico just jumps out, starts walking, HORNS blaring.

                                 CARMINE MCCLANE (CONT’D)
                        Draw enough attention?

           INT. BOSTON LOGAN AIRPORT - DEPARTURES - MOMENTS LATER

           Nico spots Zachary and Walter in the SECURITY LINE. 

           He gets in line himself...unseen, 20 bodies back. And 
           notices...a GUY sent back through the metal detector. 

           Nico looks down at a HAND GUN he has stuffed into his belt.

           Walter and Zachary disappear through security. Nico watches.

           EXT. BOSTON LOGAN AIRPORT - DEPARTURES - LATER

           Nico gets back in the car with McClane.

                                 NICO WINTER
                        I lost ‘em.
                             (off McClane’s look)
                        Piece. Couldn’t get through the 
                        detector. 

                                 CARMINE MCCLANE
                        Why’d you take your fucking gun?

                                 NICO WINTER
                        I don’t know. I wasn’t thinking. 

                                 CARMINE MCCLANE
                        Throw it away, it’s a gun. You can 
                        get another. Jesus.
                                 NICO WINTER
                        Just throw away my gun?

                                 CARMINE MCCLANE
                        Well, yeah. You fucking lost ‘em. 

           Nico and McClane stare out their windshield a beat as it 
           starts to sleet. McClane pulls into the awful traffic.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. TRANS WORLD AIRLINES - FIRST CLASS - LATER

           Zachary and Walter sitting in the first row, tense, quiet. 
           Zachary looks to Walter, looks away. Looks at him again.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        What’s the eagle for?

           Walter looks down at the EAGLE TATTOO on his forearm.

                                 WALTER
                        United States of America. What’s 
                        wrong with you?

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        I don’t know. Maybe you just like 
                        eagles?

                                 WALTER
                        Just like eagles? 

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        Yeah, maybe you’re a fucking 
                        ornithologist. I don’t know what.

                                 WALTER
                        I’m a patriot.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        Hey I love this country too, man. 

                                 WALTER
                        I’m sure you do. 

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        Serious. I was in Nam.

           Walter puts down his drink, turns to Bobby.

                                 WALTER
                        Bullshit.

                        You bulling me right now?

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        I would not lie to you, Walter.

           Walter studies Zachary.

                                 WALTER
                        Navy. ‘68 to ‘72.

                             (off Walter’s stare)
                        What?

                                 WALTER
                        Nothing...Airborne was hardcore.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        Yeah. It put things in perspective.

           Walter sips his drink, looks back to Zachary, taking in this 
           surprising info about his ward.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. FACTORY FLOOR - DAY

           Walter stares off into the factory, reflecting a beat.

                                 WALTER
                        I took my job serious. Got stabbed 
                        once. I got shot. Run over. Had my 
                        nose broken twice. Lost teeth in 
                        fist fights. I was a good cop. 

           The Author listens to Walter wax on with his head in his 
           hands, watching the cassette spin.

                                 WALTER (CONT’D)
                        I really was. That’s why they chose 
                        me, out of 4,000 cops on the job, 
                        they picked me. 
                             (beat)
                        I didn’t care what Moose said.

                                                                CUT TO:

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        I followed him next time he went to 
                        go get a fix. Thinking if shit hit 
                        or he tries any more of his antics, 
                        I’d be there to nip it in the bud.

           Walter keeps his eye on Zachary as he reaches that Pink 
           Building, following the Man With the Panama Hat inside.

                        Not yet, this was before. This was 
                        the business thing.

           EXT. SIDE OF THE PINK BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER

           Walter creeps up a narrow alley beside the building, stepping 
           over stray chickens picking at mango rinds. 

           He looks up to a window, well above his head. He puts his 
           feet on either side of the walls of the alley, and starts 
           using opposing pressure to shimmy his way up to a view.

           Walter braces himself, between the walls, up about six feet.

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        I’m expecting to see this guy 
                        sticking himself, I don’t know 
                        what, junkie shit...but I look in.

           Walter flexes his legs tighter, bracing as he leans into look-

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        And Zachary’s in there with a bunch 
                        of black chicks.

           INT. PINK BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

           Zachary and the Bermudan Women are folding and loading STACKS 
           OF COLORFUL SHORTS into big duffels. 

                                 WALTER
                             (from the window)
                        What the...

           Walter’s shoes lose grip on the walls. 

                                 WALTER (CONT’D)
                        Shit!

           He crashes down, SMASHING into a TIN TRASH BIN with a BOOM. 

           Zachary and the Women look over at the sound. Zachary rises.

           EXT. ALLEY - MOMENTS LATER

           Zachary steps into the alley to find Walter limping off.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        Walter?

           Walter freezes, slowly turns. Zachary looks tense, nervous.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing out here?

                                 WALTER
                        ...think the question’s what the 
                        hell are you doing in there?
                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        What? 

                                 WALTER
                        Don’t diddle me. I saw. You’re 
                        loading a bunch of shorts into bags 
                        with those black chicks. 

           Zachary smiles, relaxing, raises his hands all innocent.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        You got me. Come on, I’ll show you.

                             (surprised, then)
                        Yes you will.

           Walter starts limping over.

           INT. PINK BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER

           Walter and Zachary stand in the space, rows of garment bags, 
           boxes of various apparel. The women folding the shorts. 
           Walter starts sorting through the pastel cottons, confused.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        Bermuda Shorts. The real deal, from 
                        Bermuda. Feel the breeze on your 
                        legs like you’re on the island. I 
                        got a guy here, charges me two

                                 WALTER
                        ...so?

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        I got a guy in Boston pays 12. 

           Off Walter’s non-reaction.

                        That’s a 600% mark-up. Easy money.

                        They’re giving us money.

                        They give us a nice allowance. This

                                 WALTER

                                 WALTER
                        I’m serious.

           A beat. Zachary considers opening up, sniffs, wipes his eyes.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        We’re gonna go to trial eventually,

                                 WALTER
                        I don’t know. You go back to doing 
                        whatever the bum fuck you did.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        I can’t do the same old. Not after 
                        the trial. Not in Boston. Never. 
                        This’s my getaway grubstake.

                                 WALTER
                        You can’t be operating a business 
                        in witness protection. The band 
                        thing was some bullshit they put up 
                        with, but this, you can’t do this.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        I don’t mean to offend you, Walter, 
                        but you don’t tell me what to do. 

           Walter looks from the shorts to Zachary.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY (CONT’D)
                        We been beating around it, cause I 
                        didn’t want to hurt your feelings, 
                        but cards on the table: The table 
                        turned a while back. 

           Walter eyes him, angry, humiliated. A tense silence.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY (CONT’D)
                        Why don’t you girls take a break? I 
                        can finish here.

           The women rise, heading out. Zachary sits at the table, 
           covered in a bunch of half-eaten Chinese take-out. 

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY (CONT’D)
                        Stop looking all angry. Sit down. 
                        Try some moo shoo. It’s better cold- 

           Walter just stares at Zachary.

                        How’s your ankle? You need ice?

                        I don’t need any ice.

           Walter limps to the seat, pulls it back, and drops into it.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        Don’t be upset, man. This is all 
                        good. Second you get your hand out 
                        of my ass, I’ll stop bein’ a pain 
                        in yours. You dig? 

           Walter reaches for an egg roll, soy sauces it, chewing.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY (CONT’D)
                        You’re too uptight. Live a little, 
                        you know. You know how many cops in 
                        Boston’d trade their left nut to be 
                        in your thongs?

           Walter says nothing, just chewing.

                        You can do whatever you feel like. 
                        I’m not gonna tell nobody.

                                 WALTER
                        I don’t need your permission to do 
                        anything down here, alright. I may 
                        not control you, pal, but you sure 
                        as shit don’t control me.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        Okay. I’m just tellin’ you how 
                        things work. You’re by the book, I 
                        get it. But you’re missin’ out.

           Zachary bites into his own egg roll.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY (CONT’D)
                        You could help. Getting through 
                        customs. We could be partners. 

                                 WALTER
                        I don’t make partners of snitches. 

           Zachary smiles.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        You know what a confidence game is? 

           Zachary chewing, mouth full.
                                 BOBBY ZACHARY (CONT’D)
                        It’s where we get the phrase con 
                        man. Thing is, it’s not just a 
                        game, it’s the way life works.

                                 WALTER
                        Not the way my life works. 

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        Why not?

                                 WALTER
                        I like the truth.

           Zachary LAUGHS, lights a cigarette, inhales, exhales.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        I prefer the untruth. It gets a bad 
                        rap. Funny. You’d think lies could 
                        tell better fibs about themselves.

                                 WALTER
                        What?

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        A lot of people, they think 
                        deception, it can only be bad. 

                                 WALTER
                        Awful philosophical for a junkie.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        Mmm. Drugs open the mother wit, 
                        daddy-o. Take The Mechanical Turk. 

                                 WALTER
                        The what?

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        Little over 200 years ago, guy 
                        makes this machine--Mechanical 
                        Turk, claimed that this Turkish 
                        robot could beat anyone in chess. 
                        And he did. Robot was undefeated. 
                        Everyone, they all went mad. 
                        Couldn’t figure it out. It was 
                        just...too good to be true. Light 
                        years ahead of where mechanics and 
                        that shit was. 
                             (beat)
                        And they were right. 

           Zachary ashes his cigarette.
                                 BOBBY ZACHARY (CONT’D)
                        There was a little midget inside 
                        The Mechanical Turk, who was really 
                        good at chess. You dig?

                                 WALTER
                        Not really.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        That’s not even the interesting 
                        part. See, everyone believed it at 
                        the time. They believed this guy 
                        had invented this amazing machine. 
                        And a guy name Cartwright heard 
                        about this Turkish chess robot. 

           Zachary takes a final drag, stubbing out his cigarette.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY (CONT’D)
                        And he thought...well if someone 
                        can make a robot smart enough to 
                        play chess, I can make a mechanical 
                        loom. And he did. He went out and 
                        did it. A lie, a hoax, it motivated 
                        someone to build something that 
                        changed the world. 
                             (beat)
                        Sometimes a little untruth...can do 
                        a lot a good.

           Zachary opens his fortune cookie, and tosses one to Walter.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY (CONT’D)
                        So get your head out of your ass 
                        and open your eyes to the 
                        possibilities down here, huh?

           Walter looks down, opens his cookie...reads his FORTUNE.

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        Wish I could tell you I got some 
                        fortune that really summed all that 
                        up. I remember at the time thinking 
                        it’d be cool if I got something, 
                        you know, to do with all the stuff 
                        he was saying, inspirational.

           TIGHT ON THE FORTUNE: A GOOD WAY TO KEEP HEALTHY IS TO EAT 
           MORE CHINESE FOOD.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        Come on, got some people I want you 
                        to meet.
           EXT. A.S. COOPER AND SONS LIMITED - LATER

           Walter follows Zachary between mahogany columns accenting 
           grand white windows, into the jewel of Bermuda’s Menswear.

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        I didn’t realize, but he had me. He 
                        was reeling me in like a Rock Fish. 

           INT. A.S. COOPER AND SONS LIMITED - CONTINUOUS

           The jingle of the door bell announces their entrance, and a 
           WOMAN looks up from the register.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        Allow me to introduce Penelope.

           She shakes Walter’s hand. 

                                 PENNY
                        Call me Penny.

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        And Gwen.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        And Gwen.

           Gwen steps out from a row of men’s seersucker jackets. She 
           and Walter lock eyes.

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        This Gwen...there was a lot of 
                        temptation over the years. Even in 
                        Boston. Women throwing themselves 
                        at you, in uniform. I’ve had my 
                        share of playing around with the 
                        girls. But she was different. She 
                        was the bait.

           Gwen offers her hand. 

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        And I took it.

           Walter takes it.

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        Hook, line and sinker.

                                 WALTER
                        Have we met?
                                 GWEN
                        Well, not formally. The night you 
                        two had your...disagreement.

                                 WALTER
                        Oh. Oh right. Of course. You were 
                        wearing that halter?

                                 GWEN
                        ...I’m not sure, maybe?

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        See? The man’s got an eye for 
                        fashion. I’m bringing Walter into 
                        the Bermudas.

                                 WALTER
                        We didn’t agree to anything.

                                 GWEN
                        You think you can help?

           Zachary and Penny share a look.

                                 WALTER
                        Sorry, you two, you’re in on this 
                        shorts thing?

                                 GWEN
                        Penny introduced Bobby to the 
                        supplier at the store here. 

                                 WALTER
                        You don’t sound like you’re from 
                        Bermuda.

                                 GWEN
                        I’m from Boston actually. I didn’t 
                        want to be lame, cause of the band 
                        thing, and mention it, but-

                                 WALTER
                        No. That’s not lame. That’s 
                        awesome. What part?

                                 GWEN
                        Quincy. 

                                 WALTER
                        No kidding! I’m from Charlestown.

                                 GWEN
                        Half my family’s from Charlestown. 
                        What block?
                                 WALTER
                        Like Warren and Pleasant.

                                 GWEN
                        My uncle lived on Warren and 
                        Cordis.

                                 WALTER
                        That’s two blocks. That’s crazy.

                                 GWEN
                        Nuts.

           Their eye contact lingers. 

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        I explained we wanted to make a 
                        little easy cash. All the music 
                        guys are diversifying right now. 

                                 PENNY
                        Bobby was saying if you’re not the 
                        front man, they just screw you.

           Walter eyes Zachary, then Gwen looking at him.

                                 WALTER
                        Yeah. They really fuck ya.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        I thought our drummer here, he 
                        could help us move more shorts 
                        through customs. What do you say?

           Walter eyes Zachary, looks to Gwen.

                                 WALTER
                        I’ll think it over.

           An awkward beat.

                                 PENNY
                        Hey, you guys busy this afternoon?

                                 GWEN
                        Oh yeah, we rented a boat. We’re 
                        going water skiing. Do you water 
                        ski?!

                                 WALTER
                        Not really, but-

           Zachary looks to Penny, Gwen...and Walter.
                                 WALTER (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        I don’t know about this!

           EXT. OCEAN - DAY

           Zachary at the wheel of a SPEED BOAT in the harbor. Penelope 
           smoking a cigarette and drinking a cocktail.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        You’ll be fine.

           REVEAL: In the water behind the boat, TWO BIG FAT SKI TIPS 
           protrude from the water, attached to Walter’s feet.

                                 WALTER
                             (tipping and bobbing)
                        Hard to stay up right here.

                                 GWEN
                        I’ll hold you steady.

           Gwen treading water beside Walter, she steadies him.

                                 WALTER
                        So how long you down here for?

                                 GWEN
                        Guess until Penny gets sick of me.

                                 WALTER
                        I don’t see anyone getting sick of 
                        you.

           Gwen blushes. Walter eyes her. She giggles. 

                                 WALTER (CONT’D)
                        What?

                                 GWEN
                        Nothing.

                                 WALTER
                        No, what is it?

                                 GWEN
                        I bet being in a band, girls just 
                        throw themselves at you all the 
                        time?

           Walter fights a shit-eating grin hard as he can...loses.

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        I fell like a log.
                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        Here we go, ready?

           Zachary floors the boat, Walter pulls up, and over with a 
           SPLASH, gets dragged brutally as he refuses to let go. 
           Zachary stops. Walter comes up sputtering. Gwen LAUGHING.

                                 WALTER
                        What are you laughing at? 

                                 GWEN
                        If you fall, just let it go. 

                                                           TIME CUT TO:

           Walter floating again before the triangle grip.

                                 GWEN (CONT’D)
                        You got to just let it pull you 
                        along. Just lean into it. Don’t 
                        fight it. Let it guide you.

           Walter eyes Gwen, taking in those poignant words.

                                 WALTER
                        Just let it pull me along?

                                 GWEN
                        Yeah. Just let it pull you along. 
                        It’s an amazing feeling when you 
                        let go, and just feel it.

           Walter smiles, nods.

                                 GWEN (CONT’D)
                        I’m gonna get back in the boat. You 
                        steady?

           Walter shakes his hips, turns his ski tips to right and left.

                                 WALTER
                        Yeah, I’m under control.

                                 GWEN
                        Good. But don’t be too under 
                        control. You gotta let it take you.

                                 WALTER
                        Let it take me. Got it.

           Gwen swims to the boat, and Penny helps her aboard.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        He doing okay?
                                 GWEN
                        Yeah. He’s actually really sweet.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        I agree. Surprisingly cool.

                                 PENNY
                        Think he’s okay?

           Zachary looks to Walter, gives him an A-OKAY signal.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        You good?

                                 WALTER
                        A-okay.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        Think he’s A-okay. 

           Zachary gases the engines, and the wake kicks up. Walter 
           holds tight, his skis making their own wakes as he holds. And 
           lifts from the water, he’s bent over...gonna lose it.

                                 GWEN
                        Ohhh, he’s going over.

           But Walter saves it, leaning back, leaning into it.

           TIGHT ON: Walter’s face, grinning ear to ear, as he walks on 
           water for the first time, shooting across the harbor.

                                 WALTER
                        WOOOOO!

           Johann Strauss’ ON THE BEAUTIFUL BLUE DANUBE rises gently...

           As Zachary begins to make a turn, Walter follows, letting his 
           skis cut diamond drops off the ocean as they spray and turn.

           Gwen gives him a thumbs up. Walter grinning, following the 
           boat back across the harbor beneath the golden sun.

           SHOTS OF: Walter’s ski tips moving in parallel time, Walter 
           looking around at the world passing him by gently, Walter 
           figure-eighting, out of the wake, in, across, out, in...

                                 GWEN
                        He’s a natural.

           Back on Walter’s smiling face.

                                 WALTER
                        I’m a natural.
                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        I was a natural.

           We ZOOM OUT as the boat continues, Walter following its every 
           move just behind in time, like a watery, cosmic dance.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. ENGELBERT HUMPERDINCK SUITE - LATER

           Zachary and Walter packing their suitcases.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        She’s a sweet girl, huh?

                                 WALTER
                        My god. Classy too. Can’t believe 
                        they called us back to Boston 
                        again, I mean the timing. Kazoo.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        She’s not goin’ anywhere. 

                                 WALTER
                        Grand Jury can wait for a piece a 
                        tail like that. 

           Zachary LAUGHS.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        Look, you got any cash?

                                 WALTER
                        What?

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        Cash. Whatever you got. I’m 
                        bringing in more shorts this trip. 

           Walter hesitates.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY (CONT’D)
                        I know Gwen and Penny would 
                        appreciate the extra business. I 
                        give ‘em a cut.

           Walter takes out his wad of cash, counts it. 

                                 WALTER
                        That’s a thousand. I want that 
                        back. And you tell Penny to say 
                        good things about me to Gwen.
                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        No need. She already likes you.

                                 WALTER
                        Did Penny say something?

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        No.

                                 WALTER
                        Then how you know?

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        Look at you. Course she does.

           Walter smiles, flattered.

                                 WALTER
                        Thanks.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        You’re welcome, buddy. I’m gonna 
                        need you to carry this.

           Zachary grabs a GIANT DUFFEL from under his bed, full of 
           Bermuda Shorts, a rainbow of colors. He zips it up.

           EXT. BOSTON LOGAN AIRPORT - DAY

           Zachary, carrying a big duffel, and Walter, with his own 
           giant case, are whisked through customs as Walter FLASHES HIS 
           BADGE, and greeted by Moose on the other side.

                                 MOOSE
                        You got some sun.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        Guy’s been in Bermuda, what do you 
                        want him to do?

           Walter smiles to Zachary, nods, appreciating the support.

                                 MOOSE
                        You guys have chummed up, huh?

           EXT. SUFFOLK COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT - LATER

           Zachary exits the deposition. Walter waiting, smoking.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        It’s fucking freezin’ out here.
                                 WALTER
                        Gonna get a lot colder.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        Not for us.

           Zachary takes out a THICK WAD OF CASH.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY (CONT’D)
                        That’s for you.

           Walter pockets it fast, looks around, up at the courthouse.

                                 WALTER
                        What are you giving it to me here 
                        for? You crazy? 
                             (beat)
                        How much money is in my pocket?

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        Ten grand.

                                 WALTER
                        Ten grand!? Jesus. 

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        Guy went up to 20 a pair for the 
                        cornflower blue. Loved it.

                                 WALTER
                        I didn’t even...how’d you move ‘em? 

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        Got a friend here, a clerk. He 
                        handles the back and forth. 

                                 WALTER
                        That easy?

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        Could be 50 grand in your pocket if 
                        you help me out. With you signing, 
                        we can start shipping too.

           A beat. Walter processing that.

                                 WALTER
                        That’s more than I see in a year. 

           Walter looking down, a little ashamed.
                                 WALTER (CONT’D)
                        They don’t pay you so good putting 
                        your life on the line and what not. 
                        Doesn’t make any sense.

           Zachary smiles, puts a hand on Walters shoulder.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        My dad, he used to say, the world’s 
                        not fair. You figure out why, I’ll 
                        make a buck how I can.

           Walter looks up at Zachary, really hearing that.

           EXT. BOSTON LOGAN AIRPORT - LATER

           Zachary and Walter get out, and hand back their coats.

           REVEAL: INT. MAROON OLDMOBILE - CONTINUOUS

           Nico and McClane watching, Nico ready to get out. Nico takes 
           out his gun, and puts it in the glove compartment.

                                 CARMINE MCCLANE
                        Hold on.

           They spot...Walter, wearing a “Bermuda Yacht Club” tank top 
           as he heads into the airport.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. LF WADE INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - HAMILTON, BERMUDA

           Zachary and Walter’s TWA flight landing again. 

                                 WALTER
                        I want to meet the shorts guy.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        So you’re in?

                                 WALTER
                        I didn’t say that. I just want to 
                        meet him.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        Sebald’s having a yacht party 
                        tonight. I’ll introduce you.

                                 WALTER
                        A yacht party?
                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        Yeah, you got something to wear?

           INT. A.S. COOPER AND SONS LIMITED - HAMILTON - LATER

           Walter stands in the mirror as Zachary oversees him trying on 
           a Mint Green Leisure Suit...CLAPS.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        That’s what I’m talking about. 
                        Mint, baby, mint!

                                 WALTER
                        Sebald thinks we’re in Boston too? 

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        Yeah. Rock stars are trend setters. 
                        He liked that. Why he’s parting 
                        with the shorts so cheap.

                                 WALTER
                        Could be cheaper I was thinking.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        These are quality shorts.

                                 WALTER
                        I’m a quality negotiator.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        If you think-

                                 WALTER
                        Trust me.

           Zachary puts an arm around Walter in the mirror.

                                 ZACHARY
                        Alright, Handsome. I trust you.

                                 WALTER
                        Gwen likes mint, huh?

                                 PENNY
                        She adores it.

           Zachary hands Penny some cash. She goes off to the register.

                                 WALTER
                        I can pay for it.
                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        You’re protecting me down here and 
                        all. It’s the least I can do.

                                 WALTER
                        ...thanks.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        You’re welcome, daddy-o. She’s 
                        gonna eat you up like mint 
                        chocolate chip. 
                             (massaging his shoulders)
                        Nummy num num.

           Walter looks back in the mirror, smoothing his lapels. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. LF WADE INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - HAMILTON, BERMUDA

           Another FLIGHT touching down, rolling to its gate. Carmine 
           McClane and Nico Winter emerge into the sun.

           INT. LF WADE INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - CUSTOMS

           Carmine and Nico are flagged in customs, and a CUSTOMS AGENT 
           takes their bags over to a table.

                                 CUSTOMS AGENT
                        How long will you be on the island?

                                 CARMINE MCCLANE
                        About a week.

                                 CUSTOMS AGENT
                             (unzipping a bag)
                        Wonderful. Vacation?

                                 NICO WINTER
                        Business vacation.

           The Customs Agent starts unrolling shirts, feeling around, 
           finds a toiletries bag, opens it, pulls out...A REVOLVER.

                                 NICO WINTER (CONT’D)
                        Protection. I have a permit here.

                                 CUSTOMS AGENT
                        Yes, sir. Unfortunately, we do not 
                        allow firearms on the island. You 
                        can check it with our office, and 
                        pick it up on your way out.
           Nico eyes Carmine. As the Customs Agent opens McClane’s bag, 
           starts to search, and finds ANOTHER REVOLVER.

                                 CARMINE MCCLANE
                        Shit.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. THE SURETY - A 100 FOOT SCHOONER - HARBOR - NIGHT

           Walter and Zachary hit the raging party on the deck, dressed 
           to the nines...Walter in his mint suit and PLATFORM SHOES.

                                 WALTER
                        So where’s this guy? 

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        Relax. This is social, let’s ease 
                        into the business.

                                 WALTER
                        Right.

           Walter nodding to the music, looking around.

                                 WALTER (CONT’D)
                        So Gwen, what’s she into? You know? 
                        Other than water skiing?

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        I don’t know. Animals. Astrology. 

                                 WALTER
                        Like stars and shit?

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        No, no. Like the birth signs. 
                        Scorpio, Aires, that kinda shit.

                                 WALTER
                        She’s into that weird stuff?

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        All the ladies are. That planet 
                        poetry’s like pussy nip.

                                 WALTER
                        I don’t know anything about it.

           Zachary grabs two champagnes off a passing tray. 
                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        Make it up. Everybody else does. 
                        When were you born?

                                 WALTER
                        January 8th.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        So you’re a Capricorn. Sensitive. 
                        Faithful. Tender.

                                 WALTER
                        Yeah, like hell. 

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        No. That’s good. They love that. 

                                 WALTER
                        What are you?

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        Gemini. 

                                 WALTER
                        So what is that snitchy...junky?

           Zachary LAUGHS. Then sniffs, wipes his watery eyes.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        Gemini. We’re two. Talkative cats, 
                        airy, creative, like moving around.

                                 WALTER
                        What’s Gwen?

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        Why don’t you ask her, Capricorn?

           Walter turns, crowd parting, and sees Gwen in a pink body 
           suit...giant white platforms...Walter swallows.

                                                           TIME CUT TO:

           Gwen and Walter dancing...not talking. Gwen shouts over music-

                                 GWEN
                        I like your suit.

                                 WALTER
                        Thanks. Got it today. It’s mint. 
                             (off her non-reaction)
                        ...You look good too.
                                 GWEN
                        Thanks. 

                                 WALTER
                        So when were you born?

           Gwen a little weirded out.

                                 GWEN
                        It’s not nice to ask a woman that.

                                 WALTER
                        Oh no. I just. I mean what date? 
                        Like what’s your birth sign?

                                 GWEN
                        Oh. Pices. Are you into the Zodiac?

                                 WALTER
                        The what?

                                 GWEN
                        The Zodiac. 

                                 WALTER
                        No, no. I’m a Capricorn. Do I look 
                        like a Zodiac?

           Gwen LAUGHS.

                                 WALTER (CONT’D)
                        What? 

           Gwen LAUGHS again.

                                 WALTER (CONT’D)
                        Capricorns. We’re sensitive guys. 
                        You can’t just laugh at us. 
                             (beat)
                        So I hear Pices and Capricorns, 
                        they go good together.

                                 GWEN
                        Not as good as Pices and Zodiacs.

                                 WALTER
                             (dismayed)
                        Oh. Okay then.

           Gwen smiles, charmed at Walter’s cuteness, dances up closer 
           to him. Walter pleasantly surprised. Walter gets his 
           shoulders involved in his moves, starting to loosen up.

                                                           TIME CUT TO:
           Walter and Gwen by the bar, a COUPLE moves away, leaving them 
           with Penelope, Bobby Zachary and the Man in the Panama Hat.

                                 WALTER (CONT’D)
                        Hey there! Great party!

           Bobby Zachary nervous a moment, just a flash.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        Uh, Walter, this is my friend 
                        Sebald I was telling you about.

           Sebald, in the Panama Hat, extends his hand. Walter grabs it.

                                 SEBALD
                        Pleased to meet you.

                                 WALTER
                        Great party. This is your boat?

                                 SEBALD
                        Yes. 

                                 WALTER
                        Gorgeous. Really.

                                 SEBALD
                        Thank you.

           Zachary watching Walter butter Sebald up, looks to Penny.

                                 WALTER
                        No, I mean, wow. Must be expensive.

                                 SEBALD
                        Uh, well, I-

                                 WALTER
                        I’m kidding. I’m kidding.
                             (beat)
                        You ever feel like you overpaid?

           Sebald looks to Zachary--wtf? Gwen and Penny trading looks.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        He’s kidding. He means no offense.

                                 WALTER
                        No of course. No offense. I just, I 
                        would hate if you felt that way, 
                        that you’re overpaying. That would 
                        be crummy. Feels crummy to overpay 
                        for something. Even if it is nice.
                                 SEBALD
                        ...true.

           Walter fixes a weird stare on Sebald.

                                 WALTER
                        I feel like me and Bobby, we feel 
                        like we’re overpaying a little. 

           Sebald looks away from Walter’s weird stare to Zachary.

                                 WALTER (CONT’D)
                        We’re music stars here, leaders of 
                        taste. We’re not just selling. 
                        We’re marketing. 

                                 SEBALD
                        Well-

                                 WALTER
                        They’re shorts. It’s half a pants. 
                        Let’s call it half.

                                 SEBALD
                        The shorts?

                                 WALTER
                        We’ll give you a dollar a pair, and 
                        double our next order. 

                                 SEBALD
                        ...sure. 

           Walter blinks, trying not to advertise his own shock at the 
           easy victory, playing it cool...

                                 WALTER
                        Good. Great. Look forward to being 
                        in business with you, Seb. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           The bar area, Walter passing shots, elated.

                                 WALTER (CONT’D)
                        Was that incredible or what?!

                                 GWEN
                        It was incredible!

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        He just folded.
                                 PENNY
                        Half a pants. I mean.

                                 GWEN
                        Where’d you learn to negotiate? 

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        The balls on this guy.

                                 WALTER
                        Not in the balls. It’s in the eyes.

           Walter repeats his weird negotiating stare. 

                                 WALTER (CONT’D)
                        Save my balls for other things.

           Gwen giggles. Everyone LAUGHS, raising their glasses.

                                 PENNY
                        To a dollar a pair!

           A MONTAGE OF THE BOAT PARTY...

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        I was on cloud nine.

           *Walter dancing, wildly, weird, but awesome.

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        And I’m not one to brag. But boy 
                        was I a dancer. Boy.

           *Walter dancing more, doing Travolta’s knee up-and-downs, a 
           Russian-Disco blend. Gwen loving it, LAUGHING.
           *Shots, more shots, more shots at the bar on the deck.
           *Zachary talking with the Guy in the Panama Hat.
           *Walter drinking more with Gwen, LAUGHING. 
           *Dancing more, the CROWD loving him, Walter showboating.

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        Felt like the world was mine. 
                        Totally in control.

           Walter motions for Gwen to duck, and he runs, and leaps, and 
           DOES THE SPLITS as he leaps over her, lands it...

                                 PARTIERS
                        RIGHT ON! BEAUTIFUL, MAN! LOOK OUT!

           And hits the railing, ENDO’ing, and NAILS HIS HEAD AGAINST 
           THE HULL with a THUMP as he falls into the SEA.
                                 GWEN
                        Oh my god!

           EXT. OCEAN - CONTINUOUS

           Walter lies floating face down in the water. All the GUESTS 
           LAUGH, think he’s joking. Gwen LAUGHING.

           A DRUNK GUY grabs a life-saver, and CHUCKS it, like 50 feet 
           past Walter, nowhere close. Walter goes under. 

           EXT. UNDER WATER - CONTINUOUS

           Walter starts to sink into the black water, his body rolls, 
           his bleary eyes open, looking up at the lights of the boat.

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        I knocked myself good. But I 
                        remember, looking up, through the 
                        water, and seeing ‘em all laughing. 
                        They thought I was fooling around. 
                        I remember thinking, that was it. 
                        That was how I was gonna die. And 
                        all I was thinking about was...I 
                        felt happy, happier than I can 
                        remember feeling in a long time.

           A LEISURE SUIT pierces the surface like a knife, Bobby 
           Zachary diving down for Walter, he swims two strokes, and 
           grabs his drunk, drowning protector.

           He brings him to the surface as Walter’s PLATFORM SHOES 
           continue to sink...we hold on the shoes drowning a moment.

           EXT. OCEAN SURFACE - MOMENTS LATER

           Zachary emerges with Walter, who COUGHS, spits water.

                                 VARIOUS GUESTS
                        Oh shit./That was for real./He 
                        saved him./Guitar guy saved him.

           Zachary powerfully swims Walter to shore.

           EXT. PINK SANDS BEACH - MOMENTS LATER

           Both lie in the sand beneath the shining stars. Walter 
           COUGHING. Zachary exhausted. 
                                 WALTER
                        You saved my life. 
                             (LAUGHS)
                        I’m the one supposed to save your 
                        ass.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        Well, now you really owe me.

                                 WALTER
                        God, I thought that was it. 

           Walter lies back into the soft, warm sand...wasted. A long, 
           pregnant silence. 

                                 WALTER (CONT’D)
                        You know I was in a biker gang 
                        after the army. I wasn’t always on 
                        the do good.

           Zachary looks over at Walter.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        You kidding?

                                 WALTER
                        Ruby Emeralds Motor Club. I was 
                        fucking President and everything.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        You’re just full of surprises. 

                                 WALTER
                        Shit. Says the secret war hero.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        Nah, serious, I figured you were 
                        one of those generational guys, 
                        cops back to the Mayflower shit. 

           Walter stares up at the twinkling stars, eyes hazy.

                                 WALTER
                        My Uncle was a cop. 

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        Yeah. Big hero type?

                                 WALTER
                        Fucking idiot type. 

           Zachary LAUGHS. Walter LAUGHS too.
                                 WALTER (CONT’D)
                        Drunk. Said I couldn’t do it. Said 
                        I didn’t have what it takes. 

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        You showed him.

           Walter belches soft and low.

                                 WALTER
                        Not sure working for Boston shows 
                        anyone much anything. Father served 
                        the commonwealth 30 years for shit.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        Thought he wasn’t a cop?

                                 WALTER
                        Animal control. My father, he was a 
                        gentle kinda guy.

           A quiet beat.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        Hard being a soft man in C-town.

                                 WALTER
                        I didn’t say soft. Who said soft? 

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        Gentle. Whatever. Sorry. Shit look, 
                        my father, he was like that. Old 
                        man always said you gotta be tough 
                        or smart. Problem was...he wasn’t 
                        either. Streets chewed him up. Got 
                        shot in a sour deal in sixty-one. 
                        Had to raise my sister, look after 
                        my mother. She got sick.

                                 WALTER
                        Jesus. 

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        My pops had it a little wrong. I 
                        had to get smart, and it was tough.

                                 WALTER
                        Man, I get it. Gotta pick a side to 
                        survive. Next thing, you so wrapped 
                        up in it...you’re not even living.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        What I been trying to tell you.
           Walter looks to Zachary, smiles.

                                 WALTER
                        I dig.

           The guys look back up to the stars. 

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        It’s a lonely thing, a life of 
                        service, undercover and what not. 
                             (beat)
                        Not sure how it happened with Bobby 
                        and me... but there was a true 
                        friendship that happened there.

           A SHOOTING STAR passes in a slightly over-the-top fashion.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. SNOOKER HALL - FRONT STREET - LATER

           McClane and Winter step into the dark, smoke-filled SNOOKER 
           HALL. They spot a BARTENDER in a bow-tie, and approach.

                                 CARMINE MCCLANE
                        We’re looking for Bermuda Ted. 

                                 THE BARTENDER
                        I’m Ted. 
                             (off their looks)
                        I guess some people call me Bermuda 
                        Ted. It’s really just Ted though.

                                 NICO WINTER
                        Two G&T’s, Ted. 

           Winter takes out a WAD OF CASH...way too much for the drinks. 
           Ted the Bartender eyes the cash a long beat.

                                 TED 
                        Freddie, the door, mate, please.

           A GUY looks up from his SNOOKER TABLE, puts his cue aside, 
           and goes to lock the entrance. Ted opens the bar top.

           INT. SNOOKER HALL - KITCHEN - LATER

           Ted leads McClane and Winter into his kitchen.

                                 TED 
                        So what you looking for?
                                 NICO WINTER
                        Twenty-two’s. Something automatic.

           Ted eyes them...LAUGHS.

                                 NICO WINTER (CONT’D)
                        Did I make a fucking joke?

                                 TED 
                        Sorry. I think someone’s given you 
                        the wrong information.

           Carmine looks to Nico...and grabs Ted by the NUTS, squeezes.

                                 TED (CONT’D)
                        Christ!

                                 CARMINE MCCLANE
                        How‘bout the right information then-

                                 TED
                        Ah, Christ man, ahhh.

           Carmine lets him go, Ted doubled over, COUGHING.

                                 NICO WINTER
                        They said you did weapons.

                                 TED
                        Bludgeons, blades...the bobbies 
                        don’t even carry firearms.

           McClane looks to Winter, dumbfounded.

                                 NICO WINTER
                        For fuck’s sake.

                                 CARMINE MCCLANE
                        What the hell is this place?

           around the fire, bodies grooving in the firelight.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        Tough to beat this, huh?

                                 WALTER
                        Sometimes I think the wise guys 
                        actually found us, killed us. That 
                        we’ve just died and gone to heaven.

           Zachary LAUGHS, raises his Dark N’Stormy to Walter.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        Hear, hear.

           They drink, and stare into the flames.

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        And then that storm of hell came 
                        crashing.

           A plane landing in a SNOW STORM, practically white out.

           Moose flashes a badge, bringing Walter and Zachary through 
           customs, Zachary holding another LARGE DUFFEL. 

                                 MOOSE
                        Things have gotten fucked.

           EXT. BOSTON LOGAN AIRPORT - PARKING LOT

           Walter and Zachary step out into the flurries in flowery 
           short sleeves and Bermuda shorts, and FOUR GIANT DUFFELS.
                                 WALTER
                        Shit it’s cold.

                                 MOOSE
                        Yeah. It’s Boston.

           BPD Detectives meet them with coats, take them to the car. 

           INT. MOOSE’S CAR - MOVING - MOMENTS LATER

           Moose drives through the thick snow.

                                 MOOSE
                        Byrn lost the election.

                                 WALTER
                        What?

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        Who are we dealing with now?

                                 MOOSE
                        Flanagan’s the new DA. He wants a 
                        sit down with you two. Today. 

           Moose FISH TAILS as he takes a turn, a STREET SIGN BLOWING in 
           the gale force winds and snow.

                                 MOOSE (CONT’D)
                        They’re saying 30 inches. 

           INT. DA’S OFFICE - WAITING ROOM - LATER

           Walter and Zachary sitting in the waiting room, flowery 
           shirts under their giant coats. Off the snow on his shoes-

                                 WALTER
                        What about...snow flake white?

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        What?

                                 WALTER
                        As a color. For the Bermudas.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        I feel like that says cold. They’re 
                        shorts. Hot weather apparel.
                                 WALTER
                        Yeah, reminds you you’re lucky to 
                        be wearing ‘em. You know, enjoy the 
                        moment at hand. It’s multi-layered.

           Zachary nods, looking exhausted.

                                 WALTER (CONT’D)
                        How you doing?

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        I’m alright. I’m alright.

                                 WALTER
                        You haven’t had a fix in a while.

           Bobby Zachary pauses a moment, and then starts shaking his 
           knee, wipes his nose.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        I’m starting to hurt. For sure.

           Walter eyes Zachary...he wasn’t hurting a moment before.

                                 WALTER
                        You want me to talk to someone?

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        Nah, nah. I don’t know this 
                        Flanagan guy. I wanna be straight.

                                 WALTER
                        I know him.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        What’s he like?

                                 WALTER
                        An asshole.

           Zachary LAUGHS.

                        100,000 fucking dollars!

           INT. NEWMAN FLANAGAN’S OFFICE - LATER

           Zachary, Walter and Moose sit tightly packed on a couch.

           NEWMAN FLANAGAN, tall and blonde, the new DA, stands behind 
           Garrett Byrn’s old desk, irate.
                                 NEWMAN FLANAGAN
                        I’m looking at a bill, this office 
                        is looking at a bill for 100 g’s. 
                             (reading off a bill)
                        10 grand at the Empire Club? 30 
                        grand at Sebald Apparel & Co?

                                 WALTER
                        We’re entertaining our hosts, 
                        trying to keep the relationship up.

                                 NEWMAN FLANAGAN
                        Two grand in water skiing rentals? 
                        What kind of circus was Byrn 
                        running here?

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        I stuck my neck out for you. He was 
                        taking care of me.

                                 NEWMAN FLANAGAN
                        You stuck your neck out for him. I 
                        just inherited this mess. Trial’s 
                        at least three months away. Al 
                        Hutton’s representing Ierardi. Got 
                        all kinds of motions up my ass. I 
                        could have gotten an extra three 
                        acres on the Cape for this kind of 
                        dough.

                                 WALTER
                        Mr. Flanagan-

                                 NEWMAN FLANAGAN
                        No, you shut up, Robinson. They say 
                        you’re some kind of golden boy. 
                        They talking about your tan? Let me 
                        be clear, and this goes for you 
                        too, Moose.

           Moose looks up, been trying to be invisible the entire time.

                        If we don’t get our conviction, 
                        after all this shit. If I have to 
                        sit in that mess, and answer those 
                        questions...you’re done in this

                        your ass.

                        Weather was bad when we got back to

           INT. ENGELBERT HUMPERDINCK SUITE - LATER

           Walter and Zachary stand over a pile of shorts on the bed.

                        I’m pulling the plug.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        You can’t pull the plug.

                                 WALTER
                        Flanagan’s not fucking around.

                        I need this, man. It’s not a game-

                                 WALTER
                        Listen to me, I’m your friend, I’m 
                        not gonna let ‘em sell you down the

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        I do trust you. But you’re not 
                        gonna be able to stop ‘em.

                                 CARMINE MCCLANE (O.S.)
                        No, you’re not.
           They turn to see Carmine and Nico stepping into the room with 
           Steak Knives flashing in the light.

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        They caught us unaware.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        Oh god.

                                 WALTER
                        Run, Bobby!

           Nico swipes.

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        I grabbed Nico’s knife hand, like 
                        they taught me at the Academy.

           Walter grabs his arm.

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        And tackled him onto the water bed.

           Walter TACKLES HIM ONTO THE WATER BED. The knife hits.

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        And Pop! The thing just blew. 

           Water EXPLODES everywhere, in a massive surge, rushing Nico 
           off, and taking out Carmine in a roaring wall of water...

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        It was a miracle.

           They’re thrown into the glass, SMASH THROUGH with the water.

           EXT. ENGELBERT HUMPERDINCK SUITE - BALCONY - CONTINUOUS

           And are driven right up and over the balcony, in a human 
           waterfall to the sand. Carmine and Nico disoriented a beat, 
           then get to their feet...

                                 NICO WINTER
                        Shit.

           Nico looks up at Walter and Zachary on the balcony above, and 
           helps Carmine to his feet.

                                 NICO WINTER (CONT’D)
                        Let’s go, let’s go.

           Walter climbs up on the balcony.
                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        What are you doing?

           Nico and Carmine start running off down the beach, into the 
           dark, Walter about to leap, and Zachary grabs him.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY (CONT’D)
                        They’re gone. You gotta stay with 
                        me, there could be more. Others.

           Zachary is genuinely terrified for his life. Walter nods.

           INT. CASTLE HARBOR - LOBBY - LATER

           Carl Rose and a bunch of his Bermuda Bobbies stand around as 
           Walter explains the situation, re-enacting the water bed pop, 
           and explosion of water that saved them.

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        I put Rose and his boys on alert. 
                        Our cover was blown.

           EXT. ENGELBERT HUMPERDINCK SUITE - BALCONY - MOMENTS LATER

           Zachary looks out at the sea. Walter beside him.

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        Zachary was shaken up bad.

                                 WALTER
                        I’m taking you back to Boston. I 
                        can’t protect you here anymore.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        I gotta stash more first. 

                                 WALTER
                        Bobby. The shorts thing is done.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        But I’m gonna need to get away. 
                        Forever. I don’t want to die, man.

           Zachary starts tearing up.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY (CONT’D)
                        I’m scared, Walter. I’m so scared.

                                 WALTER
                        Come here. Come here.

           Walter embraces Zachary, as Bobby breaks down in sobs.
                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        I can’t die. I don’t want to die.

                                 WALTER
                        I’m not gonna let that happen. It’s 
                        okay, pal. You’re gonna be fine.

           Zachary releases Walter from the hug, pulls himself together.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        You promise me, man?

                                 WALTER
                        Yeah. I promise. I’m your friend. 

           Zachary eyes Walter.

                        I got your back. Whatever happens 
                        with this case. You can trust me.

           Zachary looks to Walter, and nods, wiping his face.

           INT. THE ENGELBERT HUMPERDINK SUITE - NIGHT 

           Walter’s BAGS are packed at the foot of his bed. 

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        I said goodbye to Gwen that night. 

           He’s naked, making love slowly to Gwen in the moonlight.

                                 GWEN
                        You have to go? 

                                 WALTER
                        Yeah, baby. And listen, I haven’t 
                        been honest with you.

                                 GWEN
                        What are you talking about?

                                 WALTER
                        I want to tell you the truth.

                                 GWEN
                        While you’re making love to me?

                                 WALTER
                        Well...I thought.

           Walter rolls off, looks at Gwen in the moonlight.
                                 WALTER (CONT’D)
                        Truth is I’m not in the band Boston-

           Gwen’s face is unreadable.

                                 WALTER (CONT’D)
                        I’m a detective. 

                                 GWEN
                        It was all a lie?

                                 WALTER
                        Not all. All the other stuff is 
                        true. I am from Boston. 
                        Charlestown. Like I said.
                             (beat)
                        You taught me how to ski... 

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        I told her...

                                 WALTER
                        We taught each other how to love. I 
                        had a job to do. I still do. I 
                        wouldn’t be telling you any of this 
                        if I didn’t care.

           Gwen eyes Walter, and rolls away.

                                 WALTER (CONT’D)
                        I really do. I love you, Gwen. 

           Gwen is silent. Walter looking at her unresponsive back, sad.

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        It wasn’t the way I wanted to leave 
                        things. I felt like an asshole. I 
                        really thought I was the bad guy.

                                                               FADE TO:

           EXT. DOCKS - LATER

           Carmine smokes. And the BOOM LIGHT on a Yacht comes on. 

                                 NICO WINTER
                        Boss said these guys were legit.

                                 CARMINE MCCLANE
                        How legit?

                                 NICO WINTER
                        Cuban legit.
           They approach the yacht, a CIGARETTE EMBER glowing in the 
           dark moves to the dock, puts some HEAVY SHAPE down, and 
           disappears again below deck. The BOOM LIGHT goes off again.

           Nico and Carmine approach, and see the CUBAN FLAG hanging 
           from the back of this dark vessel, nod. And then see...

           A LARGE CRATE LABELED RAT POISON.

                                                                CUT TO:

                                 CHAPTER CARD
                        Bermuda Low

           Aerosmith’s DREAM ON plays over...

           EXT. THE CAUSEWAY - DAY

           Walter drives a moped, Zachary behind him, arms around him. 
           Bermuda PD escorting them at front and back.

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        That was it.

           They start across the causeway, a narrow road with ocean on 
           either side that connects Hamilton and the big Bermuda island 
           to St. David’s island and the airport.

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        We were on our way outta paradise. 

           EXT. THE CAUSEWAY - SAME

           McClane and Winter wait at a scenic turnout on the causeway, 
           and get out of their vehicle with the heavy RAT POISON CRATE. 

           They pop it open, and remove TWO AK-47’s, clips of ammo. 

                                 NICO WINTER
                        He doesn’t leave this island.

           Winter slaps his clip in, loads a round -- CLICK-CLICK.

           EXT. THE CAUSEWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Clive, at the lead of the miniature motorcade, wind blowing 
           through the hair sticking out the sides of his bobby helmet.
                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        We were on our way out, crossing 
                        the Causeway, on the way to LF Wade-

           And A RIP OF GUNFIRE HITS CLIVE! 

           He flies off his moped, rolls on the pavement. 

           The Moped crashes into a guard rail, and EXPLODES in a tiny 
           little POP. Walter hits the brakes on his Moped, turns sharp. 

           He TACKLES Zachary off the back as a WAVE OF MACHINE GUN FIRE 
           sprays across the top of the bike.

           Carl Rose and Two Other Mopeds COLLIDE as they swerve, go 
           sparking as they skid, the coppers running for cover.

                                 WALTER
                        I thought there were no guns on 
                        this island?!

           Carl Rose holds his helmet tight, as they crouch behind the 
           overturned mopeds.

                                 CARL ROSE
                        This is a first.

           ANOTHER RIP of machine gun fire.

                                 WALTER
                        You guys really couldn’t carry 
                        guns? Really?

           Walter glances up, THROWS A ROCK at Nico, who ducks. 

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        We were ambushed, pinned down.

                                 CARMINE MCCLANE
                        It’s over, you fucking rat.

                                 NICO WINTER
                        Been on borrowed time since they 
                        missed you at Blackfriars.

           Another RIP of gun fire. Walter looks to Zachary.

                                 WALTER
                        What’s he talking about? Missed you 
                        at Blackfriars? You were supposed 
                        to be at Blackfriars?
                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        Wheels started to turn for me. 
                        Right in the middle of all the 
                        action, things got real clear. How 
                        you hear about sometimes. I heard 
                        about guys having things like this 
                        in Nam. The clarity.

           Another RIP of gun fire. Winter and McClane closing in. 

                                 WALTER
                        Ierardi was gonna kill you at 
                        Blackfriars?

           Zachary terrified, just pinned down with the rest of the 
           officers...and Walter grabs Zachary, starts to CHOKE him.

                                 WALTER (CONT’D)
                        He didn’t talk to you on a tape. He 
                        was gonna kill you.

                                 CARL ROSE
                        Hey Walt? What are you doing there?

           Zachary, eyes wide, his hands on Walter’s wrists.

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        I realized, here, see, that if 
                        Zachary was supposed to be killed 
                        at Blackfriars, then Ierardi was 
                        supposed to kill Zachary. 

                                                              FLASH TO:

           BLACKFRIARS:

           Ierardi holding a shotgun in Jack Kelly’s face.

                                 BILLY IERARDI
                             (hint of a lisp)
                        Where’sth your friend at?

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        And that meant, he sure as hell 
                        didn’t talk to him.

           BPD HQ:

           Zachary stands with his shirt off as Detectives 1 and 2 TAPE 
           a MASSIVELY CONSPICUOUS RECORDER to his chest.
                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        The son of a bitch faked that tape.

           THE CAUSEWAY AGAIN:

           Walter’s eyes wide, strangling Zachary.

                                 WALTER
                        You faked that tape?!

           Nico and Carmine come around the mopeds, and see Walter on 
           top of Zachary, choking him. They share a confused look.  

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        They came around, saw me choking 
                        Zachary, trying to kill him myself. 

           Carmine looks to Rose and the guys, hands up, they shrug.

                                 NICO WINTER
                        Hey!

           But Walter is locked on Zachary, who’s going red.

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        It was Zachary’s voice on the tape. 

           OUTSIDE FENWAY:

           Zachary gets out of the back of the car alone, Homicide 
           Detectives 1 and 2 watching him disappear into the crowd.

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        No one had watched him meet with 
                        Ierardi...

           THE CAUSEWAY AGAIN:

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        He faked the tape.

                                 WALTER
                        This whole thing, it’s all your 
                        fucking con. We got no case! It’s 
                        your voice on that tape.

           Zachary’s eyes bulging. And a BARREL OF AN AK pokes Walter in 
           the shoulder. He looks up, Nico and Carmine standing there.
                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        I didn’t even see ‘em I was so mad. 
                        I was seeing red. And they poke me 
                        with their AK, and I look up...

                                 CARMINE MCCLANE
                             (smiles)
                        We’ll take care of the rat. 

           Walter eyes them, and in a flash, grabs the barrel, and pulls 
           it forward, from Carmine’s hand, spins it, and FIRES...

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        Thinking back on it, it was like I 
                        was in slow motion...

           AND WE GO SLOW MOTION: Three shots rip through Carmine’s 
           CHEST, he falls. Nico starts firing as Walter stands.

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        I took rounds in the arm, the 
                        chest, the leg...

           Walter taking a round in the arm, the chest, the leg.

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        Started to go down.

           Walter starts to go down, but draws up Carmine’s Weapon like 
           a cowboy drawing his shooter.

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        But I was too fast. I drew. Fired.

           SIX ROUNDS shaking Nico’s body as he dances like a rag doll. 
           He falls off the causeway into the ocean. 

           Walter drops. Carl Rose and Bermuda PD standing, getting 
           their wits back slowly. SIRENS heard in the distance.

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        I saved his life, but it was all...

                                 WALTER
                        ...for shit.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        You saved my life.

                                 WALTER
                             (a finger to his lips)
                        Shhhh.
           Walter closes his eyes as the SIRENS close in.

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

                        Spilling The Beans in Bean Town

           INT. HOSPITAL - LATER

           Walter lies in a hospital gown, hooked up to an IV, his arm 
           in a sling, leg elevated, gun shot wounds wrapped.

           And Moose and Newman Flanagan enter, CLAPPING.

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        They thought I was this big hero.

                                 NEWMAN FLANAGAN
                        Is there a hero in this room?

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        And in many ways, they were right. 
                        I was. I really was.

           Walter smiles weakly. Moose approaches, rolls up his sleeve, 
           offers his arm for arm wrestling.

                                 MOOSE
                        Rematch?
                             (bursts out LAUGHING)
                        Hell of a job, kid. Hell of a job.

                                 NEWMAN FLANAGAN
                        You don’t look so good.

                                 MOOSE
                        Guy took three rounds.

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        They didn’t want to hear it. But I 
                        was still a cop. I still cared 
                        about the truth. After all that 
                        bullshit, it was all I cared about-

                                 WALTER
                        It’s about Zachary.

                                 NEWMAN FLANAGAN
                        What about him?
                                 WALTER
                        The tape. You ever have the tape he 
                        got of Ierardi analyzed?

                                 NEWMAN FLANAGAN
                        For what?

                                 WALTER
                        It’s not his voice on the tape.

                                 NEWMAN FLANAGAN
                        What are you talking about?

                                 MOOSE
                        You been playing with the morphine 
                        button, buddy?

                                 WALTER
                        No, look, Zachary...he was the 
                        target with Kelly that night. At 
                        Blackfriars. Him and Kelly. They 
                        thought they were selling secrets. 

                                 NEWMAN FLANAGAN
                        Okay. Just get some rest.

                                 WALTER
                        If Ierardi was supposed to kill him 
                        that night, that sure is hell ain’t 
                        his voice tellin’ his old buddy all 
                        about it. 

                                 MOOSE
                        Then whose is it?

                                 WALTER
                        Zachary’s. He did the lisp, the 
                        whole thing. He’s a confidence man.

                                 NEWMAN FLANAGAN
                        Shut up, alright.

                                 WALTER
                        Ierardi woulda killed Zachary if 
                        he’d been anywhere near him. 
                        Zachary made all this shit up. He 
                        faked the tape. He did it to save 
                        his ass, he knew they were already 
                        out to get him. Cracked that safe 
                        in Back Bay looking to skip town in 
                        a hurry with cash. It was all to 
                        save his own ass.
                                 NEWMAN FLANAGAN
                        I said shut up, Walter.

                                 WALTER
                        It’s the truth.

                                 NEWMAN FLANAGAN
                        The truth? We got too much riding 
                        on this to give a damn about the 
                        truth. We’re gonna put these 
                        bastards away. Wash our hands.

                                 WALTER
                        They’re gonna find out. Probably 
                        already know. The trial’s gonna 
                        blow apart on you. 

                                 NEWMAN FLANAGAN
                        Your career’s gonna blow apart on 
                        you if you keep going on like this. 
                        You’re a hero. You want to ruin 
                        that with the truth?

           Flanagan stares at Walter.

                                 NEWMAN FLANAGAN (CONT’D)
                        Then keep your mouth shut.

           Flanagan walks out, swatting a GET WELL BALLOON in his way 
           aside. Moose eyes Walter, and follows Flanagan off.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. BOSTON DISTRICT COURT - STEPS - LATER

           Ierardi and Italiano led down the steps of the courthouse by 
           their lawyer, AL HUTTON, swarmed by REPORTERS.

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        Al Hutton. Ierardi and Italiano’s 
                        lawyer figured out the tape was 
                        fake. On his own. Ierardi knew he 
                        didn’t talk to anyone. They got a 
                        voice expert in, identified the 
                        voice as Zachary’s. It was declared 
                        a mistrial on the spot.

           Newman Flanagan and Moose also on the steps, being swarmed.

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        It was a humiliation for the new 
                        DA. For BPD. The level of 
                        incompetence at a new high.
           EXT. BOSTON COMMON - DAY

           Walter, unemployed, sits on a bench, crutches beside him.

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        Flanagan took my badge. Held me 
                        responsible. Thought I leaked that 
                        the tape was fake. It was bullshit. 

           INT. CHARLES STREET JAIL - NIGHT

           Bobby Zachary alone in a jail cell, scared.

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        He charged Zachary with perjury.

           EXT. CHARLES STREET JAIL - DAY

           Zachary leaves the jail, looks around, nervous, and gets in 
           the passenger side of a Skylark idling for him at the curb.

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        But he got off on a technicality.

           INT. APARTMENT COMPLEXT - EVERETT, MA - EVENING

           Italiano watches FAMILY FEUD on television, drinking a beer.

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        Guys who actually did the murders 
                        got off. Walking free. 

           INT. SIGNLE FAMILY HOME - EAST BOSTON - NIGHT

           Ierardi makes unromantic love to that Pale Woman we saw in 
           his house during the raids.

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        Couldn’t be charged again for the 
                        same crime. Even though by then 
                        everyone knew they were the ones 
                        that did it.

           EXT. THE BLACKFRIARS PUB - DAY

           Spring rain falls in front of the boarded up old Blackfriars 
           Pub. PEDESTRIANS passing.
                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        Nobody got anything on anyone. Not 
                        a cent of justice. Not a cent. It 
                        was all one big fugazi. No sense in 
                        it.

           EXT. BOSTON COMMON - DAY

           Walter stares blankly as he watches various PARK-GOERS pass 
           in BERMUDA SHORTS IN BRIGHT COLORS.

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        And I was just sitting on my ass, 
                        wondering how Bobby Zachary pulled 
                        one over on me. All of us. 

           Walter spots a GUY passing in CLOVER GREEN BERMUDAS.

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        And thinking about Gwen.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. A CHARMING BRICK HOUSE - QUINCY - DAY

           Walter pulls up to a familiar looking little house in Quincy.

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        I got her address from an old 
                        contact I had in the county office-

           Walter gets out with a BOUQUET OF MUMS.

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        Thing is, I pulled up to the house. 
                        And I recognized it.

           EXT. CHARMING BRICK HOUSE - QUINCY - FLASHBACK

           Zachary staggers from the house, high out of his mind, waves.

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        It’s where I’d brought Zachary, 
                        before we left for the island.

           INT. A.S. COOPER AND SONS LIMITED - FLASHBACK

                                 GWEN
                        Quincy. 
                                 WALTER
                        No kidding. I’m from Charlestown.

           EXT. CHARMING BRICK HOUSE - QUINCY - CONTINUOUS

           Walter stares at the house. He starts up the walk, knocks on 
           the door. It opens, and he stares at Penelope.

                                 PENNY
                        Walter?

                                 WALTER
                        Is he here?

                                 PENNY
                        Who?

                                 WALTER
                        Zachary? He’s here, isn’t he?

           Walter pushes past her.

                                 PENNY
                        Walter, wait-

           INT. PENNY AND GWEN’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Walter walks into the living room where he sees...

           Gwen and Bobby Zachary. They’re loading familiar DUFFLES full 
           of CASH, a MASSIVE PILE OF TORN BERMUDA SHORTS on the floor.

                                 WALTER
                        Leaving town?

           Zachary and Gwen stand, Penny following from behind.

                                 PENNY
                        Sorry. I didn’t-

                                 WALTER
                        I brought you flowers.

           Walter looks at Gwen, at the flowers.  A beat, and he starts 
           WHIPPING THEM into the wall, petals flying.

                                 GWEN
                        Walter.

           He throws them down.
                                 WALTER
                        You were playing me? You were part 
                        of it?

                                 GWEN
                        You were playing me too.

                                 WALTER
                        It was all a lie?

           Beat.

                                 GWEN
                        Not all of it. I taught you how to 
                        ski. You taught me how to...

                                 WALTER
                        Just stop.

           Walter staring at the money, he takes in a load of their 
           Bermuda Shorts, all torn up...

           And SEVERAL BRICKS OF HEROIN BESIDE THEM.

                                 WALTER (CONT’D)
                        What the hell is that?

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                             (voice way different)
                        Look nobody wanted to hurt anybody. 

                                 WALTER
                        Is that your real voice? Jesus.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                             (smiles kindly)
                        What did Pushkin say--a deception 
                        that elevates us is better than a 
                        host of low truths?

           Walter, just in shock, he lets himself fall back into a plush 
           orange armchair...

                                 PENNY
                        I’ll get him some iced tea.

                                 WALTER
                        That’d be nice...

           Penny goes into the kitchen. Zachary and Gwen looking at 
           Walter, unsure what his next move will be.

                                 WALTER (CONT’D)
                        We were moving drugs in the shorts?
                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        Did you really believe a guy paid 
                        20,000 dollars for a duffel of 
                        Cornflower Blue Bermuda Shorts?

           Penny returns, puts the iced tea down for Walter. He looks at 
           it, takes a sip.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY (CONT’D)
                        You knew I had to get away. Bermuda 
                        Shorts don’t pay don’t look back 
                        money.

                                 WALTER
                        So you turned witness protection 
                        into a drug import business? 
                             (smiles, shakes his head)
                        I was the stooge.

                                 GWEN
                        You were more than that.

                                 WALTER
                        Was I? 

           Gwen can’t hold Walter’s eye contact.

                                 WALTER (CONT’D)
                        Why the band? Why Boston?

           Zachary eyes Walter.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        You use an informant as a mule?

           Walter nods, getting it.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        Needed another reason to believe I 
                        could get through customs clean.

                        They sure as hell weren’t gonna 
                        involve a cop and snitch.

                                 WALTER
                        Are you even a fucking user?

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        Needed a reason to get some freedom-

                                 WALTER
                        Guess I’m not much of a detective.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        You’re a fine detective. You just 
                        believed what you wanted to 
                        believe. What made you happy.

           A quiet beat.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY (CONT’D)
                        It wasn’t personal. You were a good 
                        friend, Walter, god’s honest.

                                 WALTER
                        You were too. 

           Walters face grows dour.

                                 WALTER (CONT’D)
                        But there’s always a midget in the 
                        Turk.

                                 GWEN
                        What?

                                 WALTER
                        Nothing.

                                 GWEN
                        Please, Walter. Bobby’s my brother. 
                        He’s a good man. He doesn’t deserve 
                        to go to prison. He was trying to 
                        help Jack. To help the Bureau with 
                        the Italians. He had to help 
                        himself too. He had to lie. We did. 
                        It doesn’t mean I didn’t care.

                                 WALTER
                        No, I get it. I really do. 
                             (beat)
                        But you fucked me. I’m fucked. 
                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        Nobody knows anything. Nobody’s 
                        gonna find out.

                                 WALTER
                        I’m going down, you’re going down.

           Walter stands, and his world begins to spin, he looks at the 
           iced tea, Penny and Zachary sharing looks.

                                 WALTER (CONT’D)
                        You...

           Walter’s VISION DOUBLES, he tries to turn, and COLLAPSES on 
           the crushed Mums...unconscious.

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        They put drugs in the iced-tea. 

           INT. PENNY AND GWEN’S HOUSE - SUNSET 

           Walter wakes up on the mums, the sunset streaming in through 
           the shutters...

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        When I woke up they were gone. I 
                        looked for ‘em, but no trace...
                             (beat)
                        I never saw them again.

                        The end.

           INT. FACTORY FLOOR - EVENING

           The low sun streams in through the small factory windows. The 
           Author sits there, studying Walter. 

                                 AUTHOR
                        That’s it? That’s the end of it?

                                 WALTER
                        I have trouble believing it too 
                        sometimes. I guess it’s like 
                        Zachary said. I wanted to believe.

                                 AUTHOR
                        That ending holds water like 
                        Zachary’s fucking water bed.
                                 WALTER
                        Uh, well...sorry to disappoint you.

           The Author stops the tape, opens his briefcase, putting the 
           recorder away, he takes a breath, trying to keep his cool.

                                 AUTHOR
                        Off the record. Please.

           Walter sees the guy is pushing, checks his watch, looks out 
           at the fading sunlight a beat.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. CHARMING BRICK HOUSE - QUINCY - LATER

           Walter sits in a car outside Zachary’s house.

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        Off the record. Truth is...I saw 
                        Zachary one more time. The day he 
                        died.

           Walter holds a PRIMITIVE DETONATOR in his hand...As Zachary, 
           Penelope and Gwen pile into Zachary’s car.

           INT. ZACHARY’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Zachary, Gwen and Penny all start climbing out of the bottom 
           of the car, which has been CUT OUT.

           INT. WALTER’S CAR - PARKED - SAME

           Walter checks his watch, and hits the detonator switch. The 
           CAR EXPLODES IN FLAMES!

           CAMERA PANS DOWN: To see below the car, Zachary, Gwen, and 
           Penny climbing into a man-hole cover below the car.

                        They put the bomb in the car, but 
                        then weren’t sure they got ‘em. 
                        That happens sometimes.

                        There was a rumor that they’d ID’d 
                        the bodies from the teeth.

           John Pumpford, the stutterer who owed Walter a favor, takes a 
           MANILA FOLDER from Walter in the parking lot outside.

                                 WALTER
                        I wasn’t there for the conversation 
                        obviously. These are my words. But 
                        trust me, these wise guys, they’re 
                        thorough. Very thorough.

                        They had to confirm the kill. 
                        Couldn’t afford to let Zachary slip 
                        back into protection. Let the DA 
                        try to build a new case.

           Italiano and Ierardi sneak through the morgue with a 
           FLASHLIGHT, past desks and the front office.

           INT. MORGUE - FRIDGE - LATER

           Into the fridge...

                        But Ierardi and Italiano ran into 
                        the wrong guard. Guy had been in 
                        Vietnam. Trigger finger. PTSD and 
                        all that shit.

           Ierardi and Italiano drop their flashlights...as they behold:

           VINCENT SOLMONTE’S SONS...holding shotguns.

           And they start letting the blasts RIP, avenging their dad.

                        Guard snapped.

           Ierardi and Italiano falling in an awful WAVE OF SHOT!

                        Blood and incompetence? That’s a

           The Author REMOVES THE GUN from his briefcase, training it on 
           Walter. Walter raises his hands, not necessarily surprised or 
           intimidated... or at least not showing it.

                                 WALTER
                        You didn’t like the story?

                        You ever heard the story of the 
                        Scorpion and the Frog? 

           The Author getting exasperated.

                                 AUTHOR
                        No, I did not hear that fucking 
                        story, and I do not want to fucking 
                        hear it.

                                 WALTER
                        I’d like to tell it to you. Bobby, 
                        he told it to me one time.
                             (takes a sip of water)
                        See there was a Scorpion and a 
                        Frog. And the Scorpion needed a 
                        ride ‘cross a river cause his 
                        little burrow was flooding, so he 
                        asked the Frog for help. But the 
                        Frog, he was afraid Scorpion was 
                        gonna sting him. Mr. Scorpion 
                        says...”Mr. Frog, pally, that’s 
                        crazy. I sting you in the river, 
                        we’re both gonna fucking drown.” 

           The Author moves the gun right into Walter’s face, but he 
           keeps on telling...

                                 WALTER (CONT’D)
                        But sure enough, half-way across, 
                        Scorpion stings the Frog. And just 
                        before they drown, Mr. Scorpion 
                        asks...”aren’t you gonna ask my why 
                        I did that?” And Mr. Frog goes...
                             (finishing confidently)
                        “I know why you did it.”

           The Author truly confused.

                                 AUTHOR
                        Christ. I don’t...why did he do it?

                                 WALTER
                        Cause a Scorpion’s a Scorpion and 
                        that’s how they do. Don’t matter 
                        what kinda story they’re tellin’ ya-
           Walter smiles confidently.

                                 AUTHOR
                        For fuck’s sake, just tell me wh-

           A Sewing Machine SMASHES over the Author/Hit-man’s head. He 
           drops, loses his gun. 

           BOBBY ZACHARY stands over him, shaking his head.

                                 WALTER
                        Jesus! 

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        What?

                                 WALTER
                        Took long enough. I was running out 
                        of shit to say.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        I was negotiating a new dye. 
                        Primrose Pink. It’s amazing.

           Zachary presents a pair of PRIMROSE PINK BERMUDA SHORTS.

                                 WALTER
                        Primrose? That’s Cherry Blossom.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        Primrose sounds nicer. British. 
                        They’re buying a British fantasy, 
                        via Bermuda. It’s a whole thing.

                                 WALTER
                        But the Japanese like Cherry 
                        Blossom. It should be Cherry 
                        Blossom. Cherry blossom season. 
                        Tokyo’s banana for our Bermudas.  

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        We’ll ask the girls.

                                 WALTER
                        We don’t need to ask the girls.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        We’re asking the girls.

           Walter gets up, glances at the unconscious Author/hit-man, 
           picks up his gun.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY (CONT’D)
                        What we doing with him?
                                 WALTER
                        Pack his ass with dope, drop him in 
                        the gutter outside the police?

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        In Malaysia, are you crazy? This 
                        isn’t Bermuda, Walt. Not like the 
                        old days.

                                 WALTER
                        I know a guy. I won’t touch the 
                        drugs.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        Think Boston’ll track him down?

                                 WALTER
                        If he survives his caning, and 80 
                        years in jail.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        I sorta feel bad.

                                 WALTER
                        What for? He was gonna shoot your 
                        ass. And mine.

           EXT. FACTORY - MALAYSIA - MOMENTS LATER

           Walter steps outside their shorts factory, locking the door, 
           puts the Author/hit-man’s gun in his own Bermuda shorts. 

           He and Zachary start down a sandy stretch of Malaysian 
           paradise, some LOCAL MALAYSIANS sparsely populate the beach.

                                 WALTER
                        Gwen’s gonna be with me on Cherry 
                        Blossom.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        Well Penny likes Primrose.

                                 WALTER
                        So it’s two on two. 

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        I just saved your life.

                                 WALTER
                        After I saved yours.
                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        But I saved yours before. I saved 
                        you first.

                                 WALTER
                        In that ocean drowning bullshit? We 
                        been telling that story so long 
                        you’re starting to believe it.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        Bullshit. You were drowning.

                                 WALTER
                        I was not. I’m a fantastic swimmer.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        You were sputtering. You know. 
                        Don’t you diddle me.

                                 WALTER
                        Sputtering? I was laughing.

                                 BOBBY ZACHARY
                        Laughing my ass. I saved you.

           Their conversation fades as we start to PULL OUT.

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        We all got a story. Some are worth 
                        telling. Some need a little extra.

           We PULL OUT FURTHER from our storytellers.

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        Good cop? Bad cop? 
                             (beat)
                        Criminal? Friend? Truth? 

           And FURTHER.

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        That’s about perception. Justice 
                        too for that matter. 

           FURTHER still.

                                 WALTER (V.O.)
                        So tell your story well. Your life 
                        might depend on it.

           Walter and Bobby walk off into the sunset, arguing on, and we-

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.
