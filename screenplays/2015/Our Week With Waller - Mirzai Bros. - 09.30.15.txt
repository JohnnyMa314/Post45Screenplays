           “Vacation, all I ever wanted.  Vacation, had to get away...” 

                                                             -The Go-Go’s
           INT. DARKENED CONFERENCE ROOM - TIME OF DAY: INDETERMINATE

           We’re in a darkened conference room.  Faceless shadows line a 
           long table, the only things visible are hands folded in laps.

           Are we in the Pentagon?  The United Nations?  A scene from 
           MAD MEN?

           FLIP.

           The lights come on.

           Nope, we’re in a boring meeting room in a boring tech company 
           in a boring city somewhere in California.

           JORDAN JONES, 27.

           Devoted.

           Earnest.

           Lame.

           Just finishes up a presentation that no one seems to have 
           been paying any attention to.

                                 JORDAN
                        In conclusion, ladies and 
                        gentlemen, by switching to recycled 
                        paper in all bathrooms and 
                        breakrooms, QuantEx will be saving 
                        an estimated .002 percent a month
                        on all of its supply costs.  
                             (beat)
                        I made the algorithm myself.

           Jordan waits for a round of applause like he just won a 
           goddamn Oscar, but the room stays silent.

           Until --

           BREWER KEMP, 29, and the polar opposite of Jordan (read: an 
           underachiever and proud of it) leaps to his feet and starts 
           clapping his ass off.

                                 BREWER
                        Yeah, man, you show that fuckin’
                        recycled paper who’s boss!

           Jordan turns BRIGHT RED as the other, more civilized people 
           in the room start to fan out and leave.
           One older man in his 50’s, MR. HARMON, a project manager, is 
           about to leave the conference room when Jordan spots him and 
           rushes after him.

           Jordan grabs his boss’ sleeve before he can get away --

                                 JORDAN
                        Sorry to waste your time on this, 
                        Mr. Harmon.  I just thought that 
                        with everything going on, Upper 
                        Management might like to see some 
                        out-of-the-box-thinking.

           Mr. Harmon looks annoyed that he’s been caught on the way 
           out, but he buries his real reaction and gives Jordan some 
           corporate jargon to chew on --

                                 MR. HARMON
                        We’re all worried about the layoff 
                        rumors, but you don’t have to be 
                        concerned, Jordan.  QuantEx cares
                        about you.

           Some of us just like the taste of bullshit sandwiches a 
           little better than others, and, judging by the relief on 
           Jordan’s face, he’s definitely one of those people.

           He visibly relaxes and lets Harmon off the hook until two 
           hands COME CRASHING DOWN ON HIS SHOULDERS FROM BEHIND HIM.

                                 BREWER
                        Hell of a presentation, JJ, let’s 
                        go get lunch beers and celebrate 
                        that big brain of yours!!

           Jordan walks back to his cubicle with Brewer refusing to take 
           his hands off his shoulders.  

           They go down the hallways looking like the lamest two man 
           conga line this side of San Diego.

           When they finally get back to Jordan’s cubicle, we see it’s 
           so clean and precise it looks like no one even uses it.

           Jordan sits and fires up his computer while Brewer helps 
           himself to Jordan’s mini-fridge and starts inhaling a 
           Yoplait.

           Let’s say, Strawberry Banana.  That shit is bomb.

                                 JORDAN
                        I really thought they’d flip for my 
                        idea...
                                 BREWER
                        They totally did, they were doing 
                        cartwheels in their heads, Jordy.  
                        I bet they make you a project 
                        coordinator like me any day now.

                                 JORDAN
                        I was already a project 
                        coordinator.

                                 BREWER
                        Fine, then project analyst.

                                 JORDAN
                        That’s what I do now.

                                 BREWER
                        Really?  
                             (genuinely stumped)
                        Huh.

                                 JORDAN
                        I just felt kinda humiliated, but 
                        someone has to do something or 
                        we’re all going to be out of jobs 
                        soon.

           Jordan barely finishes his sentence before LINDA, a rotund 
           woman from Accounting, stops in the middle of her tracks and 
           in the middle of her King-Size Snickers bar.

                                 LINDA
                             (half-chewing)
                        Out of jobs?  Oh God, did it happen 
                        already?!

                                 BREWER
                        Calm down, I’ve been here seven 
                        years, they’ve never laid any one 
                        off.  We’re a growth industry.  
                        Chill, people.

           Linda doesn’t know what to believe.  She finds what solace 
           she can in her candy bar and trudges on.

                                 JORDAN
                             (typing)
                        You’re really not the least bit 
                        worried?  I mean, they could let us 
                        go at any second.  The company has 
                        been doing terribly.
                                 BREWER
                        Never gonna happen.  This place is 
                        swimming in cash.  Kylie Jenner
                        will be two sex tapes deep before 
                        QuantEx goes under.

           Jordan’s computer PINGS.  So does his iPad and so does 
           Brewer’s iPhone.  

                                 BREWER (CONT’D)
                             (scooping out the last of 
                              his yogurt)
                        Ugh, another meeting?

           Jordan looks like he’s going to vomit.

                                 JORDAN
                        Worse.

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. QUANTEX CONFERENCE ROOM - MINUTES LATER

           The room is packed to the gills with dozens of people looking 
           like they’ve just been diagnosed with HPV.

           At the front of the room stands CEO RYAN WILLIAMS, a guy 
           about 30 pounds past handsome.  

           To the left of him is HR HENCHWOMAN DIANE, a stern lady with 
           the best power cut Fantastic Sam’s can provide, and to the 
           right is Mr. Harmon, the douchebag from earlier.

                                 RYAN WILLIAMS
                        I want you all to know we’re a 
                        family, and that we did our 
                        absolute best to stop this from 
                        happening.  Unfortunately, we 
                        couldn’t raise the capital we 
                        needed to avert the next steps.

                                 LINDA
                             (already into another 
                              candy bar)
                        So it’s true?!  It’s really 
                        happening?!

                                 RYAN WILLIAMS
                        Chapter 11, yes.  I’m afraid so.

           A GROAN ripples throughout the room.  
           Everyone is down in the dumps.  Except Brewer who is busy 
           scrolling through Tinder on his phone.

           (If one looks closely enough, one will notice every picture 
           Brewer posts of himself has Jordan in it, too.)

           MAX, a stringbean from IT, raises his hand like that nerdy 
           kid in Middle School desperate to give the right answer 
           before anyone else has a chance to.

                                 MAX
                        What about severance packages?  
                        What can we expect to receive?  
                        Some of us have been here a long 
                        time!

           Jordan and the others eagerly nod their heads trying their 
           best to picture their “golden” parachutes.

           Ryan doesn’t know exactly what to say.  Before he can put 
           together a half-assed platitude, Diane judo chops her way 
           into the conversation --

                                 DIANE
                        Unfortunately, QuantEx will not be 
                        able to provide severance of any 
                        kind.  There just isn’t enough 
                        money to run what will remain of 
                        the company and provide for our 
                        valued, former employees.

           Someone in the back shouts out --

                                 SOMEONE IN THE BACK
                        Well this fuckin’ sucks!

           Yes, it really fuckin’ does.  

           And Jordan, slumping into his chair with the others, seems 
           the hardest hit.

                                 DIANE
                        You’ve each been given a 25 dollar 
                        gift certificate to Buffalo Wild 
                        Wings.  They’re on your desks.  
                        Please enjoy lunch on us today as a 
                        thank you for service.  
                             (beat)
                        Oh, and you have one hour to 
                        collect your personal effects and 
                        vacate the premises. 

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT./INT. BUFFALO WILD WINGS - LATER

           MUSIC CUE: “Torn” - by Natalie Imbruglia.

           Everyone’s favorite cliché break-up song plays on the sound 
           system.

           Jordan, Brewer, Linda, Max, and everyone else who has just 
           had their nuts cut off, bury their sorrows in lobster 
           enchiladas and strawberry margaritas.

                                 JORDAN
                        Is this even legal?

                                 MAX
                        How can they not give us any 
                        warning?

           BARRY, a single dad in his 40’s, is already slurring his 
           words.

                                 BARRY
                        Corporate pig fuckers, man.  I 
                        turned down a job at QualCom three 
                        months ago because they told me I’d 
                        get promoted if I stayed.

           Linda just cries.

                                 BREWER
                        Look on the bright side, people, at 
                        least we got our vacation pay.  
                        That’s pretty cool, right?

                                 BARRY
                        Big deal, that just means all that 
                        money goes to my bitch ex-wife.

                                 BREWER
                        Honestly, Barry, after all Same-Sex 
                        Americans have gone through 
                        recently, you’d think you’d have a 
                        little more respect for the 
                        sanctity of marriage.

                                 BARRY
                        Fuck you, I’m taking a leak.

           Barry gets up to take a piss and nearly falls down.  Everyone 
           else just goes back to moping around.

           Brewer looks bored.  He partially unwraps a straw and blows 
           the paper across the table into Jordan’s face.
           Jordan looks up on impact.

                                 BREWER
                        So how much was your cut?

                                 JORDAN
                        Of what?

                                 BREWER
                        “Of what?”, he says.  Of your vacay
                        pay.  I got a cool four grand.
                             (beat)
                        Maybe I’ll buy an X-Box.

                                 JORDAN
                        You got four grand?  I only got 
                        three.  I work way harder, too.

                                 BREWER
                        Easy, lemon squeezy.  We all know 
                        that.  I’m just longer in the 
                        tooth, what did you expect?

                                 JORDAN
                             (poking his food)
                        You’re really gonna blow your money 
                        on video games?

           Brewer pounds his drink and then flags down KELLY THE 
           WAITRESS to get him another one.  She smiles at him and goes 
           behind the bar.

                                 BREWER
                        Thanks, Kelly!

                                 KELLY THE WAITRESS
                        You’re welcome, Kelly!

                                 JORDAN
                        Why do you always pretend you have 
                        the same name as the server?

                                 BREWER
                        It’s called personality mirroring.  
                        They give you a heavier pour that 
                        way.

                                 JORDAN
                        Right...

                                 BREWER
                        Anyway, back to your previous 
                        question.

                        No, I was kidding, I’m not blowing 
                        my vacay pay on video games.

                                 JORDAN
                        So what are you gonna blow it on?

                                 BREWER
                        What else?

           Kelly shows up with Brewer’s drink.  He winks at her and 
           pounds it in one extended gulp.

                                 BREWER (CONT’D)
                        I’m gonna blow it on vacay!

           A bolt of lightning strikes Brewer’s (meager) brain.

                                 BREWER (CONT’D)
                        Hey, why don’t you come with me?!

                                 JORDAN
                        On vacation?  Dude, we just got 
                        laid off.  It’s not time for us to 
                        just pick up and leave.

                                 BREWER
                        Stop being so responsible.  You 
                        sound like my asshole dad.  We’ve 
                        got nothing going on.  It’s the 
                        perfect time.  

                                 JORDAN
                        I’m gonna be polite and say I don’t 
                        quite see your logic here.

                                 BREWER
                        Jordy, we’re still reasonably young 
                        men.  This is the point in our 
                        lives when we’re supposed to be 
                        having crazy adventurous 
                        adventures.  Not slowly 
                        formaldehyding away in an office. 

                                 JORDAN
                        No way, I need to save what I have.

                                 BREWER
                        Humor me, at least.  Pretend you 
                        aren’t a total panty hamster for 
                        two seconds.  Where’s the one place 
                        you’ve always wanted to go?

           Jordan looks like he’s about to answer...  But then he thinks 
           better of it and takes a sip of his drink.
                                 BREWER (CONT’D)
                        Come on, just answer the question.

                                 JORDAN
                             (barely above a whisper)
                        Ibiza...

                                 BREWER
                        Where?

                                 JORDAN
                        I said Ibiza!  I was supposed to go 
                        for Spring Break in college, but I 
                        got Adult Chicken Pox and couldn’t 
                        go.

                                 BREWER
                        I had no idea that was a thing.  So 
                        where is that, somewhere in Russia?

                                 JORDAN
                        It’s in Spain.  Seriously, how did 
                        you graduate?

                                 BREWER
                        None of your business, I started 
                        from the bottom now I’m here.

           Brewer busts out his phone and brings up a Wikipedia article 
           on “Ibeeza” because he can’t spell because he’s a fuckin’
           idiot.

                                 BREWER (CONT’D)
                        Nice, man, look at that beach.  
                        Okay, I’m down.

           Jordan looks up again, afraid of continuing this 
           conversation.

                                 JORDAN
                        Down for what?

                                 BREWER
                        For Ibiza.  I’m down.  Let’s go.  
                        We have seven grand between us to 
                        spend.  Let’s go get our peepees
                        wet in Spain!

                                 JORDAN
                        No way, Brewer.  That money is too 
                        important.  I can’t waste it on 
                        some insane trip with you.  
           Brewer looks like he’s actually hurt.  Like a guy who’s just 
           been told his girlfriend has left and taken the cat.

                                 BREWER
                        That hurts, man.  We’ve been buds 
                        for five years.

                                 JORDAN
                        And it’s been a roller coaster ride 
                        the whole time.

                                 BREWER
                        But you can’t stand roller 
                        coasters.

                                 JORDAN
                        Exactly.

                                 BREWER
                        Ouchies.  Big time.  Look, 
                        obviously we need to work on our 
                        relationship, as well.  Think of 
                        this as a bonding trip, too, then.  
                        Besides, do you really want to end 
                        up like these people?

           Brewer makes Jordan look down the table.  Max, Linda, Barry, 
           and the others are all sobbing into each other’s shirt 
           collars bemoaning the loss of their dead-end jobs.

           Seeing that pathetic, middle-aged cavalcade of desperation is 
           enough for something in Jordan’s head to click.

                                 JORDAN
                        Maybe you’re right.  I’ve never 
                        actually gone on vacation...

                                 BREWER
                        Right?

                                 JORDAN
                        And the job market does suck...

                                 BREWER
                        Totally, and you don’t have to 
                        worry because it’ll still suck when 
                        we get back.  We won’t miss a beat.

           It might be the margarita talking, but --

                                 JORDAN
                             (almost to himself)
                        Maybe we really should do it, you 
                        know?

                        I’ll be 30 before you know it.  
                        Could be something to tell the 
                        grandkids.

                                 BREWER
                        Now you’re talking!

                                 JORDAN
                        Fine.  Fuck it.  I’m in!

           Brewer lets out a YEEEHAWWWWW!

                                 BREWER
                        Kelly, another round for me and my 
                        bromigo here!

                                 KELLY THE WAITRESS
                        Be right there, Kelly!

           She comes over with two full drinks.  Jordan and Brewer clink 
           glasses.

                                 JORDAN
                        Besides what’s the worst that could 
                        happen in Ibiza?

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           EXT. BEACH FRONT RESTAURANT - IBIZA, SPAIN - AFTERNOON

           Beautiful Ibiza, Spain.  It kicks Cabo’s ass on its worst 
           day.  Sprawling beaches, bronzed bodies, the works. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BEACH FRONT RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS

           Inside, the place is almost as gorgeous as out.  Refined 
           DINERS of all ages lucky enough to be able to afford to eat 
           here share tapas and tequila.

           But the mood suddenly darkens when --

           Four rows of MERCENARY THUGS, standing two by two with 
           matching sunglasses and complementary douchebag haircuts, 
           march in through the front door carrying SUBMACHINE GUNS.

           The SERVERS freeze in their places.  

           One GUY is so scared he refills a CUSTOMER’s margarita until 
           it overflows and spills in her lap.  
           Neither says a fucking word about it.

           The Mercs part like the Red Sea until a man emerges from in 
           between the middle of them.

           Meet MARCUS WALLER, 40’s.

           German ex-pat.

           Drug kingpin.

           Ping-pong enthusiast.

           A dangerous looking man no matter what side of the Rhine 
           you’re from.

                                 WALLER
                             (to no one in particular)
                        What’s good here?

           When nobody dares answer, Waller points to the plate of an 
           OLDER GENTLEMAN sitting with a YOUNG WOMAN who could be his 
           grand daughter.

           If she weren’t fucking him.

                                 WALLER (CONT’D)
                        That looks good.  What’s that?

                                 OLDER GENTLEMAN
                             (terrified, stuttering)
                        Gambas al ajillo, señor...

                                 WALLER
                        Fantastic.  I love garlic shrimp.

           Waller snaps his fingers at the nearest SERVER who rushes 
           over to him like a frightened puppy.

                                 WALLER (CONT’D)
                        Show me and my friends to a nice 
                        table.

           The Server trips over himself to ready a spot.  Waller 
           leisurely trails after him.  

           Before being the only one to sit down, he sends a slight nod 
           to his Mercs who instantly move about the room and collect 
           every iPhone, Samsung, Android, and whatever-the-fuck in the 
           restaurant.

           Terrified diners give up their devices like they were holding 
           onto hot coals.
           Once the phones have been taken, the same Server drapes a 
           napkin onto Waller’s lap and lays a plate of, you guessed it, 
           garlic shrimp in front of him.

           Waller dives into the shrimp, taking one big juicy bite after 
           another and making sure the entire place can hear him chew.

           Normally when you can hear people eat, it’s fucking
           disgusting.

           In this case, it’s just fucking terrifying.

           Once Waller has finished, he blurts out a single name.  

           A statement, not a question.

                                 WALLER (CONT’D)
                        Sanchez...

           A GASP goes out from somewhere in the back.  Whoever SANCHEZ 
           is, he’s one unlucky fuck.

           The diners around this now-doomed soul scoot their chairs as 
           far away as possible trying not to be rude.  

           Too late.  

           Waller’s thugs grab the man, a paunchy bastard in his 30’s
           with a bad mustache, and drag him to Waller’s table.

           No one knows what’s going to happen.  They just know it’s 
           going to be muy malo.

                                 WALLER (CONT’D)
                        Do you know why I’m here?

           Sanchez tries to break the tension.  Nervously laughing and 
           answering in Spanish --

                                 SANCHEZ
                        [For the shrimp?]

           Waller lets out a loud laugh, guffawing from his belly.  He 
           laughs and laughs, until he dabs his mouth with his napkin.  

           Okay, so maybe he’s not so bad. 

           Wait, spoke too soon.

           In one fluid motion, Waller grabs a KNIFE from the side of 
           his plate and SEVERS SANCHEZ’S LEFT PINKIE FINGER!

           Blood spurts everywhere.  People scream.  Sanchez curls his 
           hand up and wails in agony.
                                 WALLER
                             (calmly)
                        No, don’t touch it.

           Sanchez freezes in place, about to grab a napkin to staunch 
           the bleeding.

                                 WALLER (CONT’D)
                        I want you to feel the bleeding.  
                        That’s what it feels like when 
                        money bleeds from my accounts.  And 
                        do you know why money has been 
                        bleeding from my accounts?

           Sanchez may know, but he refuses to answer.  He’s too busy 
           turning whiter than a sheet.

                                 WALLER (CONT’D)
                        Because certain runners don’t know 
                        their place.

           Uh-oh.

                                 WALLER (CONT’D)
                        And when certain runners don’t know 
                        their place.  There is only chaos.  
                             (beat)
                        I am here to correct that chaos.

                                 SANCHEZ
                        Jefe, please...

                                 WALLER
                        Admit you’ve been skimming from 
                        your pick-ups and I might let you 
                        live.

           There’s a pregnant pause.  

           Sanchez is dead either way, but maybe there’s mercy behind 
           those crazy Kraut eyes...

                                 SANCHEZ
                             (defeated)
                        It won’t happen again!

           SANCHEZ’S FOREHEAD EXPLODES OUTWARD IN A SHOWER OF BRAIN, 
           BLOOD, AND GORE.

           One of Waller’s Mercs stands behind him with a smoking gun.

                                 WALLER
                        That’s all I needed to hear...
           Waller rises and throws his napkin on top of the dead body 
           now laid out on the table.  He talks to the Merc holding the 
           murder weapon.

                                 WALLER (CONT’D)
                        See that these lovely people’s 
                        devices are returned to them.

           He then looks around for the MAITRE’D, finding him shaking 
           like a Spanish leaf behind his little podium.

                                 WALLER (CONT’D)
                        And everyone’s meals are on me.

           The Mercs spread out, return the phones, and drop cash on 
           each table.  

           Leaving Waller to briskly walk out the back door of the 
           restaurant without another word...

                                                               FADE TO:

           EXT./INT. - AMERICAN AIRLINES - ECONOMY CLASS - FLIGHT 601

           We rejoin our heroes a couple of days later on their 
           impending flight as they crease, crumple, and cram their bags 
           into whatever overhead compartments are left open.

           Brewer is dressed like he’s going to Hawaii (complete with 
           stupid sunglasses and straw hat) while Jordan looks like a 
           Mid-Western dad going on vacation with a tucked-in, short-
           sleeve shirt.

           They settle into their seats and wait for take off.

                                 BREWER
                        Aight, we’re all set.  Five days in 
                        beautiful España! 
                             (reading from a pamphlet)
                        Our room is booked at the luxurious 
                        Hotel Torre Del Mar and we’ll be 
                        there in a scant 15 hours and 47 
                        minutes.

                                 JORDAN
                        Too bad the flight is so long, but 
                        it’ll give me a chance to catch up 
                        on some reading.

           Jordan busts out a copy of THE FAULT IN OUR STARS and cracks 
           open the pages.
                                 BREWER
                             (stunned)
                        What. The. Fuck.

                                 JORDAN
                             (perplexed)
                        What? It’s a best seller.

                                 BREWER
                        So is the Quran and you don’t 
                        fucking see me reading that!  
                             (nervously glancing 
                              around)
                        Put that shit away before we get 
                        our asses kicked.

                                 JORDAN
                             (still holding the book)
                        I really think you’re making too 
                        much of a big deal out of this.  
                        It’s a universal love story.

           Brewer gives up and snatches the book out of Jordan’s hands.  

           He chucks it behind him over his head and we hear the 
           faintest “What the?” from a PASSENGER somewhere further back.

           Before Jordan can protest, Brewer then grabs the sleeve of a 
           passing STEWARDESS.

                                 BREWER
                        Buenos días, Señorita.  Can we each 
                        get a double Maker’s on the rocks?

                                 STEWARDESS
                        I’m sorry, sir, you’ll have to wait 
                        until we’re airborne before we can 
                        serve drinks.

           The Stewardess goes to continue up the aisle, but Brewer 
           refuses to let go of her sleeve.

                                 BREWER
                        I know, Miss, I get that.  It’s 
                        just... Well, my mother died and 
                        we’re heading to her funeral.

                                 STEWARDESS
                        In Spain?

                                 BREWER
                        That’s where my father met her.  He 
                        served there during the war and 
                        fell in love with her.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 BREWER (CONT'D)
                        We thought it would be the best 
                        place to bury her after all she 
                        went through.  
                             (choking up)
                        She loved the water there...  
                        Please, a drink would really help 
                        ease the pain...

           The Stewardess looks heartbroken while Jordan rolls his eyes.

                                 STEWARDESS
                        You poor thing.  
                             (conspiratorially)
                        Take mine.

           The Stewardess slips Brewer three mini-bottles of Vodka from 
           out of her pocket.

                                 BREWER
                             (still misty-eyed)
                        God Bless you, mi amor.

           The Stewardess heads up the aisle, wiping sympathetic tears 
           from her eyes.

                                 JORDAN
                        Your father served in the war?  
                        What war?  We haven’t been at war 
                        with Spain since 1898.  He’d be a 
                        hundred and forty years old.

           Brewer pounds two of the mini-bottles of Vodka one right 
           after another.

                                 BREWER
                        I know that.  I’m just afraid of 
                        flying.

                                 JORDAN
                        You could’ve just taken a Valium 
                        like I did.

                                 BREWER
                        Where’s the fun in that?

           BING-BONG.

                                 PILOT (O.S.)
                        Ladies and gentlemen, this is your 
                        Captain speaking.  Please prepare 
                        for immediate takeoff and thank you 
                        for choosing American Airlines.

           As the plane starts to taxi --
                                 BREWER
                        LET’S GET DRUNK, MOTHAH
                        TRUCKAHS!!!!

           MUSIC CUE: “Stay Fly” - by Three 6 Mafia

           BEGIN MONTAGE:

           With the plane now in mid-air, Brewer has Economy Class 
           jumpin’ like a weekend at Jason Derulo’s house.

           Everyone is having a fan-fucking-tastic time.  Except for  
           Jordan who’s zonked out with EAR PLUGS and a SLEEP MASK on, 
           but fuck him.

           --Brewer buys drinks for everyone around him.  People of all 
           ages pound shots and act a fool.

           --Brewer does BODY SHOTS off the sympathetic Stewardess from 
           earlier as some OLDER DUDES up front cheer him on.

           --Brewer winds up locked in the bathroom with a MILF twice 
           his age.  He sucks on her left ring finger until her WEDDING 
           BAND comes off and they pass it back and forth between their 
           mouths making out like teenagers before the Apocalypse.

           In short, this is the best goddamn flight anyone who’s never 
           been to First Class has ever flown on.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. IBIZA AIRPORT - EARLY EVENING 

           TITLE UP -- 15 hours and 47 minutes later.

           Flight 601 lands without a hitch carrying our heroes (one 
           groggy and one buzzed out of his mind) to the Promised Land.

           INT. IBIZA AIRPORT - ARRIVAL GATE - CONTINUOUS

           Jordan rubs his eyes still sleepy as shit from his Valium.  

           Brewer, however, is bouncing off the walls.  With their bags 
           slung over their shoulders, they move through the crowd 
           trying to find a car to their hotel.

                                 BREWER
                        We’re here.  We’re fucking here!  
                        Yay for Vacay Pay!  Say it with me, 
                        Jordy!
                                 JORDAN
                        Yay for Vacay Pay.  
                             (yawning)
                        Let’s get to the hotel.  I’d kill 
                        for a shower and some dinner.

           They make it outside.  Brewer flags down a taxi.  It stops in 
           front of them.

                                 BREWER
                        Shower, maybe.  Dinner?  Hell 
                        fucking no.  I don’t want anything 
                        getting in the way of us not 
                        remembering a damn thing about our 
                        first night in Spain.  THANK YOU, 
                        QUANTEX!  

                                 JORDAN
                             (sotto)
                        What have I done...

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. HOTEL TORRE DEL MAR - LATER - NIGHT

           Our boys are dropped off in front of one of Ibiza’s 
           finest/most affordable hotels.

           Jordan, a real architecture buff like the nerd that he is, 
           definitely seems impressed.

           He takes it all in --

           Until his eyes fall on a beautiful BLONDE WOMAN, built like 
           Charlize Theron on acid.

           In her early 30’s, she’s in front of the hotel and tipping a 
           BELLHOP who’s busy grabbing her bags from the back of a super 
           duper sleek sportscar.

           A Silver 2016 Maserati GranTurismo, to be precise.  The 
           fucking car is almost as hot as she is.

           Almost.

           Their eyes meet.  There’s a pause.  And a moment.

           And most incredible of all --

           That moment is mutual.

           Jordan freezes in place like Sam Neill trying not to be seen  
           by the T-Rex in JURASSIC PARK.
           When it’s over, the Blonde Woman heads inside to check in.

           Brewer gets out of the car, completely missing what just 
           happened.

                                 JORDAN
                        Okay, I won’t lie.  This place 
                        looks awesome.

                                 BREWER
                        Wait until you see the room!  We’re 
                        gonna leave behind so many 
                        illegitimate children!

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT./INT. WALLER’S HACIENDA - NIGHT

           We see a pair of HEAVY BOOTS roam the halls of Waller’s 
           hacienda.  Portraits of the man’s scary Germanic ancestors 
           line the walls going back to when Prussia was still a thing. 

           Unlike the last time we were here with Mr. Eyeballs, the 
           place is deathly silent.

           The boots keep moving until they come upon what can only be 
           the doors of the master bedroom.

           KNOCK, KNOCK.

                                 WALLER (O.S.)
                             (from inside)
                        Reinkommen [Come in]!

           The boots, or rather the person standing in them, opens the 
           door and we get our first full glimpse of --

                                 WALLER (CONT’D)
                        Kentavious!  Come right in.

           KENTAVIOUS is a Black dude in his late 30’s.  Think Craig 
           Robinson.  

           Looking more like a broken down cable installer, one would 
           never guess this man is Marcus Waller’s top enforcer and most 
           loyal friend.

           As he enters the room --

                                 KENTAVIOUS
                        What up, Wall.
           Waller, lounging in a fancy robe and matching slippers on a 
           giant bed the size of two California Kings, waves him in.

           These two have the casualness of old drinking buddies.

           It’s oddly unsettling.

                                 WALLER
                        Care to tag in?

           Waller offers Kentavious the PS4 controller he’s holding.  We 
           then notice he’s playing DESTINY on a massive projector 
           screen.

                                 WALLER (CONT’D)
                        This game is addicting.

           Kentavious checks out the screen behind him.

                                 KENTAVIOUS
                        Nah, maybe later.  We just got the 
                        call.

           Waller instantly turns off the projector.  He stands and 
           lights a stogie that would make a frat kid puke just trying 
           to smoke it.

                                 WALLER
                        Amnesia?

                                 KENTAVIOUS
                        1 am.  Just like he said.  There 
                        gon’ be a lot of people there, you 
                        sure it’s the best place to do 
                        this?

                                 WALLER
                        We certainly aren’t doing it here.  
                        But a packed nightclub, in the 
                        middle of Ibiza, on a Saturday 
                        night?  We won’t be bothered.  
                        Nevertheless, they picked the 
                        place.  And there’s no arguing with 
                        they. 

           Kentavious shrugs.  His boss is right.  Like always.

                                 WALLER (CONT’D)
                        Stop worrying, it doesn’t suit you.

           Waller lets out a few puffs from his cigar and walks over to 
           the mini-bar set-up in the far corner.
           Mini is just a metaphor.  You could stalk Tao for Memorial 
           Day Weekend with the amount of fine liquor bottles lined up 
           in front of him.

           Waller chooses a bottle of very expensive Monkey 47 
           Schwarzwald Dry Gin and pours himself, and Kentavious, a 
           drink with two limes each.

                                 WALLER (CONT’D)
                        This is what we’ve been waiting 
                        for, Kentavious.  All my years of 
                        chasing around runners and mules 
                        for spare change will finally be 
                        worth it.  

                                 KENTAVIOUS
                        Wouldn’t exactly call all this 
                        spare change, my dude.  Still time 
                        to think on this.  We gotta good 
                        thing here.  Why fuck wit dat?

                                 WALLER
                        You know why.  The Fatherland took 
                        everything from me.  Stripped my 
                        family of every last Deutsche Mark.

                                 KENTAVIOUS
                        What’d you expect with Nazi gold?

                                 WALLER
                        That was never proven, my friend.
                             (quickly)
                        Everything my vater and großvater
                        worked so hard for.  Taken by a 
                        corrupt and desperate government 
                        all those years ago.  Raised in 
                        rags, and forced to make the 
                        fortune rightfully mine off the 
                        backs of junkies across all of 
                        Europe.

           The hint of a murderous gleam crosses Waller’s eyes --

                                 WALLER (CONT’D)
                        And now with the German Chancellor 
                        set to visit Madrid this week--

                                 KENTAVIOUS
                        Ease back, Wall.  You goin’ down 
                        the rabbit hole onemogain.  I know 
                        all ‘bout this.
                                 WALLER
                        Then you also know there is no 
                        going back.  And that I pay you 
                        quite well.

                                 KENTAVIOUS
                        Cheers to muhfuckin’ dat.

                                 WALLER
                        Indeed.  Tonight, we make that very 
                        overdue leap into the large 
                        leagues.

                                 KENTAVIOUS
                        You mean the big leagues.

                                 WALLER
                        Whatever.

           They toast.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. HOTEL TORRE DEL MAR - JORDAN AND BREWER’S ROOM - LATER

           Jordan and Brewer’s room is understandably nowhere near as 
           lavish as Waller’s house, but this place still beats the shit
           out of any hotel you’ve ever stayed in.

           Brewer, wearing only a towel, pounds on the bathroom door.

                                 BREWER
                        Can you hurry the fuck up?  You’ve 
                        been in there for an hour!  Jerk 
                        off after you come home alone, not 
                        before!

           Jordan opens the door.  A cloud of steam wafts out of the 
           bathroom so thick it looks like Han Solo was just frozen in 
           carbonite.

           He emerges, fully dressed, looking snazzier than any of us 
           ever thought possible.  

           This dude just might get laid tonight.

                                 JORDAN
                        What’s the rush?  I want to look 
                        good.

           Brewer drops his towel, revealing absolutely everything to a 
           disgusted Jordan, and then pushes his way into the bathroom.
           Before closing the door, he turns around --

                                 BREWER
                        Dude, it’s already past 11.  I’d 
                        like to get there before the place 
                        empties out and we’re forced to hit 
                        on all the leftovers and 
                        throwbacks.

                                 JORDAN
                        Don’t be a dick.  Girls like that 
                        have feelings, too.  Besides, they 
                        don’t eat dinner here till 
                        midnight.

                                 BREWER
                        That better be a goddamn urban 
                        legend.

           Brewer closes the door, and turns on the shower.

           Alone, Jordan spritzes cologne onto both wrists and rubs them 
           together in that annoying way people do.  

           Looking wistful and thinking about the Blonde Woman from 
           earlier, Jordan pours himself some Skyy and lemonade from his 
           bag and starts drinking like the dickens to loosen up.

                                 JORDAN
                             (yelling to the bathroom)
                        What’s the name of the club we’re 
                        going to again?

           Brewer opens the door and walks out, somehow fully dressed 
           and ready to go in the span of 30 seconds.

                                 BREWER
                        Amnesia!  It’s gonna be tits!

                                 JORDAN
                        How did you...?

           Brewer grabs Jordan’s bottle of Skky right out of his hands, 
           and chugs half of it straight up.

                                 BREWER
                        I already called the Uber.  Let’s 
                        goooooooooooooooo!

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:
           EXT. AMNESIA NIGHTCLUB - 45 MINUTES LATER

           Welcome to Amnesia.  Winner of four consecutive Best Global 
           Club Titles in 1996, 1997, 1998 and 1999 at the IDMA Awards 
           in beautiful Miami, Florida!

           Brewer and Jordan are unceremoniously dumped in front of the 
           club by their angry UBER DRIVER.  

           After he peels out, they stand up, dust themselves off, and 
           immediately join the massive line outside.

                                 BREWER
                        Don’t blame me, I don’t speak 
                        Ibizan.

                                 JORDAN
                        Spanish.  You don’t speak Spanish.  
                        It’s the same language.

                                 BREWER
                        Either way, it’s not my fault the 
                        guy couldn’t take directions.

                                 JORDAN
                        He took directions just fine.  He 
                        just didn’t like the million high-
                        fives you insisted on giving him.

           The guys then seem to notice they won’t be getting inside 
           anytime soon.  

           The number of hot girls, and the dudes with the money to keep 
           them interested, standing outside with them is sheer 
           ridiculousness.

                                 BREWER
                        Fuck this.  I didn’t fly half-way 
                        across the world to stand in line 
                        like a sucker.

           Brewer jumps out of line and runs away.

           From back in-line --

                                 JORDAN
                        Brew, don’t.  Let’s just wait our 
                        turn!

                                 BREWER
                             (over his shoulder)
                        Live in the now and come on!!
           Jordan nervously darts his head around and then, against his 
           better judgement, takes off after Brewer until they stop 
           right in front of the angry BOUNCER guarding the front door.

                                 BREWER (CONT’D)
                        Greetings from America, muchacho.

           Jordan gets ready for the shit to get beat out of them, but 
           instead is shocked when the guy waves them through and into 
           the club.

                                 JORDAN
                             (stupefied)
                        How the hell did that happen?

                                 BREWER
                        Relax, I just gave him like 200 
                        bucks.

                                 JORDAN
                        Why would you do that?!  We need to 
                        spend smart, the room alone is 
                        costing us--

                                 BREWER
                        Seriously, dude, relax.  It’s worth 
                        it.  Bill Cosby could forget his 
                        bag of roofies and still manage to 
                        pull here!

                                 JORDAN
                        But, Brewer--

           Jordan’s whiny bitching is drowned out as the two make it 
           deeper inside the club and onto the main dance floor.

           Writhing, sweaty bodies are jam packed next to each other in 
           an orgy of alcohol, drugs, and free love.

           This place oozes sex.  Every man and woman in the audience 
           should be popping a boner right about now.

                                 BREWER
                        I’ll get us some drinks.  You start 
                        picking out our prey.

           Brewer walks off leaving Jordan looking terrified.  

           Excited and horny, but also terrified.

           Across the dance floor, Jordan suddenly locks eyes with the 
           Blonde Woman from the hotel dancing by herself.

           MUSIC CUE: “Your Love” - by Nicki Minaj
           Dressed all in white now, she moves like a Pussy Cat Doll.  
           When her eyes meet Jordan’s, she holds them there again.  

           There’s another spark between them.  It gives Jordan more 
           courage than any drink he could possibly slam.

           Dancing over to her, Jordan makes contact!

                                 JORDAN
                        You come here often?

           Yikes.  The audience should be cringing just as much as 
           Jordan is after hearing what he said.

           The Blonde Woman stops dancing long enough to laugh at him.  
           When she speaks, she reveals a strikingly posh English 
           accent.

                                 BLONDE WOMAN
                        That can’t be your opening line?

                                 JORDAN
                             (dancing like an idiot)
                        I’m not very good at this!  Let me 
                        go again.

                                 BLONDE WOMAN
                        Go for it.

                                 JORDAN
                        I remember you from earlier.  From 
                        the hotel, right?  What’s your 
                        name?

                                 BLONDE WOMAN
                        That’s better.  I’m Claudia.

                                 JORDAN
                        My name’s Jordan!

                                 CLAUDIA
                        Nice to meet you, Jordan.

           Wedding bells.  Angels singing.  The works.  

           Jordan is in love.

                                 JORDAN
                        That’s a really nice name!

                                 CLAUDIA
                        Which one?  Mine or yours?
           Jordan blushes and snort-laughs.  This woman has him on a 
           string already.

                                 CLAUDIA (CONT’D)
                        You know, you’re really handsome.

                                 JORDAN
                        Me??

                                 CLAUDIA
                        Yes, you.

           Proving it, Claudia grabs Jordan by the shoulders and pulls 
           him in.  They dance.  It’s sexy.  

           Vibrant. 

           And utterly foreign for Jordan, but he does his best to keep 
           up with her.

           Claudia looks to one of the upper levels.  We see her eyes 
           narrow and focus on something, or someone, but we don’t know 
           on what yet.

                                 BREWER (O.S.)
                        Holy fucking fuckballs, what a 
                        find!

           Here comes Brewer to ruin the moment.

                                 CLAUDIA
                        I’ve gotta go.  Nice to meet you, 
                        Jordan.

           She squeezes his shoulder and is out of there ASAP.  The mood 
           is totally ruined.  Brewer dances over carrying (and 
           spilling) their drinks.

                                 BREWER
                        I leave you alone for two seconds 
                        and you strike oil!  Did you hear 
                        her accent??  I bet it would make 
                        James Bond cream in his fucking
                        pants!  

                                 JORDAN
                        You just scared her off!

           Brewer shrugs and hands Jordan his giant drink.

                                 BREWER
                        Tevs.  She was prolly a lez anyway.

           Jordan sulks, watching Claudia head upstairs.
                                 JORDAN
                        I totally had her, man...  You 
                        couldn’t give me two minutes to get 
                        her number?  
                             (sotto)
                        Maybe I can find her back at the 
                        hotel...

                                 BREWER
                             (struggling to hear)
                        What??

                                 JORDAN
                        Nothing, let’s just drink.

                                 BREWER
                        Good idea!  We’ll get you someone 
                        else to smash, don’t worry.  Drink 
                        up, my good man!

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. AMNESIA NIGHTCLUB - UPPER LEVEL BAR - CONTINUOUS

           On one of the upper levels, with neon lights flashing 
           everywhere, Waller sits on a roped-off couch looking bored 
           and dressed like a villain from Star Trek.

           He’s joined by a coterie of eye candy, with Kentavious 
           hovering just a few feet away keeping his eyes out for 
           anything out of the ordinary and constantly checking his 
           Apple Watch.

           A DRUNK BIMBO tries to throw herself onto Waller’s lap, but 
           he uses her own momentum against her and moves her onto the 
           other side of the couch.

                                 WALLER
                        Not now, liebchen.

           The girl looks disappointed, but Waller’s focus is elsewhere.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. AMNESIA NIGHTCLUB - MEN’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Some DRUNK ASSHOLE bangs on a locked stall waiting for 
           whoever is inside to get the fuck out so he can pee.

           Inside, on the other side of the stall door, is a YOUNG MAN 
           looking like the creepy dude from MR. ROBOT.
           The Young Man - known only as IVANOV - finishes a massive 
           BUMP OF COKE, wipes his nose, and flushes the empty toilet.

           From the way his eyes dart around, this isn’t a guy who 
           should be doing more drugs.  

           He leaves the stall before shoulder checking the douchebag
           milkshake who was banging on the door and leaves the men’s 
           room.

           INT. AMNESIA NIGHTCLUB - UPPER LEVEL BAR - CONTINUOUS

           We follow Ivanov, growing increasingly paranoid, as he heads 
           over to where our Man from Amsterdam Adjacent is still 
           waiting revealing Ivanov --

           Is the person Waller has been waiting for.

           Without a word, as usual, Waller nods and everyone around him 
           scatters far enough away to give him and his new guest some 
           personal space.

           Ivanov twitches and takes a seat across from Waller.  A table 
           loaded with thousand dollar bottles of Svedka and orange 
           juice sits in between them.

                                 IVANOV
                        They send their regards.

                                 WALLER
                        I am sure they do.  Do you have 
                        what I’ve come for?

           Ivanov looks around and then answers by removing a compact, 
           MATTE BLACK DEVICE from out of his jacket pocket.  

           We won’t get a better look at it until Waller does.

                                 WALLER (CONT’D)
                        Hand it over.  Inspection time.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. AMNESIA NIGHTCLUB - LOWER LEVEL BAR - CONTINUOUS

           Jordan and Brewer are dancing and drinking, more with each 
           other than anyone else, sadly.  

           They look too afraid to approach any of the stunning women 
           all around them.
                                 JORDAN
                        Well, when are you gonna make a 
                        move?  I almost had something going 
                        there.  What’s your excuse?

                                 BREWER
                             (still dancing)
                        I’m just waiting for it to kick in.

                                 JORDAN
                        Waiting for what to kick in?

                                 BREWER
                        The Molly I put in our drinks, 
                        dingus!

                                 JORDAN
                        You put a Molly pill in my drink?!

                                 BREWER
                        Of course not.

           Jordan breathes a visible sigh of relief.

                                 BREWER (CONT’D)
                        I put two in your drink.  To get 
                        rid of that permanent stick up your 
                        ass.

           At that moment, the club’s prerequisite EDM music kicks into 
           a DROP BEAT and the whole place goes bananas.

           Jordan holds his hand up in front of his face finally aware 
           of the concentrated MDMA that’s currently coursing throughout 
           his veins.  He blinks in rapid succession.  

                                 JORDAN
                        What have you done to me, Brewer?!

                                 BREWER
                        I made sure you’d have a good 
                        night!  Just ride the wave.  Let’s 
                        go upstairs and post up!  There’s 
                        some major boobage up there.

           Brewer, still dancing, leads Jordan up the stairs like a 
           service dog until they reach the upper level...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. AMNESIA NIGHTCLUB - UPPER LEVEL BAR - CONTINUOUS

           Waller holds the DEVICE in front of his face.
           Using his super-high-tech CELL PHONE (Samsung and Apple can 
           eat a dick, this is the Real McCoy), Waller links it to the 
           item he’s about to buy.

           While Ivanov sweats it out waiting for Waller’s inspection to 
           end, we notice Brewer and Jordan, rolling pretty hard by now, 
           just over Waller’s shoulder.

           The more eagle-eyed of our viewers will notice Claudia 
           sitting by the bar watching everything while pretending not 
           to.

                                 IVANOV
                             (more twitchy)
                        Do we have a deal?

           Waller takes a moment to answer, but when he does he seems 
           satisfied --

                                 WALLER
                        Ja, we have a deal.
                             (holding out his phone)
                        Enter your account number and 
                        password and the agreed upon funds 
                        will be transferred to your 
                        superiors immediately.

           Ivanov shakily reaches out, and that’s when Waller seems to 
           notice JUST HOW MUCH the young man is sweating.

           Either Ivanov needed the coke to build up his courage, or 
           whatever he’s selling is going to take a lot of substances to 
           forget.

           The transfer goes through and the phone BEEPS, but --

           A now suspicious Waller casts a warning look to Kentavious 
           before he is suddenly interrupted.

           The phone, and the DEVICE still attached to it, are grabbed 
           up by a seriously out of it Jordan.

           You know those little moments when your life is about to 
           change forever?

           Yeah, this is one of those.

                                 JORDAN
                             (still fucking rolling)
                        Oh, man, is this the new 7Plus?  
                        You have no idea how badly I want 
                        one of these!  It feels so amazing 
                        in my hands.  Everything feels so 
                        tactile.
           Waller, for the first time, looks completely confused.  Who 
           the fuck is this guy?

           Jordan’s legs turn to jelly and he tumbles over the couch 
           until he’s sitting right next to Waller.  

           Only ass backwards and completely upside down.

                                 JORDAN (CONT’D)
                        But what’s the attachment for?

           Waller then whips out a custom SIG SAUER PISTOL.  The grip 
           features an ENGRAVED COBRA COILED AROUND THE HANDLE.  Scary 
           fuckin’ stuff.

                                 WALLER
                        You have two seconds to return my 
                        property before I make you a 
                        eunuch.

           Ivanov, now noticeably freaking out, pulls his own gun --

                                 IVANOV
                        What the fuck is going on?  
                             (to Waller)
                        Who is this?!

                                 WALLER
                        I was about to ask you the same.

           Waller grabs up both pieces of equipment leaving Kentavious 
           to come clear Jordan away (and presumably beat him to death 
           outside).

           Scared of Waller’s approaching bodyguard, Ivanov freaks out 
           and turns his gun on the German.  His coked-up-trigger finger 
           twitches too hard and bullets ring out missing Waller by mere 
           inches.

                                 WALLER (CONT’D)
                        No shooting!

           BOOM!

           THE LIGHTS GO WAY UP IN THE CLUB!  THE MUSIC CUTS OUT!  AND 
           EVERYONE STOPS DANCING!

           DOUBLE BOOM!

           DOORS IN THE CLUB BURST OPEN AND ARMED SECURITY RUSHES IN 
           SCREAMING AND YELLING FOR EVERYONE TO FRIO!  
           No one does, of course.  The whole place ERUPTS INTO CHAOS, 
           Waller’s entourage scatters like rats on a sinking ship.  He 
           pockets both the phone and the DEVICE in his jacket pockets.

           At the bar, and clearly not expecting this, Claudia does her 
           best to hide the anger and disappointment on her face as she 
           calmly melts into the crowd.

           Kentavious and Waller make eye contact before Kentavious does 
           the same and slips away, letting Jordan collapse, and 
           pretending to be a drunk guy with blue balls whose night has 
           just been ruined.

                                 JORDAN
                             (still upside down)
                        Where’s everyone going?  The colors 
                        are amazing.  Everything looks like 
                        Infinity Stones.  I’m like Thanos
                        up in here.

           Poor Jordan flexes his imaginary Infinity Gauntlet like the 
           geek-at-heart that he is.

                                 JORDAN (CONT’D)
                             (mesmerized)
                        Whoa, I feel like my head is gonna
                        float away...

           Resigned to the inevitable, and knowing it’s better to live 
           to fight another day, Waller doesn’t resist when the Security 
           Guards jam guns into his and Ivanov’s faces.

           Ivanov, with eyes bigger than saucers, gets on his knees with 
           his hands behind his head looking up at Waller. 

                                 WALLER
                        I doubt they will be very pleased 
                        with what you’ve done.

           Brewer, tripping, but not as hard as Jordan, finally finds 
           his friend in the maelstrom.  Reaching down, Brewer tries to 
           drag him upright.

                                 BREWER
                        Jordy, we gotta bail!  Now!

           But it’s no use.

                                 JORDAN
                        I can see through time...

           Too late.  More security closes in and surrounds them.
           Police sirens blare outside as an array of guns are locked 
           and loaded and pointed right at --

           Waller, Ivanov, Brewer, and what remains of Jordan.

                                 LEAD SECURITY GUARD UP
                        ¡Manos arriba! [Hands up!]

           Waller raises his hands, palms next to the sides of his face, 
           and lets out a little, annoyed frown like someone’s just 
           burnt his coffee.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. POLICIA LOCAL DE IBIZA - LATE MORNING - THE NEXT DAY

           TITLE UP - 12 HOURS LATER

           Not everywhere in Ibiza is beautiful.  Beginning and ending 
           with the police station Jordan and Brewer find themselves in.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. POLICIA LOCAL DE IBIZA - HOLDING CELL - CONTINUOUS

           If you’ve ever been to jail, they’re all pretty much alike.  

           Jordan and Brewer are crammed into a holding cell with a 
           coupele of HOMELESS GUYS, some PARTY BOYS who partied too 
           hard last night, and a BIG DUDE in the corner who probably 
           lives here.

           Brewer, wiping fingerprint ink from his fingers and looking 
           pretty ragged, seems tired of waiting for Jordan, passed out 
           on the bench next to him, to wake up.

           Brewer kicks him and Jordan finally comes to, looking equally 
           ragged.  If not more so.

                                 JORDAN
                        Whuh?? Whe-- where am I?  What 
                        happened??

                                 BREWER
                        Chill, dude, we got arrested.

                                 JORDAN
                        For what?!  I don’t remember 
                        anything from last night!

           Brewer looks relieved Jordan doesn’t remember his role in the 
           previous night’s events.
                                 BREWER
                        Uh, yeah yeah, me either.  Maybe we 
                        were drugged!  Wrong place, wrong 
                        time, you know?

           Jordan, in spite of his pounding headache, looks like he’s 
           going to shit a brick.  If he hasn’t already, but it smells 
           pretty bad in here so it’s hard to tell.

                                 JORDAN
                        That’s bullshit.  I want to know 
                        what happened, Brewer!

           Suddenly, the single door to the cell opens and the GUARDS 
           outside it SHOVE a familiar face into the holding cell.

           Marcus Waller.

                                 BREWER
                        Maybe we can ask him?

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. IBIZA STREETS - SAME

           TITLE UP: SIX BLOCKS FROM LA POLICIA LOCAL DE IBIZA

           Cars zoom up and down the busy streets.

           Off to the side of the road, dressed like a construction 
           worker with matching orange helmet and vest, a FOREMAN gives 
           his WORK CREW instructions for the day.

           The men get to work and power on a MASSIVE PIECE OF MINING 
           EQUIPMENT looking like little more than a giant drill bit 
           with a seat strapped to it.

           As we push in --

           We notice the foreman is Kentavious, and the “workers” are 
           actually heavily armed foot soldiers in disguise.

           Kentavious checks his watch, and then yells out further 
           instructions.

           As the area is roped off with caution tape and orange cones, 
           with cars still blowing by the site and still paying it 
           absolutely no mind, the drill is pointed straight down --

           WHERE IT STARTS CHEWING INTO THE CONCRETE BELOW!

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. POLICIA LOCAL DE IBIZA - HOLDING CELL - SAME

           Back with Jordan and Brewer.  By the looks of it, it’s been a 
           while.  

                                 BREWER
                             (whisper-yelling)
                        You do it!

                                 JORDAN
                             (whisper-yelling)
                        You do it!  You’re the one who 
                        remembers him!

           Detente.

           The two play a discrete game of ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS to find 
           out who is finally going to ask the creepy looking German 
           dude now sitting right next to them about what happened last 
           night.

           Jordan pulls ROCK against Brewer’s PAPER, silently curses his 
           friend, and then turns around to face Waller who is sitting 
           with his hands in his lap and his eyes closed.

                                 JORDAN (CONT’D)
                             (weakly)
                        Um, excuse me...?

           No response.  Jordan asks a second time, this time gently 
           nudging Waller’s shoulder.

                                 JORDAN (CONT’D)
                        Did you happen to be at Amnesia 
                        last night..?

           The older man’s eyes snap open instantly and Jordan about 
           suffers a coronary.

           Waller turns his head --

                                 WALLER
                        You’re the young man with the phone 
                        fetish.

           Jordan has no idea what he’s talking about.

                                 WALLER (CONT’D)
                        You seemed pretty out of it last 
                        night.  Too much fun in Ibiza?

           Jordan looks back to Brewer, what the fuck?
                                 JORDAN
                        Yeah, something like that...  
                        Anyway, if I can ask, neither of us 
                        seems to remember what happened 
                        last night...  

           Waller turns instantly cold, all of his practiced charm 
           melting away.

                                 WALLER
                        I have some questions of my own.  
                        Like who sent you to disrupt my 
                        transaction?

           The walls begin to rattle.  Slightly at first, almost 
           imperceptible, but Waller remains absolutely unperturbed as 
           the rattling gets worse.

           Jordan is too scared to notice that strange new noise.

                                 JORDAN
                        I have no idea what you’re talking 
                        about!  You have to believe me!
                             (looking back to Brewer)
                        What should we do?!

           Suddenly, the ground -- no -- 

           THE ENTIRE CELL -- 

           BEGINS TO SHAKE LIKE A FUCKING 8.0 MAGNITUDE EARTHQUAKE!

                                 WALLER
                        I would duck.

           The German then wraps himself up into a tiny little ball as --

           THE CELL EXPLODES FROM THE BOTTOM UP!

           THE GIANT DRILL BIT FROM EARLIER TEARS THROUGH THE FLOOR LIKE 
           THE FUCKING TECHNODROME FROM NINJA TURTLES BURROWING UP OUT 
           OF THE GROUND!

           Kentavious, riding the machine like Slim Pickens riding the 
           bomb in DR. STRANGELOVE, pops up through the hole, hauling 
           himself into the cell and onto his feet.

           Before the dust and debris settles, Kentavious whips out 
           double pistols, and KILLS EVERYONE IN THE ROOM.

           Except for Waller --

           And except for Jordan and Brewer. 
           Mostly out of pity, shock, and awe, because they’re wrapped 
           around each other so tight they could write a new chapter in 
           the Kama Sutra.

           Once his astonishment wears off, Kentavious raises his 
           pistols to kill our guys too before Waller lowers his arms 
           with his hand.

                                 WALLER (CONT’D)
                        Don’t.  They owe me an explanation 
                        for last night.

           Kentavious nods as his squadron of CONSTRUCTION WORKER 
           MERCENARY SOLDIER DUDES come pouring up out of the hole 
           behind him.

           Outside, an army of COPS POUNDS ON THE DOOR trying 
           desperately to unlock the holding cell and figure out exactly 
           what the fuck is going on.

           Inside the cell, everything is calm and controlled.  

           One of the men throws Waller another custom SIG SAUER PISTOL.  
           With the Cobra grip.

           Waiting on Waller’s orders, the armed men disperse once they 
           hear --

                                 WALLER (CONT’D)
                        A-Group: Ivanov is in Interrogation 
                        Room 3.  The merchandise is in 
                        Property Lock-Up.  
                             (beat)
                        Get both.

           The members of A-GROUP nod their understanding.

                                 WALLER (CONT’D)
                        B-Group: Destroy every electronic 
                        file and surveillance record in 
                        this place.  

           B-GROUP nods in the same manner as their counterparts before 
           them.  Now that they’re all on the same page --

           The Mercs move in unison like Seal Team 6, strapping 
           EXPLOSIVES TO THE DOOR --

           AND BLOW IT THE FUCK OUT!!  

           MUSIC CUE: “X Gon’ Give It To Ya” - by DMX

           KA-FUCKING-BOOM!
           Jordan and Brewer cover their ears and scream for dear life.  

           Any cop standing in the immediate vicinity of the blast is 
           now little more than a puddle of paella.  

           The rest that survive don’t do so for long.

           Waller’s men pour out of the holding cell and we’re in full 
           on Arnold-shooting-up-the-police-station-mode from T1.

           Blood and guts everywhere.  With his Mercs serving as his 
           vanguard, Waller strides right out of the cell, but not 
           before turning around and addressing Jordan and Brewer.

                                 WALLER (CONT’D)
                        I’m inviting you two to come with 
                        me.  
                             (beat)
                        I do suggest you accept.

                                 BREWER
                             (to Jordan)
                        I think we might be getting 
                        kidnapped here.

           Our guys look at each other in abject terror and then back at 
           Waller --

                                 JORDAN
                        Who are we to refuse?

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. POLICIA LOCAL DE IBIZA

           TITLE UP -- 60 SECONDS LATER...

           With smoke pouring out of every window, and with the sounds 
           of WORLD WAR III still going off inside, the FRONT DOORS of 
           the police station are kicked the fucked down.

           Waller’s mercenaries run outside and down the front steps 
           creating a corridor to -- 

           A WAITING MERCEDES-BENZ GLK IDLING OUT FRONT.

           Every civilian on the street is caught completely off-guard.  

           The only thing any one knows to do is get the fuck out of the 
           way as fast as possible.
           Waller, wearing an intimidating BLACK BALACLAVA to hide his 
           face for the short trip from the station to his ride, heads 
           right up, and into, his waiting car.

           Once inside, he ditches the mask and pours himself a drink 
           from the built-in bar as soon as his ass hits the leather.

           The rest of the interior looks like a decked-out limo with 
           forward and rear facing seats.  A faceless DRIVER sits up 
           front ready to go at a moment’s notice.

           Outside the car, the police station looks like it’s about to 
           collapse in on itself.  Any cop lucky enough to be alive 
           shoots at the merc army from any cover they find.  

           It’s a reverse Alamo and it’s fucking gnarly.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MERCEDES-BENZ GLK - CONTINUOUS

           Next into the car are Jordan and Brewer (at gun point), 
           followed by Kentavious who uses a leash to drag along some 
           helpless bastard (probably Ivanov) wearing a Gitmo-style
           BLACK HOOD.

           When everyone is inside, Waller reaches out and slaps the 
           side of the door.  The GLK takes off down the city streets.  

           An army of fast-moving sport coupes, filled to bursting with 
           Waller’s Mercs, takes off after it.

           They leave any remaining police officers behind scrambling to 
           find any cop cars the Mercs haven’t torched yet.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. IBIZA STREETS - ROOFTOP

           High above the chaos, and from someone’s UNKNOWN POV, we 
           watch the high speed pursuit as it happens below through the 
           city streets.

           It’s a total clusterfuck and a miracle no one has crashed out 
           yet --

           SKRRRRRRBOOMMMMMM!!

           Scratch that, it’s a miracle no one else has crashed out yet 
           besides the lead Ibizan squad car that’s just eaten it.
           Having seen enough, the Unknown POV gets up from a crouching 
           position and races back across the roof...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MERCEDES-BENZ GLK - CONTINUOUS

           In direct contrast to the chaos outside on the streets, 
           inside the Mercedes sounds like a fucking tea party. 

           Mellow music plays while Waller continues to enjoy his drink.

           Jordan and Brewer sweat bullets waiting for the next pin to 
           drop.

           And it does --

                                 WALLER
                        Do you mind telling who put you up 
                        to it?

           When Jordan and Brewer, confused as hell, fail to answer, 
           Kentavious cocks his pistol and both boys jump like their 
           nuts have been hooked up to car batteries.

                                 JORDAN
                        Put us up to what?!

                                 WALLER
                        Am I supposed to believe you just 
                        flopped onto me at the precise 
                        moment this--

           Waller indicates Ivanov wearing the bag across from him --

                                 WALLER (CONT’D)
                        --person decided to panic?

                                 JORDAN
                        I swear, we’ve never seen that guy 
                        before in our entire lives!

                                 BREWER
                        Not to be a stickler, but he is
                        wearing a hood, Jordy.  How can you 
                        be sure?

                                 JORDAN
                        You’re not helping!

           Waller finishes his drink, sets his glass down, and then 
           leans forward pulling the hood off of Ivanov’s head.
           His mouth is gagged and his face is a mass of welts, bumps, 
           and bruises --

           But it’s about to get a whole lot worse...

           The car jukes and jinks.

                                 WALLER
                        Perhaps now?  Tell me why you 
                        helped him.  Before my associate 
                        here starts getting impatient.

                                 JORDAN
                        Sir, I can’t stress this enough, we 
                        aren’t working with him!  My idiot 
                        friend and I are just two losers 
                        from America.

                                 BREWER
                        Harsh much?

                                 JORDAN
                             (pushing on)
                        We came here on vacation, and we 
                        partied too hard.  Please, I don’t 
                        remember anything after we got to 
                        the club.  You have to believe me!

                                 WALLER
                        I don’t have to do anything.  

           Waller lets his statement hang there.  And then pulls out the 
           MATTE BLACK DEVICE we saw earlier.

                                 WALLER (CONT’D)
                        And this?  How much do you know 
                        about it?

                                 JORDAN
                        We don’t know anything about that 
                        either!

                                 BREWER
                        He’s telling the truth!

           Waller slaps the seat next to him with a loud CRACK.

                                 WALLER
                        Enough.  I am growing impatient.  
                        How much do you know about Madrid?

           Dead air.
                                 WALLER (CONT’D)
                        Kentavious, show our new friends 
                        here what happens to people who do 
                        not answer my questions.

           Kentavious raises his gun about to shoot when --

           BANG!

           Blood splatters everywhere.  

           Brewer and Jordan are covered head to toe in it.  They scream 
           and pat themselves down looking for the inevitable bullet 
           hole, but they freeze in place when they (and the viewers) 
           realize --

           PULL BACK TO --

           Ivanov’s head is slumped forward.

           And there’s a hole punched in it big enough for a golf ball 
           to squeeze through.

           JORDAN PUKE-SCREAMS --

                                 JORDAN
                        I wanna go back to jail!

           The car suddenly swerves again.  Oh right, we’re still being 
           chased!

           Kentavious sticks his head out of the window, and doesn’t 
           like what he sees --

                                 KENTAVIOUS
                        We gotta Ghetto Bird, 12 o’clock.

                                 WALLER
                             (to the guys)
                        Excuse me for a moment.

           Waller pulls Ivanov’s corpse off the seat and shoves it onto 
           the floor.  

           Jordan and Brewer stare at the body as it leaks out leaving 
           Waller to pull up the seat and drag out a giant box.

           We aren’t sure what language is written all over it -- 
           Russian, maybe? -- but it doesn’t matter because --

           BAZOOKA IS THE SAME IN ANY LANGUAGE!
           Waller raises the massive weapon over his shoulder, stands 
           straight up, and pokes his torso up out of the opening 
           sunroof.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. IBIZA STREETS - MERCEDES-BENZ GLK - CONTINUOUS

           AERIAL POV --

           The chase is still on.  The only difference is now the GLK 
           looks like a crazy, German JACK-IN-THE-BOX with Waller 
           sticking out of the roof.

           Ignoring the cars surrounding him, both foe and friendly, 
           Waller centers himself and takes aim --

           At Ibiza’s lone surviving police chopper.  It’s right in his 
           sights.  Waller fires off the bazooka.  It’s missile spirals 
           perfectly, like an underinflated Tom Brady football --

           AND CATCHES THE CHOPPER DEAD TO RIGHTS!

           The whole flaming fireball comes crashing down onto the 
           street below!  

           What remains of the cop cars are caught underneath it.

           With the slightest hint of a smile --

                                 WALLER
                        Wunderbar.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MERCEDES-BENZ GLK

           As Waller pulls himself back inside, the GLK speeds off to 
           safety down a long, abandoned side street.  

           The escorts then peel off one-by-one, their jobs done for 
           now.

           Inside, Brewer can’t help himself, shouting out --  

                                 BREWER
                        That. Was. Awesome!!

           Before he remembers he’s about to be next.

           Kentavious then hands Waller a new drink.  Raising his glass, 
           Waller seems complimented.
                                 WALLER
                        Proust to you.

           Waller downs the second drink, and then looks back to our 
           guys.  Realizing he’s still covered in a bit of Ivanov’s 
           blood, he dabs his forehead with a hanky and gets back to 
           addressing them.

                                 WALLER (CONT’D)
                             (mulling it over)
                        I will admit you certainly don’t 
                        strike me as the espionage types.
                        Maybe you really are just two 
                        American losers...

                                 JORDAN
                        Yes!  Yes!  I told you.  We suck!  
                        Please, just let us go and you’ll 
                        never hear from us again!

                                 WALLER
                        Come now.  Even men of limited 
                        intelligence such as yourselves 
                        can’t possibly expect a man like me 
                        to have gotten where I am by 
                        showing mercy?

           Jordan and Brewer hang their heads, fearing the worst.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. MERCEDES-BENZ GLK - IBIZA STREETS - SAME

           From outside the car --

                                 JORDAN (V.O.)
                        No, I guess not...

                                 WALLER (V.O.)
                        I am glad we’re in agreement then.  
                        At any rate, I have what I need and 
                        I’m free to do with it as I 
                        intended.  

           As we listen to Waller pay our guys their last rites, we 
           notice a familiar looking Silver 2016 Maserati GranTurismo
           now trailing the GLK.

           Behind the wheel is A LONE FIGURE wearing a SILVER SPEED SUIT 
           AND MATCHING HELMET...

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. MERCEDES-BENZ GLK

                                 WALLER
                        Normally, I would say “auf 
                        wiedersehen”, but since what “auf 
                        wiedersehen” actually means is 
                        “till I see you again”, and since I 
                        never wish to see you again, to you 
                        sirs, I say goodbye.

           Waller raises the gun.  And that’s when things get knocked 
           into 12th gear!

                                 BREWER
                        Fuck this!

                                 JORDAN
                        Brewer, wait, don’t!

           BREWER LAUNCHES HIMSELF UP FRONT AND PULLS THE GLK’S E-BRAKE!

           Calamity ensues.

           The Driver, caught unaware, panics and swerves clipping the 
           sidewalk.  The whole car flips up, forward, and onto its back 
           in a shower of sparks, screams, and all around nastiness --

           Until it skids to a stop.  The underbelly then BLOWS UP 
           leaving the GLK a blazing inferno about to go supernova with 
           everyone still inside!

           Jordan and Brewer, injured but still alive, crawl out of the 
           upside down wreckage on their hands and knees.  They cut 
           themselves on broken glass, but they don’t care.

           They don’t even have time to.

           GROUND POV LOOKING UP AT --

           The GranTurismo doing a 360 SPIN until it stops a hair in 
           front of the guys, with the passenger door open for them.

           Inside, the driver RIPS OFF THEIR HELMET revealing --

           Claudia.  The woman from the nightclub last night.

           Jordan is in awe.  He might not remember shit about last 
           night, but he definitely remembers HER --

                                 JORDAN
                        Claudia?

                                 CLAUDIA
                             (hands gripping the wheel)
                        Come with me if you want to live.

                                 BREWER
                             (grinning)
                        No way. She did not just say that!!

           She did.  And it’s all Jordan needs to hear.  He jumps up off 
           his belly and dives into the backseat.

           Brewer is about to do the same, but he looks back at the 
           about-to-explode-car. 

                                 BREWER (CONT’D)
                        One second!!

           INT. MERCEDES-BENZ GLK WRECKAGE 

           Brewer COMMANDO CRAWLS back inside.  The place is quickly 
           filling up with smoke.

           The Driver up front is dead, practically impaled on the car’s 
           gear shift, but Brewer keeps going.

           Waller and Kentavious, alive but unconscious and looking beat 
           to hell, stir.  Whatever Brewer is up to, it better be quick.
           Quietly pawing through all the crap on the floor, Brewer 
           keeps digging --

           Until --

           EUREKA! --

           He finds the MATTE BLACK DEVICE.  Except it’s clutched in 
           Waller’s very bloody fingers.

           Brewer opens them up one by one --

                                 BREWER
                        This little piggy went to market, 
                        this little piggy stayed home...

           Until he gets the device free --

                                 BREWER (CONT’D)
                        Yes!

           Stupid Brewer.  Way to wake a sleeping giant.  Waller comes 
           to and raises his Cobra-handled pistol right in front of 
           Brewer’s face.

                                 WALLER
                        You Americans.  Always so greedy.

           He pulls the trigger --

           CLICK!

           But nothing happens.  

           The gun is empty!

                                 BREWER
                             (laughing like a maniac)
                        Haha!!  Suck my Red, White, and 
                        Blue dick, fuckstick!  I’m taking 
                        this!

           Brewer sniffs the device like it’s a fucking victory cigar 
           and shimmies out backwards while a still-stuck Waller SCREAMS 
           so hard the car almost blows up right then and there!

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. MERCEDES-BENZ GLK WRECKAGE 

           Brewer finally emerges, and runs for the waiting GranTurismo.  
           Before he gets there, we hear the ominous sounds of Waller’s 
           Mercs in their coupes on the way.
           The minions have realized their master is in trouble and 
           within seconds close the gap between them and our heroes amid 
           A HAIL OF BULLETS AND ROCKET-PROPELLED GRENADES.

           Not even bothering to find the open door, Brewer JUMPS IN 
           THROUGH A LOWERED WINDOW --

           And screams --

                                 BREWER
                        GO GO GO!!!--

           At the top of his lungs!

           Claudia PEELS OUT leaving Waller’s personal army far, far 
           behind until we see, hear, and FEEL the GLK finally EXPLODE 
           WITH THE FIRE OF A THOUSAND SUNS in the background.

                                 JORDAN
                        What the hell were you doing back 
                        there?!

           Brewer flashes the DEVICE.

                                 BREWER
                        Looky what I got!

                                 JORDAN
                             (stunned)
                        You don’t even know what that is!

                                 BREWER
                        True, but whatever it is seems to 
                        be worth a whole-fucking-lot!

           Claudia, looking into the rearview mirror, sees what Brewer 
           is holding.

           Her eyes flash with both recognition and satisfaction.

                                 JORDAN
                        You are such an idiot.

                                 CLAUDIA
                        I wouldn’t go that far...

                        Just wait till you get to know him.

                        later.  For now --
           Claudia twists around in her seat -- AND SHOOTS JORDAN AND 
           BREWER WITH TRANQUILIZER DARTS FROM A SLEEK, SILVER GUN!

           They pass out immediately with their heads falling into each 
           other’s crotches.

           It’s nighttime by now.

           Jordan and Brewer, still knocked the fuck out, sit tied to 
           RICKETY CHAIRS in the middle of what can generously be called 
           a squatter’s wet dream.

           Which basically amounts to floorboards, running water, four 
           walls, and a roof.

                        Wake up.

           A BUCKET OF ICE COLD WATER follows her words.

           The guys snap awake screaming --

                                 BREWER
                        No more ice bucket challenges,

                        Where are we?!

           Claudia lights a cigarette, the only thing illuminating the 
           darkness.  She walks forward, turning on an OIL LAMP sitting 
           on the lone table in the room.

                                 CLAUDIA
                        We’re at my safehouse in Pamplona.

                        Pamplona.  That’s all the way near

                        I’m in the room, you know.

                                 JORDAN
                        How long have we been out??

                                 CLAUDIA
                        I’ll ask the questions here.

           Claudia sits back on the table and crosses her legs.

                                 CLAUDIA (CONT’D)
                        Who are you guys?  NSA?  CIA?

                                 JORDAN
                        What?  Neither!  We’re unemployed!

                                 BREWER
                        Who are you?!

           Claudia calmly gets up, walks over to Brewer, AND PUTS HER 
           CIGARETTE OUT ON HIS HAND!

                                 BREWER (CONT’D)
                        Agghhhh, I was just curious, you 
                        British bitch!!!

                                 JORDAN
                        I’m telling the truth!  I’m Jordan 
                        Jones, he’s Brewer Kemp.  We’ve 
                        just been laid off from a company 
                        called QuantEx in California.  We 
                        flew American Airlines here!  We’re 
                        staying at the same hotel as you.  
                        Look it up!

           Claudia raises her cigarette.  About to burn Brewer’s other 
           hand when Jordan screams out --

                                 JORDAN (CONT’D)
                        We’re just fucking civilians!

           Claudia comes over.  Looks Jordan in the eyes.  
           There’s that hint of the spark they shared earlier, but right 
           now Claudia is all-business.  And it’s pretty fucking scary.

                                 CLAUDIA
                        Give me a minute.

           Claudia goes back to the table, and opens up a LAPTOP that 
           looks like it could survive an A-Bomb buried inside a falling 
           meteor.

                                 CLAUDIA (CONT’D)
                        Date of births?

           The guys’s frantic words trip over each other as they try to 
           tell her what she wants.

           After a minute --

                                 CLAUDIA (CONT’D)
                        I can’t believe this.  I thought 
                        you were just a pretty face with a 
                        dumb friend.

           Jordan smiles, despite his present circumstances.  Brewer 
           STAMPS ON HIS FOOT.

                                 CLAUDIA (CONT’D)
                        Then I saw you at the club.  And 
                        then I find you riding shotgun with 
                        Marcus Waller.

                                 BREWER
                        Marcus who?

                                 CLAUDIA
                        Marcus Waller.  

           Blank faces.

                                 CLAUDIA (CONT’D)
                        The Wall of Berlin?

           Blanker faces.

                                 CLAUDIA (CONT’D)
                        I shouldn’t be telling you any of 
                        this.

           Brewer chafes his wrists behind his back, emphasizing the 
           fact that he and his best friend are presently tied up PULP 
           FICTION-style.
                                 BREWER
                        I would say whatever the fuck is 
                        going on pretty much involves us by 
                        now anyway.  Care to share?

                                 JORDAN
                        Uh, Brewer, pretty sure the less we 
                        know the better here.

                                 CLAUDIA
                        Normally, your friend would be 
                        absolutely right.  But I need to 
                        know what you know.

                                 BREWER
                        Quid pro quo, honey.

                                 JORDAN
                        What the fuck are you talking 
                        about?

                                 BREWER
                        I dunno, I saw it on Law & Order 
                        once.

                                 JORDAN
                             (to Claudia)
                        We’ve been arrested in a foreign 
                        country, imprisoned with a psycho-
                        killer, and have no money, 
                        passports, or ID’s to get back home 
                        even if we could legally do so.  
                             (bluffing)
                        You help us get tthe hell out of 
                        Spain, and we’ll tell you 
                        everything we know.

                                 CLAUDIA
                        Deal.

                                                               FADE TO:

           EXT. SELF-STORAGE LOT - NIGHT

           Alive, but beat to hell and twice as angry, Waller and 
           Kentavious go up and down a STORAGE UNIT YARD looking for a 
           particular garage.

                                 KENTAVIOUS
                        Yo, thanks for draggin’ my ass out 
                        back there.  ‘Nother minute and I 
                        woulda been Wesley Snipes-level 
                        Black.
           Waller continues to keep his eyes on the numbers they pass, 
           reading them as they go along.

                                 WALLER
                        You’ve done the same for me.

                                 KENTAVIOUS
                        True dat.  Remember Vienna?

                                 WALLER
                        I try not to.

           Waller comes to a stop, right outside of Garage 138.

                                 WALLER (CONT’D)
                        Here we are.  
                             (beat)
                        Open it up.

           Kentavious pats himself down.  Shit.

                                 KENTAVIOUS
                        No keys.

           BANG!

           Waller answers by blowing the lock off the roll-away door 
           with his now-reloaded pistol.

                                 WALLER
                        How about now?

           Kentavious shakes his head at his boss’ recklessness, but 
           does as he’s told.  He rolls up the door revealing --

           -An ARSENAL OF WEAPONS (automatic rifles, shotguns, and 
           explosives of all kinds). 

           -Survival supplies (rations and water).

           -Several changes of very expensive clothing.

           And most importantly --

           -A crimson 2016 Jaguar XF.

           Waller walks inside and immediately starts changing into 
           something a little-less charred and blood-drenched.

           Putting on a silk suit and matching tie, he says --

                                 WALLER (CONT’D)
                        Load up the car.  We need to get to 
                        the helicopter.
                                 KENTAVIOUS
                        Where in the fuck is we taking it 
                        to?

           Knotting his tie, Waller takes out his space-age phone 
           revealing a GPS tracking system the likes of which we’ve 
           never seen.

                                 WALLER
                        Pamplona.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. RUN-DOWN HOUSE - POOR NEIGHBORHOOD - PAMPLONA

           It’s now later in the night.  The guys have been untied.  
           They share a simple meal of carnitas and tortillas with 
           Claudia as she opens up about what’s going on.

                                 BREWER
                        So you’re a rogue agent?  That is 
                        so fucking cool.

                                 JORDAN
                        Shut up, Brew, will you?

                                 CLAUDIA
                        No, technically he’s right.  
                        INTERPOL suspended me when I 
                        couldn’t let the death of my 
                        partner go...

                                 JORDAN
                        And this Waller killed him?

                                 CLAUDIA
                        Absolutely.  But there was no 
                        proof.  Waller has a way of 
                        avoiding unnecessary exposure.  As 
                        far as my superiors were concerned, 
                        Tom was corrupt and took his own 
                        life rather than be found out.

                                 JORDAN
                        But you knew better?

                                 CLAUDIA
                        Of course I did.  He was framed for 
                        getting too close.

           Claudia chews thoughtfully, considering what she’s about to 
           say next.
                                 CLAUDIA (CONT’D)
                        Tom and I weren’t just partners.
                             (beat)
                        We were lovers. And that kind of 
                        thing is frowned upon where I work.

                                 BREWER
                        “No fraternizing with fellow 
                        employees.”  They said the same 
                        bullplop at our last gig.  Working 
                        for the man sucks.  Amiright?

           Jordan rolls his eyes.

                                 JORDAN
                        Not exactly the same thing there.
                             (turning to Claudia)
                        Please, go on.

                                 CLAUDIA
                        When I wouldn’t let the case go, my 
                        superiors tried to put me on 
                        another one.  I couldn’t say the 
                        reason I wanted to stay was to 
                        avenge Tom and nail Waller, so they 
                        thought I was being shortsighted, 
                        obsessive. 
                             (beat)
                        And unprofessional.

                                 JORDAN
                        Sounds like you really cared about 
                        the guy.

           Claudia wipes away a single tear.

                                 CLAUDIA
                        I did.  Once.  But it’s been about 
                        Waller for so long, all I can think 
                        about is bringing him to justice.  
                        Tom was onto something.  Something 
                        big, but my bosses wouldn’t 
                        prioritize taking down a simple 
                        drug lord.  Until this came along--

           Claudia takes out the MATTE BLACK DEVICE and sets it on the 
           table.

                                 BREWER
                        Hey, that’s mine!

           Brewer reaches for it, but Jordan slaps his hand away.
                                 BREWER (CONT’D)
                        I didn’t see either of you 
                        Backdraft your way into that 
                        flaming car for it.

                                 CLAUDIA
                        You have no idea what you’re 
                        dealing with here.

                                 BREWER
                        No shit.  This is the part where 
                        you tell us.

                                 CLAUDIA
                             (to Jordan)
                        Either you shut him up or I will.

                                 BREWER
                        I’m just saying, some info would go 
                        a long--

           THUD!

           Brewer’s heads bangs into the table falling face-first into 
           his food.

           Claudia holds her smoking tranquilizer gun again.

                                 CLAUDIA
                        He’ll be fine in a few hours.

           Trying to make light of the situation --

                                 JORDAN
                        A little alone time couldn’t hurt.

           Claudia flashes him a smile, and then quickly stifles it.  
           Jordan picks up the device and moves it from hand to hand, 
           trying to figure out what it is.

                                 JORDAN (CONT’D)
                        So what are we looking at here?  
                        Why is this thing so important?

           The question hangs heavy in the air until Claudia is ready to 
           answer.

                                 CLAUDIA
                        This is a micro-nuke.

                                 JORDAN
                        Come again?
                                 CLAUDIA
                        A miniaturized nuclear tactile 
                        device.  Think of it as a hand 
                        grenade with enough destructive 
                        force to make Nagasaki look like a 
                        wet sneeze.

           After the importance of her words hit him, Jordan 
           instinctively tosses her the device like a hot potato.

                                 CLAUDIA (CONT’D)
                        Relax, it can’t be detonated 
                        without the proper encryption key.  
                             (beat)
                        And the key is missing. All I know 
                        is that it’s somewhere in the 
                        country.

                                 JORDAN
                        Madrid...

                                 CLAUDIA
                        What?

                                 JORDAN
                        Waller mentioned something about 
                        Madrid back in the car.  I guess he 
                        figured since he was going to kill 
                        us anyway he didn’t have to keep 
                        his mouth shut.  And he seemed in a 
                        huge hurry to get there...

                                 CLAUDIA
                        Oh my God, Torvald Utne...

                                 JORDAN
                        The German Chancellor?

                                 CLAUDIA
                             (impressed)
                        You know your stuff.  He’s paying 
                        an official visit to President 
                        Ferrara.  In Madrid at the Palce of 
                        Moncloa.  In two days.

                                 JORDAN
                        So Waller wants to blow up the 
                        whole city?

                                 CLAUDIA
                        I wouldn’t put it past him.  His 
                        family was stripped of their money 
                        and exiled before the German 
                        Reunification.
                                 JORDAN
                        Lemme guess.  The guy has a few 
                        Nazi skeletons in his closet?

                                 CLAUDIA
                        Perhaps, but it was never proven.  
                        Either way, the man’s held a grudge 
                        against the German government for 
                        decades.  
                             (thinking)
                        And I bet the key he needs is in 
                        Madrid, too.  Along with whoever 
                        was going to sell it to him.

                                 JORDAN
                        Who would sell this psycho a 
                        nuclear bomb?

                                 CLAUDIA
                        That’s the part I’m trying to 
                        figure out.  The only thing I know 
                        for sure is that there’s a shadow 
                        organization out there.  It’s 
                        called The Genesis Group.

                                 JORDAN
                        A shadow organization?

                                 CLAUDIA
                        It’s exactly what you think it is.  
                        And for whatever reason, they
                        decided to get in bed with Waller 
                        because their interests must be 
                        aligning.  It’s the only reason 
                        such a meticulous organization 
                        would involve a combustible element 
                        like Waller.

           Meanwhile, Brewer blows drool bubbles into his salsa.  Jordan 
           turns his friend’s head sideways so he can breathe, but still 
           leaves him bobbing in his dinner.

                                 JORDAN
                        What next?

           Claudia picks up the micro-nuke and stashes it before 
           lowering the lamplight.

                                 CLAUDIA
                        I go to Madrid.  

                                 JORDAN
                        You’ve already got the bomb.  Why 
                        not just go back to your superiors?
                                 CLAUDIA
                        Because I have no idea who to 
                        trust. Genesis has its fingers in 
                        everything.  It’s even possible 
                        they were behind my reassignment.  
                        But as long as I have this--

           Claudia indicates the micro-nuke in her right hand --

                                 CLAUDIA (CONT’D)
                        Waller can’t do anything with it.  
                        And I’m not taking it back to 
                        Interpol without his German head to 
                        go along with it.

                                 JORDAN
                        Where does that leave Brewer and I?

           Both look at Brewer, still passed the fuck out on the table.

                                 CLAUDIA
                        Believe it or not, you two have 
                        been helpful so far.

           Despite the harrowing circumstances, Jordan swells with pride 
           being of use to this beautiful-but-deadly woman.

                                 CLAUDIA (CONT’D)
                        I’ll drop you off at an American 
                        Embassy along the way.  Anonymously 
                        of course.  But we should get some 
                        rest for now.  There’s blankets and 
                        a pillow on the couch.  

                                 BREWER
                             (asleep, hazy)
                        Yeah, baby, work that pinky...

                                 CLAUDIA
                        Just handle your friend before you 
                        go to sleep.

                                 JORDAN
                        Meh, he’s fine.

           They stand up.  Claudia heads for the single bedroom.  Before 
           she leaves, Jordan, mustering up all his courage, asks her --

                                 JORDAN (CONT’D)
                        Hey, one more thing.

           Claudia pauses.  Turning around, looking like an absolute 
           angel in the pale orange glow from the lamp.
                                 JORDAN (CONT’D)
                        What was with those looks you gave 
                        me earlier?  At the hotel and the 
                        club?  I felt...something.

           Claudia walks slowly over to him, like a predator stalking 
           its prey.

                                 CLAUDIA
                        You...reminded me of someone.

           With that, she blows out the lamp.  Leaving the safehouse in 
           total darkness...

                                                              FADE OUT:

           TITLE UP - SIX HOURS AND 34 MINUTES LATER

                                                               FADE IN:

           INT. RUN-DOWN HOUSE - POOR NEIGHBORHOOD - PAMPLONA - MORNING

           A little past dawn.  Claudia remains asleep in the bedroom 
           while Jordan still dozes on the couch.

           At the dinner table, Brewer is surprisingly the first man 
           awake.  He picks his head up and rubs it, still groggy from 
           the tranquilizer.

                                 BREWER
                        I really wish she would stop doing 
                        that.

           Noticing his face is covered in food and drool, Brewer gets 
           up to stretch and let out a morning fart.

           Scratching his ass, he heads for the lone bathroom when all 
           of a sudden --

           CRASH!

           Something CYLINDRICAL hits the floor and spins a few times 
           before stopping.

           Unsure of what he’s seeing, Brewer walks up to it like one of 
           the monkey people facing the monolith in 2001 --

                                 CLAUDIA (O.S.)
                        Cover your eyes and ears!!

           Too late --
           FLASHBANG!!

           The room goes bright white!  Jordan is up and awake, but like 
           Brewer he can’t see or hear shit.

           MUSIC CUE: “Burst!” - by Peaches

           EVERY WINDOW IN THE SAFE HOUSE EXPLODES INWARD, ALONG WITH 
           THE FUCKING FRONT DOOR!!

           WALLER’S MERCS flood into the safe house with guns, knives, 
           and fists a-blazing.

           Claudia already has her service pistol out.  From the doorway 
           to the bedroom, she picks off 1, 2, 3 Mercs in a row while 
           Jordan throws himself over the couch.

           Brewer, running high on adrenaline and a tranquilizer 
           hangover, decides the best course of action is to fist-fight 
           the MERC right in front of him.

           Bad idea.  

           He gets two good hits in before the guy stomps his foot with 
           his steel-toed boot.  The asshole almost seems happy about 
           it...at least until he’s blown the fuck off his feet by 
           Claudia’s expert shot to the dome.

           More Mercs run in!  

                                 BREWER
                        How many of these fucking guys are 
                        there?!

                                 CLAUDIA
                        Run!!

           Jordan and Brewer, struggling to see and hear, don’t 
           understand what she’s saying.

           But there’s plenty of context clues adding up to MOVE IT!!  

           Even when you’re deaf.

           Before they make it outside, Claudia throws a backpack over 
           her shoulder and then hurls a second one at Brewer.

           Still behind the couch, Jordan watches as a new wave of MERCS
           rush in.  

           Panicking, Jordan doesn’t have time to think.  Acting on 
           instincts he didn’t know he had, he grabs a modified SMG from 
           one of Claudia’s victims, stands up, and SCARFACES all over 
           these mother fuckers!!
           Claudia and Brewer duck while Jordan unleashes the whole 
           fucking clip.  Merc after Merc drops dead to the floor.

           There’s a momentary lull in the invasion.

           Claudia is shocked silent at Jordan’s capability.  

           Brewer is just fucking impressed --

                                 BREWER
                        Was that you?!

           With his hearing coming back, Jordan just shrugs.

                                 JORDAN
                        Fight or flight, I guess?

           OUTSIDE --

           RAPPEL LINES ARE DROPPED FROM SOMEWHERE ABOVE THEM --

           And that’s when all three become aware of a TERRIBLE NOISE 
           beating down on the safehouse.

           Wonder who that could be...

                                 CLAUDIA
                        MOVE!

           The three load up as fast as they can and head out the back 
           door into the neighborhood streets --

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. RUN-DOWN HOUSE - POOR NEIGHBORHOOD - CONTINUOUS

           Now out in the full light of day, they finally see just 
           what’s making that BOOMING sound above them --

           IT’S AN APACHE AH-64A!

           A FUCKING FOUR-BLADE, TWIN-TURBOSHAFT ATTACK HELICOPTER!

           Kentavious is at the helm with Waller hanging half-way out of 
           a cargo area vomiting Mercs like a runway model after dinner 
           at Boa.

                                 BREWER
                        How the fuck are we supposed to 
                        beat that?!

                                 CLAUDIA
                        We don’t!
           Claudia takes off running down the narrow street.  She lays 
           down covering fire behind her while Brewer and Jordan take 
           off after her.

           They run and run and run some more with bullets flying all 
           around them like angry mosquitoes.

           Turning a corner, the mayhem behind them gets farther and 
           father away.

           But there’s no time to rest.

           The second our heroes think they’re safe is the same second 
           they find themselves in a whole new heap of trouble.

           The bleating of the Apache is quickly replaced by the 
           pounding of what can only be described as a thunderstorm 
           drawing nearer and nearer to them.

                                 BREWER
                        What now?!

                                 CLAUDIA
                        Not today...

                                 JORDAN
                        What not today?  

           No answer.

                                 JORDAN (CONT’D)
                        What not today?!

                                 CLAUDIA
                             (backpedaling)
                        Listen, don’t let anyone ever tell 
                        you your trip to Spain was boring.

           Claudia begins running -- BACK THE WAY THEY CAME!

                                 JORDAN
                        We just came from there!

           Jordan takes off after her.

                                 BREWER
                        Wait, why the fuck are you running 
                        backwards?!

           Because BULLS that’s why!

           The street is suddenly overwhelmed by a village of HYSTERICAL 
           PEOPLE --
           And the SIX ANGRY BULLS chasing after them!

           It’s the RUNNING OF THE BULLS!  A proud (and violent) Spanish 
           tradition. 

           Everyone get the fuck out of the way!

                                 BREWER (CONT’D)
                        Fuck you, Spain!!!!!!!

           Brewer takes off after Jordan and Claudia, staying a mere few 
           inches in front of the LEAD BULL’s very sharp horns!

           With the entire city running behind him, Brewer runs back the 
           way they all came until --

           He finds Claudia and Jordan ducking behind any kind of cover 
           they can get to and pumping bullets at the remaining Mercs.

           It’s a goddamn cacophony of chaos, and it only gets worse 
           when Waller’s Apache joins the fucking fray in the sky above 
           them!

           In the streets below --

           People are gored!  People are shot!  And EXPLOSIONS go off 
           everywhere from hand grenades dropped by Waller from above 
           like he’s fucking fishing with dynamite --

           BOOM!

           BOOM!!

           BOOM!!!

                                 CLAUDIA
                             (still shooting)
                        We have to get out of here!

                                 JORDAN
                             (also still shooting)
                        Be my guest and lead the way!

           Knowing it’s a lost cause, and that retreat is their only 
           viable option, Claudia looks down a side street and sees an 
           old 1956 Packard Clipper 4-Door rusting away.  

           It’s ugly as fuck and in terrible condition, but it’s their 
           only option.

                                 CLAUDIA
                        Follow me!
           Claudia grabs a SMOKE GRENADE from her backpack and drops it 
           in front of her.

           If you thought the bulls were angry before, just wait till 
           you see how pissed they get running in smoke.

           Claudia uses the cover to take off after the car. Jordan is 
           right behind her.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. PACKARD CLIPPER - FRONT SEAT - CONTINUOUS

           Throwing herself into the front seat, Claudia gets to work 
           hot-wiring it.  She tears out wires and starts sparking them 
           together.

           Just like in the movies.

                                 JORDAN
                             (jumping in the passenger 
                              seat)
                        Wait, where’s Brewer?!

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. POOR NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS - SAME

           Brewer is in the eye of the hurricane.  Surrounded on all 
           sides by bulls, villagers, and mercenaries.

           Oh my.

                                 BREWER
                        This is not how I pictured my 
                        vacation!

                                 MERC #1
                        You there!  Don’t move!

           Brewer is now pinned against a wall.  He gets the message and 
           immediately crosses his hands behind his head.  

                                 BREWER
                        I won’t try anything!  Just please, 
                        don’t kill me!

           Merc #1 rallies his buddies - MERCS #2 and #3 - with a cool 
           hand signal right out of CALL OF DUTY.  They form up on the 
           lead Merc’s flanks.
                                 MERC #1
                        Hand over the package!

                                 BREWER
                        What package?!

           The Mercs raise their guns all at once, aimed right at 
           Brewer’s balls.

                                 BREWER (CONT’D)
                        Ohhhh, you mean the little black 
                        thing?

           They lower their guns a bit as they close in.

                                 BREWER (CONT’D)
                        I don’t have it!

           Whoops, the guns come right back up.

           Merc #1 radios in to someone we have to believe is Waller.  

           After a BURST OF CHATTER, Merc #1 nods.

           And it is.

                                 MERC #1
                        Boss says to frag your ass!

           Knowing he’s about to die, for real this time, Brewer just 
           shuts his eyes and screams out --

                                 BREWER
                        Not the face!!

           When from out of nowhere --

           ROARRRRRRRR!!!!

           THE MERCS ARE MOWED THE FUCK DOWN BY A RUNAWAY BULL AND THE 
           VILLAGERS CHASING IT!!

           Brewer opens his eyes, seeing the Mercs trampled like 
           yesterday’s road kill and the galloping bull’s ass 
           responsible for saving his life.

                                 BREWER (CONT’D)
                             (disbelieving)
                        Dios Mio...

           Brewer’s reverie is cut short when the busted down Packard
           HONKS ITS LA-CUCA-ROCHA HORN from down the same side street 
           from earlier.
           Brewer turns to see Claudia behind the wheel, and Jordan 
           standing up inside it frantically screaming for him to come 
           join them.

           Cutting through the mounting smoke, Brewer dodges both man 
           and beast running to the car as the Apache circles overhead.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. APACHE HELICOPTER - SAME

           Kentavious works the yoke, yelling over his shoulder to an 
           irate Waller who is fresh out of grenades and mercenaries.

                                 KENTAVIOUS
                        Yo, we got company on the radar!  
                        Two bogies en route, probably 
                        Spanish government!

           Waller, for the first time, briefly loses his cool.  He jumps 
           up and down screaming in German --

                                 WALLER
                        Scheisse, scheisse, scheisse!!

                                 KENTAVIOUS
                        Calm down and think!  We gotta be 
                        up outta here like now as fuck!  
                        Say the word!

           Down below, the smoke begins to billow away --

           CUT TO --

           ECU ON: WALLER’S EYES --

           His line of sight falls on the Packard.  He zeroes in on it 
           amid the bullshit clusterfuck below him.

           He watches as Claudia drives her and the guys the fuck out of 
           there in the beat-up, old car handling it like she’s behind 
           the wheel of a fucking Aston-Martin. 

           CUT TO --

           Kentavious’s radar screen.  Two very noticeable BLIPS are 
           only getting more noticeable, more blippier.

           Waller makes a reluctant decision.

                                 WALLER
                        Take off.  There’ll be another 
                        time.
                                 KENTAVIOUS
                        What about our guys on the ground?

           Waller turns to Kentavious in the cockpit, screaming so 
           loudly we can see the spit fly from his lips.

                                 WALLER
                        I said take off!!  Schnell!!

                                 KENTAVIOUS
                             (to himself)
                        This Drivin’ Herr Daisy shit is 
                        gettin’ pretty old.

           Kentavious turns to face forward, throwing the Apache into a 
           forward dive so hard it would suck your guts right out of 
           your goddamn butthole if you were unlucky enough to be on 
           board.  

           It takes them out of Pamplona so fast whoever was approaching 
           will never know they were there.

           You know, except for all the destroyed buildings and shit.

                                 KENTAVIOUS (CONT’D)
                        Where we going?

                                 WALLER
                        Madrid.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. PACKARD - SPANISH HIGHWAY - LATER

           When the dust has settled, literally and figuratively, we 
           join our heroes out on the open road --

           In the busted down shitbox Claudia was able to steal.

                                 CLAUDIA
                             (slapping the wheel)
                        How could I have been so stupid?  
                        Of course the bomb has a fucking
                        tracker in it.

           In the back seat, Jordan’s ears perk up like a dog being told 
           it’s time to go to the vet.

                                 BREWER
                        Bomb?  
                             (grabbing Jordan’s 
                              shoulder)
                        Did she just say bomb?
                                 CLAUDIA
                        What exactly do you think you stole 
                        from Waller?

                                 BREWER
                        I don’t know!  I thought it was a 
                        jewelry box or some shit.  I stole 
                        a bomb?!

                                 JORDAN
                        A MICRO-NUKE apparently.  Well 
                        done.

           Brewer plops backwards into his seat.

                                 BREWER
                        Fuck me.  
                             (beat)
                        So what do we do now?

                                 CLAUDIA
                        First thing’s first--

           With one hand on the wheel, Claudia fishes out the MICRO-
           NUKE.  She takes a mini-USB cord from out of another pocket 
           and connects the bomb to her phone.

                                 CLAUDIA (CONT’D)
                        We have to disable this thing’s 
                        GPS.

           Trying to work both her phone and the car at the same time 
           clearly isn’t working.  When they almost SWERVE INTO A SEMI-
           TRUCK --

                                 JORDAN
                        Why don’t you let me figure it out?  
                        I analyze software for a living.

           Claudia looks at Jordan.  Despite herself, she’s impressed 
           again with the way he’s stepping up.  Handing it over, Jordan 
           gets to work --

                                 JORDAN (CONT’D)
                             (eyes on the phone screen)
                        Here we go.

           Jordan clicks a few buttons and --

                                 JORDAN (CONT’D)
                        It’s off.
                                 BREWER
                             (maybe a little jealous)
                        Shit, and I can’t even turn off 
                        facebook notifications.

           Can anyone?

                                 BREWER (CONT’D)
                        At least now that psycho can’t find 
                        us.  I mean you saw the way he was 
                        dropping grenades back there.  Did 
                        he not give a single shitfuck that 
                        he could’ve blown us all up?

                                 CLAUDIA
                             (interrupting)
                        The bomb doesn’t work that way.  It 
                        can’t be set off in a blast.  
                        There’s a complex chemical reaction 
                        inside that can only be triggered 
                        by the activation key.  Which we’re 
                        going to go get.

                                 BREWER
                             (with a glazed look)
                        Say what now?  “We’re going to go 
                        get?”

                                 JORDAN
                             (matter-of-factly)
                        We’re heading to Madrid.

                                 BREWER
                        What the effing fuck for?!

                                 CLAUDIA
                        Because we don’t have a choice.  
                        Waller has to be heading there, 
                        too.  Our only hope is to get there 
                        before he does.

                                 BREWER
                        Uhh, did you not just see him go 
                        all Black Hawk Down back there?  
                        I’m pretty sure he can beat us 
                        anywhere in that thing.

                                 CLAUDIA
                        But he doesn’t know that I know 
                        about Madrid.  He’ll be wasting his 
                        time trying to chase us, not 
                        anticipating where we’re headed.
                                 BREWER
                        Okay, fine, great, but I’m pretty 
                        sure this is the part of the ride 
                        where we get off. 

                                 CLAUDIA
                        There’s no time for that.  
                             (looking only at Jordan)
                        Besides, you handled yourself 
                        pretty well back there.

           Jordan FLUSHES in spite of his every attempt not to.

                                 JORDAN
                        Well, you know, I just acted.  
                        Didn’t really have time to think...

           Brewer becomes aware of the chemistry slowly building between 
           these two and quickly grows sickened of it.

                                 BREWER
                        You’ve got to be kidding me.
                             (leaning forward)
                        Jordy, there’s plenty of other ways 
                        to get laid without risking both
                        our lives.

           Brewer might not be the smartest person in the car, but he’s 
           right.

                                 JORDAN
                        Hey, you’re the one who wanted to 
                        have “adventurous adventures” as I 
                        recall.

                                 BREWER
                        I meant like letting a local girl 
                        eat my ass out, not join Spain’s 
                        Most Wanted!

                                 CLAUDIA
                        No more arguing or you get the 
                        tranq gun again.

           Yeah, that shuts him up pretty good.

                                 CLAUDIA (CONT’D)
                        New plan.  We get to Madrid.  I get 
                        the key.  Then I get Waller.  After 
                        that, I’ll get you back home like I 
                        promised.  But only after my 
                        mission is accomplished, and not 
                        before.  There’s no time. Do we 
                        have a deal?
                                 JORDAN
                        Deal.

           Both turn to look at Brewer until he caves...

                                 BREWER
                        Deal...

                                 CLAUDIA
                        Good.  There’s only one man in 
                        Madrid capable of brokering the 
                        deal.

                                 JORDAN
                        Who is he?

                                 CLAUDIA
                        That’s on a need to know basis.  
                        For now, settle in.  It’s going to 
                        be a long drive.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. CARNICERÍA DEL BASTIAN - MADRID - AFTERNOON

           Now hours later, the Packard pulls up in front of BASTIAN’S 
           BUTCHER SHOP in the heart of Madrid’s meat-packing district.

           Claudia and Jordan get out.  

           When Brewer makes to follow them, Claudia kicks his door 
           shut, looks him right in the eyes, and tells him to --

                                 CLAUDIA
                        Stay and watch the car.

           By this point, Brewer knows better than to argue.  He does as 
           he’s told.

           Even if he does it sarcastically with a fake military salute.

                                 BREWER
                        Yes, ma’am.

           Satisfied, Claudia heads inside with Jordan acting as her 
           “muscle”.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. CARNICERÍA DEL BASTIAN - CONTINUOUS

           Inside, the place is a ghost town.  There’s meats of every 
           kind lining the walls and in refrigerated glass cases, but no 
           customers to be seen anywhere.

           Claudia and Jordan walk-in, triggering a doorbell that 
           doesn’t even phase the owner who is presently behind the 
           counter, sitting on a stool, and reading a copy of VEGETARIAN 
           TIMES MAGAZINE.

           This is none other than BASTIAN, butcher and black marketeer.  

           In his 50’s and with a thick mustache, he looks like the 
           Spanish version of Super Mario...

           Which is pretty much the same thing as the Italian version of 
           Super Mario, but that’s neither here nor there.

                                 CLAUDIA
                        Long time, no see, Bastian.

           If the doorbell didn’t get his attention, that voice
           certainly did.  

           Bastian looks up, and pales like he just saw a ghost.

                                 BASTIAN
                             (heavily-accented)
                        They said you were dead.  Killed in 
                        the Philippines.

                                 CLAUDIA
                        Lucky you, I don’t kill that easy.

           Bastian folds the magazine and stands up.

                                 BASTIAN
                        No, I don’t suppose you do.  Who’s 
                        your friend?

           Jordan opens his mouth to answer, but Claudia raises a hand 
           and makes him stay quiet.

                                 CLAUDIA
                        My new boyfriend.

           Jordan looks at her like, “really?!”, hiding the 
           hope/desperation in his eyes.

                                 CLAUDIA (CONT’D)
                        What does it matter?  I came for 
                        something.  Something very 
                        important.
                                 BASTIAN
                             (putting on his apron)
                        I recommend the lamb in that case.

           IN A FLASH -- 

           Claudia reaches out and grabs a handful of Bastian’s apron.  
           She pulls it, and by extension his face, down onto the 
           counter.

           Following it all up with her pistol pressed up hard against 
           his prone temple.

                                 CLAUDIA
                        Don’t play games with me, Bastian.  
                        We’ve come a long way.  You have 
                        five seconds to give me the 
                        activation key.

                                 BAST
                             (still on the counter)
                        I don’t know what you’re talking 
                        about!

           Claudia answers by throwing the MICRO-NUKE right in front of 
           his face.  Bastian’s eyes go wide like saucers.

                                 BASTIAN
                             (stuttering)
                        Oh, that.  Why didn’t you say so 
                        earlier?  Come in back...

           Claudia lets him up, and Bastian leads the way back into his 
           stock room.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CARNICERÍA DEL BASTIAN - STOCK ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Bastian immediately begins looking through the GIANT FREEZER 
           humming in the corner.  Lifting whole, FROZEN RACKS OF RIBS --

                                 BASTIAN
                        It’s here somewhere.

           Jordan pokes around the stock room.  By the look on his face, 
           it’s pretty hard to tell just what animal most of this stuff 
           came from --

           Except for the SEVERED PIG’S HEAD grinning back at him.
                                 CLAUDIA
                             (to Jordan)
                        Don’t touch anything.

                                 JORDAN
                             (turning green)
                        That won’t be a problem.

           Bastian keeps digging.

                                 BASTIAN
                        You have to understand, I can’t 
                        tell you who gave this to me.

                                 CLAUDIA
                        Genesis. I already know who gave 
                        it to you.  I also already know you 
                        were planning to fence it to Marcus 
                        Waller.

           Bastian freezes in place.  No use continuing the charade.  He 
           turns around, somehow more confident than before.

                                 BASTIAN
                        I didn’t realize you knew so much. 

           Claudia raises an eyebrow at him.

                                 CLAUDIA
                        You should know better than to 
                        underestimate me.

                                 BASTIAN
                        Indeed.  Come.  The key is at my 
                        home with my wife.  I will give it 
                        to you there.

                                 CLAUDIA
                        Fine, but we need to make this 
                        quick.  We’re on kind of a ticking 
                        clock.

                                 BASTIAN
                        Is that bomb humor?

                                 CLAUDIA
                        Nothing about this is funny, 
                        Bastian.  And I’m warning you: try 
                        and pull anything and my friend 
                        here will make sure you and your 
                        wife will never sell another steak 
                        to anyone.  Ever again.
           Bastian nods having heard every threat in the book already.  
           He goes to change out of his apron, leaving Claudia and 
           Jordan by themselves for a moment.

                                 JORDAN
                        You really think it’s safe to just 
                        go walking into this guy’s house 
                        alone?  I mean, he’s literally a 
                        butcher.

                                 CLAUDIA
                        I’m touched by your concern, but I 
                        can handle him.  Having said that, 
                        I need your help.

           Claudia stuffs the MICRO-NUKE into his hands along with a wad 
           of Spanish cash.

                                 CLAUDIA (CONT’D)
                        There’s a motel a few blocks north 
                        of here.  The Atlantico.  It’s 
                        cheap.  Take the car, get a room, 
                        keep this safe, and wait for me to 
                        come back.

                                 JORDAN
                        How will I know you’re okay?

                                 CLAUDIA
                        With this.

           Along with the cash and the MICRO-NUKE, Claudia whips out a 
           BURNER PHONE and hands it to Jordan.

           He takes the phone, but not before Claudia pounds her number 
           into it.

                                 CLAUDIA (CONT’D)
                        I’ll text you.

           Jordan looks at the phone like it’s the fucking Holy Grail.  

           It might not be under the best of circumstances, but he 
           finally got a hot girl’s number in Spain!

                                 JORDAN
                        I--I won’t let you down.

                                 CLAUDIA
                        Good.  Now get moving.

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. BASTIAN’S HOUSE - WELL-TO-DO NEIGHBOORHOOD - LATER

           Bastian drives with Claudia riding next to him.  They pull up 
           to his house in a spotless Range Rover.  The place is well-
           taken care of, but inconspicuous.

           They park and Claudia runs her hand along the car’s leather --

                                 CLAUDIA
                        Looks like the butcher business 
                        pays pretty well.  I wonder, what 
                        else are you up to, old friend?

                                 BASTIAN
                        Nothing that concerns you, Claudia.  
                        Or your friends at INTERPOL. Can 
                        we just get this over with?

                                 CLAUDIA
                        After you.

           They both get out of the car and walk up the narrow driveway 
           to the front door. 

           Just before Bastian puts his key in the lock --

                                 CLAUDIA (CONT’D)
                        One more thing.  What do you plan 
                        on telling Waller when he 
                        inevitably shows up?

           Bastian opens the door and steps inside before answering her 
           question.  When they’re both in the house--

                                 BASTIAN
                        I don’t know.  Why don’t we handle 
                        that part now?

           Bastian holds out a hand showing Claudia into the living room 
           where, on the couch sits --

           MARCUS WALLER!

           Cross-legged, and with his Cobra-handled pistol in his lap.

           Claudia reluctantly gulps.

                                 WALLER
                        I believe this is the part where I 
                        tell you you’ve made a terrible 
                        mistake, Fräulein.

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT./INT. MOTEL DE ATLANTICO - LATER

           Jordan and Brewer, following Claudia’s orders, are holed up 
           in a motel substantially less nice than the room they left 
           back in Ibiza.

           In the bathroom, Jordan grabs some ALKA-SELTZER.

                                 JORDAN
                        All this stress is gonna give me an 
                        ulcer.

           Jordan takes a tablet and paces the room.

                                 BREWER
                        This might take your mind off of 
                        things.  What the H do you think 
                        this is?

           Brewer examines a STRANGE STAIN on the sheets wrapped around 
           one of the room’s twin beds.  As disgusting as it may be, 
           Jordan welcomes the distraction and goes in for a closer 
           look.

                                 JORDAN
                        I have no idea.

                                 BREWER
                        Me either, but this stain is 
                        gnarly.  What’s the over/under on 
                        bodily fluids in it?  I’m gonna say 
                        three.

                                 JORDAN
                        Three, yeah, whatever.

                                 BREWER
                        And is it me or does this thing 
                        kinda look like Angelina Jolie?  I 
                        mean, it’s even got her mega lips 
                        and weird cat eyes.

           Jordan resumes his pacing, ignoring Brewer and his inane 
           observations.

                                 BREWER (CONT’D)
                        Seriously, take another look.

           That’s it.  Jordan snaps.

                                 JORDAN
                        Doesn’t it bother you that it’s 
                        been like three hours and we have 
                        no idea what happened to Claudia?!
                                 BREWER
                        Relax, dude.  She’s a secret agent.  
                        She’s fine.  Maybe her and her 
                        butcher buddy are catching up on 
                        old times, trading war stories, and 
                        shit over brandy.

                                 JORDAN
                        Yeah, I doubt that.  I’m genuinely 
                        worried.  
                             (beat)
                        I’m gonna text her.

           Jordan types out a little, “How is everything?” and hits 
           send.  Brewer is still obsessed with the stain by the time 
           the phone PINGS back with a response.

           Jordan eagerly checks the message, only to see a simple -- 
           “Answer me” in response.

           Confused, Jordan doesn’t have long to remain that way before 
           the burner phone starts RINGING.

                                 BREWER
                             (setting the stain aside)
                        Dude, put it on speaker!

           Jordan does as he’s told, and lets out a nervous-sounding --

                                 JORDAN
                        Hello?

                                 CLAUDIA (O.S.)
                        Jordan?

                                 JORDAN
                        Yes, Claudia, it’s me!  Where are 
                        you?

           Suddenly, Claudia’s voice is replaced with a different one.  

           Male.  And one heavily-accented in German.

                                 WALLER (O.S.)
                        Guten Tag, my little freund.

           Jordan and Brewer look at each other in terror, each 
           simultaneously mouthing the word FUCK! at the same time.

           Jordan panics and covers the receiver.

                                 JORDAN
                        What do I do??
                                 BREWER
                        You gotta talk to him, I don’t 
                        know!  Say something!

                                 JORDAN
                             (into the phone)
                        Yes, this is he.

                                 WALLER (O.S.)
                        I assumed so.  You know, I really 
                        should have just killed you two 
                        back in our cozy, little cell.  

                                 JORDAN
                        Yeah, well, uh, everyone makes 
                        mistakes?

                                 WALLER (O.S.)
                        Indeed they do.  Which is why I’m 
                        going to rectify mine by killing 
                        this woman I have here.  I’ve been 
                        enjoying the pleasure of her 
                        company, but I’m sure you know from 
                        experience, she can become a 
                        little...tedious.

           In the background --

                                 CLAUDIA (O.S.)
                        Jordan, don’t listen to him!--

           A rough PUNCHING SOUND can be heard and Claudia goes quiet.

                                 WALLER (O.S.)
                        I am calling to make you a deal.  
                        You and your friend are incredibly 
                        inconsequential, but the device 
                        you’re holding - my device - is the 
                        opposite.  The girl for the bomb.  
                        What do you say?  

                                 JORDAN
                        I say how do I know you won’t kill 
                        all of us once you have what you 
                        need?

                                 WALLER (O.S.)
                        The lion isn’t concerned with the 
                        flea.

                                 BREWER
                             (sotto, stifling a laugh)
                        Seriously?
                                 JORDAN
                        Meaning?

                                 WALLER (O.S.)
                        I don’t care if you live or die, 
                        but if getting what I want means 
                        you get to keep living for however 
                        long your natural lives last then 
                        so be it.  I ask again...  
                             (beat)
                        Do we have a deal?

           Jordan looks at Brewer.  Brewer looks at Jordan.  Brewer just 
           shrugs his shoulders, clearly out of his element.

           But to Jordan, this is the most important decision he’s ever 
           had to make in his life.  And he doesn’t make it lightly.

                                 JORDAN
                        We have a deal. The bomb for the 
                        girl.  Where are you?

                                 WALLER (O.S)
                        And they say Americans are stupid.  
                        Meet me at Paseo del Pintor
                        Rosales, the park, in an hour.  I 
                        shouldn’t have to remind you what 
                        will happen if you contact the 
                        authorities of any kind.  

           Nope, that part is pretty much clear.

                                 WALLER (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Come alone and bring the device.

           Click.  The phone goes dead.  Brewer wastes no time --

                                 BREWER
                        Okay, now call the cops!

                                 JORDAN
                        Didn’t you just hear what he said??

                                 BREWER
                        Every kidnapper fucking says that, 
                        dude!  What choice do we have?!  
                        There’s no way in hell I’m walking 
                        into a war zone like that.

           Jordan starts getting ready, putting on his shoes and calming 
           his nerves.
                                 JORDAN
                        Claudia risked her lives to save 
                        us.  We can’t abandon her now.

                                 BREWER
                        Speak for yourself, I’m still 
                        fucking woozy from all the 
                        tranquilizers she pumped into me.

                                 JORDAN
                        Maybe you wouldn’t be if you just 
                        learned to shut the fuck up once in 
                        a while and stop pissing the wrong 
                        people off.

                                 BREWER
                        And just what is that supposed to 
                        mean?

                                 JORDAN
                        You know what it’s supposed to 
                        mean.  And besides we wouldn’t be 
                        in this mess if you never came up 
                        with this stupid Ibiza trip in the 
                        first place.

                                 BREWER
                        Oh, pardon me for trying to make 
                        your humdrum life a little less 
                        depressing.

                                 JORDAN
                             (snapping)
                        I was perfectly fine with my 
                        humdrum life.  I had a good job, I 
                        had a future!

                                 BREWER
                        A good job??  Are you listening to 
                        yourself?  QuantEx threw us out 
                        like yesterday’s garbage.

                                 JORDAN
                        Yeah, because of people like you.  
                        Did it ever occur to you that the 
                        company would have been just fine 
                        if you and the others didn’t just 
                        coast and do the absolute bare 
                        minimum?  Don’t you ever wonder why 
                        I started two years after you and 
                        got two promotions while you kept 
                        the same entry level job for seven 
                        years straight?  You’re a loser,
                        Brewer.  
           Pissed, Brewer slowly gets right up in Jordan’s grill until 
           they’re staring each other down mano-a-mano.

                                 BREWER
                             (eyes narrowing)
                        What’d you say to me?

                                 JORDAN
                             (coldly)
                        I said: you’re a loser.

           That’s it.  The gloves are off!  Brewer takes a swing at 
           Jordan and clips him on the chin.  Jordan retaliates and 
           before long the guys are punching, kicking, and clawing each 
           other as they roll around in a ball on the floor.

                                 BREWER
                        Take that back!

                                 JORDAN
                        Never!  It’s the truth!

           The guys keep fighting until Brewer rolls face first into his 
           favorite stain from earlier.  Some of it gets in his mouth.  
           Both guys look disgusted.

           They pull apart to catch their breath.  Huffing and puffing --

                                 JORDAN (CONT’D)
                        I’m an idiot for agreeing to this 
                        stupid vacation from hell!  I never 
                        should have come!

                                 BREWER
                        It must be lonely up there on your 
                        fucking pedestal!  I’m sorry if I 
                        don’t measure my happiness by my 
                        lame ass job title.  And you’re 
                        lucky I even invited you!  I felt 
                        sorry for you.  You’re 27 years old 
                        and you’ve never lived a day in 
                        your life.

           Jordan stands up, stuffing the MICRO-NUKE in his pocket.  
           Ready to end this stupid argument, he goes to open the door --

                                 JORDAN
                        Yeah, well, thanks to you I 
                        probably won’t get to live another 
                        day anyway.  But I’m going to save 
                        Claudia.
                                 BREWER
                             (from the floor)
                        Are you even listening to yourself?  
                        How the fuck do you plan to do 
                        that?

                                 JORDAN
                        I have no idea, but I have to try.

           Jordan opens the door to leave.  

           For the first time, we see Brewer’s tough guy facade fade 
           away.  And what remains behind is the face of a very 
           frightened child.

                                 BREWER
                        Jordan...what about me?

                                 JORDAN
                        I don’t know and I don’t care.  
                        Someone’s life is on the line.  
                        I’ve gotta go.

           Jordan walks out into the hall, leaving Brewer behind in the 
           door way.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. PASEO DEL PINTOR ROSALES - LATER

           We’re at the meeting place.  Or damn close to it.  Actually, 
           the meeting place lies just beyond where Jordan stands.  In 
           between it and him, however, is the --

           TELEFERICO DE MADRID.  

           The Spanish capital’s beloved CABLE CAR SYSTEM where locals 
           and tourists alike can gain an aerial view of this beautiful 
           city.

           Steeling himself, Jordan buys a TICKET from a vending machine 
           and waits for a cable car to appear. 

           When one stops in front of him, Jordan opens the door and 
           puts one foot inside the tiny two-person space.  

           It’s literally now or never -- 

           But on the other end of the cable system waits Waller...and
           the life of the woman he can’t stop thinking about.  That 
           tears it --
           In Jordan goes. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. PASEO DEL PINTOR ROSALES - OTHER END OF THE CABLE SYSTEM

           Unfortunately for Jordan, Waller accounts for everything.  

           From down below in the Paseo del Pintor Rosales, the German 
           drug lord stands with Claudia who has a nasty bruise over one 
           eye.

           Waller is behind her.  The activation key in one hand, and 
           his Cobra-handled pistol in the other, jammed into the small 
           of Claudia’s back.

                                 WALLER
                        At some point I assume I’ll get 
                        tired of always being right.  But 
                        that point has yet to come.

           Standing in front of Waller --

                                 CLAUDIA
                        You really are crazy.  You’re 
                        willing to take out an entire city 
                        just for revenge?

                                 WALLER
                        I wouldn’t expect you to 
                        understand.  
                             (into his sleeve)
                        Send a car down.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT./INT. CABLE-CAR OPERATIONS CENTER - SAME

           On the other end of Waller’s SLEEVE RADIO is Kentavious.  The 
           real CABLE CAR OPERATOR lies crumpled at his feet.

                                 KENTAVIOUS
                             (pushing a button)
                        Comin’ in hot.  Let’s get this shit
                        and leave already.

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. PASEO DEL PINTOR ROSALES - SAME

                                 WALLER
                        Patience, my friend.

           Another CABLE CAR pulls up, ready to depart a few feet from 
           them.  Waller pushes Claudia forward, and the two get on 
           ready to meet an unsuspecting Jordan halfway across the 
           massive RAVINE that lies below the cable system.

           Ready?  Because shit is about to get tense.  The cars move 
           toward each other...

           This moment should be drawn the fuck out, suspense city.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. WALLER’S CABLE CAR

           When the cars are about to pass each other, Waller speaks 
           into his sleeve again with a simple command --

                                 WALLER
                        Full stop.

           And the cars halt their trip.  Side by side, and facing in 
           opposite directions, they SWING FROM THEIR GATHERED MOMENTUM.

           From the POV of WALLER’S CAR, we see Jordan in his looking 
           every which way trying to figure out why he isn’t moving.  

           When he turns to face Waller and Claudia in theirs, he 
           blanches for the briefest of moments before figuring out he’s 
           been set up.

           We see him take out the burner phone --

           And then Claudia’s starts ringing.  

           Watching Jordan from inside Waller’s Car, the drug lord 
           forces her to answer and hand him the phone.

                                 JORDAN 
                        I’ve got what you asked for.  Now 
                        how do we do this?

           Claudia overhears Jordan, and with a worried look on her 
           face, once again tries to stop him --

                                 CLAUDIA
                        Jordan, get the hell out of here!!  
                        Millions will die if you give him 
                        what he wants!
           Waller tightens his kung-fu grip on Claudia’s arm, twisting 
           it harder behind her back.

           Almost to the breaking point.

                                 WALLER
                        Be quiet, my dear.  Mantalk.  
                             (into the phone)
                        Throw over the device, and I’ll 
                        throw over the woman.

                                 JORDAN
                        I swear to God if you hurt her...

                                 WALLER
                        Yes?  What’s the end of that 
                        sentence?  I’m very curious.

           Jordan answers by pulling the MICRO-NUKE out of his pocket.  
           Waller shuts up immediately.  

           Trying to open the door to give it to him, Jordan can’t get 
           the lock open.

           Damn safety measures.

                                 JORDAN
                             (into the phone)
                        It won’t open.

           Looking up, Jordan gets an idea.  Namely, the EMERGENCY 
           ESCAPE DOOR located on the top of the car.

           Popping it, Jordan hauls himself up to, and through, the roof 
           until he’s standing up on top of the car, one hand wrapped 
           around the stanchion keeping it connected to the cable 
           system.

           Don’t look down.  Don’t look down.  Don’t look --

           Too late.  Jordan looks down --  

           And instantly wishes he never did.  After the pre-requisite 
           Hitchcockian zoom, Jordan musters all the balls he can and 
           says into the phone --

                                 JORDAN (CONT’D)
                        Better join me up here before I get 
                        second thoughts and drop this thing 
                        where you’ll never find it.

           Annoyed, Waller pops his own hatch and forces first Claudia 
           and then himself onto the roof of their own car.
           Hero and villain face off a thousand feet above the ground.  

           Jordan holds the bomb and Waller holds the girl.

                                 JORDAN (CONT’D)
                        One for the other, right?  I give 
                        you what you want and you take off?

                                 WALLER
                        You have my word.  I won’t kill 
                        either of you.

           Jordan meets Claudia’s eyes.  Everything behind hers SCREAMS 
           for Jordan not to do what he’s about to do.

           But he does it anyway.

           Jordan TOSSES THE DEVICE across the gap between the cars.  
           Waller catches it in one hand, looking at it like he’s Old 
           Kate Winslet in TITANIC and it’s the Heart of the fucking
           Ocean.

           As the cars still swing --

                                 JORDAN
                        You got what you want!  Now let her 
                        go!

                                 WALLER
                             (smirking)
                        Very poor choice of words.

           WALLER THROWS CLAUDIA OFF OF THE ROOF!

                                 JORDAN
                        Nooooo!

           Claudia SCREAMS on the way down.  It’s fucking horrible.

           Throwing himself onto his hands and knees, Jordan looks over 
           the edge desperately scanning for what remains of Claudia.

                                 JORDAN (CONT’D)
                        We had a deal you son of a bitch!!

                                 WALLER
                             (taunting)
                        We still do.  I said I wouldn’t 
                        kill you.  Gravity, on the other 
                        hand, is a harsh mistress.

           Waller raises his Cobra-handled pistol and SHOOTS ONE OF THE 
           CABLES HOLDING JORDAN’S CAR UP.  The tram slumps to one side, 
           dangerously off-kilter.
                                 WALLER (CONT’D)
                        Friendly advice.  Always pay extra 
                        for Mercury tipped bullets.

           After Waller signals with his hand, the cars start moving in 
           opposite directions.

           As they get farther apart, Waller lets out a FRUSTRATED YELL 
           when he, and the audience, --

           Become aware of someone, say a rogue INTERPOL agent, dangling 
           from the bottom of Jordan’s damaged tram car.

           It’s Claudia!  She’s fucking alive!  And holding on for dear 
           goddamn life!

                                 CLAUDIA
                             (from below the tram)
                        Uh, little help?

           Jordan, shocked by what he’s hearing, scrambles forward 
           finally seeing where Claudia is.

                                 JORDAN
                        Gimme a second!

                                 CLAUDIA
                             (dryly)
                        Sure, take all the time you need.  
                        I’ll just hang around.

           Waller aims his pistol, trying to take Claudia out.  But he 
           keeps missing the further the cars get away from each other.

           On the roof, and dodging bullets of his own, Jordan spies a 
           length of cord wrapped around the stanchion.  Tying off one 
           end, he grabs the other and throws it down to Claudia when --

           A SECOND CABLE SNAPS!

           Waller stops shooting, knowing they’re done for and there’s 
           no way for anyone to survive the fall that’s coming..

                                 JORDAN 
                        Quick!  Climb up!

           Moving faster than a ring-tailed lemur, Claudia shimmies up 
           the rope and throws herself onto the roof next to Jordan.

           Once she recovers her breath, Jordan helps her to her feet.

           And that’s when she fucking wallops him upside the head!
                                 CLAUDIA
                        How could you give that psycho the 
                        nuke?!  I told you to leave me 
                        behind, you stupid kid!

                                 JORDAN
                        That wasn’t an option!

                                 CLAUDIA
                             (still slapping him)
                        Why the hell not?!

                                 JORDAN
                        Because I--likeeee--you, okay?!

           Claudia stops slapping Jordan.

                                 CLAUDIA
                        You do?

                                 JORDAN
                        Yes, alright!  And it’s not just 
                        because you’re the sexiest woman 
                        I’ve ever seen.  It’s 
                        because...you’ve made me feel more 
                        alive in the past two days than I 
                        ever have in my entire life.

           Claudia seems taken aback.  

           Maybe she feels a little bit the same, but she’s a 
           professional agent.  Now is not the time and certainly not 
           the place to get into this.

                                 CLAUDIA
                        I guess on some level sacrificing 
                        an entire country for someone is
                        pretty romantic.

                                 JORDAN
                        See?

                                 CLAUDIA
                        But it’s also incredibly selfish.  
                        You’re basically an accessory to 
                        mass murder now.

                                 JORDAN
                        Not necessarily.  Waller is in for 
                        a little bit of a surprise...

                                                          FLASHBACK TO:
           INT. MOTEL DE ATLANTICO - HALLS

           Jordan leaves Brewer behind in the room, and pulls out the 
           BURNER PHONE.  Pairing it to the device via BLUETOOTH, we see 
           Jordan, tech-whiz that he is, hard at work fiddling with both 
           devices --

                                                       FLASHFORWARD TO:

           EXT. JORDAN’S CABLE CAR - ROOF

                                 CLAUDIA
                        You installed a firewall?

                                 JORDAN
                        You’re damn right I did.  The bomb 
                        is useless, even with the 
                        activation key.  
                             (beat)
                        For the next sixty minutes, at 
                        least.  Before its self-correcting 
                        software detects what I’ve planted 
                        and reboots itself.

           Overwhelmed, Claudia pulls Jordan in close and KISSES HIM 
           LIKE HE’S NEVER BEEN KISSED BEFORE.

           It’s so good, his knees fucking go weak.

           Probably not a good idea, considering he and Claudia are 
           still atop a shaky tram car.

                                 CLAUDIA
                        Let’s go get that bastard then.

           Jordan is in heaven.  Until a THIRD CABLE SNAPS under the 
           weight of the car and the tram goes swinging again, this time 
           with more momentum than it was ever built to handle.

           After all that, this may indeed be the end of the line 
           anyway...

                                 JORDAN
                        I guess there’s worse ways to go...

           Just then, FROM OFF IN THE DISTANCE, another TRAM CAR is 
           about to pass them.  Jordan and Claudia look to it for help, 
           until the top hatch pops open --

           AND BREWER STICKS HIS FUCKING HEAD OUT!
                                 BREWER
                        I totally saw that!  You better 
                        have used tongue, Jordy!

           As the cars close in on each other --

                                 JORDAN
                        Brewer!  What the hell are you 
                        doing here?

                                 BREWER
                        Saving your ungrateful ass, queef
                        cookie!

                                 CLAUDIA
                        And just how do you plan to do 
                        that?

                                 BREWER
                        Like so.

           Brewer starts rocking his tram back and forth, trying to get 
           it to swing as close to Jordan and Claudia’s car as possible 
           as they close in.  

           Timing it just right, the cars almost touch just as they pass 
           each other letting Claudia and Jordan JUMP FOR DEAR LIFE --

           And stick the landing like a couple of exhausted Gabby 
           Douglases!

           Reunited and it feels so good.

           At last second, the support wires snap and the cable car 
           PLUMMETS into the ravine in a devastating crash.  After a 
           moment --

                                 BREWER (CONT’D)
                        See?  Nothing to it.  Now let’s go 
                        nail that German asshole!

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. MONCLOA PALACE - UNIVERSITY CITY - MADRID

           The Spanish CAPITAL BUILDING, located in the heart of the 
           Ciudad Universitaria, is overflowing with POLITICIANS, 
           SECURITY GUARDS, CIVILIANS, and TOURISTS.

           Everyone present is abuzz with the news that GERMAN 
           CHANCELLOR TORVALD UTNE has landed and is about to meet with 
           SPANISH PRIME MINISTER LUIZ FERRARA before addressing the 
           nation.
           The day should go off without a hitch.  Little do they 
           know...

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. PASEO DEL PINTOR ROSALES - PARKING LOT - SAME

           Now back on solid ground, Jordan, Claudia, and Brewer race 
           back to the Packard.

                                 CLAUDIA
                        We have less than an hour to make 
                        it all the way to Moncloa Palace 
                        before Utne makes his speech.

                                 BREWER
                        Shouldn’t you be letting your 
                        INTERPOL buddies know there’s a 
                        terrorist on the way with a bomb 
                        right about now?

           Claudia looks at Brewer pointedly.

                                 CLAUDIA
                        You were asleep in your salsa when 
                        we covered this.  I don’t know who 
                        to trust.  And the last thing I 
                        want to do is set off a national 
                        panic about a rogue bomb in the 
                        city.  We handle this my way.

                                 JORDAN
                        Just playing peacekeeper here, but 
                        this is all talk we could be having 
                        on the way there.  We need all the 
                        time we can get.

           Jordan runs up to the rusted-out Packard and grabs the door 
           handle --

           Before noticing the sleek 2015 Maserati Quattroporte parked 
           nearby.  No doubt belonging to some rich fuck-knuckle tourist 
           with money to burn.

                                 JORDAN (CONT’D)
                        Unless...

           Walking up to it, Jordan channels the INNER BAD-ASS slowly 
           coming out of him and SMASHES THE DRIVER’S SIDE WINDOW with 
           his elbow.

           The glass SHATTERS, but the alarm starts BLARING making 
           Jordan realize --
                                 JORDAN (CONT’D)
                        Whoops, forgot I still don’t know 
                        how to hotwire a car yet...

                                 CLAUDIA
                             (flatly)
                        I’ll drive.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. MADRID STREETS/INT. 2014 MERCEDES-BENZ C-CLASS COUPEE

           Behind the wheel of an equally slick car, Kentavious drives a 
           very focused Waller to his meeting with destiny.

           Though he tries to keep his tone almost casual, the seeds of 
           doubt begin to form in Kentavious’s voice.

           We aren’t sure if Waller notices or not, but it’s clear he 
           doesn’t care.

                                 KENTAVIOUS
                        Ain’t there easier ways to blank 
                        out a diplomat?  I mean, I got a 
                        sniper rifle in the trunk.  One 
                        word, I’ll merc this Utne dude and 
                        we can jet off.

           Waller looks at Kentavious, almost disappointed.

                                 WALLER
                        Ja, but where’s the fun in that?  
                        Germany took everything from me.  
                        I’m going to take everything from 
                        them.

                                 KENTAVIOUS
                        You realize we in Spain right?

                                 WALLER
                        Nothing like a little nuclear 
                        fallout to start a nasty little 
                        war.  Genesis will make sure German 
                        covert agents in open rebellion 
                        against the CDU are assigned the 
                        blame.  
                             (beat)
                        Deutschland will not have a pot to 
                        urinate in or a window to throw it 
                        out of.  And they will know what 
                        it’s like to start from scratch.

           Kentavious turns his eyes from Waller to the road.
                                 KENTAVIOUS
                        Whatever you say, man.

           He steps on the gas.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MONCLOA PALACE - UNIVERSITY CITY - INNER OFFICE

           Torvald Utne arrives in the flesh, joined by his GERMAN 
           ENTOURAGE.  Everyone looks pretty dour, even for a friendly 
           visit like this one, but, hey, they’re Germans, remember?

           Greeted by Luiz Ferrara in person, this initial meeting takes 
           place behind closed doors.

                                 PRIME MINISTER FERRARA
                        Welcome to Madrid, Mr. Utne.  We 
                        haven’t had the pleasure of hosting 
                        the German Chancellor since Señora
                        Merkel last visited.

                                 CHANCELLOR UTNE
                        The pleasure is mine, Mister Prime 
                        Minister.  I expect this visit to 
                        go just as well.

                                 PRIME MINISTER FERRARA
                        The sentiment is mutual.  If you’d 
                        like some time to rehearse your 
                        speech, you are welcome to it.

                                 CHANCELLOR UTNE
                        Most appreciated.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MASERATI QUATTROPORTE - MADRID STREETS

           Claudia REDLINES the sports car harder than Danica Patrick!

           Which isn’t saying much in retrospect because she’s managed 
           to win about one race, but who’s counting?

           Brewer hangs on for dear life in the back seat while Jordan 
           does his best to side-seat drive.

                                 JORDAN
                        We’re almost there.  I can see the 
                        capital building from here!
                                 CLAUDIA
                             (calmly)
                        Hang on.

           SHE SLAMS ON THE GAS!

           Pulling onto the side of the road.

                                 CLAUDIA (CONT’D)
                        We run from here.

                                 JORDAN
                        But we’re about two miles away?

                                 CLAUDIA
                        You really think we can just valet 
                        in front of a national address?

                                 JORDAN
                        Good point.

           They ditch the car and, together, run the rest of the way.

           Claudia and Jordan manage to make it, but Brewer looks sweaty 
           as fuck trying to keep up and not die from a mutant asthma 
           attack.

           When they get to the front of the building, they bleed into 
           the massive crowd being let in through the main gates.

           Before they can be stopped at SECURITY, all three know they 
           have a big fucking problem.

           Just like back at Amnesia, they aren’t on the list.

                                 JORDAN (CONT’D)
                        What do we do?

           The line is getting shorter.

           Brewer looks around.

           And realizes this is his moment.

                                 BREWER
                        Jordy, you still got that alka-
                        seltzer from the motel?

           A confused Jordan does as he’s told and hands the half-empty 
           packet to Brewer.  Who dry swallows the tablet, and within 
           moments --

           HE’S FOAMING AT THE MOUTH!
                                 JORDAN
                             (catching on)
                        Oh, uh, oh my God, he’s having a 
                        seizure!!

           Brewer falls to the ground and flops around like a caught 
           bass.  Allowing Claudia and Jordan to blend into the crowd...

           And right through the fucking front gate.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. MONCLOA PALACE - UNIVERSITY CITY - MAIN DAIS

           Just in time, too.

           With the gathered crowd waiting in anticipation, everyone 
           breaks into applause when Chancellor Utne takes the stage.

           Walking to the MAIN PODIUM with Prime Minister Ferrara by his 
           side, the two seasoned politicians take in the moment and 
           politely wait for the adulation to die down.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MONCLOA PALACE - UNIVERSITY CITY - FIRST LEVEL - SAME

           Moments before the dignitaries reach the podium, Waller 
           strides right into the building, clipping a forged CLEARANCE 
           BADGE provided him by Genesis onto his jacket pocket. 

           No one gives him a second glance.  Genesis is that fucking
           good at what they do.

           Speaking into his sleeve, Waller talks to, who else? --

                                 WALLER
                        Keep the engine running.

           We hear a muffled --

                                 KENTAVIOUS (O.S.)
                        You got 10 minutes.

                                 WALLER
                             (sotto)
                        More than I need...

           Sneaking off into a SIDE ROOM, Waller brings up a VIDEO FEED 
           of the main stage on his phone and sets it on a table 
           watching it and waiting for the precise moment to activate 
           the bomb and begin the countdown.
           Utne and Ferrara reach the podium like before.

           After being introduced, Utne begins his speech --

                                 CHANCELLOR UTNE (V.O.)
                        The strength of the European Union, 
                        now more than ever, depends greatly 
                        on international cooperation--

           Ignoring the words, Waller unfocuses his eyes, slips the 
           activation key from one pocket and the MICRO-NUKE from the 
           other --

           And joins them together!

                                 WALLER
                        “To the last, I grapple with thee.  
                        From Hell's heart, I stab at 
                        thee...”

           WOMP WOMP.

           The MICRO-NUKE lets out a cute, little two-note rejection 
           beep.    

           Something’s wrong.

           So much so that a frowning Waller fails to notice the door 
           behind him open.  He’s too busy trying to engage the 
           countdown that won’t begin.

                                 JORDAN (O.S.)
                        Very poetic.  I love WRATH OF KHAN, 
                        too.

           Jordan and Claudia come in, guns pointed at him.  Waller 
           spins around, whipping out his SIG Sauer.

                                 WALLER
                        You?!  How?!

                                 CLAUDIA
                        We English survived the Blitzkrieg.  
                        What did you expect?

           Ignoring their taunts, Waller aims the gun and steals a 
           glance at the MICRO-NUKE’s display finally noticing the 
           FIREWALL Jordan has slipped onto it.

                                 WALLER
                             (frenzied)
                        WHAT HAVE YOU DONE TO MY WEAPON?!
                                 JORDAN
                        I locked you out of it.  
                             (cocking his gun)
                        Never fuck with a software engineer 
                        on vacation!

           Booyah!

           But in the next moment, we see the calculated mental 
           discipline Marcus Waller has cultivated for a lifetime 
           crumble into tiny, little pieces.

           No longer a measured man content with meting out his revenge, 
           what is left behind is pure animal hate.

                                 WALLER
                        Ich werde euch töten! [I’m going to 
                        kill you!]

           WALLER STARTS FIRING!!  JORDAN AND CLAUDIA THROW THEMSELVES 
           OUT OF HARM’S WAY BEHIND ANY PIECE OF FURNITURE THEY CAN 
           FIND!!!

           BUT IT’S GODDAMN TIGHT IN CLOSE QUARTERS!

           Still, Claudia, the fucking pro that she is, takes out 
           Waller’s knee-caps from behind an overturned desk.

           ONE, TWO!!

           And clips him in his gun arm to das boot!

           Waller goes down in a heap.  Jordan presses the advantage, 
           racing out from his cover and stepping on the hand holding 
           the Cobra-embossed pistol.

           Pinning it down.

           Together, with Claudia now standing over Waller, too, they 
           both aim their weapons at his face.

           With one of them prepared to fire immediately --

                                 CLAUDIA
                        This is for Tom...

           About to squeeze the trigger, Jordan stops her.

                                 JORDAN
                        You don’t want to do this.  You 
                        kill him now and you’re no better 
                        than he is.  And this asshole was 
                        just about to nuke an entire 
                        goddamn city.  Think about it.
           Claudia’s eyes fill with tears.  Her head fighting her heart.

                                 WALLER
                             (weakly, wheezing)
                        Listen to your friend.  I’m more 
                        valuable to you alive than dead...

                                 CLAUDIA
                             (relenting)
                        Give me everything you have on 
                        Genesis, and maybe you’ll spend the 
                        rest of your life in a secure 
                        supermax buried somewhere far away 
                        from everyone else.

           Waller considers his options.  

           Dying here and now.  Sans revenge.

           Or life in a concrete box.

           After a moment, he chooses the box.  Like the coward he is.

                                 WALLER
                        Agreed.

           Jordan scoops up the MICRO-NUKE, making damn sure the 
           firewall is still active.  It is.

                                 WALLER (CONT’D)
                        And I can start right now.  You 
                        should know this about Genesis--

           A HOLD-OUT PISTOL instantly shoots out from the cuff of 
           Waller’s uninjured arm!  He aims it squarely at Claudia’s 
           head --

                                 WALLER (CONT’D)
                        --they never give up!!

           BLAM!

           But it’s not Waller’s gun with a smoking barrel.

           It’s Jordan’s.

           And the bullet launched from it is now firmly planted right 
           between Waller’s fuckin’ eyeballs.

           His body collapses and goes slack.

           Dead as a fuckin’ doornail.

           And not a moment too soon.
                                 CLAUDIA
                        Jordan.
                             (beat)
                        You just saved my life.

                                 JORDAN
                        Just returning the favor...

           He looks down, realizing he’s just taken another life.  And 
           also realizing he had no choice.

                                 CLAUDIA
                        Unemployed, huh?

                                 JORDAN
                        That’s right.

                                 CLAUDIA
                        Not for long I bet...

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           EXT. MONCLOA PALACE - UNIVERSITY CITY - MAIN DAIS

           Jordan and Claudia limp out of the building just as 
           Chancellor Utne finishes his address without a hitch.  

           Not a single soul on the stage or in the crowd has any clue 
           just how close they all came to utter annihilation.

           On the edges of the audience, Jordan and Claudia find Brewer 
           under a medical tent being tended to by TWO PARAMEDICS who 
           refuse to believe he’s okay.

           The pair walks up to him.

                                 BREWER
                        Jordy!  Did we save the day?!

           The paramedics look at each other thinking Brewer’s starting 
           to hallucinate.

                                 JORDAN
                        Yeah, man, everything is gonna be 
                        just fine.

           He and Claudia share a knowing look.

                                 BREWER
                        Oh, fucking, phew.  Okay, now get 
                        me out of here.
           Brewer tries pulling an IV out of his arm.  Jordan looks at 
           Claudia, enjoying letting Brewer twist in the wind.

                                 BREWER (CONT’D)
                             (waiting)
                        Dude, for the love of Buddha, tell 
                        these people I’m not epileptic!  
                        You know I don’t have health 
                        insurance!!  Fucking QuantEx!

           Jordan takes a moment before answering.  Seeing the speech 
           continuing on as peacefully planned, Jordan looks to the lead 
           medic and says --

                                 JORDAN
                        Better keep him overnight for 
                        observation.

           He puts his arm around Claudia, and the two walk away leaving 
           Brewer behind to scream --

                                 BREWER
                        Nooooooooooo!

           -- off in the distance.

                                 CLAUDIA
                        How long do you think before he 
                        figures out Spain has Universal 
                        health care?

                                 JORDAN
                        A good while.

                                 CLAUDIA
                        I’ll have my people get him to the 
                        Embassy in a few hours.

                                 JORDAN
                        You’re coming clean to INTERPOL 
                        then?

                                 CLAUDIA
                        With the evidence we have?  I’ll 
                        get a promotion.  
                             (looking wistful)
                        And an apology...

           It’s a heavy moment.

                                 JORDAN
                        Hey, listen, I’m sorry about Tom.  
                        I’m sure he was a great guy.  But 
                        at least he can rest easy now.
           Claudia pauses to look Jordan in the eye.

                                 CLAUDIA
                        Yeah.  I think I can too, now.

           Her eyes then fall on Kentavious, waiting in a line of cars 
           in the C-Class coupee sporting diplomatic plates (also 
           courtesy of Genesis).

                                 CLAUDIA (CONT’D)
                        On second thought...

           Claudia pulls her gun, rushes up to the car, and sticks it 
           into the passenger window.

           Kentavious looks down the barrel --

                                 KENTAVIOUS
                        Ya’ll got him, huh?

                                 CLAUDIA
                        You’re goddamn right we did.

                                 KENTAVIOUS
                        Good.

           Claudia, and Jordan coming up behind her, are shocked by his 
           answer.  Raising his hands and almost relieved --

                                 KENTAVIOUS (CONT’D)
                        So whatchu wanna know about 
                        Genesis?

                                 CLAUDIA
                        Everything.

                                                        SMASH TO BLACK:

                                    THE END

           TITLE UP -- Just kidding.  

           Epilogue!

           EXT. INTERPOL HEADQUARTERS - LYON, FRANCE - DAY

           TITLE UP - 3 MONTHS LATER
           Brewer, looking happy and healthy after his brief stay in a 
           Spanish hospital, is in the middle of a group of 12 INTERPOL 
           RECRUITS going through a rigorous training course outside.

           Looks like someone has found themselves a new job! 

           ...but on closer inspection, we notice Brewer is wearing a 
           different colored jumpsuit from the other recruits...

           Beige, not blue.

                                 INTERPOL TRAINER (O.S.)
                             Back to work!

                                 BREWER
                             (startled)
                        Sorry, sir!

           He hops on the back of a nearby RIDING MOWER and cuts the 
           grass while further up the field --

           INTERPOL-AGENT-IN-TRAINING-JORDAN, holding an ASSAULT RIFLE, 
           and looking as confident as we’ve ever seen him -- 

           NAILS THE HEART OF A TARGET BOARD 30 yards away with his live-
           fire training coach by his side.

           It’s Claudia.

           And she couldn’t be more goddamned proud!

                                   THE (REAL) END
