                                                               FADE IN:

           EXT. APPALACHIAN WILDERNESS - ESTABLISHING - DAWN

           Trees blanket the rolling mountains. A lone CABIN dots the 
           autumn landscape.

           INT. CABIN - SAME

           CHARLIE NASY (42) and his son WILL (15) sleep in parallel 
           twin beds in the bare bones, one-room cabin. 

           As the sun peeks in a window, they simultaneously awaken. 

           Without a word, they roll onto the floor and do push ups in 
           perfect unison. Flawless form, machine-like. Their muscular 
           physiques ripple through their threadbare attire. 

           BIRDS, CRICKETS, and a ROOSTER provide the only noise.

           No electricity. The only decor is hundreds of BOOKS, lining 
           the walls from floor to ceiling on homemade shelves.

           EXT. CABIN - SAME

           Wilderness. Total isolation.

           A large SHED, an OUTHOUSE, a WATER TANK, and a CROP FIELD 
           flank the cabin. SOLAR PANELS cover the shed and outhouse - 
           not the cabin. In the rear, an apple orchard meets the woods.

           A DIESEL PICKUP TRUCK is parked in the long, unpaved driveway 
           that snakes away to an indiscernible starting point. 

           INT. CABIN - MOMENTS LATER

           Charlie and Will do pull ups from a rafter, again in unison -- 
           finish a set -- hang in a resting position, but not for long:

                                 CHARLIE
                        Fifteen more.

           They snap back into the exercise, eyes straight ahead.

           EXT. POND - DAWN

           Charlie and Will fish side by side in silence.
           Charlie feels a bite. Inexpressive, he reels it in. The newly-
           caught fish joins others in the bucket.

           Will’s line grows taut. His face lights up momentarily, then 
           he adeptly reels in his catch.

           EXT. CABIN - DAY 

           Charlie methodically chops wood. Will guts the fish on a 
           homemade table nearby. 

           EXT. APPLE ORCHARD - DAY

           A WOODPECKER hammers high in a tree. Charlie and Will pick 
           apples below. Will admires the magnificent bird - only for a 
           moment - then back to work. 

           EXT. CABIN - DAY

           A homemade punching bag - a potato sack filled with dirt - 
           hangs behind the cabin. Will watches as Charlie strikes it 
           with rapid, forceful punch combinations.

           Charlie steps back. Will approaches the bag -- mimics 
           Charlie’s exact pattern of punches -- looks to Charlie for 
           approval or encouragement: no reaction.

           Charlie replaces Will in front of the bag -- kicks the bag 
           with amazing force. 

           EXT. DRIVEWAY - DAY

           Will loads the firewood onto the truck bed, already near-full 
           with apples, corn, mushrooms, berries, and squash.

           Charlie fills a gas can with BIODIESEL fuel from an oil drum 
           near the shed -- pours it in the gas tank. 

                                 WILL
                        Father..? May I come to town with you?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Not this time, William. See to your 
                        studies then prepare dinner.

           Will eyes his feet. 

                                 WILL
                        Okay, Father.
           Charlie continues to pack the truck.

           EXT. TOWN MARKET - LATER THAT DAY

           TEN VENDORS line a quaint town square. CUSTOMERS peruse the 
           offerings -- tinker away on their SMARTPHONES. 

           Charlie - looking completely out of his element in 
           contemporary society - keeps to himself, reading a book 
           behind his display of produce, fish, and firewood. 

           The other Vendors chat amongst themselves.

           A customer, THERESA (40s), scans Charlie’s produce -- bags a 
           selection.

                                 THERESA
                        My husband and me, we just love 
                        your produce. It’s perfection. 
                        What’s your secret?

                                 CHARLIE
                        No secret.

                                 THERESA
                             (re: the fish)
                        What kind?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Trout.

                                 THERESA
                        Catch ‘em yourself?

                                 CHARLIE
                        This morning.

                                 THERESA
                        Delightful. I’ll take two.

           Charlie packages the fish.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Fifteen.

           She hands him the cash. 

                                 THERESA
                        Is it possible to buy direct from 
                        the farm? Or do you have a website? 
                        You could really make a killing if 
                        word gets out.
                                 CHARLIE
                             (terse)
                        We cultivate a limited amount of 
                        native crops. Not looking to 
                        expand. But I’ll be here each week.

           Theresa is surprised by his curtness -- departs.

           A flirty woman, BEVERLY (38), approaches.

                                 BEVERLY
                        How’s business?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Okay.

                                 BEVERLY
                        Did Ann contact you about her roof?
                             (off Charlie’s nod)
                        Hope you don’t mind me passing your 
                        name. It’d be selfish to keep you 
                        all for myself.

           Charlie tilts his head slightly in consent.

                                 BEVERLY
                        Come by later. My sink’s leaking 
                        and there’re some dead lights. I 
                        don’t have any new bulbs. Mind 
                        picking some up?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Sure.

                                 BEVERLY
                        Sure as in you mind or sure as in 
                        you don’t mind?
                             (off Charlie’s blank look)
                        Oh come on - lighten up.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I’ll bring the bulbs.

                                 BEVERLY
                        Anyway... I’ll see you soon then. 

           Beverly prances away.

           EXT. WOODS - DAY

           Will sits on a branch high up in a tree, reading Nietzsche’s 
           Thus Spoke Zarathustra. His perch overlooks the entire 
           property. How the hell did he get all the way up there? 
           A SQUIRREL leaps from limb to limb. Will observes it until it 
           jumps from sight. 

           INT. HARDWARE STORE - DAY

           Charlie pushes a cart to the register: LIGHT BULBS, DRAIN-O, 
           an opaque JUG OF LIQUID, THREE LARGE BEAKERS, and WIRING. 

           The OLD CLERK (65) eyeballs Charlie.

                                 OLD CLERK
                        Say there, son. You wouldn’t happen 
                        to be that outta-towner does odd 
                        jobs, wouldya?

                                 CHARLIE
                        No.

           Charlie starts to unload his cart.

                                 OLD CLERK
                        Heard ‘bout you.

                                 CHARLIE
                        You have me confused with somebody.

                                 OLD CLERK
                        Someone’s been snatching up 
                        business from the local contractor. 
                        May not be aware he’s stepping on 
                        toes, if you catch my drift.
                             (surveys Charlie’s items)
                        You building explosives, son?

           Charlie shifts but maintains his composure.

                                 CHARLIE
                        This amount should take care of a 
                        handful of gophers, right?

                                 OLD CLERK
                             (suspicious)
                        That’s about right, boss.

           Charlie hands the Clerk some cash.

                                 OLD CLERK
                        You happen to see that outta town 
                        handyman, tell him his services 
                        aren’t ‘preciated round here.

           Charlie stares down the Clerk, icy -- receives his change.
                                 OLD CLERK
                        You have a good one now.

           INT. CABIN - EVENING

           Will finishes cutting vegetables -- wipes the knife on his 
           pant leg -- stares out the window, restless. 

           INT. BEVERLY’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - EVENING

           Charlie works on the sink. Beverly enters in a low-cut dress -
           - leans in, dangling her cleavage. He doesn’t even glance.

                                 BEVERLY
                        Can I offer you something to eat?

                                 CHARLIE
                        No.

           Charlie finishes -- stands -- turns on the faucet. They look 
           at the pipes: no more leak. Beverly beams.

                                 BEVERLY
                        Sure you can’t stay for supper?

                                 CHARLIE
                        I’m sure.

                                 BEVERLY
                        At least let me get you a drink. I 
                        have milk, lemonade, tea...
                             (with a seductive glance)
                        Maybe a glass of wine.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I have dinner waiting.

                                 BEVERLY
                        Oh... Your wife’s cooking?

           No reply. Beverly hands Charlie some cash. He exits.

           INT. CABIN - EVENING

           Will cooks a fish over the open-flame stove. Smoke billows 
           out the window.
           INT. CABIN - LATER - DUSK

           Charlie and Will dine in silence. Will inhales as if to speak 
           but suppresses the urge.

           They finish eating. Will clears the dishes. Charlie exits. 
           Will hears the truck engine start -- exits...

           EXT. CABIN - DUSK - MOMENTS LATER

           Will enters the truck. No talk. Charlie drives away.

           EXT. DEEP WOODS - HOUSE - NIGHT

           Secluded. Satellite dishes line the roof. A TV flickers from 
           within. The curtains rustle as someone peaks out. 

           Charlie and Will walk from the parked truck to the door.

           INT. DEEP WOODS HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Smoky. Cluttered. A shady hillbilly, JIM (50s), ushers them 
           in. Charlie stares Jim down, all business. Will stands back, 
           detached; they’ve done this before. 

           Jim rubs his fingers together expectantly: ‘the money?’

                                 CHARLIE
                        The results?

                                 JIM
                        You don’t trust me by now?
                             (smiles)
                        Right.

           Jim fishes two documents off a messy desk. 

                                 JIM
                        Squeaky clean as always.

           Charlie inspects the documents: two sets of STD results. 
           Charlie nods -- hands Jim a small roll of cash.

           Jim thumbs the cash -- grins -- leads them back into the...

           INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Jim keys into a bedroom. Charlie enters -- pulls the door 
           closed behind him. Jim leads Will to another... 
           INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           A REDNECK PROSTITUTE (35) sits on the bed -- clicks off her 
           TV -- mechanically starts to undress. Jim leaves them alone.

           Will stares at her blank-faced -- starts to disrobe. Routine. 

           INT. CABIN - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Moonlight illuminates the cabin. Charlie and Will sit next to 
           each other cross-legged -- eyes closed in deep meditation.  

           Their breathing is deep, focused, rhythmic; their faces 
           completely calm. Crickets and the occasional frog are the 
           only thing we can hear over their breathing.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. CROP ROWS - DAY

           Charlie and Will work their field. Will notices a POLICE CAR 
           winding up the driveway. 

                                 WILL
                        Father.
                             (points to the cop car)
                        Should I get the rifles?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Remain calm, William.

                                 WILL
                        How could they know?

                                 CHARLIE
                        We don’t know what they know. Keep 
                        your eyes on me. If I clench my 
                        fists, we attack. Understood?

                                 WILL
                        Yes, Father.

                                 CHARLIE
                        We are prepared for this.

           Will nods. Charlie walks to the driveway. Will follows. 

           EXT. DRIVEWAY - CONTINUOUS

           The police car parks and TWO OFFICERS, LOU (25) and GEORGE 
           (50s), exit. Charlie nears.
                                 OFFICER LOU
                        Had a helluva time finding you. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        May I help you?

           The Officers scan the property. 

                                 OFFICER GEORGE
                        Just the two of you here?
                             (off Charlie’s nod)
                        We just have a few questions, sir. 
                        Mind coming with us?

                                 CHARLIE
                        I’d prefer to answer here. We’re in 
                        the middle of some work.

                                 OFFICER GEORGE
                        We better head down to the station - 
                        to follow protocol and whatnot.

           WILL’S POV: Will watches Charlie’s hands, awaiting the 
           signal. Charlie slightly curls his fingers... no fist.

                                 OFFICER LOU
                        Know why you were so hard to track 
                        down, sir? 

           No reply. George eyes his overeager young partner.

                                 OFFICER LOU
                        Damn hard to find a man who doesn’t 
                        take part in the census - and 
                        doesn’t pay taxes on the odd jobs 
                        he steals from hard working, law-
                        abiding citizens. 

                                 OFFICER GEORGE
                        Enough, Lou. 
                             (to Charlie)
                        Why don’t you just come along now?

                                 CHARLIE
                        The crops don’t work themselves. 
                        I’m sure you can appreciate that.

                                 OFFICER GEORGE
                        I can.

           George and Lou look around. Charlie’s eyes instinctively dart 
           to the SHED.  The thick PADLOCK dangles... UNLOCKED. Charlie 
           scowls accusingly at Will. Will meets his gaze, anxious.
                                 CHARLIE
                        You said you have some questions.

           The Officers turn their attention back to Charlie.

                                 OFFICER GEORGE
                        Yessir. 

           Lou can’t keep his eyes from the shed -- starts toward it.

                                 OFFICER LOU
                             (re: the oil drums)
                        What’s in there?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Vegetable oil. For the truck. We 
                        create our own biodiesel. 

                                 OFFICER LOU
                        You mind giving us a little tour - 
                        show us how it works?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Another time.

                                 OFFICER LOU
                             (re: the shed)
                        What’s in there?

           Will gulps, nervous -- shifts. Charlie grits his teeth -- 
           wiggles his fingers. Lou edges closer to the shed.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Unless you have a warrant, you must 
                        leave now. Nothing personal. We 
                        have work to do. We understand our 
                        rights and appreciate our privacy. 

           Officer Lou scoffs -- continues toward the shed. Charlie 
           takes a step toward Lou.

                                 OFFICER GEORGE
                        Please relax, sir.

                                 OFFICER LOU
                        Get down on your knees.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Am I under arrest?

                                 OFFICER LOU
                        You bet your ass you are.
                                 OFFICER GEORGE
                        Lou. Easy.

                                 CHARLIE
                        On what charge?

           Will’s eyes widen. Sweat beads on his brow.

                                 OFFICER LOU
                        Practicing construction without a 
                        license for starters.

           Charlie relaxes his hands. Lou approaches Will. 

                                 OFFICER LOU
                        Where’s your mom, partner?

           Will stares Lou straight in the eyes.

                                 WILL
                        Dead.

                                 OFFICER LOU
                        You guys have a smooth operation. 
                        All alone up here. What exactly 
                        does your dad do up here, buddy?

                                 WILL
                        We respectfully live off the land. 
                        A simple life.  My father is a 
                        veteran. A hero.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Enough, William.

           Lou moves toward the shed. Too close. Charlie sidesteps -- 
           stands in his way. Lou, threatened, instinctively reaches for 
           his gun -- grabs Charlie’s collar with his other hand.

           Charlie allows Lou to initiate contact. Lou attempts to force 
           Charlie to the ground. Charlie doesn’t budge.

                                 LOU
                        I said get your ass on the ground!

           With lightning quick speed -- Charlie punches Lou in the jaw. 
           Lou drops hard, immediately knocked out. 

           Will assumes a fighting stance, ready to lunge at George. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        William - relax.

           Lou lies unconscious. A drop of blood trickles from his mouth. 
           George is frozen: 30 years of nonviolent crimes in Podunk 
           hasn’t prepared him for this. He kneels next to Lou. Will 
           sprints to the shed -- fastens the padlock.

           Charlie voluntarily raises his hands above his head. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        I was provoked, Officer. I was 
                        cooperative and he grabbed me.

           George stands -- fumbles -- draws his gun.

                                 OFFICER GEORGE
                        Just come along. You don’t want any 
                        more trouble.

           Charlie walks toward the police car. 

                                 OFFICER GEORGE
                        I have to cuff you.

           Charlie allows George to handcuff him.

           Lou’s eyes flutter. He comes to, dazed, unable to move his jaw.

                                 OFFICER GEORGE
                        Just stay still, Lou.
                             (to Will)
                        Get in the car, son.

                                 WILL
                        I’m not going anywhere. 

                                 OFFICER GEORGE
                        How old are you?

                                 CHARLIE
                             (off Will’s hesitation)
                        He’s fifteen.

                                 OFFICER GEORGE
                        Can’t leave you out here alone.

                                 WILL
                        This is my home. I’ll take care of 
                        myself until my father returns.

                                 CHARLIE
                        It will be fine, William. Come.
           INT. COURTHOUSE MEETING ROOM - DAY

           Charlie, in a prison jumpsuit, sits with Will. The CASE FILE 
           rests on the table.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Go to the property. Make sure 
                        everything is secure. 

           Will chews his thumbnail, staring a hole in the table.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Look at me... There are so few 
                        strong men left in this world.

                                 WILL
                        I know, Father.

                                 CHARLIE
                        You must be one of them right now. 
                        The prosecutor is recommending 3 
                        years in prison.

           Will’s eyes show fear.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Based on previous cases and with no 
                        prior offenses, I’ll work it down 
                        to 16 months. Out in a year with 
                        good behavior. Worth it to stop 
                        them from snooping around, ruining 
                        everything we’ve worked for.

                                 WILL
                        Why don’t you at least meet with an 
                        attorney, Father? It couldn’t hurt.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I’ve read enough to represent 
                        myself better than the vast 
                        majority of attorneys. You could 
                        even do better than most.

           Will nods, confident in Charlie. Charlie leans in, serious:

                                 CHARLIE
                        It is of utmost importance we do 
                        not draw attention to ourselves. 
                        Conceal your intellect and physical 
                        abilities. Avoid photographs. 
                        Anonymity is one of our most 
                        powerful assets. 
           EXT. CAHILL HOME - DAY

           Quaint, one-story home. Will, carrying a small duffle, walks 
           with his new foster mother, MRS. CAHILL (60).

           MR. CAHILL (63) rocks slowly in a rocking chair on the porch.

                                 MRS. CAHILL
                        This is my husband, John.

           No response. Mr. Cahill continues to gaze into the street. 
           Mrs. Cahill leads Will in. Will glances back at Mr. Cahill.

           INT. CAHILL HOME - DAY - CONTINUOUS

           A den/dining/kitchen combo. Will marvels at the interior. 
           Modest decor - but a posh lounge compared to the cabin. 

                                 MRS. CAHILL
                        Not exactly Lifestyles of the Rich 
                        and Famous, but it treats us well.

           Will studies each painting and photo -- stares at a photo of 
           the Cahills - much younger - with a uniformed SOLDIER.

                                 MRS. CAHILL
                             (re: the soldier)
                        Our son...

           Her eyes turn sad for a moment. A medieval-style CRUCIFIX 
           hangs on the wall. Will eyes it with disdain for a long beat -
           - then follows Mrs. Cahill into the...

           INT. GARAGE - MOMENTS LATER

           Decades of accumulated stuff. She points to an old BICYCLE:

                                 MRS. CAHILL
                        You’re welcome to use it. I took it 
                        for a tune up. We’re about five 
                        blocks from the school. Or I can 
                        drive you - if you prefer.

                                 WILL
                        I’ll walk.

                                 MRS. CAHILL
                        Up to you. I’d like to see the bike 
                        get some use.
           INT. WILL’S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Mrs. Cahill shows Will his room. Basic. But he’s blown away.

                                 MRS. CAHILL
                        Towels are in the restroom closet. 
                        I’ll leave you to get settled.

           EXT. PRISON YARD - DAY

           INMATES stand in racially segregated clumps. 

           Charlie stands alone. A massive, tattoo-covered skinhead, 
           JACOB (35), approaches. 

                                 JACOB
                        Whaddya say there?

           Jacob towers above Charlie. Charlie assesses Jacob, calm.

                                 JACOB
                        Talking to you, boy.

           Charlie eyes Jacob, unblinking, unintimidated. More SKINHEADS 
           trickle up. The BLACK PRISONERS observe from across the yard.

                                 JACOB
                        You have two options: Keep giving 
                        me the mime act and make this 
                        stretch a living hell.... Or make 
                        some friends today. Join up with my 
                        crew. Help us run this place.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I prefer to serve my time alone.

                                 JACOB
                        Did it sound like you had a choice?

           Charlie attempts to step away, but he’s surrounded.

                                 JACOB
                        Enough talk. Let’s welcome him.

           A Skinhead, BJ (30), rushes at Charlie -- swings. Charlie 
           ducks -- lands an uppercut. BJ falls, knocked out cold.

           The next CRONY steps up. Charlie sweeps his leg -- lands a 
           punch to the face before he hits the ground.

           A SKINHEAD PUNK pulls a SHANK from his waistband. Jacob 
           notices -- shakes his head -- wants to see what Charlie can 
           do in a fair scrap. Punk tucks the shank away.
           A third SKINHEAD punches from the side. Charlie dodges it -- 
           grabs the wrist -- punches the elbow hard, breaking the arm. 

                                 PRISON GUARD
                             (O.S.)
                        Hey! Break it up.

           A GUARD rushes over. The Skinheads back off. Charlie 
           maintains his fighting stance, on high alert.

           BJ starts convulsing on the ground. The Guard rolls his eyes.

                                 PRISON GUARD
                        Somebody go get BJ his meds...

           One of the Skinheads sprints away.

                                 PRISON GUARD
                             (re: the fight)
                        Your handy work, Jacob?

                                 JACOB
                        No way, boss. Not me. New guy here 
                        is a real firecracker. Better keep 
                        a close eye on him.

                                 PRISON GUARD
                        Right.

                                 JACOB
                        I’m a product of my environment. 
                        Just seem to end up in compromising 
                        situations sometimes.

           The Skinhead runs back with a pill and water cup -- feeds BJ 
           the medicine. His breathing slowly returns to normal.

                                 PRISON GUARD
                        Alright. Everybody cool off.

           The crowd disperses. The Skinheads stare Charlie down.

                                 JACOB
                        We’ll see you later then. Pleasure 
                        to make your acquaintance.

           INTERCUT - INT. PRISON CELL / INT. WILL’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Charlie and Will each sit cross-legged, meditating. 

           ON CHARLIE: Clanking of cell doors; footsteps of guards; and 
           prisoner chatter echo, but Charlie’s focus is unbreakable.
           ON WILL: An occasional passing car and the faint whirring of 
           electronics disrupt the silence, but he’s completely at ease.

           EXT. CAHILL HOME - ESTABLISHING - PRE-DAWN

           The neighborhood sleeps. The sun barely hints at rising.

           INT. WILL’S ROOM - SAME

           The clock reads 5:41. Will instinctively wakes -- rolls onto 
           the floor -- starts doing push-ups.

           INT. PRISON HALLS - SAME

           Dark. Eerily quiet.

           INT. PRISON CELL - SAME

           Charlie - seemingly the only person awake in the entire 
           prison - does push-ups. 

           INTERCUT WILL AND CHARLIE: They go through their workout 
           routine - as if in unison - but in their new environments.

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL - COUNSELOR’S OFFICE - DAY

           Will - in his threadbare outdoor attire - sits opposite a 
           hefty COUNSELOR. She looks puzzled.

                                 COUNSELOR
                        Now - have you ever been in school?
                             (Will shakes his head)
                        Because your placement tests were 
                        actually darn good. I’d recommend a 
                        full track of advanced courses.

           Will grimaces: he revealed too much intellect on the tests.

                                 WILL
                        I’ll pursue the average curriculum.

                                 COUNSELOR
                        You’ll be bored. Some of the AP 
                        instructors are doing very exciting-

                                 WILL
                        No. 
                                 COUNSELOR
                        At very least, try AP U.S. History - 
                        I think you’ll connect with Mr. 
                        Ganthon. And let me know ASAP if 
                        you want to switch into the other 
                        advanced courses.

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - LATER THAT DAY

           Congestion between classes. STUDENTS covertly check their 
           SMARTPHONES at their lockers, presumably banned from use 
           inside the school.

           Will walks with a stack of books -- passes a group of POPULAR 
           GIRLS. They take a break from texting to gawk.

                                 GIRL 1
                        Where’d they find that creature? 

                                 GIRL 2 
                        My mom said his dad’s a total 
                        psycho. Raised him in the woods.

                                 GIRL 1
                        Twisted. Where’s he staying?

                                 GIRL 2
                        Foster care... with the Cahills. 

                                 GIRL 3
                        It’s like, the kid has been through 
                        enough, then you stick him with a 
                        batty old couple.

           Will overhears their jeers but walks straight ahead.

                                 GIRL 3
                        Tragic.

                                 GIRL 1
                        Please, Em. You’d probably blow him.

                                 GIRL 3
                             (playing along)
                        He is kind of cute...

           The Girls giggle. 

           Down the hall, a group of BOYS stare at Will. The apparent 
           leader is ADAM (17): handsome, athletic, cruel. 

                                 ADAM
                        Freak show. Look at those clothes. 
                                 BOY 2
                        Imagine growing up in the woods, 
                        man. I bet his dad was bangin’ him.

                                 BOY 3
                        His dad got 14 months, bro. He’s 
                        stuck here with us.

                                 BOY 2
                        Home-schooled his whole life.

                                 BOY 3
                        Home-everythinged...  

                                 BOY 2
                        Home-schooled is just a fancy way 
                        of saying molested. Sick shit, man.

           Adam - much taller than Will - intentionally bumps into Will, 
           knocking his books to the floor. The Boys snicker. 

           Will immediately shoves Adam forcefully against the lockers. 

           Adam’s face drops, startled by Will’s strength. The other 
           Boys - equally shocked - step in between them.

           Will assumes his fighting stance, identical to Charlie in the 
           prison yard. OFF WILL’S CLENCHED FISTS, we...

           FLASHBACK - EXT. CABIN - DAY

           Will, sweaty from training, stands in his fighting stance at 
           the makeshift punching bag. Charlie watches.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Right.

           Forceful right hook to the bag. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Left.

           Will punches with his left, equally powerful. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Attack.

           Will pivots to Charlie, who assumes an identical stance. Will 
           lunges at Charlie, unleashes a flurry of full-force punches 
           and kicks. This is no simple sparring session. 

           Charlie only defends. One kick solidly connects with his 
           side. Charlie nods, impressed but betraying no approval.
                                 CHARLIE
                        Stop... Defend.

           Charlie attacks at full speed, punches and kicks flying. Will 
           skillfully defends, but Charlie’s strength takes a toll on 
           his forearms and shins. 

           Will deflects a jab at his stomach, but Charlie lands a 
           forceful punch to Will’s cheek. Will is momentarily fazed but 
           defends the next barrage.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Stop.

           Will steps back, catching his breath, his cheek already 
           bruised and swelling.

                                 CHARLIE
                        We are strong, William.

           Will’s eyes are locked on Charlie’s, fully focused.

                                 CHARLIE
                        We possess the physical ability to 
                        overpower... to injure... to kill.

           Will nods, intense.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Using this ability at the wrong 
                        time is wasteful - jeopardizing 
                        everything we work for. We must 
                        carefully choose when to use these 
                        skills... Understood?

                                 WILL
                        Yes, Father.

           END OF FLASHBACK.

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - RESUMING

           Will stands in his fighting stance, glaring at Adam. Adam and 
           his friends remain frozen.

           Will recalls Charlie’s advice -- exhales -- relaxes his 
           posture -- collects his books.

           The bell rings. The Boys walk away. Adam feigns confidence, 
           joking with his pals, but glances back at Will, uneasy. 

           RENEE (16), an indie girl-next-door type, rushes from her 
           locker to catch Will.
                                 RENEE
                        Don’t worry about them. They’re 
                        assholes.
                             (off Will’s silence)
                        I’m Renee. 

           Will shuns her -- quickly walks away. She watches him go, 
           then turns and heads to class.

           INT. WARDEN’S OFFICE - DAY

           Tidy. Plaques adorn the walls. WARDEN AYERS (50s) sips coffee 
           at his massive desk. Charlie sits opposite him, stolid.

                                 WARDEN AYERS
                        I’ve seen thousands of inmates come 
                        through these doors.

           Charlie stares him dead in the eyes.

                                 WARDEN AYERS
                        I pride myself on running a tight 
                        ship. When a new inmate immediately 
                        gets to fighting, I smell a trouble 
                        maker.
                             (sips his coffee)
                        You a trouble maker, Nasy?

           Charlie’s constant eye contact unsettles the Warden. He 
           fidgets with his already-straight tie. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        No.

                                 WARDEN AYERS
                        Trouble makers get time tacked on. 
                        That what you want?

           Charlie shakes his head.

                                 WARDEN AYERS
                        Keep your head down. Serve your 
                        time. We’ll overlook today’s 
                        indiscretion, but only once. 
                             (off Charlie’s nod)
                        I’d like nothing more than to not 
                        see your face again til your 
                        release. I want you to be a ghost.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Likewise.
           EXT. CABIN - LATE AFTERNOON

           Will jogs up the long driveway, drenched in sweat -- surveys 
           the property: no sign of intrusion.

           INT. CABIN - MOMENTS LATER

           Will selects a thick tome from a bookshelf -- opens it -- 
           removes several rolls of CASH from a secret cut-out section -- 
           replaces the homemade safe on the shelf.

           EXT. CROP ROWS - SUNSET

           Will moves through the crops, pruning and picking.

           INT. CAHILL HOME - NIGHT

           Will enters, out of breath. Mrs. Cahill stands to greet him 
           as Mr. Cahill watches the nightly news.

                                 MRS. CAHILL
                        In the future, please let me know 
                        if you have plans after school. So 
                        we can have supper together. We can 
                        get you a cell phone, so-

                                 WILL
                        No, thank you. I’ll be exercising 
                        after school most days. Like today.

           INT. DINING ROOM - LATER

           Will and Mrs. Cahill finish their meals in awkward silence. 
           Mrs. Cahill searches for words.

                                 WILL
                        Could you drive me to visit my 
                        father on Saturday? Visiting hours 
                        begin at 9:00. 

                                 MRS. CAHILL
                        Sure. It’s about a 3 hour drive.

                                 WILL
                        So we should leave by 5:30. 

                                 MRS. CAHILL
                        You mean in the morning, right?

           Will nods. Mrs. Cahill is surprised by Will’s nonchalance.
                                 MRS. CAHILL
                        The gardeners are coming to finish 
                        the shrubs. Maybe we could leave a 
                        bit later... 

           They make eye contact. Will’s gaze is intimidating. Mrs. 
           Cahill crosses to the refrigerator, unnerved.

                                 MRS. CAHILL
                        Blueberry or cherry pie? Wasn’t 
                        sure which you preferred, so I 
                        baked one of each.
                             (off Will’s shrug)
                        Who can choose, right?

           Will scrapes his fork against his empty plate.

                                 WILL
                        I’ve never tried either.

           Mrs. Cahill’s face drops. She quickly recovers with a smile.

                                 MRS. CAHILL
                        Try a piece of each and decide.

           Will looks at her with a naive innocence, but his 
           vulnerability is short-lived. He turns unpleasant, defensive.

                                 WILL
                        I don’t want any. Excuse me.

                                 MRS. CAHILL
                        Okay, honey. I just-

           Will exits. She joins Mr. Cahill on the couch -- rests her 
           head on his shoulder, unaffected by his trance-like state. 

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           MR. GANTHON (40s) displays a slideshow on a large FLATSCREEN 
           TV. Renee sits a few rows behind Will, paying more attention 
           to him than the lecture.

                                 GANTHON 
                        Columbus discovered the Americas 
                        because he dared to explore. Took a 
                        leap into the unkown and found 
                        scores of new land and resources.

           Will shakes his head in disgust, looks down at his TEXTBOOK. 
           OFF HIS TEXTBOOK, we...
           FLASHBACK - INT. CABIN - DAY

           Will sits opposite Charlie at the table, reading the final 
           paragraphs of Sartre’s Nausea. Will closes the book.

                                 WILL
                        I’m sure I would experience similar 
                        frustration out there: the lack of 
                        intelligence, consciousness, 
                        purpose. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        These simple-minded people are 
                        brainwashed in schools, factories 
                        for teaching lies so a select few 
                        can control the masses. The outside 
                        world is bleak... If we are 
                        separated, you must never trust 
                        anyone. 

           Will nods with conviction. 

           END OF FLASHBACK.

           INT. CLASSROOM - RESUMING

           Will - lost in his memory - stares at Ganthon.

                                 GANTHON
                        It could be argued he was seeking a 
                        shortcut to India, but the bottom 
                        line was that he had the courage to 
                        get in a boat and explore.

           The bell rings and most of the students dash out. Will 
           lingers, sorting his books. Renee confidently approaches.  

                                 RENEE
                        How’d you like the lecture?
                             (no response)
                        Ganthon is so smart. Most teachers 
                        would lose my interest in the first 
                        ten minutes, but he’s just so 
                        articulate and keeps it 
                        interesting, you know? 
                             (Will scoffs, judging)
                        You disagree? How could you? He 
                        just gets it.

           Will boils over.
                                 WILL
                        That man knows nothing. They spit 
                        lies to impressionable students...

                                 RENEE
                        Low blow.

           Will looks puzzled at her slang usage. She smiles.

                                 RENEE
                        Just wanted to get you talking. I 
                        think I have your number, Will 
                        Nasy... See you tomorrow.

           She walks away before he can react.

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Crowded. The Boys stand by their lockers. Will passes.

                                 ADAM
                        What's up, pussy?

           Will shoots Adam a glare. The Boys look away, pretending to 
           look at something else. Will rummages in his locker.

                                 BOY 2
                        What’re you doing, faggot?

           Will looks. Again, they avert their eyes -- whistle. 
           Irritated, Will turns back to his locker -- grabs a book.

                                 BOY 3
                        Fuck you, freak!

           Will hurries away, past a group of three TEACHERS, including 
           Ganthon and Theresa (Charlie’s customer from the market). 
           They can’t resist staring. We stay with the teachers:

                                 TEACHER 1
                        Of all schools, they send that here.

                                 THERESA
                        Can’t wait til his dad gets out and 
                        they both just get out of town.

                                 TEACHER 1
                        How’s he doing in his classes?

                                 GANTHON
                        I don’t think anyone’s heard him 
                        speak yet. His first essay was odd. 
                                 THERESA
                        He’s literate?

                                 GANTHON
                        Absolutely. The essay lacked 
                        ambition and was formulaic. But... 
                        with allegedly no previous 
                        schooling, he cited several authors 
                        that aren’t introduced until upper-
                        level college courses. 

           The other Teachers raise their eyebrows.

                                 GANTHON
                        I don’t know what they were doing 
                        up there in the woods, but the kid 
                        has been educated.

           EXT. CAHILL HOME - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

           The neighborhood is silent. 

           Will plants shrubs in the yard. He digs quickly, efficiently -
           - then carefully fills in the dirt -- moves on to the next. 

           INT. CAHILL HOME - PRE-DAWN - THE NEXT MORNING

           Will knocks on the Cahills’ bedroom door. Stirring from 
           within. A groggy Mrs. Cahill opens the door in a robe.

                                 MRS. CAHILL
                        Everything okay?

                                 WILL
                        Yes. I’m ready to leave for the 
                        prison.

                                 MRS. CAHILL
                        Honey. The gardeners. I told you.

                                 WILL
                        The shrubs have been planted.

           Mrs. Cahill purses her lips, still half asleep, confused.

           INT. MRS. CAHILL’S CAR - MOVING - MORNING

           Mrs. Cahill drives. Will gazes out the window.

                                 MRS. CAHILL
                        Is he expecting you?
                                 WILL
                        Yes.

                                 MRS. CAHILL
                        You sure miss him a lot, don’t you?

                                 WILL
                        I’m fine.

                                 MRS. CAHILL
                        I know you’re going through a lot. 
                        Maybe you’re not comfortable yet, 
                        but I’m always here to talk. Okay?

           She looks at Will. He continues to look out the window, but 
           his intense gaze slightly softens. 

           INT. PRISON VISITATION ROOM - DAY

           Large, open room. PRISONERS mingle with VISITORS at tables.  

           Will waits eagerly. Charlie approaches in an inmate jumpsuit.

                                 WILL
                        Hello, Father.

           Charlie scans around: the coast is clear, but he still speaks 
           in a near-whisper.

                                 CHARLIE
                        How’s the property?

           Will’s emotion is stifled by Charlie’s stoicism.

                                 WILL
                        The shed is secure. The cabin is 
                        untouched.

                                 CHARLIE
                        You must be discrete with your 
                        letters. I don’t know who reads 
                        them before they reach me.
                             (off Will’s nod)
                        Is anyone suspicious of you?

                                 WILL
                        I rarely speak. I do just enough to 
                        pass the assignments in school. I’m 
                        invisible.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Stay strong. Be patient. This is 
                        only a temporary setback.
           Charlie motions to a Guard, who approaches and leads him 
           away. Will watches him go, longing for more interaction. 

           INT. PRISON WAITING ROOM - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Mrs. Cahill looks up from her book, surprised to see Will.

                                 MRS. CAHILL
                        Was he not available yet?

                                 WILL
                        He was. We spoke. We may go now.

                                 MRS. CAHILL
                        That’s it? After the long drive?

           Will nods. Mrs. Cahill stands, facing Will, yearning to hug 
           him. Will turns abruptly -- exits. She follows.

           EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - ESTABLISHING - DAY

           The trees are barren. Hints of winter.

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL GYM - DAY

           16 STUDENTS - including Will, Adam, Adam’s friends, and the 
           Popular Girls - do jumping jacks. Most sport gym clothes, but 
           Will wears his usual outdoor attire.

           An apathetic PE COACH (30) observes, paying extra attention 
           to the Girls’ bouncing physiques.  

           Coach blows his whistle, and the students stop exercising.

                                 PE COACH
                        Alright, everybody’s favorite time 
                        of year... Fitness tests.

           LATER

           The Students stand in queues behind PULL UP STATIONS. The 
           first group grasps the pull up bars.

                                 PE COACH
                        Partners, be sure to count 
                        accurately... Good luck breaking 
                        your own record, Adam.

           Adam is in the first group. Coach whistles, and the pull ups 
           begin. Most struggle, achieving only a few reps. Coach 
           records their results on his iPad.
           Adam cranks out fast reps, only going halfway down. The class 
           counts his reps aloud, cheering him on. The Girls swoon.

                                 CLASS
                        19-20-21-22... 23... 24.

           Adam strains for a 25th, red-faced, but fails -- drops from 
           the bar, breathing heavily. The Boys high five him. Coach 
           smiles, impressed.

           LATER

           Will at the pull up bar. Adam watches, arms crossed and smug. 
           Coach whistles.

           Will does one rep then lowers to a resting position. Adam 
           sneers, thinking Will is struggling... Then Will churns out 
           another full pull up - from resting position all the way up. 
           And another. And another.

           MOMENTS LATER

           The class looks on, surprised. Will’s ‘partner,’ a NERDY 
           GIRL, counts aloud. Adam snarls. Coach’s mouth hangs agape. 

                                 NERDY GIRL

           Will continues, showing no sign of fatigue. 

                                 NERDY GIRL

           After the 23rd rep, Will drops from the bar, barely breathing 
           above normal. Nerdy Girl offers him a high five: denied. Will 
           nonchalantly walks away. 

           INT. LOCKER ROOM - LATER

           Will stands alone. Adam and the other Boys change clothes. 

           Will removes his shirt, exposing his ripped physique. The 
           other Boys pretend not to stare, but the kid is shredded.

                                 ADAM (O.S.)
                        He’s actually heard of a shower 
                        after all? Fucking freak...

           Will turns. The others gasp as they notice his back: scarred 
           and bruised from years of intense training and rugged living. 
           Will turns on a sink: OFF THE WATER STREAMING, we...

           FLASHBACK - EXT. CABIN - DAY

           Water flows from the RAINWATER TANK. Will rinses dirty 
           clothes, then hangs them on a clothes line.

           Charlie creeps up -- cups his hands and emits a noise, 
           similar to a bird call... An alert. 

           Will’s ears perk up. He drops everything -- sprints past the 
           shed -- runs into the woods. He runs powerfully. Damn fast.

           Charlie watches from his hiding place.

           EXT. WOODS - MOMENTS LATER

           Will ascends a tree, climbing with force and speed, arrives 
           quickly at the top. From a high branch - where we saw him 
           reading before - he has a clear view of the property.

           Will hears the bird call alert again -- sees Charlie below. 
           Charlie quickly climbs up -- joins Will at the top. 

           They look out over the property and the breathtaking 
           mountains beyond.

                                 WILL
                        All seems secure.

                                 CHARLIE
                        The shed?

                                 WILL
                        Locked.

                                 CHARLIE
                        You didn’t check behind you before 
                        climbing. Someone could’ve followed. 
                        You’d be stuck - finished.

           Will closes his eyes -- nods, disappointed in himself.

                                 CHARLIE
                        We waste our physical superiority 
                        if fail to use our intellectual 
                        superiority...

                                 WILL
                        I’m sorry, Father.
           Fire flashes in Charlie’s eyes, vicious. The most animated 
           we’ve seen him:

                                 CHARLIE
                        Never apologize! Apologizing is 
                        weakness! Belittling yourself... 
                        Learn - then never repeat a 
                        mistake. 

           END FLASHBACK.

           INT. CLASSROOM - DAY

           Ganthon lectures, mid-slideshow. The images are glamorized 
           colonial portrayals of interaction with Native Americans. 
           Will eyes his desk, frustrated.

                                 GANTHON
                        Some tribes had positive relations 
                        with settlers and coexisted in 
                        peace. Others refused to cooperate, 
                        so relations became violent.

           Will glares at Ganthon with disdain. OFF HIS LOOK, we...

           FLASHBACK - INT. CABIN - DAY

           Will holds Friedrich Albert Lange’s Geschichte des 
           Materialismus (the German language edition). Charlie stands 
           looking down at him.

                                 WILL
                        I sympathize with his plight, but I 
                        cannot directly relate. I’d like to 
                        encounter the outside world.

                                 CHARLIE
                        You have the opportunity to live 
                        and think freely without being 
                        corrupted by this rotting society. 
                        A superior existence. I would give 
                        anything for that opportunity. You 
                        alone are pure, William. 

                                 WILL
                        You’re right. Of course. However my 
                        knowledge is purely theoretical... 
                        I’d like to observe, just a bit, to 
                        confirm my beliefs.
                                 CHARLIE
                        Your senses cannot be trusted out 
                        there. It’s all mind tricks and 
                        manipulation.

           Will nods, unconvinced, looks away.

           END OF FLASHBACK.

           INT. CLASSROOM - RESUMING

           Will stares a hole through Ganthon - lost in his memory - 
           anger on his face. 

           Ganthon has noticed and stopped lecturing. The whole class 
           looks at Will and his frightening expression.

                                 GANTHON
                        Will..? Are you okay? Will? 

           Will looks up -- nods -- looks down at his desk. Ganthon, 
           still uneasy, realizes he’s short on time:

                                 GANTHON
                        Quick. I want to plant a seed about 
                        the Presidential Scholars Program. 

           Mostly groans and yawns. Renee perks up.

                                 GANTHON
                        Scholars receive an all-expense 
                        paid trip to Washington DC and meet 
                        the President of our great United 
                        States. Looks amazing on a college 
                        application. Great opportunity but 
                        extremely competitive. Only the top 
                        students in the country. Let me 
                        know if you want more info. 

           The bell rings, and the students explode toward the door.

                                 GANTHON
                        Have a safe weekend. Good luck to 
                        our football players tonight. 

           The students flee. Renee follows closely behind Will. 

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Will trudges through the crowd. Renee catches up.
                                 RENEE
                        A few friends and I are going to a 
                        movie tonight. Wanna come?
                             (Will eyes the floor)
                        It’ll be fun. What else would you 
                        do - go to the big game?

                                 WILL
                        What do you think?

                                 RENEE
                        I think people like us wouldn’t be 
                        caught dead there. Bunch of dumb 
                        assholes running around with a 
                        ball, trying to cream the crap out 
                        of each other.

                                 WILL
                        What do you mean ‘people like us’? 

                                 RENEE
                        Outsiders. Losers. Different kids.

                                 WILL
                        We are nothing alike.

                                 RENEE
                        I moved here last year. I know what 
                        it's like to be new. To hear people 
                        talking about you in the hall. You 
                        don’t have to face it alone.

           For a moment, Will's shield drops. Renee notices the glimmer.

                                 WILL
                        You know nothing about me.

           Renee pulls out her smartphone.

                                 RENEE
                        What’s your number? I’ll text you 
                        about the movie.
                             (off Will’s blank stare)
                        No number - got it. How about I 
                        swing by your place on the way. If 
                        you want to come, be outside at 7. 
                        If not, no big deal.

           Will watches her walk away.
           EXT. CABIN - DUSK - LATER THAT DAY

           The sun begins to creep below the mountains. Will unlocks the 
           cabin -- enters.

           EXT. CAHILL HOME - DUSK

           Renee parks in front. A hippie girl, POLLY (16), and a 
           stoner, POPS (16), ride along.

           Renee scans the porch: no Will. Disappointed, she drives away.

           INT. MOVIE THEATER - LATER

           Renee, Polly, and Pops watch the film. Renee regards the 
           empty seat next to her -- turns pensive.

           EXT. CABIN - NIGHT

           Will strikes the homemade punching bag with a newfound vigor. 
           He strikes and strikes until the bag rips, spilling dirt. 
           Oblivious, he continues to strike.

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY

           Will shuts his locker. Renee is waiting.

                                 RENEE
                        You should apply for the 
                        Presidential Scholarship.
                             (blank stare)
                        The school only nominates one 
                        student. I’m applying.

                                 WILL
                        So why would you want me to apply?

                                 RENEE
                        Healthy competition. I like a 
                        challenge. It would make us both 
                        work harder. Get to know each 
                        other. I can go on...

                                 WILL
                        I’m not a strong enough student.

                                 RENEE
                             (scoffs)
                        You’re not fooling anyone. 
           Will is taken aback. Renee doesn’t belabor the point:

                                 RENEE
                        You missed a good movie last 
                        weekend. We’re going again 
                        Saturday. I’ll swing by at 7.

           She doesn’t wait for a reply.

           INT. PRISON CELL - NIGHT

           Charlie does push ups, eyes straight ahead, unblinking. 

           INT. PRISON VISITATION ROOM - DAY

           Charlie sits opposite Will. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Does anyone question you?

                                 WILL
                        Not really.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Elaborate.

                                 WILL
                        Most people leave me alone, but 
                        there’s a girl.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Trouble. I told you to remain 
                        completely inconspicuous.

                                 WILL
                        I have. She’s harmless. But she’s 
                        persistent.

           Charlie’s exhales hard, losing interest.

                                 WILL
                        She wants me to apply to a scholar 
                        program for the top students in the 
                        country. To meet the President in 
                        Washington. It’s comical. Who would 
                        want to compete to meet that 
                        conniving puppet?

           Charlie’s eyes dart back to Will.

                                 CHARLIE
                        You would meet the President?
           Will nods. Charlie processes the information... then:

                                 CHARLIE
                        Perfect. This is your opportunity. 
                        This is your destiny. 

           Will’s eyes search Charlie, perplexed.

                                 CHARLIE
                        It’s time to achieve, William. 
                        Integrate yourself. Do what you 
                        must. The President will meet you. 
                        The world will know our strength.

           They lock eyes. Will wavers, then nods. Charlie leans in -- 
           starts whispering plans to Will.

           EXT. CAHILL HOME - DUSK

           Will sits on the porch. Renee pulls up. Will freezes, hoping 
           he hasn’t been spotted. Her voice pierces the night:

                                 RENEE
                        Come on, Will. We’re running late.

           Will nervously plods toward the car.

           INT. RENEE’S CAR - MOVING - MOMENTS LATER

           Renee drives. Polly texts in the front seat. Will and Pops 
           ride in back. Pops nods ‘what’s up’ to Will.

           Bob Dylan's Tangled Up in Blue thunders from the speakers, 
           forcing the conversation to consist of near-yelling.

           Will studies Pops. Renee smiles back at Will.

                                 RENEE
                        Glad you came.

           Will gives a slight nod. Polly turns the volume down.

                                 POLLY
                        Dylan sold out, man. If he hadn’t 
                        gone electric, folk scene would 
                        still be huge. He ruined folk 
                        music. Period.

                                 RENEE
                        He evolved as a musician. His 
                        electric stuff just shows 
                        versatility. Interests can change.
                                 POLLY
                        Sold out. 

                                 RENEE
                        If he hadn’t come along, the folk 
                        scene never would have gotten as 
                        big as it was...

           Polly turns to address Pops, whose full attention is occupied 
           by watching his own hand dip and rise in the wind.

                                 POLLY
                        What do you think, Pops..? Pops!

           Pops, oblivious to the conversation, offers a cheesy grin. 
           Will studies their interaction.

                                 POLLY
                        Thoughts about Dylan going electric?

                                 POPS
                        Dig it.

                                 POLLY
                        Profound insight as always.

           Pops returns to watching his hand surf the wind.

           INT. MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT

           The foursome watches a movie and shares popcorn. Polly 
           cuddles with Pops. 

           Will’s face contorts in new ways, engaged in the film. Renee 
           observes Will -- smiles.

           INT. RENEE’S CAR - MOVING - LATER THAT NIGHT

           The foursome rides home. 

                                 RENEE
                        What’d you guys think?

                                 POLLY
                        Effects were too much. Plot was way 
                        outlandish. I need a little realism. 

                                 RENEE
                        Pops? How’d you like it?

                                 POPS
                        Dope.
                                 RENEE
                        Will... your thoughts?

                                 WILL
                        The story seemed unrealistic-

                                 POLLY
                        Thank you. Finally a fellow 
                        realist.

                                 WILL
                        The characters lacked conviction 
                        and made illogical decisions. But 
                        the experience was intriguing.

           Renee smiles in the rearview.

           EXT. POLLY’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Renee pulls into Polly’s driveway. Polly and Pops exit.

                                 POLLY
                        Good night, you guys. 

           Renee calls out of her open window:

                                 RENEE
                        Good night, my love. G’night, Pops.

           Pops throws up a peace sign over.

           INT. RENEE’S CAR - CONTINUOUS

           Will remains in the back. Renee eyes him in the rearview.

                                 RENEE
                        My name is Renee. I’ll be your 
                        chauffeur this evening. Where to?

           Will swallows, the humor lost on him.

                                 RENEE
                        Get up front, Will. 

                                 WILL
                        Oh - okay.

           INT. PRISON CELL - NIGHT

           Charlie scribbles on a note pad. His hand moves with rapid 
           precision, as if he can’t write fast enough.
           INT. RENEE’S CAR - MOVING - SAME

           Renee stops in front of the Cahill home.

                                 RENEE
                        Thanks for coming tonight.

                                 WILL
                             (hesitates; then:)
                        I enjoyed it.

           Renee leans over and kisses Will on the cheek. Will’s body 
           locks up; his face reddens. Renee leans back, smiles.

                                 RENEE
                        Have a good night.

           Will exits -- then turns back, earnest.

                                 WILL
                        I’ve decided to participate in the 
                        Presidential Scholar Program.

                                 RENEE
                        You mean ‘apply?’
                             (off his confident stare)
                        Alright - I like the swagger. Let’s 
                        meet early Monday to start prep.

           Will nods. Renee smiles -- drives away.

           EXT. CAHILL HOME - PORCH - CONTINUOUS

           Mr. Cahill puffs a cigar. Will walks past. No pleasantries. 

           INT. PRISON KITCHEN - NIGHT

           BJ, still with a black eye from Charlie, washes dishes. 
           Charlie mops. They are alone.

                                 BJ
                        You got a lady on the outside?
                             (no response)
                        Listen, man. We’re gonna spend a 
                        lotta time together in this fuckin’ 
                        sweatbox. Goes much faster if we 
                        talk.

                                 CHARLIE
                        What would you like to discuss?
                                 BJ
                        Shit - I dunno. Anything.

           Charlie’s eyes penetrate BJ, sizing him up.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I’m interested in your group. Are 
                        you actually a White Supremacist, 
                        or do you just claim allegiance in 
                        here for protection?

                                 BJ
                        Wasn’t affiliated on the outside, 
                        but I got to listenin’ to the 
                        teachings. I like what I hear.

                                 CHARLIE
                        And what are the teachings?

                                 BJ
                        We’re the superior race, man. We 
                        just want to wipe out the 
                        inferiors, you know?

                                 CHARLIE
                        What makes you superior?

                                 BJ
                        This beautiful ivory skin. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        That’s all it takes?

                                 BJ
                        Them minorities aren’t fully 
                        evolved.

                                 CHARLIE
                        You’re aware that whites aren’t a 
                        majority in the world. Even in this 
                        country, Caucasians will soon be 
                        outnumbered.

                                 BJ
                        Which is why we gotta attack now.

           Charlie sneers -- continues mopping.

                                 BJ
                        Where’d you learn that fancy 
                        fightin’ shit?
                                 CHARLIE
                        Learned basics in the Army. 
                        Developed the rest myself.

                                 BJ
                        You mind showing me a few moves?

                                 CHARLIE
                        I do mind.

           BJ chuckles: fair enough. They work in silence for a moment.

                                 BJ
                        What do you believe in then? Easy 
                        to cast judgment - not say anything 
                        - not stand for anything.

           Charlie pauses, provoked -- stares a hole through BJ, then:

                                 CHARLIE
                        I believe in many things, but my 
                        prime ethic - which permeates every 
                        decision I make - is to leave 
                        things better than I find them. 

                                 BJ
                        You think my face is better off 
                        with this black eye?

                                 CHARLIE
                        The struggle to survive precedes 
                        the desire to improve.

                                 BJ
                        How do you reckon we improve things?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Sometimes it’s simple - like 
                        picking up a piece of trash.

                                 BJ
                        So you wanna be a garbageman?

                                 CHARLIE
                        On a larger scale, to leave the 
                        earth better than we found it... 
                        will require drastic actions. The 
                        world is on a dangerous trajectory. 
                             (off BJ’s nod)
                        Humans are consciously destroying 
                        the earth, while the population is 
                        swelling. And this nation is 
                        crumbling. 
                                 BJ
                        I’m with you. We have similar 
                        beliefs, man. Keep the foreigners 
                        out. Wipe out the excess - the 
                        minorities. Stop them inferiors 
                        from overbreeding. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Do you have children?

                                 BJ
                        Yep - four little white angels.

                                 CHARLIE
                        You’re the problem. And your 
                        bigoted, nonsensical, obsolete 
                        ideology disgusts me. 

           BJ processes the insult for a moment, then laughs, 
           uncomfortable. Charlie just stares at him.

                                 BJ
                        You’re fucking crazy, man.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Sometimes I think I’m the only sane 
                        person on the planet.

           Charlie gets back to mopping. 

           A moment of silence, then BJ coughs... then all of a sudden 
           starts convulsing, having a seizure. 

                                 BJ
                        Nasy... Shit... 

           BJ’s breathing deepens. He falls to the floor, gasping:

                                 BJ
                        My pills... in the infirmary... 
                        please...

                                 CHARLIE
                        Quite superior.

           Charlie calmly walks away. 

           INT. PRISON HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Charlie strolls past a door marked ‘INFIRMARY’ but doesn’t 
           break stride. Not even a glance.
           INT. PRISON KITCHEN - SAME

           BJ writhes until he finally lays motionless, dead.

           INT. CHARLIE’S CELL - MOMENTS LATER

           Charlie nonchalantly peruses the collection of books on his 
           window sill -- selects on a tattered Kierkegaard novel.

           BEGIN MONTAGE:

           -LIBRARY. Renee and Will study together. Renee points to 
           Will’s notes -- makes a suggestion. Will shakes his head -- 
           explains his better way. Renee nods, conceding. 

           -COUNSELOR’S OFFICE. Will sits with the Counselor.

                                 WILL
                        I’d like to switch into the 
                        advanced classes... All of them.

                                 COUNSELOR
                        The semester’s nearly over.

                                 WILL
                        I’ll make up the work. No problem.

                                 COUNSELOR
                        O-kay. Would you want to take some 
                        of the old Advanced Placement 
                        tests... To gauge-

                                 WILL
                        Absolutely. As many as possible.

           -MATH EXAM. The rest of the class hammers away on their 
           scientific calculators. Will quickly computes in his head. 

           The Teacher strolls past, intrigued -- looks down at his 
           answer sheet. Her face drops, impressed.

           -WILL’S ROOM. Will scribbles on his homework.

           -TRACK. William outsprints the entire gym class, including 
           Adam, with ease. Coach’s eyes nearly pop out of his head. 

           -HALLWAY. Will passes Teacher 1, Theresa and Ganthon. 

                                 TEACHER 1
                        He scored 5’s on every sample AP 
                        exam he took - including Latin, 
                        Physics, and Chinese. 
                                 THERESA
                        Did he have access to the tests 
                        beforehand? Did he cheat?

                                 TEACHER 1
                        No way. I proctored the exams 
                        myself.

                                 GANTHON
                        Ms. Dalton says his work in chem 
                        lab is the most advanced she’s seen 
                        in her 40 year career... 

           END OF MONTAGE.

           EXT. SIDEWALK - DAY

           Will walks home from school -- passes the local...

           EXT. MIDDLE SCHOOL - DAY - CONTINUOUS

           STUDENTS trudge home from school, glued to their smartphones.

           Will stares straight ahead, unblinking, in his own world. As 
           he crosses the school driveway... Beeeep.

           Will springs out of the way of the car. His leap and reaction 
           speed seem superhuman. He surveys the area, wide-eyed, then 
           slowly relaxes -- continues walking.

                                 RENEE (O.S.)
                        Sorry to startle you. Just saying hi.

           PULL BACK TO REVEAL Renee is driving the car, picking up her 
           brother BEN (13; pre-pubescent, overconfident) from school.

                                 BEN
                        That was some ninja robot shit.

           Will becomes self-conscious.

                                 RENEE
                        This is my pesky little brother Ben. 

           Ben pretends to scratch his cheek with his middle finger, 
           flipping Will the bird. Will is oblivious.

                                 RENEE
                        Come over for dinner.
                             (off Will’s hesitation)
                        You like beef stroganoff? Mom’s 
                        specialty.
                                 WILL
                        Never tried it.

                                 RENEE
                        I’ll scoop you at 6. 

           Will tries to force a smile, but manages to look 
           uncomfortable. Renee drives away.

           INT. CAHILL HOME - DAY

           Mr. Cahill watches TV as Mrs. Cahill works on a crossword. 
           Will approaches. Mrs. Cahill looks up -- smiles.

                                 WILL
                        I won’t be eating dinner here.

                                 MRS. CAHILL
                        Okay. Where will you be eating, if 
                        you don’t mind me asking?

                                 WILL
                        A friend’s house.

                                 MRS. CAHILL
                        What’s his name? Maybe we know the 
                        family.

                                 WILL
                        Renee. I don’t know her last name.

                                 MRS. CAHILL
                        Oh, a girl friend - not necessarily 
                        a girlfriend girlfriend, but a 
                        friend that’s a girl. Delightful.

           Will blushes. Mrs. Cahill recovers.

                                 MRS. CAHILL
                        Renee... Doesn’t ring a bell. We 
                        aren’t the socialites we once were.
                             (Will lingers)
                        Is there something else?

                                 WILL
                        I was wondering... Would it be okay 
                        if I borrowed some clothes from the 
                        closet in my... the room I’m 
                        staying in?

           Mrs. Cahill pauses, nostalgic for a moment, then grins.
                                 MRS. CAHILL
                        Of course. It’s your room. You’re 
                        welcome to wear anything you find.

                                 WILL
                        Thank you.

           Will retreats. Mrs. Cahill calls after him:

                                 MRS. CAHILL
                        But I doubt those clothes are still 
                        in style...

           Too late: Will’s already out of earshot.

           EXT. RENEE’S HOUSE - EVENING

           Renee approaches her house, casually dressed. Will follows, 
           sporting a plaid flannel shirt and acid washed jeans.

           The front door opens and a small DOG, “Otis,” sprints to 
           Renee. She greets it warmly. Renee’s dad, AMOS (39), barefoot 
           in gym clothes, leans out the door.

                                 AMOS
                        Make sure Otis drops one.

                                 RENEE
                        This is my friend Will.

           Otis sniffs Will thoroughly. He stands straight, stiff.

                                 AMOS
                        Hey there. 
                             (re: Will’s attire)
                        You two going to a grunge 
                        concert... or a costume party? 

           Will looks down at his outfit, instantly embarrassed.

                                 AMOS
                        You can help with the dog, Will. 
                        He’s small but don’t underestimate 
                        his ability to defecate.

                                 RENEE
                        We get it. Thanks, Dad.

           Amos disappears into the house. Renee scratches Otis’ belly.

                                 RENEE
                        Do you have a dog?
           Will is slow to respond:

                                 WILL
                        We had a hunting dog for a while.

                                 RENEE
                        And...

                                 WILL
                        It’s a long story.

                                 RENEE
                        We have time. Otis likes to inspect 
                        the area before deciding where to 
                        drop one, as my dad so eloquently 
                        put it.

           As if on cue, Otis starts sniffing around the yard.

                                 WILL
                        I was much smaller... I had been 
                        hunting with my father before but 
                        only to help scout. One day he went 
                        to town, and I wanted to try the 
                        rifle by myself. 

                                 RENEE
                        Oh god. You didn’t. You shot the dog?

           Otis crosses into the neighbor’s yard. They follow.

                                 RENEE
                        Okay. Sorry. I won’t interrupt. But 
                        if you shot the dog, you’re no 
                        longer welcome for dinner. Just 
                        kidding. But seriously - you didn’t 
                        shoot the dog, did you?

                                 WILL
                        We went into the woods. Walked a 
                        while - didn’t find any animals, so 
                        I sat down by the creek.

           Renee hangs on every word, enthralled.

                                 WILL
                        I dozed off... woke to barking. 
                        There was a black bear with her cub 
                        about 20 meters from me.

           Renee is speechless for the first time in her life.
                                 WILL
                        The dog tried to protect me and got 
                        slashed. I fired one shot - missed. 
                        Father had returned from town, 
                        heard the shot, came running, and 
                        shot the bear. The dog was injured 
                        so Father shot it.

           Her jaw drops at his deadpan delivery.

                                 RENEE
                        You’re joking, right?

                                 WILL
                        The dog wouldn’t be able hunt 
                        anymore, so it wasn’t of use. No 
                        reason to keep it around.

           Renee looks away, perplexed.

                                 RENEE
                        What was its name?

                                 WILL
                        No name. It knew hunting commands. 
                        No need to address it otherwise. 

           They turn back toward the house in silence.

           EXT. NASY PROPERTY - CROP ROWS - SAME

           The crops begin to show signs of neglect. Weeds creep between 
           the formerly pristine crop rows.

           BIRDS snack on the crops.

           INT. RENEE’S HOUSE - SAME

           Renee and Will enter the tidy home. Ben and Amos lounge on 
           the couch, watching sports.

           Renee’s mom, DIANA (38), hums as she prepares dinner.

                                 BEN
                        This is the drifter Renee picked up 
                        on the sidewalk earlier.

           Amos laughs. Diana chimes in from the kitchen:
                                 DIANA (O.S.)
                        I can’t hear exactly what you’re 
                        saying, Benjamin, but I assume it’s 
                        inappropriate. Knock it off.

                                 BEN
                        Are you two sexually active?

           Renee reddens. Will raises his eyebrows. Amos laughs again. 

                                 BEN
                        Didn’t think so.

                                 RENEE
                        Shouldn’t you be staring at your 
                        armpits in the mirror, hoping to 
                        miraculously sprout hair?

                                 BEN
                        Whoa whoa. Some of us take longer 
                        to mature than others. Don’t rush 
                        perfection, lady. It’ll happen. 

                                 AMOS
                        That’s right, bud. Can’t rush it.

           Ben shoots Renee a smug glance. Diana bounds from the 
           kitchen, greets Will with a handshake.

                                 DIANA
                        So nice to meet you. Please excuse 
                        them... I visited a psychic in 
                        college. She said I’d have three 
                        kids: two boys and a girl. 
                             (motioning to Amos)
                        How right she was... Dinner is 
                        served.

           Ben leaps the couch -- runs to the dining area. Amos follows 
           Diana into the kitchen.

           INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Amos sneaks a few green beans from the serving dish. 

                                 DIANA
                        I saw that, mister.

                                 AMOS
                        Looks so delicious - couldn’t wait.

                                 DIANA
                        Yeah yeah.
           Will watches the exchange. Renee smiles -- tugs at Will’s 
           hand. He follows her to the table.

           INT. PRISON DINING HALL - SAME

           INMATES eat mystery slop. 

           Jacob addresses the Skinheads, elbows on the table:

                                 JACOB
                        I know BJ got seizures, and I don’t 
                        care if Nasy had nothing to do with 
                        it. They had kitchen duty together - 
                        That’s suspicious enough. We don’t 
                        deal with him, we lose face. 

           Murmurs and nods. Jacob’s disciples listen intently.

                                 JACOB
                        Straight up: This fucker is 
                        serious. Got some Bruce Lee shit 
                        going on. Can’t just walk up and 
                        shank him. We wait... Let him get 
                        comfortable, then we hit.

           Charlie eats alone. GOBI (50s; beady-eyed), joins. 

                                 GOBI
                        Name’s Tom Gobieski. Call me Gobi.

           Gobi talks fast -- avoids eye contact.

                                 GOBI
                        I don’t get mixed up with the 
                        gangs. I’m more of a thinker... 
                        Seems we got things in common. Saw 
                        that book collection of yours - 
                        Nice spread. 

           Charlie eats, ignoring Gobi. Gobi brags:

                                 GOBI
                        I was a professor on the outside. 
                        Had my way with a few too many co-
                        eds. A few got mouthy - disappeared.

           Charlie glares at Gobi, disgusted.

                                 GOBI
                        You need anything, or wanna talk 
                        philosophy or play chess, come find 
                        me... I’m on library duty.
           Charlie stands -- walks away.

           INT. RENEE’S HOUSE - DINING AREA - SAME

           Dinner is underway: beef stroganoff, salad, bread.

                                 WILL
                        Everything is delicious.

                                 DIANA
                        Thank you, Will.

                                 RENEE
                        His first time eating beef 
                        stroganoff.

                                 BEN
                        You’ve never stroged it off? 
                        Weirdo.

           Renee silences Ben with a kick under the table.

                                 WILL
                             (without thinking)
                        I’ve never eaten beef actually.

                                 DIANA
                        Oh no. Do you have dietary 
                        restrictions? I should’ve asked.

                                 AMOS
                        You Muslim?

                                 RENEE
                        Muslims eat beef, Dad.

                                 WILL
                        I usually cook fish, deer, fowl, or 
                        hog. Depends on the season.

                                 DIANA
                             (impressed)
                        You cook? Wow. Any particular 
                        reason you choose those meats?

           All eyes on Will. He proceeds slowly, self-conscious.

                                 WILL
                        Well, my father and I - we catch 
                        our own fish. Hunt our own meat.

           Ben looks at Will with a newfound respect.
                                 BEN
                        Can you take me? I will totally 
                        snipe some deers.

                                 DIANA
                        Deer.

                                 BEN
                        No no. Deers. I would take down 
                        five or six big ass-

                                 BEN
                        Five or six big-boned deers.

                                 DIANA
                        Deer, hon. Plural of deer is deer.

                                 BEN
                        Whatever. Will you take me hunting?

           CLOSE ON WILL’S intense gaze as we...

           FLASHBACK - EXT. WOODS - EVENING

           Will and Charlie creep with RIFLES, wearing camouflage.

                                 CHARLIE
                        3 o’clock. 60 meters.

           Will rapidly pivots -- eyes his scope -- fires at a tree in 
           the distance with a target painted on it. Bark flies. 

           The rifle kicks a bit, but he seems in control. Definitely 
           not his first time. He cocks the rifle. Charlie checks the 
           shot with binoculars.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Too high.

           BINOCULAR POV: Nearly a bull’s eye - millimeters too high.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Shooter at 12 o’clock. 25 meters.

           Will drops to a knee behind a fallen log -- steadies -- fires 
           at the target painted on the 12:00 tree. Slightly high.
                                 CHARLIE
                        Too high. Again. When you’re too 
                        weak or hesitant, the gun kicks, 
                        the bullet enters too high, and the 
                        target suffers. Steady, strong 
                        hand. We must respect our targets. 
                        Directly through the heart. No 
                        suffering. Clean kill.

                                 WILL
                        It’s just paint on trees.

           Charlie glares at Will, provoked. A long beat.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Get in the truck.

           EXT. MAIN STREET - EVENING - MOMENTS LATER

           Charlie’s truck cruises along.

           INT. CHARLIE’S TRUCK - MOVING - CONTINUOUS

           Will stares out the window. They still sport hunting camo. 
           They cruise past a FATHER and SON playing catch.

                                 WILL
                        What are they doing?

                                 CHARLIE
                        A pointless activity to fill time.

                                 WILL
                        They just heave it back and forth 
                        repeatedly?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Correct.

           Will takes a long look at the catch game -- squints -- 
           perhaps recalling a distant memory from his subconscious...

                                 CHARLIE
                        Their lives are meaningless.

           The comment snaps Will from his reminiscence. He chuckles, 
           amused by the ‘pointless’ game. His laugh is unnatural - 
           obviously not a common behavior. 

                                 WILL
                        Such an unproductive use of time.
           They pass a HOMELESS MAN panhandling on a street corner.

                                 WILL
                        And him?

                                 CHARLIE
                        These people are everywhere: drug-
                        addicted, mentally ill, cast away 
                        by society, begging for scraps.

           A SERIES OF SHOTS:

           -DUSK. Charlie drives down the interstate. Will rides in 
           front. The only vehicle on the road.

           -MIDNIGHT. Charlie continues to drive. Will sleeps.

           -DAWN. Charlie pulls off the highway -- parks deep in the 
           WOODS. Will wakes as he feels the car stop.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Come. We have a small hike.

           EXT. OIL FIELD OUTSKIRTS - MORNING

           Charlie and Will walk silently, rifles on their shoulders -- 
           arrive at a steep drop-off. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        Here.

           They stop. Several UPRIGHT OIL RIGS populate the landscape 
           down below: active fracking derricks. 

           A handful of WORKERS in jumpsuits and hardhats work the rigs. 
           A PARKING LOT and MOBILE OFFICES sit between the derricks.

           MOMENTS LATER

           Charlie and Will lie flat on their stomachs, rifles - now 
           with silencers attached - pointed toward the oil field.  

           WILL’S RIFLE SCOPE POV: Searching for movement. An old 
           compact car parks. A black man exits in a SECURITY GUARD 
           uniform. The crosshairs finds his chest.

                                 WILL
                        I have him.

           Will is calm -- cocks the rifle -- finds the trigger. 
                                 CHARLIE
                        No. He is not a target. 

           Will exhales. The Guard strolls into the office, oblivious.

           Will’s scope finds one of the workers.

                                 CHARLIE
                        No. We do not perpetrate senseless 
                        violence.

           A chubby, sharp-dressed oilman, NAT CLOUMIN (50) exits the 
           mobile office, barking into his phone. Charlie narrows his 
           eyes. Will aims at Nat.

                                 CHARLIE (O.S.)
                        Nat Cloumin. He’s ravaged the earth 
                        via hydraulic fracturing for 
                        decades to extract the almighty oil 
                        and natural gas. 

           Will tracks Nat with the crosshairs, focused.

           Nat approaches his pristine RANGE ROVER -- paces as he 
           continues his phone conversation. 

                                 CHARLIE (O.S.)
                        Contributes more than 250 million 
                        dollars per year to heartless, pro-
                        oil, climate change denying 
                        politicians and lobbyists. True 
                        criminal. Do it.

           Will steadies on Nat -- closes one eye -- inhales -- thwap!

           The bullet soars just over Nat’s shoulder -- shatters his car 
           window. Nat startles -- lowers his phone, frozen.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Too high. Weak, William.

           Charlie calmly finds Nat in his scope -- settles on his chest 
           -- pulls the trigger -- thwap. 

           Nat crumples to the ground: dead. Clean kill. 

           Charlie and Will stand -- stride into the woods. Composed.

           END OF FLASHBACK.
           INT. RENEE’S HOUSE - DINING AREA - RESUMING

                                 BEN
                        Will you teach me to shoot?

           Will stares at Ben vacantly.

                                 RENEE
                        I don’t think your behavior has 
                        earned an invitation. 

                                 AMOS
                        I’m a bit of a sportsman myself, 
                        Will. Maybe we could go out 
                        sometime.

           Will looks at Amos, not sure how to reply.

           INT. RENEE’S CAR - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Renee parks outside the Cahill home. Will looks straight 
           forward. Renee leans over and kisses him on his cheek. He 
           blushes. Awkward silence.

                                 WILL
                        Thank you.

                                 RENEE
                             (laughing)
                        You’re welcome.

           Renee turns his head, closes her eyes, and plants a long kiss 
           on his lips. Will’s wide eyes remain open. His mouth stays 
           rigid. Renee pulls away:

                                 RENEE
                        You can move your lips around on 
                        mine... if you want.

           Will nods. They share a proper closed-mouth kiss.

           Renee tilts her head -- slips in her tongue. He lets it 
           happen -- blinks. She pulls away. Will turns serious.

                                 WILL
                        I have to tell you something. 

           Renee is intrigued. A pregnant pause.

                                 WILL
                        The school nominated me for the 
                        scholar program. 
                                 RENEE
                        I know.

                                 WILL
                        I’m sorry.

                                 RENEE
                        Stop. Are you kidding? You 
                        absolutely deserve it. It wasn’t 
                        even close... I’m happy for you.

                                 WILL
                        I couldn’t have done it without you.

                                 RENEE
                             (smiles)
                        I know.

           Renee kisses him again. 

                                 RENEE
                        Good night.

                                 WILL
                        Good night.

           Will exits -- watches her go with an ambiguous look: is he 
           falling for her or playing her as a pawn in his mission?

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. NASY PROPERTY - DAY

           The last signs of winter recede from the property. Birds 
           chirping. New blooms. The neglected crops sprout haphazardly.

           INT. PRISON VISITATION ROOM - DAY

           Charlie looks sleep deprived, manic -- joins Will -- slips 
           him a sheet of paper. Will unfolds it to find a handwritten 
           scientific equation and a handdrawn diagram.

                                 CHARLIE
                        A synthetic aerosol form of abrin - 
                        untraceable via x-ray. And it’s 
                        nonvolatile as a liquid, so use a 
                        plastic vile - a metal detector 
                        won’t be an issue. You’ll fashion a 
                        bulb sprayer - similar to an 
                        antique perfume sprayer. The tube 
                        will run up the inside of your pant 
                        leg and exit your shirt. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 CHARLIE (CONT'D)
                        When you shake the President’s 
                        hand, look him square in the eyes 
                        and hold your breath. With your 
                        left hand, squeeze the bulb in your 
                        pocket, spraying a small cloud into 
                        his airspace. He’ll inhale it. Less 
                        than a microgram is fatal - three 
                        days later he’ll drop dead. You’ll 
                        be long gone.

                                 WILL
                             (unsure)
                        I haven’t even been selected yet.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I have full confidence in you, son.

           They lock eyes. Will nods, impassioned by the compliment and 
           first-ever familial term of endearment. 

           INT. CAHILL HOME - NIGHT

           Will and Mrs. Cahill enter to find Mr. Cahill watching the 
           news. Mrs. Cahill joins him with a kiss on the cheek.

                                 MRS. CAHILL
                        Hi, honey.

           Mr. Cahill is unresponsive. Will lingers.

           FLASHBACK - EXT. CHARLIE’S TRUCK - MOVING - LATE NIGHT

           Charlie and Will drive down the highway, the city SKYLINE 
           fading in the background. 

           A prominent building - the building from the new report - 
           burns, spewing flames and smoke into the sky. 

           Charlie’s eyes remain focused on the road ahead. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        You did well. We are heroes. This 
                        is just the beginning.
           Will watches the burning building in the sideview mirror, 
           proud to accept the rare compliment.

           END OF FLASHBACK.

           INT. CAHILL HOME - RESUMING

           ON TV: The news anchor continues the report.

                                 NEWS ANCHOR
                        The bombing - which claimed 112 
                        lives - took place one year ago 
                        today. Authorities still have no 
                        concrete leads, but eco-terrorism 
                        is highly suspected. KCH is a 
                        chemical engineering conglomerate, 
                        major backers of conservative and 
                        libertarian political groups, and 
                        adamant climate change deniers. 

           Will intently watches, then slips away to his room.

           INT. PRISON LIBRARY - NIGHT

           Four rows of book stacks. INMATES make use of 10 computer 
           stations while the rest of the facility collects dust. 

           SURVEILLANCE CAMERA FOOTAGE: Desaturated. Four cameras cover 
           the library from the corners. The book stacks are too tall, 
           creating a blind spot within.

           Charlie sits at a computer, rapidly typing up his handwritten 
           notes. He hammers on the keys, focused.

           Gobi appears over his shoulder.

                                 GOBI (O.S.)
                        How’d you learn to type so fast? 
                        Thought you lived off the grid - no 
                        electricity. Thought we were 
                        Luddites. 

           Charlie turns, blocking the screen from Gobi’s view.

                                 GOBI
                        ‘Know thy self, know thy enemy,’ eh?

           Gobi chuckles, uninterested in what Charlie is typing -- 
           walks away. Charlie glances around -- continues typing.
           EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           The bell rings. STUDENTS pour out, minding their phones. Will 
           emerges after the initial onslaught. Not far behind, Renee 
           rushes to catch him. 

                                 RENEE
                        Wait up... What movie do you want 
                        to see tonight?

                                 WILL
                        I have other plans.

                                 RENEE
                        Really?

           Will smiles. Renee smiles bigger than ever before.

                                 RENEE
                        William Nasy. We should record 
                        this, maybe build a statue. This is 
                        a big deal. Your first joke... 

           Will nods with a grin. Renee bites her lower lip, then looks 
           down to her phone -- starts texting. Will looks around, 
           everyone enslaved by their phones -- scoffs.

                                 RENEE
                        What?

                                 WILL
                        Technological dependency. 

                                 RENEE
                        I’m texting Polly about the movie...

                                 WILL
                        There could be an armed invasion of 
                        the school right now - nobody would 
                        notice if it wasn’t posted online.

           Renee looks around: everyone stuck on their devices. She 
           pockets her phone -- looks Will in the eyes.

                                 RENEE
                        You’re right. I’ll try to be more 
                        present.

           INT. MOVIE THEATER - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Will, Renee, Polly, and Pops each laugh uniquely: Renee with 
           her entire body; Will, a reserved smile; 
           Pops open-mouthed, spilling popcorn; Polly chuckles, then 
           notices Pops and goes stone-faced.

           Renee slides her hand to hold Will’s.

           INT. PRISON LIBRARY - NIGHT

           THREE INMATES on computers. Gobi sits behind the circulation 
           desk looking at a chessboard. Charlie enters. 

                                 GOBI
                        Chess match?

           Charlie ignores Gobi -- continues to the bookshelves -- 
           peruses the selection.

           Jacob and three Skinheads enter the library. Fast and silent, 
           they motion for the reading inmates to disappear.

                                 JACOB
                        You missed our appointment last 
                        night.

           Gobi utters a nervous laugh. Jacob grabs him by the throat.

           One of the Skinheads sweeps the library -- notices Charlie -- 
           rushes toward Jacob -- points to the book stacks.

                                 SKINHEAD
                        Nasy.

           Jacob releases Gobi, who gasps for air, massaging his throat.

                                 JACOB
                        You two go around back. We’ll pin 
                        him in. Don’t fuck it up.
                             (turns to Gobi)
                        Good - massage that throat. I’ll be 
                        back to deal with you.

           Jacob arrives at the end of Charlie’s aisle -- removes a long 
           SHANK from his waistline. Charlie spots him. 

           Two Skinheads appear on the far end, eliminating his exit. 
           Charlie assumes his fighting stance, focused.

                                 JACOB
                        Thought you could stroll in here, 
                        throw a few punches, and everyone 
                        would just leave you be.

           Charlie stares Jacob down, unafraid.
                                 JACOB
                        I run this place. I decided you’d 
                        die after that first scrap. You’re 
                        going to feel every second of this.

           The massive Skinhead blocking Charlie’s exit moves closer, 
           pulls a SHANK from his waist.

           The Skinheads close in. Charlie darts toward the massive 
           Skinhead, who swipes his shank. Charlie ducks it, kicks him 
           in the balls with amazing force. He keels over in pain. 

           Charlie steps on his hand, tries to remove the shank, but 
           Jacob rushes in, lands a crushing blow to Charlie’s back that 
           sends him to the ground.

           Jacob raises his shank, but Charlie kicks him simultaneously 
           in both shins, launching Jacob forward. 

           The shank flies from Jacob’s hand. He lands on Charlie -- 
           rears an arm back -- lands a violent blow to Charlie’s face.

           Charlie, fazed, reaches for the shank: just out of reach.

           Jacob rears back to swing, but Charlie delivers a powerful 
           head butt to his nose: BLOOD explodes from his nostrils. 

           The other two Skinheads move in. They kick Charlie, but 
           Charlie maneuvers -- picks up the shank.

           Charlie slices one of the kicking Skinhead’s Achilles tendon -
           - pops to his feet. 

           He drives the shank deep into Jacob -- then stabs the massive 
           Skinhead who was ailing from the kick to his balls.

           The last Skinhead flees, leaving ruptured Achilles Skinhead 
           at Charlie’s disposal. Charlie stands over him -- plunges the 
           shank into his heart.

                                 GOBI (O.S.)
                        Holy shit, Nasy.

           Charlie, covered in blood, looks at Gobi, hollow-eyed. Gobi 
           surveys the dead -- hocks a loogie on Jacob’s dead body.

                                 GOBI
                        I was a slave to that monster. You 
                        ever need a favor, you name it. 
                        I’ll tell the warden this was gang-
                        related.

           Covered in blood but composed, Charlie exits the library. 
           INT. SHED - EVENING

           TIGHT ON WILL. We don’t see his full surroundings in the 
           shed. He wears a gas mask and lab coat -- mixes liquids in a 
           beaker. Intensely focused. 

           He ignites a Bunsen burner -- carefully mounts the liquid 
           over the flame. 

           Charlie’s equation and diagram rests on the table.

           EXT. ABANDONED STRIP MALL - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           Picturesque night. Will and Renee lie on the hood of her car, 
           gazing at the stars, totally at ease.

                                 RENEE
                        What do you want to do? In life?

                                 WILL
                             (earnest)
                        I will change the world. 

                                 RENEE
                        I believe in you.

           She burrows into his chest.

                                 WILL
                        What do you want to do?

                                 RENEE
                             (takes her time; sincere)
                        Maybe change the world... but I 
                        want to see it first. 

           Her answer strikes Will. He stares at the sky, pensive. 

                                 RENEE
                        Travel for at least a year before 
                        college. Maybe India. I’ve been 
                        saving up for the flight. Then work 
                        random jobs to keep it going. Maybe 
                        you could come...

           They lie in silence, then:

                                 RENEE
                        Tell me something about you that no 
                        one else knows.
                                 WILL
                        You may need to narrow the 
                        category.

                                 RENEE
                             (smiling)
                        Good point... Okay, mystery boy. 
                        I’ll ask some questions.

                                 WILL
                        Doesn’t seem fair. Do I get to ask 
                        you questions?

                                 RENEE
                        Sure - one for one. But I go first.

                                 WILL
                        Why?

                                 RENEE
                        Because I made up the game. That 
                        logic seemed reasonable in 
                        elementary school, but I suppose 
                        you wouldn’t know about that.

                                 WILL
                        Low blow.

                                 RENEE
                        Withdrawn, but I’m totally going 
                        first. Nice slang by the way.
                             (off Will’s smile)
                        What’s your full name?

                                 WILL
                        William Nasy.

                                 RENEE
                        No middle name?

                                 WILL
                        I don’t think so. That was two 
                        questions, so now I get two.

                                 RENEE
                        I’ve got nothing to hide.

                                 WILL
                        What’s your full name?

                                 RENEE
                        Renee Elizabeth Barbin.
                                 WILL
                        Why do you like hanging around with 
                        me so much?

                                 RENEE
                        I knew you’d take this to serious 
                        town. I’m going over basic info, 
                        and you dive into feelings. 

                                 WILL
                        Answer the question please.

                                 RENEE
                        I like you because you are unique 
                        and intelligent and... genuine... 
                        and handsome.

           She kisses him on the cheek. He turns his head and they share 
           a long kiss. Finally, Renee withdraws.

                                 RENEE
                        My turn: When’s your birthday?

                                 WILL
                        I don’t know. We don’t do holidays. 
                        He doesn’t see a point in 
                        arbitrarily celebrating random, 
                        consumer-driven days each year.

           Renee wraps an arm around him -- strokes his side.

                                 RENEE
                        I’m very glad you were born, Will - 
                        no matter which day it was.

           They snuggle, looking up at the stars. 

           LATER

           Same position, but Will has dozed off. Renee regards the 
           sleeping, peaceful Will. 

           She carefully straddles him -- leans in to wake him with a 
           kiss -- moves closer -- OFF WILL’S SLEEPING FACE, we...

           FLASHBACK - INT. CABIN - NIGHT

           CLOSE ON Will’s sleeping face. PULL BACK slowly to reveal a 
           RIFLE pointed between his eyes, point blank. MOVE UP the 
           barrel to reveal Charlie holding the rifle, straddling Will. 
           Charlie cocks the rifle. Will’s eyes dart open. He 
           immediately tries to topple Charlie, but his arms are pinned 
           by Charlie’s knees. He struggles to no avail.

           Charlie’s finger nears the trigger. Will thrashes. Charlie 
           doesn’t budge -- pulls the trigger: click. Not loaded.

                                 CHARLIE
                             (stern)
                        You’re dead.

           Will tries to catch his breath. Charlie keeps him pinned. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        If immobilized by a stronger 
                        opponent, what do you do?

                                 WILL
                        Look for any possible advantage.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Why did you thrash recklessly? 
                        Wasted energy.

                                 WILL
                        I couldn’t figure a way-

                                 CHARLIE
                        Nonsense! If your legs are free, 
                        kick to immobilize. If you hands 
                        are free, go for the eyes. If 
                        you’re pinned, use your head...

           Charlie - still pinning Will - pulls two SHOTGUN SHELLS from 
           his pocket -- loads the rifle -- points it at Will’s face.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Go.

           Will tries to move his legs: nope. Charlie cocks the rifle. 
           Will wiggles to dislodge his arms: nope. Charlie’s finger 
           dances near the trigger...

           Will uses a shoulder to shove the rifle to his side -- lunges 
           forward and head butts Charlie directly in the nose. 
           Charlie’s nose gushes blood. He teeters back. 

           Will uses his leverage to hoist Charlie to the ground. Will 
           jumps to his feet, into fighting stance. 

           Charlie stands, ignoring the blood flowing from his nose -- 
           stares at Will, betraying no emotion.
                                 CHARLIE
                        We must always be prepared. Always 
                        alert. Never expose yourself. Never 
                        leave yourself vulnerable.

           Charlie turns and exits the cabin.

           END OF FLASHBACK.

           EXT. ABANDONED STRIP MALL - PARKING LOT - NIGHT - RESUMING

           Renee hovers, about to plant a kiss on him. Will’s eyes dart 
           open. He immediately hoists his legs -- topples Renee to the 
           ground -- springs to his feet. She screams, startled.

                                 RENEE
                        What the hell was that?

           Will snaps out of it. His face drops. Renee stands -- brushes 
           herself off. She looks at him, waiting for an apology.

                                 WILL
                        I was just having a bad dream.

                                 RENEE
                        And?

                                 WILL
                        And I was startled.

                                 RENEE
                        And...

                                 WILL
                        That’s it. That’s what happened.

           Will looks at her. Stubborn. Programmed never to apologize. 
           She searches his eyes. He softens:

                                 WILL
                        I’m sorry.

           She hesitates, conflicted... then hugs him. He hugs back. 

                                 WILL
                        Can I ask you something?

                                 RENEE
                        Anything.

                                 WILL
                        Do you know how to ride a bike?
           She smiles.

           EXT. CAHILL DRIVEWAY - DAY

           Will walks the bicycle into the driveway. Renee titters.

                                 RENEE
                        So exciting!

                                 WILL
                        Do you want to just show me first?

           Renee hops on -- pedals into the street -- gains some speed, 
           then turns back. Will is in awe.

                                 WILL
                        Nice moves.

                                 RENEE
                             (laughs)
                        It’s nothing. However I must warn 
                        you that I learned with training 
                        wheels - much easier.

                                 WILL
                        Do you still have them?

                                 RENEE
                        Maybe. My mom kept everything from 
                        childhood. Not joking: she has 
                        several bags full of our hair. 
                        Maybe training wheels made the cut. 
                        Be they’d be for a kid’s bike.
                             (off Will’s anxious look)
                        Relax. You’ll be absolutely fine... 
                        Do you trust me?

           A seemingly innocuous question - but weighted to Will. He 
           considers... then half-nods.

           Renee dismounts -- secures a grip on the seat. Will steps on.

                                 RENEE
                        I’ll hold you steady. You just 
                        pedal. Ready?

                                 WILL
                        I think so. 

           Will starts pedaling. Renee jogs along. After several 
           strides, she lets go.
           Will feels her release -- looks over his shoulder. His 
           balance shifts. The bike swerves -- hits the curb. Will falls 
           off into a neighbor’s yard. Renee runs to him.

                                 RENEE
                        You okay? I’m so sorry.

                                 WILL
                        You said you would hold on.

                                 RENEE
                        I know - but that’s how you learn. 
                        I say I’ll hold on, but I let go to 
                        show how easy it is alone.

           Renee plants a kiss on his cheek. Will mounts the bike.

                                 RENEE
                        I’m sorry. Ready to try again?

                                 WILL
                        This time just tell me that you’re 
                        going to let go.

                                 RENEE
                        This time I am definitely going to 
                        let go. Just keep pedaling.

           Renee takes out her phone -- snaps a photo of Will on the 
           bike -- smiles. Will turns stern:

                                 WILL
                        Don’t do that. 

                                 RENEE
                        What? Everyone on earth has a photo 
                        of their first bike ride - for most 
                        us it’s before age 8, but still. 

                                 WILL
                        No. Erase it.

                                 RENEE
                        Nothing to be embarrassed about. 
                        You look cute.

                                 WILL
                             (fierce)
                        Erase it.

           Renee’s smile disappears, put off by his overreaction -- 
           deletes the photo.
                                 RENEE
                        Never talk to me in that tone of 
                        voice again. 

           Will softens -- faintly nods.

           INT. PRISON DINING HALL - DAY

           Charlie walks to his usual place between the gangs. The Black 
           Prisoners give nods of respect, but he keeps his head down.

           The Skinheads, down in number, don’t even look at him, unsure 
           what to do without their leader. 

           EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - ESTABLISHING - DAY

           Birds celebrate the spring. 

           INT. CHEMISTRY LAB - DAY

           MRS. DALTON (60s) lectures. Will sits front and center. His 
           CLASSMATES are far nerdier than in the previous courses.

           A knock on the classroom door, then it opens. Ganthon and 
           Counselor step inside, beaming, staring at Will. 

                                 INTERCOM (O.S.)
                        Students, we have a very special 
                        announcement.

           From the corner, WE SLOWLY PUSH IN toward Will. 

                                 INTERCOM (O.S.)
                        For the first time in school history, 
                        we have a U.S. Presidential Scholar. 
                        Please extend your biggest Golden 
                        Lion congrats to Will Nasy. One of 
                        just 140 scholars out of the entire 
                        country. 

           Titters among the class as we continue to slowly PUSH IN. 
           Will is composed, breathing methodically.

           Mrs. Dalton smiles. Ganthon and Counselor approach -- pat him 
           on the back. Counselor hands Will a plaque emblazoned with 
           the Presidential seal and a small AMERICAN FLAG PIN. 

           His surroundings blur as we arrive TIGHT ON Will’s face: 
           Detached. Contemplative. Determined.
           EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - DAY

           Bell. The double doors fly open. STUDENTS flee. 

           Will approaches the bike rack. Renee runs from the building 
           to him, beaming -- throws her arms around him.

                                 RENEE
                        Congratulations! So proud of you! 
                        You’ve come a long way since 
                        silently scowling in Ganthon’s 
                        history class...

           Will lets a smile slip.

                                 WILL
                        Let’s do something different this 
                        weekend.

                                 RENEE
                        But we love our weekend movie 
                        tradition.

                                 WILL
                        Movies tonight... But tomorrow I 
                        want to take you somewhere.
                             (off Renee’s nod)
                        You have to give your word you’ll 
                        never tell anyone about it.

                                 RENEE
                        You know you can trust me.

           They share a kiss, then Will mounts his bike and adeptly 
           pedals away. Renee glows. 

           EXT. SIDEWALK - DAY 

           Will cycles home - past the...

           EXT. MIDDLE SCHOOL - DAY - CONTINUOUS

           He notices a scuffle in the school alley. Ben gets pushed 
           around by FOUR LARGER CLASSMATES. One of them takes a video 
           of it on his phone. 

           EXT. ALLEY - DAY - CONTINUOUS

                                 WILL
                        Hey!
           Will pedals toward them. They relent, startled. The main 
           BULLY gives Ben one last shove. 

                                 BULLY
                             (to Ben)
                        You’ve got a big fucking wise-ass 
                        mouth to go with that scrawny body. 

           The Larger Kids walk away. Ben hangs his head, embarrassed.

                                 WILL
                        What was that?

                                 BEN
                        I’m the smallest kid in the fuckin’ 
                        class. One day I’ll grow - and I’ll 
                        be able to defend myself.

           Will stares at Ben for a long beat.  

                                 WILL
                        Defense is for the weak. You must 
                        learn to attack.

                                 BEN
                        Great. I’ll call once puberty comes 
                        knocking.

                                 WILL
                        Size is inconsequential. When 
                        facing a larger opponent, you must 
                        strike first. You have the element 
                        of surprise.

           Ben makes eye contact with Will for the first time. Will 
           assumes the fighting stance. Ben mirrors him.

                                 WILL
                        Throat or nose. Soft on the fists. 
                        Both will stun - possibly 
                        incapacitate - the opponent.

           Ben nods, engaged in the lesson. 

                                 WILL
                        Hit me.
                             (off Ben’s uncertainty)
                        Do it.

           Ben throws a soft jab at Will’s chest. Will easily shifts out 
           of the way -- pushes Ben’s shoulder in a fluid movement, 
           knocking him off-balance. 

           Ben is taken aback by Will’s aggression. Will continues: 
                                 WILL
                        On your toes. Firmly plant only 
                        when you throw the punch - then 
                        back on the toes. Stable.

           Ben steadies -- throws another punch -- connects with Will’s 
           chest. Will pushes Ben’s other shoulder: Ben absorbs it.

                                 WILL
                        Weak punch. But your balance is 
                        better.

           Will stops -- points to his solar plexus.

                                 WILL
                        Solar plexus. The optimal target. 
                        Solid contact will knock the breath 
                        from your opponent. 
                             (off Ben’s nod)
                        Hit me. Solar plexus, throat, or 
                        nose.

                                 BEN
                        I don’t want-

                                 WILL
                        Do it. 

           Will pushes Ben forcefully, provoking. Ben bounces on his 
           toes -- grits his teeth -- swings at Will. 

           Will easily sidesteps it -- strikes Ben directly in the solar 
           plexus. Ben doubles over -- gasps for air.

                                 WILL
                        Your emotions must remain in 
                        control. Your attack must be 
                        calculated.

           Will helps Ben stand upright. 

                                 WILL
                        Breathe. Open the lungs. Now you 
                        know exactly where the solar plexus 
                        is. If you connect, the opponent 
                        will double over. Then you can kick 
                        or punch freely. 

           Ben starts to catch his breath. Will places a hand on his 
           shoulder.
                                 WILL
                        Work on your strength and the speed 
                        of your punches. Next time will be 
                        the last time he bullies you.

           Ben nods, half scared/half inspired.  

           EXT. CABIN DRIVEWAY - MOVING - DAY

           Renee’s car winds up the long driveway. 

           INTERCUT - INT. RENEE’S CAR - MOVING - CONTINUOUS

           Renee drives, in awe. Will fidgets beside her.

                                 RENEE
                        This place is unbelievable.

                                 WILL
                        Maybe this wasn’t a good idea. I-

                                 RENEE
                        It’s beautiful.

           INT. CABIN - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Will opens the door. Light invades the cabin for the first 
           time in months. 

           Renee stands in the doorway, speechless. Will enters.

                                 WILL
                        Everything looks so small.

           Will stands over his bed, vulnerable, exposed. Renee joins 
           Will -- hugs him from behind. 

                                 WILL
                        See what I mean when I say that I 
                        grew up differently?

           She squeezes him tighter. He strokes her arms.

                                 RENEE
                        Which was your bed?

           Will points. Renee sits on it. Will joins her; they kiss, 
           then she rests her head on his shoulder. 

                                 RENEE
                        What’s he like?
           Will stares at Charlie’s bed.

                                 WILL
                        Efficient... He doesn’t waste 
                        anything. Not even words.

                                 RENEE
                        What does he do for fun?

                                 WILL
                        I don’t think he knows that fun 
                        exists. I sure didn’t. I mean - we 
                        would read a lot - but not for fun. 

           Renee marvels at the number of books, peruses the collection.

                                 WILL
                        He’s serious. Committed to his 
                        beliefs.

                                 RENEE
                        What were his beliefs?

                                 WILL
                        We believe in respect for the 
                        earth, maximization of personal 
                        potential, and a deep sense of 
                        personal responsibility.

           Will turns his head, not ready to divulge more.

                                 RENEE
                        What about your mom?

                                 WILL
                        He never talks about her. And I 
                        don’t remember her... How about a 
                        walk?

           EXT. CABIN - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Will and Renee exit, carrying FISHING GEAR -- pass the shed.

                                 RENEE
                        What’s in there?

           Will eyes the shed, then looks at Renee, uneasy.

                                 WILL
                        Storage. 
                                 RENEE
                        You have no electricity in the 
                        cabin, but the storage shed is 
                        covered in solar panels?

                                 WILL
                        We also filter the biodiesel fuel 
                        in there for the truck. Do 
                        carpentry. Sort of a workshop...

           Renee lingers, expecting to be shown the interior, but Will 
           brushes past. She doesn’t push it -- follows him.

           EXT. POND - MOMENTS LATER

           Will and Renee emerge from the woods. Will dislodges a large 
           stone -- digs out a plump WORM with his fingers.

                                 RENEE
                        Nice find. Done this before?

                                 WILL
                        Your turn.

           Renee finds an even bigger worm -- baits her hook like a pro.

                                 WILL
                        Have you done this before?

                                 RENEE
                        My granddad has a lakehouse. I was 
                        the one who would run and dive off 
                        the dock, scaring the fish away. 
                        Dad and Gramps didn’t mind though. 
                        Wasn’t about catching fish. They’d 
                        just hang out all day. Mom and Gran 
                        would have to drag them in for 
                        dinner.

           Renee looks at Will. He is staring at her, hanging on every 
           word. Startled by his eerie gaze, Renee stops her story.

                                 RENEE
                        You okay, Will..? 

           He baits -- casts -- stares into the pond while he speaks.

                                 WILL
                        We came here everyday. We’d rarely 
                        speak. We’d catch one fish, then go 
                        home and cook it. 

           Will’s line grows taut. He doesn’t react.
                                 WILL
                        Recently we started catching more 
                        fish so he could sell them in town. 
                        And he started doing odd jobs... He 
                        needed extra money for the 
                        projects.

                                 RENEE
                        Projects?

           Will looks at Renee.

                                 WILL
                        I’ve done some horrible things.

                                 RENEE
                        I’m sure it’s not too bad. You were 
                        younger, so it probably seemed 
                        worse than it actually was.

           Renee studies Will’s face. She hugs him tight. Over his 
           shoulder, her face exposes fear, uncertainty.

                                 RENEE
                        That’s all over now. What’s done is 
                        done... You’re going to Washington 
                        D.C. To meet the President in a 
                        week... That’s amazing.

           EXT. CABIN - AFTERNOON

           Renee and Will stand at the cabin door. Will locks it, and 
           they move toward Renee’s car.

           A silent anxiety exists. Renee attempts to cut the tension:

                                 RENEE
                        Since you’ve mastered the bike...

           Renee tosses him the car keys.

           EXT. MIDDLE SCHOOL - ALLEY - EVENING

           Ben walks down the alley. The same four Larger Classmates 
           surround him. Ben bounces on his toes.

                                 BULLY
                             (laughing)
                        What the fuck are you doing?

           Ben quickly lunges at Bully -- punches him square in the 
           throat. Bully chokes, grabbing his throat. 
           Ben turns -- swings a punch at one of the others but misses. 
           They converge on him -- hold him -- start punching him. Ben 
           falls -- curls into the fetal position while they beat him.

           INT. PRISON VISITATION ROOM - DAY

           Charlie and Will sit together. Will seems anxious.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Have you tested the device?
                             (Will’s look says ‘no’)
                        We cannot risk malfunction. Find 
                        someone random - someone you 
                        couldn’t be linked to for any 
                        reason. 

           Will nods, half-hearted.

           INT. SHED - AFTERNOON

           TIGHT ON WILL wearing a GAS MASK. Again - we don’t see his 
           full surroundings. Sweat beads on his face. Tense.

           He bores tiny perforations into the FLAG PIN with a DRILL -- 
           affixes a small plastic tube to the back -- fastens the pin 
           to his shirt -- runs the tube down the inside of his clothes.

           Through a hole in his pocket, he screws the tiny ABRIN 
           CONTAINER and BULB into the end of the tube.

           EXT. MAIN STREET - DUSK

           Empty. Most shops are already closed for the night. 

           Will strolls, wearing the flag pin -- passes the HARDWARE 
           STORE. Old Clerk flip his sign from ‘Open’ to ‘Closed.’

           EXT. HARDWARE STORE - BACK ALLEY - DUSK - MOMENTS LATER

           Old Clerk exits backwards -- locks the door from the outside. 

           As the Clerk turns, he jolts at the sight of Will, standing 
           an arms length away.  

                                 OLD CLERK
                        Jeez, son. You startled me.

           Old Clerk catches his breath. Will observes him in silence, 
           hands in pockets. They stand chest to chest, the flag pin 
           positioned perfectly to spray the Clerk’s airspace.
                                 OLD CLERK
                        Can I help you with something?

           Will shakes his head. Slowly. Straight-faced. Old Clerk grows 
           uneasy. Will locates the squeeze bulb in his pocket.

           A pregnant beat: fear in the Clerk’s eyes; intimidating 
           confidence in Will’s. Will inhales... then we CUT AWAY.

           INT. CAHILL HOME - EVENING

           Mrs. Cahill toils in the kitchen. Mr. Cahill occupies his 
           post on the couch. Will enters.

                                 MRS. CAHILL
                        I bought you some socks for your 
                        trip. Good socks are important.

           Will smiles, pensive. She smiles back, unquestioning.

                                 WILL
                        Blueberry.
                             (off Mrs. Cahill’s look)
                        Cherry is delicious, but the way 
                        the blueberries interact with the 
                        sugar and crust... It’s a complex 
                        series of consistencies, but they 
                        combine to be so sweet.

           Mrs. Cahill smiles. Will gives her a big hug. She tears up -- 
           embraces him tightly. Maybe her first hug in years. They 
           release. Will turns to exit. 

                                 MRS. CAHILL
                        There’s a letter for you on the 
                        table...

                                 WILL
                        Thank you.

           Will scoops the letter en route to...

           INT. WILL’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Will opens the letter -- quickly scans it -- throws it down 
           on his bed -- blows out of the room, agitated.

           INT. CAHILL HOME - SAME

           Mrs. Cahill continues dinner prep. Will storms from his room 
           out the front door. Mrs. Cahill looks in his direction.
           INT. WILL’S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Mrs. Cahill approaches Will’s bed -- picks up the letter.

           ON LETTER: A formal letter from the department of corrections 
           mentioning “EARLY RELEASE - GOOD BEHAVIOR.”

           Mrs. Cahill swallows hard.

           INT. PRISON LIBRARY - NIGHT

           Empty save for Gobi. Charlie approaches with two thick 
           printed documents, his MANIFESTO. Gobi doesn’t look up.

                                 GOBI
                        Closed. Just about to lock her up.

           Charlie places one copy on the counter.

                                 CHARLIE
                             (re: the Manifesto)
                        Make copies of this. Pick out any 
                        sharp, intellectual types and get 
                        them to read it.

                                 GOBI
                        You save my life and all I can do 
                        is peddle your book?

                                 CHARLIE
                        I need your word you’ll never tell 
                        anyone that I gave this to you.

                                 GOBI
                        You have it... Heard you’re out. 
                        Drop the biggest assholes in this 
                        place - they set you free... That’s 
                        karmic, brother. Take care. World 
                        ain’t what it used to be.

           Charlie nods, picks up his copy of the Manifesto, exits.

           EXT. CAHILL HOME - NIGHT

           Mrs. Cahill and Renee chat on the porch. They try to mask 
           their anxiety as Will arrives. Will is dour.

                                 MRS. CAHILL
                        There’s a plate in the fridge, hon.

           Will nods. With a forced grin, Mrs. Cahill leaves them alone.
                                 RENEE
                        How about a ride?

           INT. RENEE’S CAR - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

           They sit in the parked car outside the Cahill’s house. Will 
           gazes into the night, confused.

                                 RENEE
                        This isn’t a great time to bring 
                        this up, but Ben got beat up... Did 
                        you encourage my brother to fight?

           Will’s demeanor is barely recognizable.

                                 WILL
                        There are so few strong men left in 
                        this world.

                                 RENEE
                        I know you’re under a lot of 
                        pressure with the trip... and your 
                        dad getting out.

           Will’s mind races, conflicted, no idea how to react.

                                 RENEE
                        Do you feel okay about everything?
                             (no response)
                        Come on. It’s me.

           Vulnerability - uncertainty - stress. Fifteen years of 
           indoctrination wins... He jumps on the defensive:

                                 WILL
                        What do you mean ‘it’s me?’ 

           Renee is stung.

                                 RENEE
                        What about school?

                                 WILL
                        I learn more in a day with my 
                        father than my entire time at that 
                        pathetic factory of mediocrity.

                                 RENEE
                        How can you even consider going 
                        back to that lifestyle?
                                 WILL
                        He’s my father. That is my 
                        lifestyle.

                                 RENEE
                        What about this? What about us? 

                                 WILL
                        What about us?

           Renee turns away, tearing up. Will turns to look at her, a 
           hint of emotion returning. He tries to apologize.

                                 WILL
                        I...

           Renee pivots to face Will, a single tear creeps from her eye.

                                 RENEE
                        You’re nothing like him. You know 
                        that.

           She crossed a line. Will raises his voice, abrasive.

                                 WILL
                        You don’t know him! You don’t even 
                        know the real me! You think you can 
                        use that body of yours to manipulate 
                        me! That makes you a whore!

           Will looks at her with unfeeling eyes. Tears start to stream 
           down her face: a combination of anger and heartbreak wells. 

                                 RENEE
                        Get out! Get out of my car, you 
                        fucking monster!

           Will exits -- slams the door. Renee leans on the steering 
           wheel, sobbing.

           EXT. CAHILL HOME - PORCH - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER

           Mr. Cahill slowly rocks in his chair, staring into the night. 
           Will storms to the door -- grabs the knob. Still gazing off, 
           Mr. Cahill speaks for the first time:

                                 MR. CAHILL
                        Take a seat here a minute, boy.

           Will spins, shocked to hear him speak. Mr. Cahill speaks 
           slowly:
                                 MR. CAHILL
                        Heard you’re heading home... How do 
                        you feel about that? 
                             (no response)
                        Returning home after a long absence 
                        is daunting. Likely to shake you.

                                 WILL
                        What’s with you people? I lived 
                        there 15 years. Less than a year 
                        here - you think I’ve changed? And 
                        think you know what’s best for me?

                                 MR. CAHILL
                        That’s not what I’m saying. Only 
                        you should know what’s best for 
                        you. As for changing... I know 
                        you’ve changed immensely.

                                 WILL
                        I’ve never even heard you speak. 
                        Now you think you know me?

                                 MR. CAHILL
                        I may not speak often - but I 
                        observe.
                             (off Will’s scoff)
                        The more words, the less meaning, 
                        and how does that profit anyone?

                                 WILL
                        You and my father would get along 
                        famously... Is that in the silent 
                        hermit handbook?

                                 MR. CAHILL
                        The bible.

                                 WILL
                        Now you’re going to lecture me on 
                        religion? Save your breath. It’s a 
                        trick used to control the lives of 
                        simple-minded creatures.

                                 MR. CAHILL
                        That book has some serious wisdom 
                        in it. I’m an atheist, but I’d 
                        never say a word to discourage a 
                        devout believer. 

                                 WILL
                        They live a lie. They live their 
                        lives in vain.
                                 MR. CAHILL
                        But they have something to live 
                        for. They believe enough to devote 
                        their lives to a cause.

                                 WILL
                        Their cause is bogus.

                                 MR. CAHILL
                        Who are you to judge the validity 
                        of someone else’s cause?

                                 WILL
                        Thanks, but I don’t need a gloomy 
                        old man telling me how to live.

                                 MR. CAHILL
                        Fair - but I have a reason to be 
                        gloomy. Not you. I’d hate to see 
                        you waste your chance to find your 
                        reason to live and possibly find 
                        happiness.
                             (off Will’s scowl)
                        I see how you and that girl look at 
                        each other. Right now, being young 
                        and in love can be your reason. I’m 
                        not saying that it won’t change. It 
                        probably will and should-

                                 WILL
                        This is not about her.

                                 MR. CAHILL
                        What’s it about then - for you?

                                 WILL
                        Nothing. That’s the point. We live 
                        on this earth for a fraction of a 
                        second. What’s the point in forming 
                        relationships and setting yourself 
                        up for pain. Emotional attachment 
                        is for the weak. We are going to 
                        open people’s eyes. We are going to 
                        change the world.

                                 MR. CAHILL
                        Before Mrs. Cahill and I got 
                        married, I was the best drag racer 
                        in the state. It was my passion. 
                        Then we got hitched, Luke came 
                        along, and my family became my 
                        reason to live. I lost my son to a 
                        war we had no business fighting. 
                        For years I’ve been miserable. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MR. CAHILL (CONT'D)
                        And I’ll continue to be. I have 
                        issues with our society - sure - 
                        but I’ll be damned if I condemn the 
                        society that allowed me to 
                        experience the ultimate happiness 
                        and love at one point. 

           Will eyes Mr. Cahill, who continues to gaze into the night: 

                                 MR. CAHILL
                        Emotional attachment could be all 
                        we have. Some people try to change 
                        this world - and a few may actually 
                        make a dent - but that’s not what 
                        it’s about for me. Bottom line: I 
                        choose what I live for, and the 
                        same should apply for you. 

                                 WILL
                        So you’ll continue to be miserable 
                        yet refuse to try and change the 
                        system that made you miserable? How 
                        can you sit back and accept that 
                        other fathers will lose their sons 
                        the same way you did? How can you 
                        be so willing to watch history 
                        repeat itself?

                                 MR. CAHILL
                        Because I still have love, boy.
                             (off Will’s scoff)
                        My angel of a wife has not stopped 
                        loving me for a second. 

                                 WILL
                        How can you be sure?

                                 MR. CAHILL
                        Know that feeling when the winter’s 
                        ending? Sun’s out but it’s still 
                        cold. You get in your car and your 
                        whole body turns warm and numb.

                                 WILL
                        I haven’t been in too many cars.

                                 MR. CAHILL
                        One day you’ll feel that sensation, 
                        I promise you that. That’s the 
                        feeling I get every time that woman 
                        looks at me. And she knows that I 
                        love her too, even if I may not 
                        come out and say it. 
                                 WILL
                        So you’re content to live in an 
                        unjust world just because you’ve 
                        found a woman.

                                 MR. CAHILL
                        That’s exactly what I’m telling 
                        you, son.

           Will shakes his head, but his eyes betray some emotion.

                                 MR. CAHILL
                        If you feel like you can change 
                        this world, go for it. Nobody’s 
                        stopping you. 

                                 WILL
                        That’s exactly what I intend to do.

                                 MR. CAHILL
                        I wish you luck. Just be sure you 
                        choose for yourself.

           Will stands, moves toward the house.

                                 MR. CAHILL
                        And ask yourself a few questions...
                        Were you happier before? Would you 
                        trade this experience and go back, 
                        not knowing the things you’ve 
                        learned and the people you’ve met?

           Will digests the question then enters the house.

                                                             EFFECT TO:

           EXT. PRISON ENTRANCE - DAY

           Will sits in the driver’s seat of the parked truck. Charlie 
           marches out, escorted by two guards. He notices Will, nods.

           INT. CHARLIE’S TRUCK - MOVING - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Charlie drives away from the prison, emotionless. Will stares 
           at his feet in the passenger’s seat.

                                 WILL
                        What was it like?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Irrelevant. When do you leave for 
                        Washington?
                                 WILL
                        8:15 bus tomorrow.

                                 CHARLIE
                        This timing is perfect. Fated to 
                        be. Is everything prepared?

                                 WILL
                        Of course, Father... What did you 
                        do with all of your time?

                                 CHARLIE
                        I had time to think. I achieved 
                        total clarity. 
                             (off Will’s vacant nod)
                        It’s your time, son. This is what 
                        we’ve been preparing for. This is 
                        your destiny.

           EXT. CABIN DRIVEWAY - DAY

           The truck winds up the driveway -- parks. They exit. Charlie 
           heads straight for the shed. Will follows.

           INT. SHED - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

           The door swings open, and we see the full shed for the first 
           time. It looks like a high-tech laboratory, completely out of 
           place in the wilderness. 

           CITY MAPS, BLUEPRINTS, SCIENTIFIC EQUATIONS, and NEWS 
           CLIPPINGS (including a pic of Nat Cloumin with the President) 
           line the walls. BEAKERS and TEST TUBES fill a set of shelves. 

           Charlie surveys the shed. Will lingers in the doorway.

                                 WILL
                        I’m glad you’re out, Father.

           Charlie inventories the chemicals on his work table, 
           oblivious to Will’s comment.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Show me the abrin.

           Will carefully opens a box, revealing a tiny VIAL of liquid. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        And the device?

           Will complies. Charlie puts the vial on the table -- puts on 
           a gas mask.
                                 CHARLIE
                        You tested it? Verified the kill?

           Will and Charlie eye each other. Will faintly nods.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I’ll run some tests. Go prepare 
                        lunch. 

                                 WILL
                        I haven’t tended the crops, Father. 

           Charlie closes his eyes, annoyed.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Forget the crops. We’ll need to 
                        vacate this place anyway. Go to the 
                        pond and catch some fish.

                                 WILL
                        Yes, Father.

           Will turns to exit -- looks back.

                                 WILL
                        I love you, Father.

                                 CHARLIE
                             (vicious)
                        What have they done to you? We were 
                        out of touch before. Things are 
                        more dismal than we thought.

           Will gulps. Charlie’s fervor increases:

                                 CHARLIE
                        Surely you noticed the apathy, the 
                        ignorance, the laziness.

           Will nods, conflicted.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Our isolated attacks accomplished 
                        nothing. A new president will 
                        accomplish nothing. We must 
                        establish a completely new system. 
                        We must start a movement - to save 
                        the earth. Poisoning the President 
                        is an overture. 3 days later - when 
                        he falls dead, we will blow up the 
                        stock exchange. We claim 
                        responsibility. They will be forced 
                        to take us seriously.
           Charlie pulls out his manifesto.

                                 CHARLIE
                        We publish our beliefs. Demand to 
                        have them featured in every major 
                        news source. No more ravaging the 
                        earth for oil. No more factories 
                        spewing toxins into the sky. 
                        Everyone is held accountable. Our 
                        fellow brave revolutionaries will 
                        act. Independently we will attack 
                        politicians, oilmen, bankers. We 
                        must incite violence. We must 
                        create anarchy. We must collapse 
                        the economy to see an actual 
                        change. No more bailouts. We must 
                        start over new. Our movement will 
                        spread internationally. Money will 
                        no longer dictate social hierarchy. 
                        Legislation will no longer be 
                        bought. There will be a phase of 
                        chaos, there will be widespread 
                        death, but the future of life on 
                        this planet depends on it. Earth 
                        will be restored to a sustainable 
                        population. Only the fittest will 
                        survive - the way it is meant to 
                        be. We are the fittest.

                                 WILL
                        What about all of the innocent 
                        victims?

                                 CHARLIE
                        Nobody is innocent anymore. The 
                        evidence that we are destroying the 
                        planet is ubiquitous, yet nobody 
                        acts. Those who are aware and fail 
                        to act are the most guilty of all.

           Charlie looks at Will, intoxicated with his own megalomania. 
           Will tries to mask his uneasiness.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Go get the fish, William.

                                 WILL
                        Of course, Father.

           Charlie turns back to his tests. Will exits.
           EXT. CABIN - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Will hides the fishing gear behind a tree -- takes off 
           running across the fields toward town.

           EXT. RENEE’S HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - EVENING

           WE WATCH FROM A DISTANCE, as if from the POV of someone 
           spying on the interaction:

           Will pleads, contrite. Renee eyes the ground, arms crossed. 

           Amos exits the house -- motions for Will to leave. Will 
           lingers a moment -- then hops on his bike and pedals away. 

           Amos attempts to console Renee, but she pushes him away -- 
           jumps in her car. We faintly hear her say:

                                 RENEE
                        I just need to be alone right now.

           She drives away in the opposite direction of Will. The CAMERA 
           PIVOTS with her car, as if eyes following her. 

           EXT. ABANDONED STRIP MALL - PARKING LOT - EVENING

           Renee lays on the hood of her car, listening to loud music in 
           her headphones, parked in the same space where she and Will 
           gazed at the stars. Puffy-eyed, but she’s out of tears.

           We hear a car rumble up, but Renee doesn’t hear it over her 
           music. We hear the car park. The door opens and closes.

           Renee notices someone approach in her peripheral vision -- 
           turns -- pales, terrified, as she realize who it is: Charlie 
           stares at her, stern. Her lip quivers.

           EXT. CABIN - DUSK

           Will dismounts his bike. Charlie tosses MAPS and BLUEPRINTS 
           onto the fire onto a BONFIRE, destroying evidence. He doesn’t 
           notice Will -- disappears into the cabin.

           Will glances into the shed: the walls have been completely 
           stripped. SIX LARGE HOMEMADE BOMBS rest on the ground.

           INT. CABIN - DUSK

           Charlie carries a duffle bag of supplies toward the door. 
           Will enters the doorway, empty-handed.
                                 WILL
                        I didn’t catch any fish.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I know. You still haven’t learned 
                        to always check behind you.

           Will swallows, stung. His confidence falters:

                                 WILL
                        I shouldn’t have to worry about 
                        being followed. I have nothing to 
                        hide anymore.

           Charlie eyes Will with pure disdain, then glances to the 
           corner. Will follows his glance to find Renee, bound and 
           gagged, wide-eyed with fear. His face drops.

                                 WILL
                        We do not perpetrate senseless 
                        violence.

                                 CHARLIE
                        You did this. You involved her. Now 
                        you have a decision to make.

           Will takes a breath -- looks Charlie square in the eyes.

                                 WILL
                        I already made my choice. I spoke to 
                        the police. Told them everything. 
                        Everything.

           Intensity invades Charlie’s face.

                                 CHARLIE
                        You’re as guilty as I am. 

                                 WILL
                        I understand that.

                                 CHARLIE
                        You ungrateful little monster. You 
                        absolute fool. This country is 
                        broken. This world is broken.

                                 WILL
                        Correct - but you don’t have the 
                        answer. This isn’t the way to fix 
                        it.
                                 CHARLIE
                        Who else will make a difference? I 
                        am a patriot. I am the American 
                        dream.

                                 WILL
                        They’re coming now. I did this for 
                        your own good, Father.

                                 CHARLIE
                        Don’t you dare call me that. I’m 
                        not your father. I never was. 

           Will goes pale -- stammers -- can’t find words. Renee looks 
           on, helpless.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I saved you from a indolent life of 
                        excess and materialism. Look at you 
                        physically and intellectually. I’ve 
                        unlocked your full potential and 
                        more. This is your gratitude. 

           Will’s breathing quickens, but his inhales are thin, as if 
           the air was siphoned from his lungs. His eyes dart around, 
           attempting to process the information.

                                 CHARLIE
                        You thankless bastard. Your family 
                        didn’t even look for you. They went 
                        about their self-indulgent lives as 
                        if you’d never existed.

           Faint sirens approach. Will looks up -- steadies his glare on 
           Charlie -- fights to regain his breath. 

           Will and Charlie look toward the road. Then simultaneously, 
           they look to the rifles, propped against a bookshelf, ammo 
           sitting in a nearby box.

           Equidistant, neither moves toward the guns.

                                 WILL
                        They’re not loaded.

                                 CHARLIE
                             (spitting venom)
                        I don’t need a gun.

           They assume identical fighting stances.
                                 CHARLIE
                             (re: the police)
                        They’re about two minutes away. You 
                        won’t live to see them die.

           Renee struggles in the corner, frantic.

           Charlie lunges at Will -- lands a punch to his head. Will 
           staggers -- misses with a punch. Charlie strikes again with a 
           kick to Will’s side.

           Will absorbs the kick -- jumps back into fighting stance. 

           The sirens grow louder.

           Charlie attacks again, landing a combination of punches to 
           Will’s stomach and face. Will FALLS to the ground, injured.

                                 CHARLIE
                        You haven’t been training, I see.

           Charlie strides to the kitchen -- grabs the CARVING KNIFE -- 
           stands over Will.

                                 CHARLIE
                        You are nothing. I created you. And 
                        now I will destroy you.

           Charlie rears back with the KNIFE above his head. Before he 
           can swing it down, Will lands a kick to the side of Charlie’s 
           leg with the bottom of his foot, DISLOCATING Charlie’s knee.

           Charlie CRUMBLES to the ground, but holds onto the knife. 
           Will struggles to his feet.

           Charlie lunges -- swings the knife -- rips a small gash in 
           Will’s neck -- then falls, immobilized by the knee injury.

           Will applies pressure to his wound. BLOOD creeps through his 
           fingers. The sirens grow louder still.

                                 CHARLIE
                        You’re no better than the wretches 
                        you once helped me destroy. Better 
                        kill me now, or I will find you. 

                                 WILL
                        I pity you.

                                 CHARLIE
                        My movement will spread, and you’ll 
                        die along with the other wasteful, 
                        ignorant fools.
           Will moves to Renee -- unties her.

           EXT. CABIN - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           Will and Renee exit as TWO POLICE CARS arrive. Still 
           pressuring his wound, Will waves his free hand. 

           INT. CABIN - NIGHT - SAME

           Charlie agonizingly pulls himself toward the rifles.

           EXT. CABIN - NIGHT - SAME

           OFFICERS Lou, George, and EDDIE (30s) rush toward the cabin. 
           George stops to check on Renee and Will. Lou and Eddie draw 
           their guns, creep toward the door. 

                                 OFFICER LOU
                        You okay? He in there?

           Renee crouches behind the police car. 

                                 WILL
                        Dislocated knee. He’s immobilized.

           Lou flings the cabin door open. 

           INT. CABIN - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           Charlie sits propped against the bookshelf with an eerie 
           smile, and the RIFLE pointed directly at the doorway.

           Before Lou can react, Charlie PULLS THE TRIGGER: Crack!

           EXT. CABIN - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           Lou flies backward out of the doorway -- lands in the dirt. 

           George and Eddie duck for cover. GUNS DRAWN, they crouch 
           along the side of the cabin. 

           Will’s eyes grow large. He joins Renee behind the police car. 

           INT. CABIN - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           Charlie methodically breathes... survival mode. 
           EXT. CABIN - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           George shuffles to a position under the window. Eddie 
           crouches next to the still-open door.

           As George rises up to look in the window, the WINDOW IS 
           BLASTED OUT by a shot from Charlie, inches from George’s 
           head. Broken glass showers the veteran.

           Lou writhes in the dirt, clutching his abdomen.

                                 OFFICER LOU
                        He got me, George. The asshole got me.

           George and Eddie make eye contact. George POINTS to the 
           window -- then holds up THREE FINGERS.

           Eddie nods, his gaze steady on George’s silent count.

           TWO FINGERS.

           Sweat pours down Eddie’s face; his eyes grow wide.

           ONE FINGER.

           As George drops his last finger, he reaches up and breaks 
           what is left of the window with his gun to attract Charlie’s 
           attention. Charlie FIRES toward the window.

           Eddie draws in a deep breath, ready to hop into the doorway. 

           Before he budges, A SINGLE GUNSHOT from off screen. 

           INT. CABIN - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           Charlie receives the bullet in the chest, directly through 
           the heart -- slumps dead instantly. 

           EXT. CABIN - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           Will, pale from blood loss, stands above Lou, HOLDING his 
           freshly discharged HANDGUN, still pointed at Charlie with a 
           firm, steady hand. WILL HAS JUST KILLED CHARLIE.

           Eddie rushes into the cabin, gun pointed at Charlie. 

           INT. CABIN - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           Charlie sits motionless. Surrounded by his books. Eddie 
           checks for a pulse.
                                 OFFICER EDDIE
                        No pulse.

           EXT. CABIN - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           Eddie dashes to Lou -- kneels -- grasps Lou’s head.

                                 OFFICER EDDIE
                        Stay with us.

           Lou, barely conscious, mumbles incoherently. George rushes to 
           the squad car, grabs the radio:

                                 OFFICER GEORGE
                        51 to base. Send a bus to the Nasy 
                        residence. Officer down. Civilian 
                        injuries sustained.

           Will slowly lowers the gun -- drops it in the dirt. 

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. HARDWARE STORE - NIGHT

           The Old Clerk reclines motionless in a folding chair. His 
           mouth hangs ajar. Seemingly dead.  

           Beverly enters -- peruses the shelves -- notices the Old 
           Clerk -- rushes to him.

                                 BEVERLY
                        Are you okay?

           She gently grasps his shoulders. He doesn’t move... then 
           suddenly jolts upright, awake.

                                 OLD CLERK
                        Sorry ‘bout that. Dozed off.

           He stands, very much alive: Will didn’t spray the abrin.

           INT. HOSPITAL OPERATING ROOM - NIGHT

           A NURSE stitches Will’s neck. Renee sits next to him.

                                 NURSE
                        You’re a lucky guy. A millimeter 
                        deeper, you’d be in the basement. 
                        Gonna be one heck of a scar. It’ll 
                        be with you the rest of your life.
           Will’s look says, ‘More than you’ll ever know.’ She finishes 
           the last stitch, shows Will with a hand mirror.

                                 WILL
                        I’ll survive.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           FLASHBACK - EXT. MANSION - KIDS BIRTHDAY PARTY - DAY

           Extravagant: CLOWNS, MAGICIANS, JUGGLERS, STILT WALKERS. 

           Spoiled white KIDS run amok, while their PARENTS sip mimosas 
           and gossip in expensive attire.

           YOUNG WILL (3) isn’t interested in the performers -- jogs to 
           his DAD holding a baseball and mitt.

                                 YOUNG WILL
                        Daddy. Come play. 

           Will’s Dad, sporting a polo shirt with an Oil Company logo, 
           has his EARLY MODEL SMARTPHONE to his ear -- shushes Will.  

                                 YOUNG WILL
                        Daddy. 

           Will’s Dad covers his phone, annoyed -- whispers to Will:

                                 WILL’S DAD
                        Go play with Dominga. I’ll come 
                        later.

           Disappointed, Will jogs way.

           MOMENTS LATER

           Will plays catch with his portly Hispanic NANNY. Young Will 
           misses a catch. The ball rolls down a hill into a bush. 

           The Nanny turns her attention to a crying child.

           Young Will jogs after it -- nears the bush -- looks in... 

           Suddenly two hands grab Will -- pull him behind the bush. 
           A YOUNGER CHARLIE (30) trots away, muffling Young Will’s 
           screams with a hand over his mouth. 

           INT. PICKUP TRUCK - MOVING - EVENING

           Charlie steers down the empty interstate with Young Will 
           bound in the passenger seat, eyes swollen from tears. 

                                 CHARLIE
                        I hope you’re finished crying. Try  
                        to sleep. We have a long drive.

           Charlie drives into the night, into the unknown.

           INT. CABIN - DAY

           Young Will wakes on a small cot, no longer bound. His eyes 
           dart around the sparse room. 

           Charlie approaches, grasps him by the shoulders.

                                 CHARLIE
                        I saved you from a dangerous world - 
                        a world that must be changed. This 
                        is our home. We are destined for 
                        great things. We must be strong.

                                 WILL
                        I want my mom.

                                 CHARLIE
                        You will never see your mother 
                        again. You are in a much better 
                        place now. We are destined to 
                        change the world.

           END FLASHBACK.

           INT. PRISON LIBRARY - NIGHT

           Several copies of Charlie’s manifesto line a shelf in the 
           Philosophy section. A hand removes one of them.

           A discerning eye may notice the quote ‘AND IF YOU GAZE LONG 
           ENOUGH INTO THE ABYSS...’ tattooed on the prisoner’s forearm.

                                                              FADE OUT.

                                                               THE END.
