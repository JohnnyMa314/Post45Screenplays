                   *The Following Story Is True... or Misremembered.
           OVER BLACK: The impassioned voice of a NEW YORKER...

                                 NEW YORKER (V.O.)
                        Do ’ya know the most difficult thing 
                        to do in sports, in any sport, in 
                        the history of sports?

           CAMERA FLASHES sprinkle the darkness like a constellation.

                                 OTHER VOICE (V.O.)
                        No.

                                                         FADE IN ON:

           A SEA OF SPECTATORS

           HUNDREDS OF THEM. OUT-OF-FOCUS. Just a lot of RED & WHITE 
           blurring into a single mass of reverberating excitement...

                                 NEW YORKER (V.O.)
                        Hitting a baseball. Plain and 
                        simple.

           ...A figure RISES into frame -- TAKING THE MOUND -- his face 
           forever forward. The back of his bright white UNIFORM reads:

                                        CLEMENS

           #21 takes position to pitch and our angle adjusts, REVEALING--

                                 NEW YORKER (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        See... a baseball mound is 60-feet, 
                        six inches from home plate...

           --A BATTER, a CATCHER and an UMPIRE. They’re out-of-focus 
           too... because all we care about, all we’ll be watching...

           IS A BASEBALL -- clean cowhide, 108 double-stitches -- lifted 
           into frame, enveloped in a black LEATHER PITCHER’S GLOVE...

                                 NEW YORKER (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        ...And the average major league 
                        fastball is 95 miles-an-hour.

           FOLLOW THE BALL as the still-faceless #21 brings his arm back 
           -- the windup -- unfurling in a fluid split-finger rotation...

                                 NEW YORKER (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Means it takes point-four seconds 
                        from hand to bat...

           LAUNCHING THE BASEBALL and snapping us into-- SLOW MOTION...

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 NEW YORKER (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        ...That’s four hundred and thirty 
                        milliseconds, if we’re bein’ exact.

           We’re so tight on the ball we can almost make out the AIR 
           CURRENT slipstreaming over the red rivets of yarn...

                                 NEW YORKER (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Now the batter has only half that 
                        time to choose if he’s gonna swing. 
                        That’s it. Ball’s still thirty feet 
                        away-- he’s gotta decide. When it’s 
                        that fast...

           A CHANGE UP -- We now FOCUS on the tip of the BASEBALL BAT. 
           It quivers as the batter’s arm muscles make a decision...

                                 NEW YORKER (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        It has to become instinct.

           ...TO SWING. The Louisville Slugger begins its PERFECT ARC...

                                 NEW YORKER (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Best hitters in the game either got 
                        some crazy Jedi inner-peace or 
                        they’re the dumbest jocks on the 
                        face of God’s green earth...

           ...THE BALL approaches the far corner of the plate...

                                 NEW YORKER (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Because the end of that bat’s goin’ 
                        almost as fast as the ball. So the 
                        timing, the angle... Everything has 
                        to be perfect... Otherwise...

           --THE BAT AND THE BALL MISS EACH OTHER BY A HUMAN HAIR--

                                 NEW YORKER (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        ...In the blink of an eye...

           The baseball SLAMS into the CATCHER’S GLOVE as we resume...

           NORMAL SPEED. The Umpire gives the universal SIGNAL for:

                                 NEW YORKER (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        ...You’re out.

           #21 - ROGER CLEMENS - face still unseen, throws a fist to the 
           heavens... in elation, in excitement, or maybe, just maybe...

           In defiance.

                                                            CUT TO:
           EXT. COFFEE KIOSK - MORNING - FEBRUARY 13, 2008

           BRIAN MCNAMEE -- our New Yorker -- tears apart a PAPER 
           NAPKIN. The body of a jock but the face of an accountant, 
           he’s spent his late 30’s losing hair and growing bitter.

                                 BRIAN (NEW YORKER)
                        You ever play baseball?

           He looks across the fold-out table at federal agent JEFF 
           NOVITZKY, his sharply SHAVED HEAD matched by his demeanor.

                                 JEFF (OTHER VOICE)
                        I’m six-seven, Brian. I’ve got a 
                        strike zone the size of Montana.

                                 BRIAN
                        Randy Johnson’s six-ten.
                           (
                            beat
                                )
                        Basketball?

           Jeff sips coffee from a paper cup, points at Brian: Bingo. 
           Brian tears his napkin again. One tiny piece at a time...

                                 BRIAN (CONT’D)
                        Do you miss it?

           Jeff thinks, takes a look around... the kiosk is in a BIG 
           PARK. Lot of grass, lot of trees, lot of visitors...

                                 JEFF
                        You know... Turns out, I’m not 
                        really a big fan of sports.

           This idea seems so alien to Brian. He tears the napkin--

                                 BRIAN
                        See, I don’t get that. I miss the 
                        game every day. And I was good, 
                        too... back in college. Just not 
                        good enough. Couldn’t hit for shit.

                                 JEFF
                        Well I hear hitting a baseball is 
                        rather difficult.

           Brian stops tearing. Looks Jeff bitterly in the eye.

                                 BRIAN
                        You still don’t get it, do you?

                                 JEFF
                        You mean that little math lesson we 
                        just had wasn’t explanation enough?

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 BRIAN
                        Hitting a baseball is hard because 
                        the guy throwing it makes it hard!
                           (
                            riled up
                                    )
                        You have no respect for the game. 
                        That’s your problem! Respect.

                                 JEFF
                        We clearly have different 
                        definitions of that word.

           Tourists crowding the kiosk are beginning to stare at Brian.

                                 BRIAN
                        Christ-- didn’t you guys have better 
                        things to do? Huh, Jeff? 
                           (
                            no answer
                                     )
                        Before you and Senator Mitchell 
                        decided to burn down Rome... He  
                        saved baseball. Twenty-eight hundred 
                        strikeouts. Two hundred wins. Four Cy 
                        Young’s. All before ninety-eight. He 
                        could’ve retired then and there and 
                        he still would’ve been one of the 
                        best to ever play. And all of it... 
                           (
                            beat
                                )
                        All of it done clean.

           Jeff nonchalantly tosses out the dregs of his coffee cup--

                                 JEFF
                        Yeah. And then he met you.

           --AND HE SLAMS THE CUP down over the napkin shards.

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        You owe Roger nothing. Tell the truth.
                           (
                            beat
                                )
                        Now throw away your trash.

           Brian doesn’t move, his last defiant act before the gallows. 
           Instead, he looks behind him, out over the green grass to-- 

           THE UNITED STATES CAPITOL

           At the end of the WASHINGTON MALL. A reflecting pool doubles 
           the sky and the dome and a flapping AMERICAN FLAG...

                                 BUD
                        Thank you, Steve. And a heartfelt 
                        thank you to all the baseball fans 
                        watching. I think we’re all looking 
                        forward to what I know will be a 
                        thrilling ninety-eight season.

           TWO ARMS slice into frame, straining-- and then out again--

           INT. MCNAMEE APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NEW YORK, NY - NIGHT

                                 STEVE LEVY (ON TV)
                        I’m glad somebody is so optimistic.

           Brian McNamee, ten seasons younger, works out hard on his 
           BOWFLEX MACHINE, the nicest thing in the cramped room...

                                 BUD (ON TV)
                        I hear you loud and clear, Steve. 
                        And I hear the fans, too. We know 
                        they’re still smarting from the 
                        strike... but this is their game, 
                        and trust me... they are about to 
                        see some amazing baseball.

           Bud and Steve are BLOCKED by a spittle-covered shirt. Brian 
           looks up at EILEEN, his wife, a once-upon-a-time cheerleader.

                                 EILEEN
                        Brian... I’ve been calling you.

                                 BRIAN
                        Okay. Sorry. One more set!

           Brian keeps attacking his workout. Eileen sighs and exits.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           A SPORTS-THEMED BABY MOBILE softly plays Take Me Out to the 
           Ballgame. Brian reaches into a CRIB and cradles his SON-- A  
           loving tableau, REFLECTED by a glass-paneled BOOK SHELF, aka:

           “BRIAN’S TROPHY CASE” -- Filled with TEAM PHOTOS and AWARDS 
           that start in LITTLE LEAGUE and end at ST. JOHNS UNIVERSITY. 

           The only item not baseball related is a PLAQUE with the NYPD 
           POLICE ACADEMY SHIELD and: “BRIAN G. MCNAMEE - CLASS OF 1990”

                                 BRIAN
                        Daddy’s gonna have to clear some 
                        room here... Yes he is. Yes he is!

           Brian takes the baby’s hand and points it at this SHRINE to 
           his glory days... But as the CAMERA admires it closer...

           ...It seems to be more like a shrine to potential unfulfilled.

           INT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Brian sets his one year-old on the Formica counter beside a 
           safety-wrapped, infant-sized SYRINGE. Eileen hovers.

                        I’m worried, Bry.

                                 BRIAN
                        I know, sweetie, but honestly... it 
                        makes him feel better.

                                 EILEEN
                        I’m not talking about the shot. I’m 
                        talking about you leaving your 
                        family for seven months.

           Brian turns. Hates disappointing his wife.

                                 BRIAN
                        Six months and do you want me to call 
                        Tim and say I’m out? I will, for you. 
                        But he went out on a limb for me! I 
                        turn him down now, that’s it. Chances 
                        to be a trainer at this level -- they 
                        don’t come along more than once.

                                 EILEEN
                        You never should’ve left the force.

                                          )
                        Remember when you used to say you’d 
                        rather have me a thousand miles away 
                        in a baseball jersey than two miles 
                        away in a bullet-proof vest? Hmmm?

           Eileen hugs him. She’s trying to be strong for her husband.

                                 EILEEN
                        I’m just gonna miss you, is all. 
                        This’s what you’ve been waiting for.

                                 BRIAN
                        It’s what we’ve been waiting for. 
                        Come on... It’s better insurance, 
                        better pay, bragging rights! Now your 
                        husband’s not just some putz down at 
                        the “Y”... I’ll be a bona fide coach 
                        for a professional baseball team!

                                 EILEEN
                        I know. It’s your dream. Just... 
                        Promise me you won’t get into too 
                        much trouble with those guys.

                                 BRIAN
                        Leeny, it’s Canada! What’am I gonna

           Brian takes a condensation-covered VIAL marked “INSULIN” from 
           his pocket. He uses the fresh syringe to suck up the medicine.

                                 BRIAN
                        Come on. We’ll do it together.

           Brian turns the needle vertical, taps the plastic. GO CLOSE--

           AS HE DEPRESSES LIQUID FROM THE TIP

                                                       MATCH CUT TO:

           A FOUNTAIN, shooting water straight into the air outside...

           EXT. UNITED STATES CAPITOL - MORNING - 2008

           Two MASSIVE STAIRCASES wrap around the fountain. FOCUS ON: 

           BRIAN MCNAMEE AND JEFF NOVITZKY

           Walking up the North stairs. Brian pauses, turns to the South 
           stairwell where a SIZABLE CROWD has gathered at the base... 

           TV NEWS CREWS and SEVERAL FANS have surrounded a LARGE MAN, 
           his face angled away from us. But we recognize his backside.

           Even without his uniform, we know. This is #21.

           Brian stares at an EXCITED FAN pushing to the front of the 
           crowd holding a baseball and marker. #21 SIGNS THE BALL...

           INT. SKYDOME STADIUM FIELD - TORONTO, CANADA - MORNING - 1998

           The iconic CN TOWER and the SKYDOME HOTEL -- with its famous 
           rooms overlooking the field -- are both visible as we reveal: 

           JOSÉ CANSECO (#33), a beast of muscles, slugging it out at 
           home plate. A few players have gathered behind the BACKSTOP--

                                 JOSÉ
                        Fuck. Yeah!

           Brian STEPS OUT from behind the players to get a better look. 
           José quickly notices the one guy not in a BLUE JAYS UNIFORM:

                                 JOSÉ (CONT’D)
                        You here for an autograph, pal?

                        McNamee. I’m the new strength and 
                        conditioning coach.

                                 JOSÉ
                        No shit?

           José signals for a pitch and LAUNCHES IT deep to right field.

                                 JOSÉ (CONT’D)
                        Don’t think I’m gonna need you.

           The players laugh, causing Brian to turn red just as--

           A $4000 ROLEX DATEJUST wraps around Brian’s shoulder. TIM 
           MCCLEARY is only thirty and already assistant General Manager. 
           A younger Tim stood next to Brian in those old TROPHY PHOTOS.

           Tim gestures to the EXECUTIVE OFFICES up by the Press Box.

           Brian looks puzzled. Tim quickly smiles, pivoting...

                                 TIM
                        Brian’s the most ruthless trainer 
                        I’ve ever met. A dictator in the 
                        gym. Plus, he’s a miracle worker for 
                        shoulder injuries.

           Tim spins his rotator cuff, winking at Brian.

                                 JOSÉ
                        Right. That’s what you said about 
                        the last five guys.

           José fouls a ball near TWO HOT WOMEN in the bleachers then 
           points his bat a la Babe Ruth at the waving women...

                                 JOSÉ (CONT’D)
                        I’m gonna go fuck those chicks. 

           José adjusts his junk, drops his bat and struts off.

                        when he missed two. You wanna know

           INT. TIM MCCLEARY’S OFFICE - DAY

           Brian is staring in complete surprise at Tim:

                                 BRIAN
                        Roger... Clemens? You want me to fix

                        I didn’t say that. I want you to 
                        work with Roger Clemens.

                                 BRIAN
                        I don’t understand. Didn’t he win 
                        the Cy Young last season?

                                 TIM
                        That was last season. He was only 
                        thirty-five last season.

           The implication hangs in the air...

                                 BRIAN
                        How many years does he have left on 
                        his contract?

           Tim gets up from his desk, looks out the window at all those 
           vacant bleachers. The weight of those tickets a reminder.

                        team is biting the bullet... the 
                        strike fucked us. We gotta do 
                        whatever we can to get the fans back 
                        in the seats and surprisingly, free 
                        hat night isn’t cutting it.

                        And the five trainers before me

                                 TIM
                        Those were five guys from inside the 
                        box. Five guys who followed the 
                        rulebook. Now it's time to try 
                        somebody who's never even read it.
                        Jesus, Mac... I can’t believe I have

                        You don’t have to sell me, Tim. I 
                        just don’t want to let you down.

                                 TIM
                        Listen. I know how close you came to 
                        being one of them... instead of one of 
                        us. But as good as you were at the 
                        game, you’re an even better trainer. 
                        Now, I’m at the end of my rope-- I’m 
                        not doing you a favor, you’re doing me 
                        a favor. Because I believe if the

                        up to work, he just may be what this

                        Ten starts. That’s it. This is the 
                        greatest show on earth, Brian. Get 
                        the Rocket to ten starts... and 
                        you’ll finally be inside the tent.

           A propped-open door reveals two giant METAL WHIRLPOOL TUBS. 
           One is steaming hot. The other is filled to the top with ICE.

                                 TUPAC (V.O.)

           An ICE MACHINE rattles by the wall under a blasting BOOMBOX 
           playing “How Do U Want It” by TUPAC. Brian steps over and...

           Clicks the song off. Peace and quiet. Brian dips a hand into 
           the icy tub, staring at his REFLECTION... psyching himself up:

                                 BRIAN
                        Don’t screw this up, Bry. No going 
                        back. You got this.

           Without warning, he just DUNKS HIS FACE INTO...

           THE ICE BATH

           Brian, eyes closed, SCREAMS into the blue field of cubes...

                        FUUUUUCCCCKKKKK!!!

           He opens his eyes and finds... A FACE GLARING UP AT HIM.

           Brian whips his head from the water in shock, STUMBLING over 
           the wet floor... tripping on a STEP-STOOL and knocking his 
           head into the rumbling ice machine. His eyes flutter open on--

           A JOCKSTRAP

                                 JOCKSTRAP
                        You gonna look me in the junk or you 
                        gonna look me in the eye?

           Brian pulls it together. Looks up to see the FACE OF #21...

           ROGER “THE ROCKET” CLEMENS

           All Texan. All swagger. All or nothin’. Big as a brick wall, 
           his square features are topped by a dripping crew cut. But 
           he’s also showing off an unfashionably excess twenty-five lbs.

           Roger calmly extends his open RIGHT HAND -- a lethal 
           weapon -- down to Brian. Brian is star struck by the hand.

                                 ROGER (CONT’D)
                        I have graciously extended my 
                        pitching arm. You gonna take it?

           Brian snaps out of it, grabs Roger’s hand and stands up.

           Six desks, culled together in a corner. Brian habitually 
           CLICKS A PEN, deep in thought over a clutter of charts. 
           Another TRAINER, old and easily annoyed, stares him down...

           Brian stops clicking. He grabs a folder: “CLEMENS X-RAYS”. He 
           flips through the film... when a WHISTLE distracts him--

           He approaches Roger, gently feeling along his spine.

                                 ROGER (CONT’D)
                        I’m diggin’ the foreplay darlin’.

           Brian’s hands stop near the towel. He double-checks the X-ray 
           and with every ounce of his weight digs into Roger-- Crack!!!

                                 ROGER (CONT’D)
                        What the fuck?

           Roger flips over... Brian??? He springs up from the table...

                                 ROGER (CONT’D)
                        You are one dead son-of-a-bitch!

                                 BRIAN
                        Roger. Please.

                                 ROGER
                        I don’t know what they’re payin’ you 
                        to fuck with me, but I’m about to 
                        show ‘ya it wasn’t worth it.

           Cornered against the wall, Brian holds up the X-ray.

                                 BRIAN
                        Your arm, Roger! Just tell me how 
                        your arm feels... Then lose your 
                        shit. Please!

           Beat. Roger wiggles... Eyes locked on Brian. And...

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                        It feels better, doesn’t it? I’ve 
                        looked at your charts. Your shoulder 
                        isn’t the problem. It’s your back. 
                        It’s your spine. And that I can fix.
                        I can make you the Rocket again!

           Roger could go either way. A long pause before...

                                 ROGER
                        Come with me.

           INT. TUB ROOM - LATER

           Roger flips off the faucet for the large ice bath.

                                 ROGER
                        Take off your clothes.

                                 BRIAN
                        What?

                                 ROGER
                        You heard me. Take ’em off!

           He grabs a SCOOPER from the ice machine and furiously shovels 
           ice into the tub. Brian doesn’t move.

                                 ROGER (CONT’D)
                        This ain’t no queer shit. Get down 
                        to your skivvies ‘cause here’s the 
                        deal: You wanna work with me, you 
                        best prove you got a tough son-of-a-
                        bitch buried somewhere inside that 
                        soft pussy of yours.

           Roger stops shoveling. Looks up. Brian only has one choice. 

           So he takes off his shirt.

           INT. TUB ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Tupac blasts on the boombox. The two men face across from 
           each other, naked in the tub. Brian SHIVERS. Roger MAD-DOGS.

                                                            CUT TO:

           Ballad “One More Try” replaces the gangster rap. Minutes have 
           passed. Roger hasn’t moved. Brian is turning pale.

                                                            CUT TO:

           “Gone Away” by The Offspring fills the room. Brian shakes 
           violently. Roger loves every moment. He starts clapping.

                        fuckin’ shit!? Woooooooo!

           Brian can take no more, HURLING himself out of the tub. As he 
           convulses on the floor, Roger CHEERS. Brian passed the test...

                                 ROGER (CONT’D)
                        Hell! We may be friends after all.

                                                        HARD CUT TO:

           CLOSE ON -- Brian, remembering that day, the beginning, here--

           INT. CONGRESSIONAL HEARING ROOM - MORNING - 2008

           --At the end. He’s seated behind a microphone at a WITNESS 
           TABLE. The full OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE -- over two dozen reps -- 
           has shown up, making small talk at their dais, waiting for...

           The star attraction. All eyes turn as oxygen leaves the room:

           FOR ROGER CLEMENS. Forty-six years old now. The C-SPAN 
           CAMERAS lock onto his entourage of FAMILY and LAWYERS...

           “The Rocket” makes his way down the aisle, shaking hands, 
           slapping backs. But never once so much as looking at Brian.

           INT. BAR - TORONTO - NIGHT - 1998

           Patrons play pool and drink like Canadians. At the bar, Roger 
           catches Brian staring at the SEXY BARTENDER’S cleavage...

                                 ROGER
                        Guess you can feel your pecker again?

           Brian laughs. Pleased to see a more genial, accessible Roger.

                                 ROGER (CONT’D)
                        They sent a few trainers my way this 
                        spring. Tim tell ‘ya that?

                                 BRIAN
                        Yeah.

                                 ROGER
                        None of ‘em got in the damn tub 
                        though, you crazy motherfucker!

           He takes a big swig, finishes his beer. Motions for another. 
           Brian nurses his Bud Light. He glances at a muted T.V. with...

           SPORTSCENTER: Steve Levy interviews MARK MCGWIRE (#25). His 
           muscles grow on muscles in places muscles shouldn’t grow.

                        No doubt about it. He’s juicing.

                                 ROGER
                        Shit man. They all are.

           Sexy Bartender delivers shots of whiskey with Roger’s beer.

                        On the house.

                                 ROGER
                        Thank you, dear. Would you do us a 
                        favor and turn this showboatin’

                        Of course.

           Roger picks up his shot of whiskey. A TOAST...

           A GAVEL pounding us to order...

           INT. CONGRESSIONAL HEARING ROOM - MORNING - 2008

           Brian and Roger sit side-by-side at the WITNESS TABLE, just 
           like at the bar. Except no smiles here. Now, they are ENEMIES.

           Committee Chairman HENRY WAXMAN (D-CA) presides. He has an 
           upturned nose and Groucho Marx eyebrows.

                                 CHAIRMAN WAXMAN (CONT’D)
                        The House Oversight Committee is 
                        hereby called to order. This is a 
                        hearing on Senator Mitchell’s recent 
                        report investigating illegal use of 
                        steroids and other performance-
                        enhancing substances in Major League 
                        Baseball.

           Waxman lifts up a 409-page copy of THE MITCHELL REPORT.

                                                             (CONTINUED)
           CONTINUED:

                                 CHAIRMAN WAXMAN
                        The former Senator’s report is 
                        impressive and credible. He concluded 
                        that the use of steroids was 
                        pervasive for more than a decade, and 
                        that everyone in the game -- the 
                        players, the union, the owners, and 
                        the Commissioner himself -- were 
                        responsible for this... scandal.

           In the front row of the gallery, attorney RUSTY HARDIN smooths 
           his toupee beside DEBBIE CLEMENS (46) and her children. 

           Behind a stoic Brian, Jeff Novitzky takes careful notes. 
           Nobody from Brian’s family is present to support him.

                                 CHAIRMAN WAXMAN (CONT’D)
                        Today, however, the committee's 
                        inquiry will be narrowly focused on 
                        major accusations made by Mr. Brian 
                        McNamee against Mr. Roger Clemens...

           INT. BAR - TORONTO - NIGHT - 1998

           Brian and Roger, a little drunk, play BILLIARDS. Brian racks 
           ‘em up and Roger takes the break shot-- ALL PLAYED UNDER...

                                 CHAIRMAN WAXMAN (V.O.)
                        Now, all of us have memory lapses. But 
                        it is exceptionally rare, especially 
                        in this house, to face the situation 
                        we find ourselves in this morning...

           Roger pockets a few. Brian pockets a few. More drinks go down. 

                                 HENRY WAXMAN (V.O.) (CONT’D)
                        Because both Mr. Clemens and Mr. 
                        McNamee insist the other is lying.

           Roger makes an amazing bank shot but the EIGHT BALL stops 
           just shy of the corner pocket. Roger can’t believe it...

                                 HENRY WAXMAN (V.O.)
                        These two men do not disagree on a 
                        mere phone call or meeting. They 
                        disagree on whether -- over a period 
                        of 4 years -- Mr. McNamee repeatedly 
                        injected Mr. Clemens with steroids 
                        and human growth hormone.

           Brian cues up... and though the shot couldn’t be easier... he 
           (purposefully?) SCRATCHES. Roger strides forward -- pleased -- 
           and quickly pockets the win. Brian gives him a HIGH FIVE...
           INT. CONGRESSIONAL HEARING ROOM - RESUME - 2008

           ...SLAPPING US BACK TO -- McNamee and Clemens scowling at the 
           witness table. Refusing so much as to look at each other...

                                 HENRY WAXMAN (CONT’D)
                        It is impossible to believe that this 
                        is a simple misunderstanding.

                        your life? No more booze.

           Before Roger can respond, a HAND snakes between his parted 
           legs, GRABBING HIS CROTCH. Another hand covers his eyes.

                                 ROGER
                        Karen...? Tammy-Lynn?

           The hand SQUEEZES Roger’s balls.

                                 ROGER (CONT’D)
                        Shit almighty!!

           He spins to find the hand’s tipsy owner: MINDY MCCREADY (22). 
           A damaged curly-haired beauty and country music megastar...

                                 MINDY
                        Somebody told me the Rocket was 
                        here. I just had to feel for myself!

                                 ROGER
                        I didn’t know you were in town!

                                 MINDY
                        Canadians like country music too.

                                 ROGER

                                             )
                        Ah, damn, be careful next time. 
                        You know the Rocket can’t take off 
                        if you’re breakin’ its thrusters.

                                 MINDY
                        They don’t feel broken to me.

           CONTINUED:

           Mindy grabs his crotch again, pulling him in for a DEEP KISS. 
           Brian awkwardly watches until they break apart...

                                 MINDY (CONT’D)
                        Who’s your boyfriend?

                                 ROGER
                        New trainer. Brian McNamee. He’s a 
                        stern fuck! Says this’s my last beer!

                                 MINDY
                        Hey, Brian. I’m Mindy.

                                 BRIAN
                        Holy shit my wife loves you, Ms. 
                        McCready! She has both your CD’s.

                                 MINDY
                        Ain’t that sweet. Now I feel bad-- 
                        but if it’s Rocket’s last night to 
                        have fun... he’s comin’ with me.

           Mindy grabs Roger’s shirt (thankfully) and drags him toward 
           the door. Roger laughs, yells to the Sexy Bartender...

                                 ROGER
                        Hey barkeep! Whaddaya say you let my 
                        friend show you how they do things 
                        in New York City! No one’s lookin’!

           The Bartender stops wiping. She gives a “why not” shrug.

                                 BRIAN
                        I have a wife.

           She nods. Back to cleaning as Brian thinks about her tits.

           INT. AIR CANADA 737 - FIRST CLASS CABIN - MORNING

           Brian follows Roger onto the plane. He glances at his ticket:

           SEAT 1B. He watches Roger drop into a window seat, then takes 
           the aisle beside him... realizing he’s now flying FIRST CLASS.

           A STEWARDESS appears with a silver tray of CHAMPAGNE as...

           A PHONE RINGS IN PRE-LAP. We hear it answered OVER OUR SCENE:

                                 EILEEN (PRE-LAP)
                        ...Brian? Is that you?

           Roger reaches over and grabs a FLUTE, setting it on his 
           armrest. Brian immediately returns it to the stewardess.

                                                             (CONTINUED)

                        I am right now!

           Roger gives Brian a fuck you look. He takes out a RIO 
           PMP3000, a boxy mp3 player, and throws on headphones.

                                 EILEEN (PRE-LAP)

           INT. AIR CANADA 737 - IN FLIGHT

           Roger is asleep. Brian is talking into one of those pay-by-
           credit-card AIRPLANE PHONES built into the seat.

                                 BRIAN (INTO PHONE)
                        No... I didn’t mean to get your 
                        hopes up. I’m on a plane... I’m 
                        calling you from the first class 
                        cabin thirty-five thousand feet up!

           Brian can hear her sigh in disappointment.

                        I’m not with the team. I’m with

                        Yeah. It’s... the job’s a little 
                        different than I thought. But hey... 
                        you’ll never guess who I met the 
                        other night!

           In the next seat, Roger begins to stir at the noise.

           Brian stammers, realizing he’s broken some unspoken rule.

                                 BRIAN
                        Um... She, uh, she’s dating one of 
                        the outfielders, I think. Can’t

           Brian hangs up. Roger doesn’t say a word. He just puts his 
           headphones on and goes back to sleep...

           ...We’ll see about that.

           EXT. CLEMENS ESTATE - HOUSTON, TX - AFTERNOON - 1998

           A LIMOUSINE enters the circular drive of Roger’s home, a red 
           brick 15,000 SQUARE-FOOT FUCK-OFF MANSION with the works.

           Roger exits the limo, followed by Brian, his jaw HITTING THE 
           FLOOR at the house’s size. Roger lives for these moments:

                        Yeah. I do alright.

           They head through the giant columns that mark the entryway. 
           Roger grabs for the front doorknob then STOPS--

                                 ROGER (CONT’D)
                        Damn. Almost forgot.

           He reaches into his shirt pocket and pulls out his WEDDING 
           RING, which he does not wear while quote-unquote “pitching.”

           INT. ENTRY WAY - CONTINUOUS

           The black marble entrance leads to dual staircases. Hanging 
           above the foyer is an enormous painted FAMILY PORTRAIT of 
           Roger, his beautiful wife Debbie and their FOUR SMILING BOYS.

                                 ROGER
                        Anybody home?

           A LABRADOR storms downstairs, jumping up onto Roger.

                                 ROGER (CONT’D)
                        Easy there, Cy!

                        Well. Consider it your home away 
                        from home now. Mi casa es tu casa.

           OFF BRIAN -- His entire apartment could fit in this foyer...

           INT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           The only part of the house anyone would dare call modest. A 
           MAID cuts mango as Roger leads Brian on a tour.

                                 ROGER
                        This is the kitchen. And this is

              He pulls back a beige curtain to reveal a HOME MOVIE THEATER. 
              Big screen projector. Theater seats. Even a popcorn machine.

              INT. TROPHY ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

              The wood-paneled room is filled with a MUSEUM’S WORTH of 
              memorabilia, awards and photos of Roger with fellow legends. 
              Brian gapes... This is a far, far cry from his trophy case.

              Roger points to a framed SPORTS ILLUSTRATED cover of himself 
              in a Red Sox jersey under a headline: “LORD OF THE K’S”

                       game. Can you believe that? Only one 
                       other gunslinger done it since.

           loves taking in his many, many accomplishments. He notices--

           Brian is staring above the fireplace at four CY YOUNG AWARDS. 
           1986, 1987, 1991, 1997. Different years but all etched with:

                        else when Cooperstown takes it all.

                                 BRIAN
                        You’d give all of these to the Hall 
                        of Fame?

                                 ROGER
                        Yeah, they always want the 
                        memorabilia. For history’s sake. 
                        Heck, they can have the three I got 
                        in Boston right now.

           Brian laughs. Roger does not.

           A MICROPHONE is the only thing in focus until Brian leans in.

                                 BRIAN
                        Thank you, Chairman Waxman and--

                        Mr. McNamee, there’s a button on the 
                        bottom of the mic you need to push.

           Brian looks down, sees the button and starts over:

                        Thank you, Chairman Waxman and other 
                        members of the committee. My name is 
                        Brian Gerard McNamee, and I was once 
                        the personal trainer for one of the 
                        finest pitchers in the history of 
                        baseball, Roger William Clemens.

                        I am not proud to testify against a 
                        man I once hugely admired. To those 
                        who suggest that I take some 
                        personal satisfaction in bringing 
                        down the great Roger Clemens... let 
                        me assure you. I absolutely do not.

           EXT. CLEMENS ESTATE - BACK YARD - DAY - 1998

           MOS: Roger points out his LAVISH POOL and BBQ to Brian.

                                 BRIAN (V.O.)
                        I am only here because what I did was 
                        wrong. And make no mistake -- For 
                        that, I am truly and deeply sorry.

           And with the far-off click of the microphone we can now hear:

                                 ROGER
                        --And that’s the music studio. Just 
                        got me a guitar signed by Eric 
                        Clapton. And there’s the tree fort, 
                        for the boys. Built it myself. Also, 
                        guest house, where you’ll be layin’ 
                        your head. But now we come to the 
                        pièce de résistance!

           They’ve reached a long, squat building. The only thing not 
           made of brick. Roger keys a code into a lock and leans inside 
           the door, flipping a series of light switches, ILLUMINATING:

           INT. ROGER’S HOME GYM - CONTINUOUS

           A BASKETBALL COURT, near regulation size, stamped with the 
           TEXAS LONGHORNS EMBLEM. By its sideline...

           A CAGED PITCHING MOUND with a MURAL -- unfinished by design -- 
           of Roger morphing through the UNIFORMS of his career...

           A FULLY LOADED WORKOUT CENTER with several high-end TVs...
           This is not some home gym. This is a world class facility.

                                 ROGER
                        Will this work for ‘ya?

           Oh, this will definitely work for Brian. Suddenly--

           Roger spins... sees Debbie Clemens emerge from the main house.

                                 ROGER
                        Damn. Sorry buddy. We’ll get to the 
                        exercising after I get in my workout.

           Roger winks, then bounds back outside. Brian watches Roger 
           kiss his wife, then toss her over his shoulder like a caveman.

           CLOSE ON -- BRIAN, clearly enamored. Roger has it all. Wealth. 
           A beautiful wife. A beautiful mistress. And this fucking gym.

                                              PRE-LAP LOUD GRUNTING:

           INT. ROGER’S HOME GYM - THIRTY MINUTES LATER

           Roger is bench-pressing. And grunting. He powers through the 
           last rep. Brian guides the bar back onto the rack. Then--

                                 BRIAN
                        On the ground!

                                 ROGER
                        Hang on. Gimme a minute. Then we’ll 
                        toss another plate on.

                                 BRIAN
                        No more plates. No minute. Hit the 
                        deck. Now.

           For the first time, Brian is in his element. Military intense. 
           Doesn’t care who he’s pleasing-- not when he’s in the gym.

                                 BRIAN (CONT’D)
                        This is the program! Let’s go! Now,

           INT. CONGRESSIONAL HEARING ROOM - MORNING - 2008

           Chairman Waxman has the honor of first questions.

                                 CHAIRMAN WAXMAN
                        Now, Mr. McNamee. Roger Clemens was 
                        at this point considered to be -- and 
                        this was a widely used designation -- 
                        the “hardest working man in throw 
                        business.” Did you see proof of that?

                                 BRIAN
                        What do you mean?

                        What shape was Mr. Clemens in when 
                        you began working with him?

           Roger gulps air, then assumes sit-up position. Brian hands him 
           a weighted ball. Every time Roger sits up, Brian pushes down.

                                 ROGER

                        year old Roger needs to explore 
                        alternative methods. It’s gonna come 
                        from the core. That’s what I was--

                        Yes, that’s what I said.

                                 CHAIRMAN WAXMAN
                        That was a bold statement, Mr. 
                        McNamee, considering what you just 
                        told us about Roger’s physical 
                        state. What made you make it?

                                 BRIAN
                        I saw that Roger still had the drive 
                        and determination. I saw that he 
                        still had the potential.

                        You didn’t see the opportunity to,

                        See, I know you didn’t want to 
                        disappoint certain individuals in the 
                        Blue Jays organization -- Did you see 
                        the potential at this early stage for 
                        introducing the idea of steroids?

           cross under a white dome, like the top of a ROCKET SILO... 

           WHOOSH! A baseball flashes past into a catcher’s glove. The 
           RADAR GUN built into Roger’s pitching mound reads: 85MPH.

           ...as the silo-like SKYDOME STADIUM rumbles OPEN...

           Roger’s feet pound a treadmill. Brian ups the speed.

           ...the dome retracts to reveal a BASEBALL FIELD...

           Roger, on his indoor mound, pitches to Brian: 87MPH.

           ...31 stories down four uniformed CARETAKERS rake the dirt...

           Roger and Brian on the ground do military push-ups.

           ...then use a CHALK MARKER to line the infield...

           Roger pitches a training fastball. Still 87MPH. He angrily 
           throws his glove against the indoor netting. Brian thinks.

           Brian has now taped TIM MCCLEARY’S FACE to the mannequin.

           ...Spectators find their seats on this spring day...

           Pull-up time. For every Roger count, Brian does three.

           ...in the LOCKER ROOM Roger buttons his jersey. He has heavily 
           trimmed down. He turns his back and there it is... the #21...

           Finding psycho-strength, Roger matches Brian’s pull-up pace.

           ...as Roger runs out of the DUGOUT with the rest of his team...

           Brian and Roger jog together around downtown Toronto.

           ...and then Roger takes the MOUND at Skydome...

           Rapid rotation: Sit-up, push-up, pull-up, knee-high, sprint. 

           ...The Umpire brushes dirt from home plate. And we SLOW DOWN:

           As THE ROCKET rears back... 40,000 FANS hold their breath. The 
           ball explodes out of his hand and 430 milliseconds later...

           DECAPITATES THE BATTER... WHIP PAN TO A RADAR GUN: 101MPH.

           Roger smiles and we reveal we’re actually back at his HOME 
           PITCHING MOUND. Brian takes off his catcher’s mask and 
           examines the mannequin. Tim McCleary’s head hangs upside-down.

                        seeing improvement game-to-game.

           ON THE TV: A SHOT OF BRIAN standing near Roger. Watching him.

           The way he’s smiling reminds Eileen of something. She glances 
           at a WEDDING PHOTO of her and Brian in newly wedded bliss.

           Eileen turns to the TV. Brian has the same look in his eyes.

           INT. PLAYER’S LOCKER ROOM - AFTER A GAME

           The team celebrates their win. Roger gets his fair share of 
           congratulatory ass-slaps when someone pops CHAMPAGNE...

           IT’S BRIAN! He hands the bottle to Roger, nodding permission. 
           Roger laughs, smiles and takes a big, Texas-sized drink.

           INT. PLAYERS GYM - TRAINER’S OFFICE - LATER

           Brian steps into the darkened gym to grab his things. On his 
           desk is a GREEN BOX with a crown logo. He opens it to find...

           A $4000 ROLEX DATEJUST. And a note, on Blue Jays stationary:

           up and scratched, it hasn’t left his wrist in ten years...

           INT. CONGRESSIONAL HEARING ROOM - DAY - 2008

           Rep. TIM DAVIS (R-VA) is taking his turn questioning Brian.

                                 CONGRESSMAN DAVIS
                        I want to start off my questioning 
                        by asking you about this party 
                        mentioned in the Mitchell Report on 
                        or about June 8th through the 10th

                                 BRIAN
                        It was June 9th.

                                 CONGRESSMAN DAVIS
                        You remember this party?

                        instance, which we’ll get to, this 
                        particular party was ten years ago--

                                 BRIAN
                        I remember the party.

                                 CONGRESSMAN DAVIS
                        How do you have such a clear and vivid 
                        recollection of a ten year old party?

                                 BRIAN
                        For many reasons. I hadn’t been to 
                        many parties like it.

                                 CONGRESSMAN DAVIS

           A BIKINI TOP bursting with new and impressive FAKE BREASTS.

                        Touch them!

           INT. CANSECO’S MIAMI MANSION - KITCHEN - AFTERNOON - 1998

           The fake breasts belong to JESSICA CANSECO (26), who talks to 
           Debbie Clemens (36 here, also in a bikini, also augmented). 
           Mrs. Clemens reaches out and feels Jessica’s DD-breasts.

                        Gosh. They’ve come a long way since 
                        I had mine done.

                                 JESSICA 
                        But yours look great!

                                 DEBBIE
                        I worry, though. Did you see the 
                        piece on 60 Minutes about them 
                        leaking? There’s a lawsuit.

                                 JESSICA
                        Wouldn’t the stuff just come out 
                        your nipples?

                        Sweetie, that’s not how it works.

           Brian opens up the sliding glass door and quietly enters...

           Jessica removes her bikini top, letting her breasts POP OUT.

                        They went in through my belly 
                        button! So I can still model.

           Brian accidentally drops a SODA CAN, drawing their attention. 
           Jessica quickly covers her breasts and scowls at Brian...

           INT. CONGRESSIONAL HEARING ROOM - MORNING - 2008

           Congressman Davis scowls at Brian too.

                        I want this to be very clear. Debbie 
                        Clemens was at the party? Who else?

                                 BRIAN
                        About thirty or forty people.

                        I meant from the Clemens family.

                                 BRIAN
                        Everyone. Roger, his wife, his nanny 
                        and his children.

           ...and splashes spectacularly into José’s pool, tucked behind 
           a Spanish-style Hacienda on the 18th-hole of a GOLF COURSE.

           We now get a good look at the party. Blue Jay players mingle 
           with their WAGs as José plays grill master. No Roger in sight.

                        Lily! Tell Brian to throw me!

           Sexy nanny LILY STRAIN (22) gives a thumbs up. Returns to her 
           PEOPLE MAGAZINE with “Phil Hartman (1948-1998)” on the cover.

           Lily sees the kid soar. Nod of approval. Back to the magazine. 

           Brian triumphantly walks to his chair. A PAGER on his towel 
           flashes. He puts his glasses on to see: “EILEEN 212-457-0599”

                        Ha, yeah. This thing’s pretty ancient.

           Debbie sits in the lounge chair next to Brian. Waits a beat.

           Brian cautiously screeeeeches his chair to hers. The noise--

           Draws José’s attention. Not pleased at Brian being so intimate 
           with Roger’s wife. He glares at Brian rubbing Debbie’s back...

                        My cellphone. You can grab it so you 
                        don’t have to go all the way inside 
                        to answer your page.

                                 BRIAN
                        Oh. Thank you.

           Brian grabs her phone, notices his WEDDING RING is now covered 
           in sunscreen. Debbie takes over, lotioning her legs... 

                                 DEBBIE
                        You know, I hear Rog’ talking about 
                        ‘ya a lot. I mean half the time he’s 
                        cursin’ your name for makin’ him so 
                        damn sore, but once in a while he’ll 
                        tell Koby and the boys...
                            doing her best Roger

                        “Uncle Brian wouldn’t want ‘ya to 
                        eat that ice cream. Hell, Uncle 
                        Brian wouldn’t want the Rocket to 
                        eat that ice cream.”

           Brian is touched. He forgets about dialing Eileen when--

           A GOLF CART careens around the corner, barely on four wheels. 

                                 BENITO (THE PASSENGER)
                        Vaya más despacio!! Slow down!!

           Roger drives with a big smirk. He skiiids to a stop... 

           Catcher BENITO SANTIAGO (#18) jumps out, kissing the ground.

                                 ROGER
                        Oh, quit ‘yer bellyachin’.

           Roger saunters into the party like Don Johnson. Koby runs 
           over to hug him, getting Roger’s khakis soaking wet.

                                 KOBY

           Roger looks to Brian. Chair very close to his wife’s.

                                 ROGER
                        Four-hundred? Oh yeah? Well lemme

                        compared to a thousand feet!!

           Roger slings his son a “thousand” feet in the air. A gleeful 
           scream all the way down... CAMERA FOLLOWS KOBY...

                                                         UNDERWATER:

           AS BUBBLES obscure our view, we rise out of the water into--

           EXT. JOSÉ CANSECO’S JACUZZI - EVENING

           Blue Jays SHAWN GREEN (#15) and SHANNON STEWART (#24) soak 
           with Roger, José and Brian. SportsCenter plays behind them in 
           José’s GAME ROOM, visible through a MASSIVE WINDOW...

                        say it was fucking delicious?

           Now that it’s just the men, José chomps away on a stogie.

                                 JOSÉ
                        I don’t want you to tell me it was 
                        delicious. I want you to tell me it 
                        was fucking fantastic barbecue.

                        You know we can’t do that, amigo. 
                        What I can tell ‘ya is that here, in 
                        America, a barbecue's gotta have 
                        burgers. It’s gotta have hot dogs. 
                        Coleslaw. And some goddamn beans!

                        We had beans, bro! You put’m on your 
                        tacos!

           Everyone loses it, laughing. Brian chuckles, still unsure how 
           much he’s allowed to contribute to the conversation.

                                 YOUNG BOY (O.S.)

           Alex holds out a baseball and a sharpie. Barely audible...

           Roger lights up. Hops out of the water to grant a boy’s wish.

                        from you, Canseco!

           José mimes a dagger to the heart. Interrupted by a BEEPING...

                                 JOSÉ
                        Something’s beeping. What the fuck 
                        is beeping?

           Brian realizes it’s his pager beeping. José rolls his eyes.

                                 JOSÉ (CONT’D)
                        Man, that shit’s embarrassing. Rocket,

           INT. CONGRESSIONAL HEARING ROOM - MORNING - 2008

           Rep. Davis reads a passage from the Mitchell Report:

                                 CONGRESSMAN DAVIS
                        McNamee stated that after the party, 
                        and now I’m quoting... “he observed 
                        Clemens and Canseco convene inside 
                        the house. Canseco told members of my 
                        investigative staff” --This is, 
                        again, from Senator Mitchell-- “That 
                        he had numerous conversations with 
                        Clemens about Deca-Durabolin and 
                        Winstrol and how to cycle and how to 
                        stack steroids.” Do you believe that 
                        is what they were discussing?

                                 BRIAN
                        I was not present for the 
                        conversation... but yes, I do.

                                 CONGRESSMAN DAVIS
                        Mr. Clemens. Exactly, what did you 
                        and Mr. Canseco discuss at the party?

                        You don’t know or you don’t remember?

                        Let me ask a-- wait, you were not at 
                        this -- you weren’t at this party?

                                 ROGER
                        That’s correct.

           Davis tries to regroup. Before he can--

                                 CHAIRMAN WAXMAN
                        Congressman Davis, your time has 
                        expired. Congresswoman Norton, you 
                        have fifteen minutes.

           ELEANOR HOLMES NORTON (D-WASHINGTON, D.C.) leans forward.

                                 CONGRESSWOMAN NORTON
                        I will actually yield five minutes 
                        back to Congressman Davis. I want to 
                        hear the end to his line of 
                        questioning.

                                 CONGRESSMAN DAVIS
                        Thank you. Mr. Clemens. You claim 
                        you were not at this party. Have you 
                        ever been to José Canseco’s house?

                                 ROGER
                        I may have. I certainly was not at 
                        any Blue Jay party. I may have been 
                        at-- I know I played golf at the 
                        Westin, the golf course. It’s down in 
                        that area. But no party. And Mr. 
                        McNamee says I had talked about 
                        these... steroids? Honestly, couldn’t 
                        tell ‘ya the first thing about ’em.

           Roger’s lawyer, Rusty, is starting to look concerned...

                                 CONGRESSMAN DAVIS
                        A young man by the name of Alex 
                        Lowrey, Mr. Canseco’s former 
                        neighbor, testified that he received 
                        an autograph from you at Mr.

                        count the stars.

           Laughter from the crowd. Roger turns, shrugging his shoulders. 
           Rusty Hardin has had enough. He calls out from his seat--

                                 RUSTY
                        Come on, Mr. Chairman. The kid was 
                        ten years old. I think we can all 
                        acknowledge the likelihood that 
                        young Mr. Lowrey may have his dates 
                        and locations a little mixed up.

                                 CHAIRMAN WAXMAN
                        Mr. Hardin. The rules of this 
                        committee provide that counsel may 
                        advise their clients but not speak 
                        directly to the hearing itself.

           Admonished, Rusty leans over and speaks softly to Roger. Beat.

                                 ROGER
                        ...My attorney has informed me that

                        However, in an effort to clear this 
                        up... Mr. McNamee informed us of a 
                        key impartial witness who we hoped 
                        would be able to answer whether or 
                        not you were at this party... and 
                        that witness is your former nanny.

                        Last week we asked your attorney for 
                        her name, which I will refrain from 
                        saying here for purposes of privacy.

                        Unfortunately for all of us, she 
                        claims not to remember the party.

                                 CONGRESSMAN DAVIS
                        In fact, I personally spoke to her 
                        just yesterday and... Mr. Clemens, 
                        can you tell me the last time you 
                        spoke to your former nanny?

                                 ROGER
                        We’ve had a few nannies, so...

                                 CONGRESSMAN DAVIS
                        The one who worked for you in 1998.

                                 ROGER
                        Well, I believe Lily stopped working 
                        for us in ‘99?

           Roger is clearly uncomfortable. He licks his lips.

                                 CONGRESSMAN DAVIS
                        That’s not what I asked.

                                 ROGER
                        Can you repeat the question?

           INT. TAVERN ON THE GREEN - NEW YORK, NY - NIGHT - 1998

           In the famous CRYSTAL ROOM, Bud Selig tucks into a rib-eye 
           across from frenemy DICK EBERSOL, President of NBC Sports.

                                 DICK
                        ...You gotta be thrilled.

                                 BUD
                        I’m thrilled with the ratings, Dick. 
                        And I hope you remember how thrilled 
                        we both are during our contract 
                        renewal talks.

           CONTINUED:

                                 DICK
                        I will... but you need to promise me 
                        you’ll start feeding McGwire and 
                        Sosa-- Gonna be honest, Bud, those 
                        boys could use a proper meal.

           Bud stops chewing. Looks up. Swallows the piece whole.

                                 BUD
                        What are you saying, Dick?

                                 DICK

                           (
                                                 )
                        Oh, come on, Bud! It was a joke.
                            beat; Bud doesn’t move
                        Are you seriously sitting there 
                        right now and telling me you haven’t 
                        heard the rumors?

                                 BUD
                        What rumors?

                                 DICK
                        Mark McGwire just hit his 33rd home 
                        run and he has a 110 games left to 
                        go. In 37 seasons no player has been 
                        within spitting distance of breaking 
                        Roger Maris’s record and all of a 
                        sudden - in one year - we’ve got two?
                           (

                        Doesn’t that sound a little fishy to 
                        you?

           Bud sets his fork down. For some reason, he keeps the knife.

                                 BUD
                        Dick... Is the head of NBC Sports 
                        accusing the Commissioner of 
                        Baseball of knowingly turning a 
                        blind eye to... what exactly?

                                 DICK
                        Bud, I’m not here to antagonize you. 
                        I know you know what’s going on 
                        because even the cub-reporter at the 
                        sports desk at WNBC Fucksville knows 
                        what’s going on. I couldn’t give 
                        three shits what your players are 
                        doing. As long as the ratings are 
                        high... you can give them heroin for 
                        all I care.

                                )
                        But they’re still your players.

           Bud picks up his utensils and stabs into his steak.
           EXT. TORONTO PEARSON AIRPORT - ARRIVALS GATE - EVENING

           Brian watches passengers disembark the jet-way from JFK (this 
           is pre-9/11). Eileen comes off the flight carrying Brian Jr.

                                 EILEEN
                        Hey.

                                 BRIAN
                        Hey! How was the flight?

                                 EILEEN
                        Shorter than I expected. You forget 
                        we’re coming to another country.

           There’s a distance to her hello kiss. Brian doesn’t notice it.

                                 BRIAN
                        Well I’m glad you’re both here.

           He kisses Brian Jr. on the head. The baby claps and babbles 
           something vaguely like “mama.”

                                 BRIAN (CONT’D)
                        When did he start doing that?

                                 EILEEN
                        A couple days ago. I paged you. But 
                        you didn’t respond and he stopped...

           Her indignation shows as Brian holds up a new NOKIA CELLPHONE.

                                 BRIAN
                        Surprise! I bought one for you, too.

                                 EILEEN
                        Oh, good. So now I’ll get to leave a 
                        message. 

           Brian forces a smile. Grabs Eileen’s bag.

                                 EILEEN (CONT’D)
                        When do I get to meet the infamous 
                        Rocket?

                                 BRIAN
                        Roger’s actually-- he’s busy tonight.

                                                           SLAM TO:

           INT. ROGER’S SKYDOME SUITE - NIGHT

           Mindy McCready is flung passionately against the window. 
           Roger kisses her neck as she hastily removes her top.
           INT. SKYDOME STADIUM FIELD - NIGHT 

           Brian, carrying his son, leads Eileen onto the silent field.

                                 EILEEN
                        Wow. ‘Sure is a lot nicer than the 
                        one at St. John’s.

                                 BRIAN
                        I told you. I can’t believe I get to 
                        work here. It’s -- look up -- that’s 
                        the dome part... the first fully 
                        retractable stadium dome ever built.

           Eileen studies the open dome for a requisite three seconds.

                                 EILEEN
                        It’s a nice roof.

           Brian nods. Wishes Eileen shared his enthusiasm. He glances 
           up once more... and this time spots a WINDOW at the Skydome 
           Hotel, top floor... It’s far away, but it almost looks like--

           THE SHADOW OF TWO PEOPLE HAVING SEX

                                                           BACK TO:

           Mindy’s palms are splayed hard against the window. Roger 
           enters her from behind. She moans as he bites her neck.

                                                            CUT TO:

           Brian. Gazing up. Almost as if he’s making eye contact with...

                                                            CUT TO:

           Roger fucking Mindy. But Roger’s FOCUS is on the seemingly 
           EMPTY FIELD. Like he’s making love to his two favorite things 
           with the abandon of a man who can feel them slipping away.

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:

           BRIAN’S NOKIA displays 4:04AM when it begins VIBRATING...

           INT. BRIAN’S SKYDOME ROOM - NIGHT

           ...on the nightstand. Eileen is asleep with her back to 
           Brian. A portable baby-bed with Brian Jr. is on the floor.

           Bzzz... Bzzz... Brian stirs, grabs the phone. Without glasses, 
           the CALLER ID is a blur. He brings it close: “ROGER CALLING”
           INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - LATER

           Brian quietly exits his room, wearing a hoodie. He looks left, 
           then right... spying a BELLBOY setting a familiar USA TODAY in 
           front of every door. Brian reaches down and grabs his copy:

                        “THE HOME RUN RACE: CHASING THE IMPOSSIBLE”

           Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa have become above-the-fold news.

           INT. TOP FLOOR HOTEL HALLWAY - LATER

           Brian raises his hand to knock, but the door is open a crack.

           INT. ROGER’S SKYDOME SUITE - CONTINUOUS

           Wearing sweatpants, Roger stares out at the empty field.

                                 ROGER
                        It’s all good. Come on in.

           Brian cautiously steps forward. Looks into the BEDROOM. Mindy 
           is passed out naked under the sheets.

                                 ROGER (CONT’D)
                        I wake you?

                                 BRIAN
                        Nah, I was up. Mindy okay?

                                 ROGER
                        Yeah, she’s just sleepin’ it off.

           Brian silently counts the EMPTY BEER CANS. Too many to--

                                 ROGER (CONT’D)
                        Relax. They ain’t mine. Hey... don’t 
                        you judge her. She’s got demons we 
                        can’t begin to understand.
                           (

                                )
                        I had a talk with José. Told him to 
                        back off of ‘ya.

                                 BRIAN
                        You didn’t have to do that.

                                 ROGER
                        Yes, I did. You’re a part of this 
                        team. And you are my friend.

           INT. ROGER’S SKYDOME SUITE - RESUME - 1998

           Roger nervously licks his lips.

                                 ROGER
                        I can’t believe I never asked ‘ya 
                        this... Why’d you quit the NYPD?

                                 BRIAN
                        I got tired of people telling me I 
                        look like Jimmy Smits.

                                 ROGER
                        Come on now.

                                 BRIAN
                        It was three years. Mostly doin’ 
                        paperwork. I guess-- I only joined 
                        for my Dad, really, in the first 
                        place. I think he knew how much I 
                        wanted a uniform.

                                 ROGER
                        Huh. He still a cop?

                                 BRIAN
                        True blue ‘til the day he died.

                                 ROGER
                        Well, shit. Every man should do what 
                        he loves ‘til the day he dies. That 
                        there’s the cruel side of this

                        God I love this game, Brian. With 
                        every particle of my being.

                                 BRIAN
                        I know you do.

           Brian can see Roger is in anguish. He looks around, starting 
           to worry. He spots the USA TODAY flung in the garbage as--

                                 ROGER
                        I got you somethin’. It’s over here.

           CONTINUED:

           Roger leads Brian to a LIVING ROOM AREA with a sofa. On the 
           coffee table is a pinstripe blue & white NEW YORK YANKEES CAP.

                     BRIAN
                                                    ROGER
           Roger, I...
                                            --See how it looks on ‘ya.

           Brian lifts the hat. Adjusts it, nice and snug on his head.

                                 ROGER (CONT’D)
                        It fits ‘ya. It fits ‘ya good.
                           (
                            then
                                )
                        Brian... Do you know the hardest 
                        thing to do in any sport?

                                 BRIAN
                        Yeah. Hitting a baseball.

                                 ROGER
                           (

                                )
                        Not anymore.

           Only now does Brian see what was hiding beneath the hat:

           A VIAL AND A SYRINGE

           Brian picks up the tiny bottle. Examines the label: WINSTROL.

                                 ROGER (CONT’D)
                        Before you say anything... Do you 
                        know why they outlawed the spitball?

           Practically in a daze, Brian looks up from the vial.

                                 ROGER (CONT’D)
                        See, it used to be legal to dirty the 
                        ball. You’d spit on it, maybe roll it 
                        in dirt. Then on August 16, 1920, 
                        Carl Mays threw one at Ray Chapman’s 
                        head and it killed him. Chapman 
                        didn’t even see it coming. Cracked 
                        his skull wide open. But that’s not 
                        why the league banned the spitball. 
                        No, sir. That was just their excuse. 
                        They outlawed it because it was 
                        fuckin’ hard to hit! ‘Goddamn owners 
                        “sold out to home runs.” And those 
                        ain’t even my words. They’re Ty 
                        Cobb’s. And if Ty Cobb were alive 
                        today, he’d say the exact same 
                        thing’s happening all over again.

                                 BRIAN
                        I thought we were playing it right?

           Roger comes over. Puts his hands on Brian’s shoulders.

                                 ROGER (CONT’D)
                        Far as I see it, we got two choices.

           Roger has really worked himself up... Practically panting:

                        I know I ain’t supposed to have a beer

                                                             LATER:

           Roger and Brian drink warm Miller Lights on the sofa, staring 
           at the Winstrol like it’s radioactive.

                                 BRIAN
                        You even know how to take it?

           Roger’s finger instantly appears in Brian’s face.

                                 ROGER
                        Hey. We don’t use that word. Ever. I 
                        ain’t like them. That’s not what 
                        this is about. Getting here...
                           (

                        ...is what this is about.

           Brian lets it sink in. This is a nasty rabbit hole to go down. 
           But his best friend is begging. His only friend is begging...

                        And we tell nobody.

           Roger nods with a great sigh of relief. Brian picks up the 
           syringe, much bigger than baby-sized insulin shots.

                                 BRIAN (CONT’D)

                        Let me read once more from the 
                        Mitchell Report: “That summer Clemens 
                        asked McNamee to inject him with 
                        Winstrol, which Clemens supplied. 
                        McNamee injected Clemens approximately 
                        four times in the buttocks over a 
                        several week period.”

                        So when Mr. McNamee said this to 
                        former Senator Mitchell, you are 
                        saying that Mr. McNamee lied?

                        Did Mr. McNamee ever inject you with

                                 ROGER

                        when in fact you were injected with

           they could be related -- comes down the aisle. Bud stands up.

                                 BUD (CONT’D)
                        George! How the hell are you?

           The gentleman is former U.S. SENATOR GEORGE MITCHELL (D-MA).

                                 SENATOR MITCHELL
                        Good to see you, Bud.

                                 BUD
                        This is my granddaughter, Natalie.

                                 SENATOR MITCHELL
                        Nice to meet you.

                                 BUD
                        George here was a former Senator--

                        --I recognize him, Pop Pop. We’ve 
                        talked about you, Senator Mitchell, 
                        in my political science symposium.

                                 BUD
                        Well, I was going to say George here 
                        is now on the board of the Boston Red 
                        Sox and I think seventeen other 
                        companies. How’s that treating you?

                                 SENATOR MITCHELL
                        I show up for two meetings a year. 
                        It’s not half bad.

           Derek Lowe STRIKES OUT Canseco. It’s the end of the inning.

           The Red Sox head into their dugout as the Blue Jays take the 
           field. In the middle of the pack, headed to the MOUND...

                        Blue Jays, number 21: Roger Clemens.

           The stadium SHAKES with BOOS and some less appropriate words.

                                 SENATOR MITCHELL
                        If three-hundred years of history and 
                        forty-six tons of tea has taught me 
                        anything... It’s that nobody gets

                                 SENATOR MITCHELL

           INT. FENWAY PARK - PITCHING MOUND - SAME

           Roger blows into his hand. He ignores the booing. He kicks  
           the mound -- sculpting it -- and digs his cleats in. GO TIGHT:

           ON ROGER’S FACE. Pupils laser focused on his catcher’s fist... 
           Roger shakes off the first call. Nods to the second. Primed.

           The last thing we see before Roger’s body brutally uncoils 
           forward out-of-frame... Is a giant fucking smile.

           Roger waves to someone behind the photographers-- Out steps 
           Brian, rushing into frame. Like he won the Cy Young himself. 
           In Brian’s hand is a PRIORITY MAIL ENVELOPE addressed to “Up

                        On November 17th, 1998, Mr. Clemens

                        futzing with that pen?

           Brian immediately stops clicking, embarrassed by his habit.

                                 BRIAN
                        I’m sorry.

                                 CONGRESSMAN BRALEY
                        Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

                        Mr. McNamee, would you say you played 
                        a part in Roger Clemens’ success?

                        Roger’s ability is all his own, 
                        Congressman.

                                 CONGRESSMAN BRALEY
                        So you do or do not believe you had 
                        anything to do with Mr. Clemens’

                        I believe-- As a team-- I believe I 
                        did have something to do with his 
                        turn around. Yes.

           Roger is overcome by a SNEEZE...

           The room erupts in laughter. Waxman angrily bangs his gavel.

                                 CHAIRMAN WAXMAN
                        Not here, Mr. Clemens. I won’t 
                        tolerate that in here. Mr. Braley?

           Roger throws his hands up in apology. But he’s smiling.

                                 CONGRESSMAN BRALEY
                        Mr. McNamee. In the month of May, 
                        1998, Mr. Clemens had 45 strikeouts. 
                        He had 44 in June. In July he only 
                        had a meager 35. And according--

                        ...Sir, if I may, I feel it’s 
                        important to point out that 35 
                        strikeouts is not meager.

                        Okay. Noted. The importance of these 
                        numbers is that July, the month when 
                        Mr. Clemens had his lowest statistics 
                        of the season, correlates time-wise 
                        with when you began injecting him 
                        with Winstrol. Is that correct?

                        in June. 35 strikeouts in July. And 
                        in August, his first month on

                        strikeouts did Mr. Clemens throw?

                        You have no idea, man, what this 
                        means to me. To everyone in my 
                        family. Oh man, when I sent my 
                        resignation to Tim... I wish I had

           thoughts race through his head and none are about breakfast.

              Brian smiles. She’s not lying. He pours the milk.

                                 BRIAN
                       I’m double-checking: Your ma’s pickin’ 
                       Junior up from daycare, right?

                       No, she can’t do it today. I told 
                       you she can’t do it today.

              Eileen grabs her keys. In a rush.

                                 BRIAN
                       No, it’s-- I’ll cancel Ms. Argyle.

                                 EILEEN
                       It’s fine. I’ll ask Mary.

                                 BRIAN
                       Okay.

              Eileen pecks his cheek. Brian sighs, regards the Breakfast of 
              Champions box-- MOCKING HIM with a picture of YANKEE LEADER:

              A WORLD SERIES RING sparkles on Roger’s left hand...

                                 CHAIRMAN WAXMAN
                       Mr. Clemens, which world series ring 
                       are you wearing now? 

                                 ROGER
                       They say you never forget ‘yer first 
                       time. This is from ‘99.

                                 CHAIRMAN WAXMAN
                        Obviously the team did very well. But 
                        did your personal stats change after 
                        you stopped working with Mr. McNamee?

                                 ROGER

                        When you went to the New York 
                        Yankees and won two World Series 
                        without Mr. McNamee, did your 
                        statistics -- your wins, your 
                        strikeouts -- did they go up, stay 
                        the same or did they go down?

                                 ROGER
                        They-- It’s a team sport. You know, 
                        we won. We had the best team and I 
                        did my part to win-- and, you want to 
                        talk about statistics, it’s not about 
                        that, it’s about the game, man.

                                 CHAIRMAN WAXMAN
                        Very well, Mr. Clemens.

           INT. WEST VILLAGE APARTMENT - DAY - 2001

           Brian trains MS. ARGYLE, age indeterminate due to many 
           plastic surgeries. His eyes are HYPNOTICALLY COLD... Either 
           from the mundane job, the dull repetition of her ARM RAISES--

                        Almost there. Two more, Sylvia.

           --But probably both. Ms. Argyle finishes. Brian pats her back, 
           grabbing the 5-lb. hand weights and returning them to his...

           DUFFLE BAG. Inside, he discovers his CELL PHONE (a Motorola 
           now) is vibrating. He does not recognize the 718-number:

           Eileen is trying valiantly to keep her voice down.

                        He abandoned you, Brian!! Two years

           Brian holds a paper with an address. He matches it to the 
           gold awning for “403 E 90th St.”

           INT. ROGER’S NEW YORK PENTHOUSE - LATER

           The elevator door opens straight into Roger’s fabulous

                        Welcome back, Handsome.

           Brian spins to find Debbie in her open-air KITCHEN beside a 
           BLENDER filled with fruits and vegetables. She turns it on.

           INT. DEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Brian softly opens the door on Roger playing TONY HAWK’S PRO 
           SKATER 2 split-screen on a 42-inch top-of-the-line Plasma TV.

           Challenging Roger is teammate ANDY PETTITTE (#46), a strong 
           Romanesque face and a CATHOLIC CROSS necklace. In the corner, 
           CHUCK KNOBLAUCH (#11) drinks a beer. At no time does Chuck 
           ever not look like a dick. The three form a TEXAS TRIUMVIRATE.

                                 ROGER
                        Goddamnit!

           He throws his controller on the floor as Andy’s skateboarding 
           avatar is declared the winner.

                        Just ‘cause God’s on my side don’t--

           Roger notices Brian standing in the door. He brightens:

                        --Brian fuckin’ McNamee! Get the 
                        fuck over here.

           Roger pulls Brian into a bear hug. Brian points to the game.

                                 BRIAN
                        Looks like you should stick to 
                        baseball.

           Bad joke. Brian tries to hide it with a fake laugh.

                                 ROGER
                        Fellas. This is Brian McNamee. Guy I 
                        was tellin’ you all about. Brian...

                        Nice to meet you, Brian.

           Andy stands up and offers Brian a proper handshake. Chuck 
           stays in the corner and gives him a whassup nod.

                                 ROGER
                        You guys wanna get a workout in? See 
                        what all the hype’s about?

           Chuck slowly looks down at the beer in his hand. Looks up.

                        before the one o’clock mass.

           Roger pats Brian hard on the back.

                                 ROGER
                        Well. Looks like it’s just the two 
                        of us. Like old times.

           EXT. CENTRAL PARK - JOGGING PATH - DAY

           Stroller moms and tourists. The trees are just starting to 
           bloom. Brian and Roger jog past at a serious pace...

                                 ROGER
                        So how’s Eileen?

                        She’s... fine. Hormonal.

           Roger slows down, tired. He motions to move off the path.

                        Hey-- Don’t worry about Eileen.

                        not playin’ in my living room!

           Roger doesn’t laugh. Brian senses something’s off. They sit on 
           a park bench. Roger, more winded, takes a moment...

                                 ROGER
                        Brian... Go see your family whenever 
                        the hell you like. The Yankees don’t 
                        control you. Forget the schedule. 

                                 BRIAN
                        What are you talking about?

           Roger has trouble finding the words. He licks his lips.

                                 BRIAN (CONT’D)

                        benefits...

           Enough said. Brian understands.

                                 BRIAN
                        The Yankees didn’t hire me.

           Roger nods. Brian glances at the sympathetic hand on his 
           shoulder... At the gleaming DIAMOND   RING he’ll never get.

                                 ROGER
                        For what its worth Bry... you always 
                        were.

           Brian hides his feelings. Roger stands, wipes his face.

                                 ROGER (CONT’D)
                        Come on. I’ll race ‘ya to the 
                        boathouse!

           Roger takes off running. Brian swallows his pride...

           ...And follows after him.
           EXT. OLD YANKEE STADIUM - EMPLOYEE ENTRANCE - DAY

           Brian wears the gifted NY Yankees hat from Roger and carries 
           his duffle bag filled with equipment. He power-walks over to:

           CARL -- a black security guard hired in the days of Mantle and 
           Maris -- leaning on a step-stool reading the NEW YORK POST.

                                 BRIAN
                        Excuse me. I’m-- Hi.
                           (
                            Carl looks up

                        Brian McNamee. Today’s my first day.

           With a show of great inconvenience, Carl grabs a CLIP-BOARD.

                                 CARL
                        Spell your last name.

                        Nope.

           Carl sets the clip-board back and returns to his newspaper.

                                 BRIAN
                        I work for Roger Clemens.

                                 CARL
                        Uh-huh. I heard ‘em all before, pal. 
                        Round the corner with the rest of ‘em.

           EXT. PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

           Confused, Brian walks around the corner to find six or seven--

           MIDDLE-AGED MEN WITH ROLLER BAGS. Three of the guys compare 
           baseball cards. A BEARDED MAN looks up from his cellphone...

                                 BEARDED MAN
                        You have to be inside the line.

           Brian looks down to see a YELLOW BOX painted into the asphalt.

                                 BRIAN
                        I don’t understand.

                                 BEARDED MAN
                        We have to wait here. They don’t 
                        like us harassing the players.

                            then
                           (
                                )
                        Dave Cossini. You must be new, right? 
                        See, I don’t do this full time like 
                        some of the other guys. I’m an air

                        figured this was a good way to drum 
                        up extra cash. Thank God for Ebay!

           --Brian’s eyes narrow as Dave overshares--

                        Ebay?

           Dave nods. Leans down and opens his bag. It’s full of...

           YANKEE MEMORABILIA

           Jerseys. Hats. 8x10’s. And a box of various colored SHARPIES. 
           Brian does an about-face, storming out of the yellow box--

                                 BEARDED MAN/DAVE
                        Hey! Where ‘ya goin’! You’re gonna 
                        get us in trouble, man!

           Brian spots Roger’s teammate Chuck Knoblauch leaving his car.

                                 BRIAN
                        Chuck! Excuse me... Chuck.

           Chuck stops mid-stride, staring at Brian. Brian jogs over--

           Chuck continues to the team entrance. Brian doesn’t move. 
           Reluctantly, he reaches into his pocket for his cellphone. 
           Holds down the “2” button and speed-dials...

                        You got the Rocket. Leave a message.

           Brian hangs up. Frustrated, he walks to his beat-up BEIGE 
           CAMRY as an out-of-focus FIGURE runs out of the stadium...

                                 ROGER

                        It’s... okay.

           The MEMORABILIA GUYS inside the yellow box murmur when they 
           see Roger put his arm around Brian... one of their own.

                                 ROGER

           Roger and Laura Pettitte carry Debbie into an idling LIMO as

                        We’re pals with the lady of honor. 
                        Headin’ backstage.

                                 ROGER
                        Just call someone up on your walkie-
                        talkie toy. We’re expected.

                        If that were true, you’d have VIP 
                        badges. Do you have VIP badges?

           Brian puts a hand on Roger to calm his flaring temper...

                                 ROGER
                        You kiddin’ me? Badges? D’you know 
                        who the hell I am?

                                 BOUNCER
                        Yeah, I know who you are. And I hate 
                        the fuckin’ Yankees. So you and your 
                        lap dog can go fuck off now.

                                 ROGER
                        What did you say you--?

           WHACK!!! Brian PUNCHES THE SHIT out of the bouncer before 
           Roger can mouth off. ANOTHER BOUNCER rushes over to help but--

           ROGER GRABS HIM AND... 

                                                 HEAD BUTTS US INTO:

           INT. BACKSTAGE GREEN ROOM - LATER

           Mindy puts ice in a plastic baggie. Instead of putting it on 
           his red FOREHEAD, Roger puts the ice on his PITCHING SHOULDER.

                                 BRIAN
                        I think there’s tooth in my hand.

           Brian wraps a towel around his KNUCKLES, notes the ice bag:

                                 BRIAN (CONT’D)
                        Jesus! Did you pull your shoulder?

                                 ROGER
                        Nah. Just aggravated it is all.

           And like that, Brian understands why Roger asked him back--

                                 BRIAN
                        How long?

                                 ROGER
                        ...Six months.

                                 MINDY
                        I told him to call you sooner.

           Mindy grabs some excess ice and pours TWO GLASSES of whiskey. 
           She brings a tumbler to Roger, who holds up a hand...

                        and you know his rule.

           Mindy shrugs, pours Roger’s whiskey into her glass.

           The peephole clanks shut. LOCKS DISENGAGE and the door swings 
           open on a goliath... this is body-builder KIRK RADOMSKI (32).

                        Growth Hormone. You heard of it?

           Beat. Brian nods.

                                 KIRK (CONT’D)
                        Good. Well everything you heard is 
                        true. Untraceable in testing and it 
                        won’t turn RC into the Incredible 
                        Hulk. Though... you will want to 
                        avoid him when he’s angry.

           Kirk laughs hard at his own joke. Brian is ready to go.

                                 BRIAN
                        Thank you, Kirk...

                                 BRIAN
                        Thank you, Murdoch.

                        You know how to use this stuff? It’s 
                        not like Winstrol.

           CONTINUED:

           Kirk can tell Brian has no clue. He motions for the brown bag 
           back, pulls out TWO VIALS and a needle. Holding up VIAL “A”...

                                 KIRK (CONT’D)
                        This is sterile water. Take the 
                        syringe and fill it up. All of it.

           Kirk does so. Setting the empty vial down, he grabs VIAL “B”.

                                 KIRK (CONT’D)
                        This is hormone powder. Take the 
                        water from the syringe and slowly 
                        mix it with the HGH.
                           (
                            vial “B” turns milky
                                               )
                        Now don’t shake it or you’ll muck up 
                        the molecules and shizz.
                           (
                                                    )
                            sucks up the milky liquid
                        Voilà. Now lift up your shirt.

                                 BRIAN
                        Oh, this isn’t for me. I don’t--

                                 KIRK
                        I like you Brian. I see a lot of 
                        similarities between us. We share a 
                        deep spiritual love for the game.
                            holding up the syringe
                           (
                                                 )
                        This is the part we play. And if we 
                        are going to play it, we are going 
                        to play it to the best of our 
                        goddamn ability. Now stop being an 
                        Octopussy and lift your shirt.

           Brian obeys. Kirk deftly injects the HGH into his side. Brian 
           instantly feels dizzy and stumbles... AS A RECORD SCRATCHES--

                                         BREAK, EJECT, EJECT, EJECT:

                        Take a seat. I’ll grab you a Gatorade.

                               'FOR THEY CATCH YA CHAINSMOKIN', WORD:

           Brian lays down on the couch. Kirk heads for his secret room--

           The sun rises over the island, leaving the buildings -- 
           including an iconic set of towers -- silhouetted in shadow.

           INT. ROGER’S NEW YORK PENTHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Elevator doors open and Brian heads for the kitchen island, 
           setting his son’s SPIDER-MAN LUNCH BOX on the gray marble.

           INSIDE: 1 VIAL OF HGH, 1 VIAL OF WATER, 1 SYRINGE

           Brian stares down at the contents of the lunch pail. Roger 
           appears beside him. Watches as Brian snaps quickly to work.

           Water--> Syringe--> HGH--> Syringe--> Tap, tap-->

           Brian turns to Roger with the READY-TO-GO NEEDLE...

           INT. OLD YANKEE STADIUM FIELD - NIGHT

           Roger pitches a missile. The RED SOX BATTER has no chance.

           Brian nods to the concierge, who activates an elevator.

           INT. ROGER’S NEW YORK PENTHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Elevator opens. Brian enters the kitchen. Lunch box opens.

           INSIDE: 2 VIALS OF HGH, 2 VIALS OF WATER, 2 SYRINGES

           Brian and Roger stare down. CHUCK appears beside them.

           Chuck, at second base, DIVES for a line drive-- Falling onto

                        I believe Mr. McNamee misremembers.

           ...As the FATBOY SLIM SONG comes to a stop. Waxman looks like 
           he wants to beat himself over the head with his own gavel.

                                 CHAIRMAN WAXMAN
                        I think we could all use a moment. 
                        We’ll reconvene in ten minutes.

           Brian beelines it out of the room for some fresh air. Roger 
           stays in his seat. He notices Brian’s notepad-- FACE DOWN. 
           Debbie comes forward, wrapping her arms around Roger...

                                 DEBBIE
                        You’re doing fabulous, sweetheart.

                        Confident. Truthful. And you look

                        run with that suit, Debbie. Where 
                        can I get me one of those?

           Roger isn’t listening, focused on Brian’s pad. He discreetly 
           lifts it... Enough to see one word filling the entire page:

                                         LIAR

                                                            CUT TO:

           INT. D’AGOSTINO MARKET - AFTERNOON - 2001

           Brian and Eileen -- carrying a FIVE MONTH OLD BABY -- navigate 
           their cart into the dairy section. Brian Jr. tags behind.

                                 EILEEN
                        Can’t we just get regular eggs?

                                 BRIAN
                        Brown, cage free. It’s gotta be. 
                        Otherwise it’s cruel, Leeny. They 
                        don’t even let the chickens stand. 

                                 EILEEN
                        Yeah, but they’re double the price.

                                 BRIAN
                        We can afford it now-- Hey, Junior, 
                        put that down. Get over to your ‘ma.

           Brian reaches for the good eggs. Eileen rolls her eyes.

                        Tell me about it.

           Eileen and Brian turn--

           Jeff Novitzky - Federal Agent - leans against his empty cart.

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        They even have eggs now-- Had a 
                        goddamn bedtime story read to them.

                        I mean you’re the health nut, Brian. 
                        I guess I’ll defer to you.

           Jeff reaches out and grabs the SAME BRAND of expensive eggs 
           as Brian. He puts them into his cart. His only item.

                                 BRIAN
                        Do I know you?

                                 JEFF
                        Not yet.

           Jeff pulls an IRS BADGE from his pocket.

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        Special agent Jeff Novitzky. IRS

                        rumors -- they’re not new, but 
                        they’re getting louder -- that, uh... 
                        Some individuals in professional 
                        baseball... are not playing fair.

           Brian bristles. Eileen pulls Brian Jr. closer.

                                 EILEEN
                        You’re with the IRS?

                                 JEFF
                        Yep.

                                 BRIAN
                        Eileen. Watch the kids. Can we step 
                        over there, Mr...?

                                 JEFF
                        Agent Novitzky. Sure.

           They step to an aisle. Just so happens to be the cereal aisle.

           Jeff grabs a box of LUCKY CHARMS. Throws it in his basket.

                                 JEFF
                        No, I don’t think you’re Pete Rose. 
                        I’m investigating steroid use in 
                        Major League Baseball. And if I’m 
                        being honest-- I’m not getting a lot 
                        of my phone calls returned.

                                 BRIAN
                        Does this... have something to do 
                        with Roger?

                                 JEFF
                        Is Roger Clemens taking steroids?

                                 BRIAN
                        I-- I never said that.

                                 JEFF
                        Then this has nothing to do with 
                        Roger.

                                 BRIAN
                        Look, I’m just a trainer. I don’t 
                        know anything about any of this 
                        and... we’re making lasagna tonight, 
                        we’re kind of in a hurry.

           Jeff nods. Pulls out his BUSINESS CARD.

                                 JEFF
                        Of course. Here, let me give you my

                        Okay. Sure. But I don’t know anything.

                        I get it. I don’t know if I believe 
                        any of it myself. These guys train 
                        hard. McGwire, Sosa... Barry Bonds. 
                        These guys could be legit, right?

                        On second thought... I probably 
                        shouldn’t put this crap in my body.

           Jeff puts the Lucky Charms back on the shelf. The only thing 
           left in his cart now are, once again, those fucking eggs.

                        Have a good day, Brian.

           Jeff pushes his cart down the aisle. Brian is shaken.

                                                           SLAM TO:

           BRIAN’S CAR bounces violently into the driveway of a...

           EXT. A FOR SALE HOUSE - LONG ISLAND - AFTERNOON

           Emptied moving boxes sit on the porch. The escrow sign still 
           in the yard. It’s clear the McNamee Family has just moved in.

           Brian jumps out of the car and RUSHES to the passenger side. 
           He helps his son out first, then Eileen...

                     BRIAN
                                                    EILEEN
           Come on. Come on...
                                            --Brian, what the hell is 
                                            going on!?

                                 BRIAN
                        Just... order take-out tonight!

           He dives back into the driver’s seat and peels off... 

           Leaving Eileen with their son and their baby and no dinner.

           EXT/INT. BRIAN’S CAR - LATER

           It’s raining now. The Camry WEAVES through traffic. Groceries 
           fly around the back seat. Brian dials #2 on his cellphone...

           INT. NY PRESBYTERIAN - CHILDREN’S CANCER WARD - EVENING

           Beds are pushed against the wall. Roger squats down with a 
           glove playing catcher. A YOUNG GIRL stares him down from the 
           “mound” with a signed YANKEES HAT covering her bald head.

                                 ROGER
                        Let’s give him the fastball, down and 
                        inside... Fire it in there, darlin’.

           Patients. Family. Staff. All cheer her on. The wind-up and--

                        Striiiike three! He’s out! Yes!

           Roger rushes the young girl, hoisting her atop his shoulders, 
           parading her around the room. Her smile could not be bigger.

                                 ROGER (CONT’D)
                        Okay! Who’s next? We got a bunch 
                        more yahoos to strike out here!

           He sets the girl down. Other kids excitedly raise their hands.

                        Roger.

           Brian stands in the doorway. Drenched from the rain. 

           INT. MEDICAL SUPPLY CLOSET - MOMENTS LATER

           Brian locks the door. Some familiar looking stuff in here.

                                 ROGER
                        This better be worth the 
                        embarrassment.

                                 BRIAN
                        A federal investigator just cornered

                                 BRIAN
                        And he’s investigating steroid use 
                        in baseball.

                                 BRIAN
                        He’s not wrong. But there are other 
                        ways for us to get caught that don’t 
                        involve testing!

                        My stats? Those stats are me.

                        Are you sayin’ I couldn’t hit those 
                        stats on my own?

           Brian instinctively rolls his eyes.

                        You think McGwire could have done 
                        what he did without juicing?

           ROGER SLAPS BRIAN. Hard enough to knock him to the ground.

           DEBBIE IS PRACTICALLY NAKED

           White lace panties and an untied silk robe hide just enough. 
           Her hair is up in a bun. Brian averts his eyes...

                        have to be in a swimsuit and all?

           Debbie touches her body, feeling for flaws.

                                 DEBBIE (CONT’D)
                        Uch! I am a cow. Brian...

                        I don’t know--

                                 DEBBIE
                        Would you give me a bit of your 
                        magic potion?

           Brian doesn’t respond. Debbie laughs, reaching into her robe 
           pocket, removing a vial of HGH. Brian’s eyes go even wider.

                                 DEBBIE (CONT’D)
                        Don’t worry. I know its a secret 
                        potion. I just want to try a little 
                        bit. And Lord knows I can’t stick 
                        myself with that big needle.

           She pulls her robe up a little to reveal her inner thigh. 
           Brian, nervous but clearly aroused, shakes his head...

                                 BRIAN
                        Your stomach.

           Debbie brushes her robe aside, revealing even more flesh--

                                 DEBBIE
                        Here?

           Brian walks into the bathroom. Closing the door behind him.

                                                            CUT TO:

           He returns to his chair. Flips his notepad face up--

                        You were arrested and held on a very 
                        serious criminal charge.

                                 BRIAN
                        I didn’t hear a question.

           INT. TROPICANA FIELD - ST. PETERSBURG, FL - AFTERNOON

           The TAMPA BAY DEVIL RAYS play host to the New York Yankees in 
           a sold out game. DEREK JETER (#2) is at bat.

           INT. VISITING TEAM DUGOUT - SAME

           Roger sits beside Andy and Chuck. Manager Joe Torre leans 
           over the railing as Derek Jeter swings and misses...

           Brian emerges from the clubhouse tunnel. His face is ashen 
           white. Joe notices him, displeased. He spits in the dirt. 

                                 BRIAN
                        Roger. I-- I have some bad news...

                        It’s Mindy.

           INT. TROPICANA FIELD - BOTTOM OF THE INNING

           Roger stomps to the mound. TEARS WELL IN HIS EYES. He wipes 
           them away, inadvertently WETTING THE BALL. Kind of like...

           A SPITBALL. Roger nods to the first sign. Winds up, and--

           DRILLS THE BATTER IN THE HELMET

           The batter is pissed. He drops his bat to STORM THE MOUND-- 
           But to his surprise... Roger is already coming after him!

           THE BENCHES clear for a good ol’ fashioned BRAWL.
           INT. VISITING TEAM DUGOUT - SAME

           Joe Torre still leans over the rail. He turns to Brian, the 
           only one left in the dugout.

                                 JOE
                        I always find that bad news is best 
                        given... after the game.

           Joe rolls up his sleeves and trots onto the field.

           EXT. LARGO MEDICAL CENTER - EVENING

           Several local NEWS VANS create a buzz at this Tampa Bay area 
           hospital. CAMERA CREWS and REPORTERS block the entrance.

           INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - SAME

           Roger keeps his head down, avoiding eye contact with the 
           staff. Music manager STAN MORESS (60), straight from the 
           Sinatra-era, paces on a cell phone. Roger approaches him...

                                 STAN (INTO PHONE)

                                 ROGER

                        How is she? She swallowed a fist-
                        full of Tricyclic and chased it with 
                        a liter of vodka.

                                 ROGER

                        to the airport for her mother.

           INT. MINDY’S HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           EKG is steady. For the first time, we see... Mindy’s just a 
           girl. Her eyes slowly open as Roger kneels down beside her.

                                 ROGER
                        Hey.

                        losin’ these fights...

           Roger touches his INJURED EYE. He’d forgotten about it.

                                 ROGER
                        Darlin’, you had me so worried.

                                 MINDY
                        You ain’t gotta worry about me... I’m 
                        just dandy. Think I’m gonna write a 
                        song to that God awful beepin’. What 
                        should I call it?

                                 ROGER
                        I don’t know.

                                 MINDY
                        How ‘bout “No Sleep for the Sick”?

           Roger caresses her cheek. She abandons herself to his touch.

                                 ROGER
                        What can I do, baby?

                                 MINDY
                        Nothin’, baby. This is God’s work 
                        right here. This is how he made me.

                                 ROGER
                        But... he gave you the voice of a 
                        damn angel.

                                 MINDY
                        And he gave you the arm of a rocket. 
                        Doesn’t mean we’re not fucked up.

           A tear falls from the corner of Roger’s eye.

           INT. RENAISSANCE TAMPA - BRIAN’S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           The local hotel for visiting teams. On the first floor -- next 
           to the ice machine and the noisy pool -- Brian watches TV:

                                 REPORTER (ON TV)
                        ...This was her third failed suicide 
                        attempt. Mindy’s longtime manager 
                        Stan Moress released a statement 
                        asking for privacy at this time but 
                        assured fans that Ms. McCready’s 
                        tour will continue.

           CRACK!!! A BEER BOTTLE shatters outside the window. Brian 
           leaps off his bed, shoving the curtains aside to see...

           BY THE SWIMMING POOL

           Chuck Knoblauch and a few teammates are totally TRASHED. 
           Speaking of trashed, a BLEACHED BLONDE sucks face with a 
           ROOKIE until another PLAYER grabs her arm for his own kiss.

           Brian shakes his head in disgust, shutting the curtains.

           INT. BRIAN’S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Fast asleep, Brian is abruptly awoken by-- A WOMAN’S SCREAM!

           Brian jumps from under the covers to look out the curtains...

           OUTSIDE: Two naked Yankee ASSES scatter from the pool. No sign 
           of the woman. Brian rushes out the door in his UNDERWEAR...

                                                            CUT TO:

           BLONDE HAIR dancing over a naked body several feet below--

           EXT. HOTEL POOL - CONTINUOUS

           A FIGURE slices through water and grabs the UNCONSCIOUS BODY. 
           Brian heroically lifts the Blonde’s head above the surface.

           She immediately coughs, throwing up pool water. Brian is 
           relieved... but then the woman FREAKS OUT.

                                 BLEACHED BLONDE
                        Help! HELP!

           Hotel room lights flip on. The Blonde woman SCREAMS.

                     BRIAN
                                                    BLEACHED BLONDE

                                 SECURITY GUARD (O.S.)
                        Sir! Let the girl go!

           The hotel SECURITY GUARD has a TASER and is itching to use it.

                                 BRIAN
                        It’s not what it looks like. I was--

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        I said let go of the girl! And put 
                        your hands in the air!

           Brian releases the woman’s arm. The Blonde scrambles over to 
           the side and pulls herself out of the pool, crying.

           With his hands in the air, Brian looks around for help. Sees 
           familiar faces staring down at him from their BALCONIES...

           JOE TORRE... ANDY PETTITTE... CHUCK KNOBLAUCH...

           None of them come to his aid. They just shake their heads.

           -- In walks Federal Agent Jeff Novitzky with two piping hot 
           coffees and a FOLDER between his armpit.

                                 JEFF
                        Hi.

                                 BRIAN
                        What are you doing here?

           Jeff sets down the coffees. No napkins here. He pulls a chair 
           over and sets the folder on the table.

                                 JEFF
                        Well, Brian, we have this thing... 
                        If someone we’re watching -- doesn’t 
                        matter who, FBI, CIA, IRS -- if they 
                        get arrested, we get an email.

                        I got an email.

                                 BRIAN
                        This is... a huge misunderstanding.

                                 JEFF
                        What’s there to misunderstand? 
                        According to the detective outside, 
                        the woman you assaulted had a blood 
                        alcohol level that’d make Mickey 
                        Mantle look like a light-weight, not 
                        to mention copious amounts of two 
                        date rape drugs in her system. Ooh! 
                        And then there’s the hotel security 
                        guard who swears up and down you were 
                        getting pretty funky in the pool.

           Brian shakes his head in disbelief.

                                 BRIAN
                        Somebody told him to say that! I 
                        saved her life!

                                 JEFF
                        I can help you, Brian.

           Jeff opens the folder. There’s only one thing inside it--

           AN 8x10 PHOTO OF KIRK RADOMSKI

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)

                        So you lied? To a Federal Agent.

           Brian sits at the witness table, ashamed. He can only nod.

                                 CONGRESSMAN ISSA (CONT’D)
                        Let the record show Mr. McNamee has 
                        nodded in the affirmative.

           INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - RESUME - 2001

           Jeff pushes the photo of Kirk across the table to Brian. 

                                 JEFF
                        His name is Kirk Radomski. But I 
                        believe you call him Murdoch.
                           (

                        I need to keep going? Okay...

           Jeff pulls a PAPER from his pocket... a handwritten RECEIPT. 

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        Your very first drug purchase: Four 
                        vials of Human Growth Hormone, one 
                        vial of Winstrol and a box of one 
                        dozen syringes.

                        Oh. And a Gatorade. Wow. He charged 
                        you for the Gatorade.

           Brian perspires... But he’s still not ready to give in.

                                 BRIAN
                        I want a lawyer.

                        You’re absolutely right; Kirk could’ve 
                        just typed this out to hand us some 
                        names. You’re very perceptive, Brian. 
                        However, my friends and I recently 
                        took a little trip to the bank...

           Jeff flips over the photo of Kirk. Stapled to the back is a 
           photocopy of a PERSONAL CHECK signed by: BRIAN G. MCNAMEE... 
           And made out to “PRO SHOP DETAIL CENTER.” Brian is silent.

                                 JEFF (CONT’D)
                        Look. Between you and me and the two 
                        cops on the other side of that one-
                        way glass, you’ll beat these assault 
                        charges.

           Brian is taken aback. Not the tactic he was expecting.

                        The girl accusing you of rape isn’t 
                        exactly a pillar of society and, end 
                        of day, any low-rent defense attorney 
                        could get a grand jury to believe -- 
                        in a hotel full of New York 
                        Yankees -- the idea she’d accept a 
                        drink from you is next to impossible.

                        But none of that matters. Guilt or 
                        innocence. Do you know what matters?

                                 BRIAN
                        What?

                                 JEFF
                        The accusation. It will haunt you 
                        until the day you die, whether you 
                        did it or not.

                                 BRIAN
                        I didn’t hurt that girl. I saved her.

                                 JEFF
                        You’ll have an awfully hard time 
                        getting Eileen to believe that when 
                        you’re already behind bars for the 
                        illegal distribution of schedule 
                        three narcotics. You got no outs,

                        with me. And this will all go away.

           Brian stares down at the overwhelming evidence against him.

                                 BRIAN
                        No.

           VARIOUS PLAYERS and STAFF trickle in for the day’s game. 
           Brian grabs his ubiquitous duffle bag from his car’s trunk.

                        tell him this bullshit’s goin’ down?

                        I know Roger’s your boy. That’s why 
                        I asked him. He said Torre’s word is 
                        the word.

           Brian is embarrassed as other employees brush past and stare.

                                 BRIAN
                        Fuck you, Carl.

           INT/EXT. BRIAN’S CAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Brian flies into the driver’s seat... Pulls his cellphone from 
           his pocket. Holds down the #2... It rings... And rings...

                        You got the Rocket. Leave a message.

           Brian hangs up. Dials again. One ring-- and then...

                        Fuck! Fuck! FUCK YOU! Pick up the 
                        fucking phone!!

           Brian tosses the phone and BANGS his hands against the wheel. 
           He starts to WEEP, like a child. Drool drips onto the steering 
           wheel’s Toyota emblem. After a few deep sobs, Brian looks up--

           AT THE EMPLOYEE ENTRANCE. At old Carl. That motherfucker.

           Brian turns on the car. Incensed. Past his breaking point. He 
           leaves the PARKING BREAK on as he slams the GAS PEDAL DOWN...

           TIRES BURN AND SMOKE-- Drawing the attention of the 
           “Memorabilia Guys” in their yellow box. They watch as... 

           THE CAMRY BARRELS FORWARD

           Straight for the EMPLOYEE ENTRANCE. Carl DIVES out of the way 
           as Brian speeds his car through the SECURITY TURNSTILE...

           RIPPING IT FROM THE GROUND... Before coming to a brutal halt.

           Carl pokes his head out of an ALCOVE... watches the Camry 
           shift into REVERSE and gun back into the parking lot where...

           Brian spins the wheel, SCREECHES 180-DEGREES...

           The Camry, it’s front end severely SMASHED, sits in the

           THROUGH THE BROKEN WINDSHIELD: Brian is SHAKING. Can’t believe

                        So you had incentive to name Mr.

                        or did not use steroids?

                        I had incentive to tell the truth.

                        Then why are we sitting here six-

                                 BRIAN
                        I-- I don’t think so.

                        Gee whiz, are you kidding me? When

                        evidence?

                                 BRIAN
                        I turned it over to authorities in 
                        2006 or 2007.

                        That’s your excuse, Mr. McNamee? 
                        You’ve told this committee and the 
                        people of this country that Roger 
                        Clemens did things... and I don’t 
                        know what to believe. I know one

                        goes to hospitals, he was active in 
                        supporting our public service men 
                        and women after 9/11... This is a-- 
                        he’s a titan in baseball. And you, 
                        and your lies, if they’re not true-- 
                        You are destroying him and his

                        Very well.

                        Mr. McNamee. If you are not lying 
                        now, if you expect anyone to believe 
                        what you’ve told us here today, you 
                        need to tell the truth about why you 
                        didn’t come forward with the 
                        physical evidence right away. Why 
                        did it take you until just a few 
                        months ago?

                                 BRIAN
                        Because until a few months ago, I 
                        still thought of Roger as my friend. 
                        And until a few months ago, I prayed 
                        maybe this would all just go away.

                            then

                        But mostly, Congressman, until a few 
                        months ago, I still had hope Roger 
                        would take me back... To the game I 
                        love. And he didn’t.

           A sky blue ocean. Powdery sand as soft as a blanket. It’s 
           everything Roger told Mindy it would be. Nearby CABANAS are 
           decked out with tinsel-and-shells for a Caribbean Christmas.

           FOUR CLEMENS BOYS jockey for position in the breaking water. 
           Koby is 20. The youngest, Kody, is 11. A FOOTBALL spirals 
           overhead as the boys tackle each other, missing the catch.

                        seen you much lately. Hey... you know 
                        what? Where you at? I’ll call my

           Brian sits alone in an apartment filled with UNOPENED BOXES,

           And then the RAGE takes over... ROGER CHUCKS THE PHONE...

                        I’ve read, and I sure as-- I never-- 
                        I didn’t do ‘em, but they ain’t 
                        miracle workers. My arm is my arm, 
                        you know? Ask any teammates that’ve 
                        come here and done the work with me.

                                 MIKE WALLACE
                        I came here in 2001. And you were 
                        pitching to a guy by the name of...

                                 ROGER
                        --Brian McNamee. That’s right.

                                 MIKE WALLACE
                        Why would Brian McNamee want to 
                        betray you?

           Roger’s focus is all over the place. His hands won’t stop 
           fidgeting with a WATER BOTTLE. He licks his lips, too.

                                 ROGER
                        You know... I don’t know. I’m so 
                        upset about it. How I treated this 
                        man. And took care of him.

                                 MIKE WALLACE
                        I imagine he’s watching the two of 
                        us right now, wouldn’t you?

           INT. BRIAN’S STUDIO APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Brian most certainly is. He sits on the edge of his futon 
           anxiously clicking a pen as the interview continues ONSCREEN:

                                 MIKE WALLACE (ON TV)
                        Anything you want to tell him?

           Brian eagerly scoots to the edge of the futon.

                                 ROGER (ON TV)
                        Yeah. I um... Treated him fairly. I 
                        helped him out. I’m... mad.

           Mike -- and Brian -- wait for Roger to say more. He doesn’t.

           Bzzz... Bzzz... “EILEEN” appears on Brian’s outdated cell.

                                 BRIAN (INTO PHONE)

                                 ROGER (ON TV)
                        If he’s puttin’ that stuff in my 
                        body-- if what he’s sayin, which is 
                        totally false, if he’s doin’ that to 
                        me, I should have a third ear comin’ 
                        out of my forehead. I should be 
                        pullin’ tractors with my teeth.

                        Jesus. He’s fucking terrible.

           Brian gets a much needed laugh. 

                                 EILEEN (VIA PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry you have to go through 
                        this. You doing okay?

           Brian scans his sparse home... rubbing his empty ring finger. 
           He notices a box marked “TROPHY DISPLAY.” One of his college 
           trophies has pathetically poked a hole through the cardboard.

                                 BRIAN
                        I should’ve listened to you, Leeny.

                        Hey! Come say hi to your daddy!

           We hear Brian’s two kids CALLING OUT over the phone... But it 
           doesn’t cheer Brian up. It just makes him choke up with tears.

           INT. CLEMENS ESTATE - MOVIE THEATER - SAME

           Roger sits alone in his dark theater, watching the interview 
           broadcast onto America’s (not) Largest In-Home MOVIE SCREEN...

                                 MIKE WALLACE (ONSCREEN)
                        Do you think people are going to 
                        believe you? Believe that you, Roger 
                        Clemens, never took steroids?

                                 ROGER (ONSCREEN)
                        I think the people that know me 
                        believe me and understand what I’m 
                        about and I can’t-- the-- the people 
                        that are out there that have been 
                        sayin’ the things that they’ve been 
                        sayin’... I’ll-- do everything I can 
                        to prove them wrong and-- and I still 
                        don’t know if that’s good enough.

           ONSCREEN: The interview ends with the trademark TICKING CLOCK.

           Roger raises a remote. Clicks the screen off. He sits in the 
           dark a moment until his new iPhone LIGHTS UP: “RUSTY HARDIN”

                                 ROGER (INTO PHONE)
                        What d‘ya think?

           Rusty has his office TV muted (playing CBS COMMERCIALS for 
           Cialis and NCIS). An official FEDERAL SUMMONS on his desk.

                                 RUSTY
                        Roger... You’ve been called to 
                        testify before Congress.

                                 ROGER (VIA SPEAKERPHONE)
                        ...‘Cause of my interview?

                                 RUSTY
                        No, Congress doesn’t work quite that 
                        fast. I got it Friday. I thought it 
                        best to wait until after the show to 
                        tell you. Because there’s more...

           INT. CLEMENS ESTATE - THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY - SAME

           Roger exits the theater and wanders dazedly down the hall...

                                 RUSTY (VIA PHONE)
                        Chuck Knoblauch and Andy Pettitte 
                        are going to confess.

           Roger leans against the wall, closing his eyes in shock.

           INT. RUSTY HARDIN’S LAW OFFICE - SAME

           Rusty takes the call off speaker, puts the headset to his ear.

                                 RUSTY (INTO PHONE)
                        Everyone’s coming clean, Roger. No 
                        one is getting fined. No one is 
                        going to jail. But if you go in 
                        front of Congress next month and you 
                        lie... You’re gonna have bigger fish 
                        to fry than a little asterisk by 
                        your name. They will charge you with 
                        federal perjury.

           INT. TROPHY ROOM - SAME

           Roger has made his way into his private museum, lit by moon-
           light and the iPhone. On the wall are SEVEN CY YOUNG AWARDS:

           And just so we’re clear... that’s two more than anyone. Ever.

           Roger COLLAPSES into a chair. Takes in all his hardware... 

           Suddenly and completely meaningless.

           INT. CONGRESSIONAL HEARING ROOM - DAY - FEBRUARY 13, 2008

           Congressman Waxman looks at his watch. Nods to an AIDE...

                                 CHAIRMAN WAXMAN
                        We’re needed for a vote on the 
                        floor. But before we conclude this 
                        hearing I’d like to say something.
                           (
                            beat
                                )
                        This is not a court of law. We are 
                        not here to pass judgment of guilt or 
                        innocence. I have my opinion of which 
                        one of you is telling the truth but 
                        other members may disagree. I think 
                        it will be up to history to decide.

           As Waxman continues, slowly PUSH IN on Brian and Roger...

                                 CHAIRMAN WAXMAN (O.S.)
                        We began this investigation in order 
                        to break the link between 
                        professional sports and the use of 
                        steroids. We cannot have athletes as 
                        role models leading our children 
                        down this dangerous path. We cannot 
                        have the culture of the clubhouse 
                        become the culture of the high 
                        school gym. And I think we have 
                        moved closer to that goal today.

           CLOSE NOW -- Just Brian and Roger. Brian on the left. Roger on 
           the right. Behind them, Novitzky, Rusty, Debbie-- JUST A BLUR.

                                 CHAIRMAN WAXMAN (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Lastly, I want to apologize. I want 
                        to apologize to the fans. To an 
                        entire generation who will always

                        all do better by them in the future.

           And while Waxman is saying this, we’ve cut out Brian and just 
           MOVED IN on Roger. A twenty-five-year legacy gone with the...

           BANG OF A GAVEL.

                                 CHAIRMAN WAXMAN
                        That concludes our hearing today and 
                        we stand adjourned. Thank you.

           INT. U.S. CAPITOL - BATHROOM - DAY

           Brian washes his hands, staring at them intently like he’s 
           rinsing away the day’s testimony. He makes a cup and splashes 
           water on his face, reaching over for some nearby PAPER TOWELS.

           Brian dries his face and hands as he stares at the water 
           swirling down into the white porcelain when--

           A TOILET FLUSHES

           From out of a stall walks The Rocket, standing tall. He steps 
           over to the sink beside Brian. Briefly wets his hands.

           Brian -- almost on instinct -- grabs a few paper towels, 
           handing them over to Roger like a proper bathroom attendant.

           Roger accepts the towels, dries his hands, balls the paper and 
           moves to exit... as Brian finally finds the courage to speak:

                                 BRIAN
                        Why did you lie?

           Roger turns. Speaks without a hint of dishonesty:

                                 ROGER
                        I didn’t.

           He tosses the paper towels into a waste can several feet away. 

           A perfect shot. And with that-- He’s out the door.

           Leaving Brian alone, staring into the empty sink. Preparing...

           ...To look himself in the mirror.

           Now, and for the rest of his life.

                                                        DISSOLVE TO:
                COOPERSTOWN, NY. Warm sun casts a glow along a HALLWAY...

               Roger Clemens was charged with multiple counts of perjury for lying to 
                       Congress. After two trials, he was found not guilty.

           ...MARBLE PILLARS flank the hall down to an arched ROTUNDA...

                 In February of 2013, Mindy McCready ended her life. When asked to 
                 comment, Roger replied: “The few times that I had met her and her 
                             manager, they were extremely nice.”

                ...Along the walls hang 310 individual BRONZE PLAQUES...

              Mark McGwire, Barry Bonds and José Canseco all admitted to steroid use. 
               When asked by Congress, Sammy Sosa pretended not to speak English.

                ...Inside the rotunda, PAN AROUND the most recent plaques...

              Brian McNamee never again worked in professional sports. He now specializes 
                                 in training aspiring athletes.

           ...We’re close enough now to recognize FAMOUS NAMES AND FACES...

               With 354 Wins, 4672 Strikeouts and 7 Cy Young Awards, Roger Clemens 
                     was once considered a first-year lock for the Hall of Fame.

           ...As the PLAYERS grow current, we stop on EMPTY WALL SPACE...

                           He is now in his fourth year of eligibility.

              ...Waiting, ready, for the HALL OF FAME’S next worthy inductee.
