           OPEN ON: 

           IPAD SCREEN: featuring the fresh face of JANE, 40’s.  Her 
           simple chic style and beauty appear effortless.  But it’s 
           not.  It’s calculated as all things in Jane’s life are.   

           She looks directly at us, flashing a bright smile as though 
           she’s selling us chewing gum or wrinkle cream, but no--

                                 JANE
                        Hi, Wylie.  Wylie-Bear.  

           The screen FREEZES as she presses PAUSE.  Begins again.  

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        Hi, Wylie.  It’s me.  Mom.  

           Pause.  Jane looks away.  As she starts over, We track 
           through:  

           INT. JANE’S OFFICE - DAY

           Stark white Modern, minimalist space.  The monochrome decor 
           interrupted by several BRIGHT PRINTS showcasing the cookbooks 
           of: Green Guru, Jane Skye; Green & Clean Eating.

                                 JANE (O.C.)
                        Wylie.  When you were little... 
                        before you were born actually, I 
                        started -- I created a sound track 
                        of your life.  

           We find FRAMED PHOTOS of her son Wylie, tucked into all of 
           the perfect nooks:

           - Newborn Wylie, cradled by a flawless looking Jane. 

                                 JANE (O.C.) (CONT’D)
                        I kept a file with a song per year 
                        that encompassed that time.  

           - Wylie, 3, in the grass, a look of wonderment as he studies 
           a BUTTERFLY in his hand.       

                                 JANE (O.C.) (CONT’D)
                        I was going to surprise you with 
                        this compilation on your eighteenth 
                        birthday...

           - Wylie, 5, in a tux, and GLITTER SHOES, dancing with Jane 
           and his nanny, EMANUELA.  
           We finally land on Jane at her desk.  iPad propped up.  She 
           forces another smile.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        Circumstances changed that plan.  
                        So, I’m giving it to you early...

           The LOW BATTERY indicator flashes on the screen.  

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                            (muttering)
                        Emanuela...

           She searches for a charger in her desk.  Nada.  

           MUSIC fades in as Jane gets up and --

           A SUPER QUICK FLASH of IPAD FOOTAGE -- Wylie’s infant mouth 
           babbling, Wylie’s eyes smiling, Wylie’s nail polished hands 
           dancing.  These small moments that make or break us depending 
           on whether we’re on the winning or losing side of things.  

           INT. WYLIE’S BEDROOM - DAY

           A mixture of craft and glitz.  Dolls, Barbie’s dream house, 
           and an impressive shoe collection suggest this is not a 
           typical boy’s room. 

           GIGGLES emerge from the bottom bunk where a sheet hangs 
           creating a fort.

           Jane enters on a mission.

                                 JANE
                        Wylie-Emanuela do you have my 
                        charger?

           WYLIE, 9, adorable and effeminate, pokes his head out, 
           revealing a half-painted face.

                                 WYLIE
                        The Queen has beckoned! 

           Jane searches Wylie’s desk.  Her eye CATCHES ON -- a handmade 
           advent-like calendar entitled, Mom.  A count-down of 90 days.  

                                 WYLIE (CONT’D)
                        And she requests her magical 
                        serpent coil!  Princesa, whatever 
                        shall we do?

           EMANUELA, 28, Latina, boho-funky, emerges from the tent.  
           It’s clear, she isn’t just his nanny, she’s his best-friend.    
                                 EMANUELA
                        We shall put on a feast of 
                        children’s feet--

           Wylie MOCK SCREAMS in horror as she tackles him with tickles. 

           They continue to play as Jane surreptitiously opens up the 
           last square on the calendar, “90.”  There is a sad face and 
           “Mom’s last day” written.  

           Jane carefully tucks the calendar away on the desk, glancing 
           toward the fort. 

                                 JANE
                        We have the ballet tonight with 
                        Khalil and Dan.  So make sure 
                        you’re both cleaned up.

                                 WYLIE
                        Whaattttt?  

           Jane spots the charger inside a glass container of glittery 
           rocks.

                                 JANE
                        Why is my charger with your wishing 
                        rocks?  

           She fishes it out. 

                                 WYLIE
                        I thought it was going to be just 
                        the three of us?

                                 JANE
                        No.  It’s the big fun bunch.

                                 WYLIE
                        Why do we keep having these weird 
                        dates with them?

                                 JANE
                        They’re not dates.  They’re our 
                        friends.

                                 WYLIE
                        Your friends, mom.

                                 EMANUELA
                        They’re snobby.  They act as though 
                        I’m not there.

                                 WYLIE
                        Yeah.  They don’t like Emanuela.
                                 JANE
                        That’s not-- why do you think that?

                                 WYLIE
                        I don’t think it.  I just feel it. 

           Jane walks over to Wylie and kisses his head. 

                                 JANE
                        They’re good people.  Just like 
                        you. 

           Wylie studies his mom.  Attempting to read between the lines. 

           INT. THEATRE - NIGHT

           ON Jane, she stares at the BALLET PERFORMANCE with an empty 
           expression. 

           Wylie watches intently, his eyes welled with tears.  He looks 
           to his mom but she is somewhere else. 

           He turns to Emanuela who is moved as well.  She grabs his 
           hand and squeezes it.  He squeezes back. 

           INT. THEATRE - LOBBY

           Intermission.  Jane holds court with KHALIL 30’s, and DAN 
           40’s.  

                                 JANE
                            (grabbing Dan’s face)
                        With that adorable mug of yours? 
                        The ratings can’t be that bad.

                                 DAN
                        Oh.  It’s bad.  Early morning shows 
                        are going to be extinct. 

                                 KHALIL
                        Ugh.  Just stop.  Stop with the 
                        negativity. 
                            (to Jane)
                        This is what he does.

           ANGLE ON WYLIE 

           He wears a brightly colored ascot, skinny pants, bracelets 
           and sparkle oxfords.  Somehow it all goes together 
           brilliantly.  Nearby, he and Emanuela practice ballet moves. 
                                                         DAN
                                             What do I do?
                         EMANUELA
           Arabesque!  Come on, Wylie I 
           know you have it in you. 

                          WYLIE
           Now you arabesque. 
                                                        KHALIL
                                             I love you, sweetie. But, you 
                                             make these blanket assertions 
                                             with no data. Like all of the 
                                             time.

                         EMANUELA
           Jete! 
                                                         DAN
                                             Whatever.  I’ll blanket your 
                                             assertions.

           Emanuela TWIRLS into the conversation, with Wylie.  Khalil 
           awkwardly attempts to engage Wylie.

                                 KHALIL (CONT’D)
                        Wylie, what do you think of the 
                        ballet?

                                 WYLIE
                        The costumes are rad.

                                 DAN
                        Your ascot is rad.

                                 WYLIE
                        Thanks.  Emanuela and I made it.

           Jane looks at Wylie closely for a beat.

                                 JANE
                        Emanuela, did you forget to take 
                        Wylie to get his haircut?

                                 WYLIE
                        She didn’t forget.  She just uh... 

                                 EMANUELA
                        I couldn’t find the car keys.

                                 JANE
                        They’re always in the same place. 
                        Mason jar by the stove.

                                 EMANUELA
                        I know, I know.  I had them and 
                        then the yarn creation exploded--

                                 JANE
                        The yarn what?  
                                 DAN
                            (sotto)
                        Nanny of the year.

           Khalil discreetly elbows him in the ribs.

                                 JANE
                        Well, maybe Dan and Khalil can take 
                        you to get a haircut tomorrow.

           A little too upbeat:

                                 KHALIL
                        I can hook you up with something 
                        fresh.

                                 JANE
                        Yeah, and you can all grab lunch 
                        after.

           Wylie looks at Jane and then Khalil and Dan.  This is weird.

                                 WYLIE
                        I like my hair.  I mean, it’s not a 
                        thing.  I don’t need it to be 
                        fresh.  But, thanks.
                            (to Emanuela)
                        Race you to the bathrooms!

           She starts off ahead of him.  He laughs, following her.

                                 WYLIE (CONT’D)
                        No fair, cheater!

           When it’s clear Wylie is out of earshot: 

                                 KHALIL
                        You haven’t talked to him yet.

                                 JANE
                        I will.  At the right time.

           Dan and Khalil exchange a look. 

           EXT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - PLAYGROUND - DAY

           Jane watches as Wylie plays with a few GIRLS.  He grabs his 
           satchel and a poster-board and runs toward Jane, giving her a 
           bear hug.

                                 WYLIE
                        Is everything okay?
                                 JANE
                        Yes, sweetie.  Of course.

                                 WYLIE
                        Where’s Emanuela?

                                 JANE
                        She’s taking care of all of those 
                        parking tickets she’s ignored for 
                        months.

                                 WYLIE
                        Oh.  And you’re feeling okay?

           Together they walk toward the parking lot.

                                 JANE
                        I’m fine, honey.

                                 WYLIE
                        Mom.  What’s up with Khalil and 
                        Dan?

                                 JANE
                        What do you mean?

           He shrugs.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        We’ll talk about it in the car.

           This makes Wylie noticeably anxious. There is something weird 
           going on. 

                                 WYLIE
                        In the car?

                                 JANE
                            (switching gears)
                        How was your presentation?

           Wylie holds up his poster-board featuring a bedazzled title: 
           Fashion Through Out The Ages.  An impressive lay out of 
           fabric swatches, and sketches of women’s wear from the 1700’s 
           to present.

                                 WYLIE
                            (making fun of Khalil)
                        It was fresh.  Super fresh.

                                 JANE
                        Did the kids like it?
                                 WYLIE
                        Mostly.

                                 JANE
                        Cameron?

                                 WYLIE
                        Ehhh.  He called me the “f” word.

           Jane stops mid-stride.

                                 JANE
                        Not cool.  I’ll have a meeting with 
                        the principal.  Schedule another 
                        sensitivity training for the kids. 
                        Maybe book a speaker from GLAAD--

                                 WYLIE
                        Mom, Mom!  No, I didn’t finish.  He 
                        called me the other “f” word -- 
                        FABUUUUULOUS!

           Jane looks at him.  Can’t help but smile at her son’s ability 
           to turn bad into good.

           INT. JANE’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

           Jane and Wylie enter.  Wylie is agitated.  Jane is cool 
           headed.  It’s how she deals. 

                                 WYLIE
                        That just doesn’t make any sense!  
                        I don’t want to live with them. 
                        Mom, I don’t want to.

                                 JANE
                        Honey, we’ve talked about this.

                                 WYLIE
                        No, we didn’t.  We never talked 
                        about this. 

           Jane grabs green ingredients from the fridge, lines them up 
           by the blender.  Begins washing and chopping.

                                 JANE
                        Dr. Landry said--

                                 WYLIE
                        No!  Dr. Landry never said you 
                        would choose parents for me.  Or 
                        guardians?  I don’t even know... 
                        what do I call them?  
           Jane crouches to meet Wylie’s gaze.

                                 JANE
                        I know this is hard.  It will take 
                        time, but you can call them 
                        whatever feels right. 

                                 WYLIE
                        I’m not gonna call them anything 
                        because this is wrong.  Mom, It’s 
                        wrong.  You should have asked me. 
                        What about what I want?

                                 JANE
                        Should we work this out with your 
                        therapist?

                                 WYLIE
                        No!  I want to talk to you about it 
                        now.  You can’t keep on hiding 
                        things from me.  I’m not a little 
                        kid.

                                 JANE
                        Honey.  Khalil and Dan are the best 
                        fit.  I’ve known them both for a 
                        long time.

                                 WYLIE
                        But, how?  How do you know they’re 
                        the best?  You can’t know that.

           Jane blends the smoothie to buy time to think an answer...   

                                 JANE
                        Honey, they share our values. 

                                 WYLIE
                        But you don’t know my values.  I 
                        don’t know my values.

                                 JANE
                        They’re educated, progressive, 
                        financially secure, cultured, 
                        and... I know this is hard, Wylie.  
                        But, it’s what we have to do.  One 
                        sleep-over a week.  Okay?

                                 WYLIE
                        No, not okay.  Why can’t Emanuela 
                        be my guardian?  That makes more 
                        sense.
                                 JANE
                        Because... for a million reasons.

                                 WYLIE
                        Give me one.

                                 JANE
                        She’s too young... maybe she 
                        doesn’t want to be a single mom...

                                 WYLIE
                        You wanted to be a single mom.

           This hits Jane.  She covers well.  

                                 JANE
                        And... Emanuela can barely take 
                        care of herself.

           Emanuela enters, ear buds in, jamming to some tunes, she 
           hands a pharmacy bag to Jane. 

                                 WYLIE
                        This is so not right.  I should 
                        have a voice in this!

                                 EMANUELA
                            (removing buds)
                        What’s up with Wy?

                                 WYLIE
                        What’s up?  I’ll tell you what’s up 
                        -- Mom is going to make me live 
                        with Khalil and Dan after she dies!

           Wylie races out of the room.  Jane takes a breath.  Emanuela 
           looks stricken.

                                 EMANUELA
                        Wait... what?  What’s he talking 
                        about?  You’re dying?

                                 JANE
                        Emanuela, you knew that.

           Emanuela becomes increasingly upset, she begins to cry.

                                 EMANUELA
                        No, I didn’t know that.  Oh my God, 
                        Jane.  Oh my God.
                                 JANE
                        But, Em, you drove me to my 
                        appointments, bought my meds... I 
                        thought we talked about this.

           Wylie pokes his head through the doorway, secretly observing.

                                 EMANUELA
                        No we did not talk about this.  I 
                        thought you were just a little 
                        sick.  You don’t look sick. How 
                        could you not tell me?

           Emanuela erupts into sobs.  Wylie runs in and puts his arm 
           around Emanuela, comforts her.

                                 JANE
                        I’m sorry.  I really thought I told 
                        you.

                                 WYLIE
                            (in Spanish, to Emanuela)
                        She has stage four pancreatic 
                        cancer.  They caught it too late. 

                                 EMANUELA
                            (in Spanish)
                        How long did you know?

                                 WYLIE
                            (in Spanish)
                        A while. 
                            (nuzzles into her)
                        It’s going to be okay.  It’s going 
                        to be okay...

           Off Jane loaded with so many conflicting emotions.  

           INT. KHALIL AND DAN’S HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY

           Modern, cold architecture with polished concrete floors.  
           Decked out with expensive art and all of the latest gadgets.  

           Jane and a subdued Wylie follow Dan and Khalil toward a 
           bedroom. 

                                 DAN
                        And, your room is in here.

                                 KHALIL
                        It has an en suite bathroom.
           Wylie doesn’t know what he means.  Offers a weak smile.  They 
           walk into -- 

           INT. KHALIL AND DAN’S HOUSE - GUEST BEDROOM - DAY

           Clean lines.  Minimalist.  It would make for a great feature 
           in an architectural magazine, but not as a child’s bedroom. 

           Wylie looks around.  He appears so small and out of place. 

                                 DAN
                        What do you think?

           He moves toward the platform bed and sits on it.  Doesn’t 
           make eye contact.

                                 WYLIE
                        It’s cool. 

                                 JANE
                        It will look different, Wy.  With 
                        your things, of course. 

           Wylie nods.  Jane moves toward the large window.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        Look, a view of the pool.

           Wylie looks over.

                                 WYLIE
                        Why is it so skinny?

                                 KHALIL
                        It’s a lap pool.  To swim laps.  Do 
                        you like to swim?

           Wylie shrugs. 

           INT. KHALIL AND DAN’S HOUSE - LIVING AREA - DAY

           Wylie sits on a slim modern couch, wireless headphones on, 
           watching a movie on a flat screen.

           THROUGH the large glass slider Jane sits with Khalil and Dan 
           around a gas fire pit. 

           EXT. KHALIL AND DAN’S HOUSE - YARD - DAY

           A flustered Khalil and Dan appear to be tap dancing around a 
           bomb they just dropped on Jane.
                                 KHALIL
                        Oh, no, no, no.  You misunderstood 
                        us.

                                 DAN
                        We’re not backing out.  Of course 
                        not, we just want to know who your 
                        number two was in case...

                                 KHALIL
                        It doesn’t work out.

                                 JANE
                        It has to work out.  There is no 
                        number two.

                                 DAN
                        What about your parents? 

                                 JANE
                        The Southern Baptists?  Really?  
                        They would destroy him.  

                                 KHALIL
                        Right.  Okay... well, we just need 
                        to be clear on certain...

                                 KHALIL (CONT’D)
                        Details.

                                 JANE
                        What details?

                                 KHALIL/DAN
                        Emanuela.

                                 JANE
                        You’re not adopting her.  I don’t 
                        see what the issue is.

                                 DAN
                        Their relationship is kind of, 
                        they’re very -- 

                                 KHALIL
                        Attached.

                                 DAN
                        Intertwined.

                                 KHALIL
                        Don’t you think it would be healthy 
                        for Wylie to individuate from his 
                        nanny?
           Jane stares at them for a beat.  

                                 JANE
                        I need him to be able to somehow 
                        survive this shitty hand he’s been 
                        dealt.  If that means leaning on 
                        the one other person who gets him, 
                        who happens to be his nanny, then 
                        so be it. 

                                 DAN
                        The thing is, I mean that’s fine 
                        and all, I hear you -- we -- hear 
                        you. 

                                 KHALIL
                        We are prepared to bring in one 
                        child, but not two. 

                                 DAN
                        Wherever he goes, she goes.  Our 
                        lifestyle isn’t equipped for that. 

                                 JANE
                        So you want me to find a way to 
                        remove Emanuela from Wylie’s life?

                                 KHALIL
                        No, we’re not saying that, but 
                        maybe just encourage a different 
                        sorta relationship-

                                 DAN
                        Yes.  That’s exactly what we’re 
                        saying.  Sorry.  We can’t have her 
                        bouncing around our house.  I mean, 
                        could you imagine?

           Jane takes this in, Khalil, Dan, the museum-like quality of 
           the home.  How dick-ish her friends suddenly seem.

                                 JANE
                        No.  I guess I cannot. 

           INT. HOSPITAL - PRIVATE ROOM - DAY

           The sterility of the room is over-powering despite efforts of 
           pastel colors, impressionistic prints, and wooden fixtures. 

           Jane speaks with Palliative Care Director, DR. VIJAY.  She 
           holds a clipboard.  Her forced warmth grates on Jane.
                                 JANE
                        Absolutely no one but hospital 
                        staff.  I want to be drugged up, 
                        pain-free and oblivious.  No one 
                        needs to see my wasting away days. 

                                 DR. VIJAY
                        No visitors at all?  What about 
                        your family and loved ones? 

                                 JANE
                        No family.  No friends.  No well-
                        wishers.  Just a shit ton of 
                        opiates. 

                                 DR. VIJAY
                        It says here, you have a son, 
                        wouldn’t he--

                                 JANE
                        My son doesn’t deserve to see what 
                        happens.  I don’t want to do that 
                        to him. 

                                 DR. VIJAY
                        Have you had a conversation about 
                        these desires with your community?   

                                 JANE
                        Community?  No. 

                                 DR. VIJAY
                        People change their mind as 
                        things... progress.  Having a 
                        support system is vital during your 
                        final phase.

                                 JANE
                        Look, I’m here to sign documents.  
                        I don’t need pseudo-spiritual 
                        guidance or a lecture on how to die 
                        properly.  My wishes are clear.   

           Dr. Vijay hands her papers while making intensely concerned 
           eye contact.

                                 DR. VIJAY
                        Here’s my card.  Call me anytime 
                        you'd like to make amendments to 
                        your advanced care plan. 
           INT. WYLIE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Wylie sleeps on the bottom bunk while Emanuela is on top, 
           texting.  She hangs her head over to check on Wylie and then 
           ninja’s her way down.

                                 WYLIE
                        You going to see one of your dudes?

                                 EMANUELA
                        Maybe.

                                 WYLIE
                        Is it a Tinder one or a Cupid one?

                                 EMANUELA
                        A new one.

                                 WYLIE
                        A new “artist” that still lives 
                        with his parents?

           Emanuela jokingly punches Wylie. 

                                 EMANUELA
                        Hey!  No.  He’s a tech guy... who 
                        still lives with his parents.

                                 WYLIE
                        Could you sing me a song?  Before 
                        you leave?

           Emanuela pauses.  And then positions herself by Wylie.

                                 EMANUELA
                        Song roulette?

                                 WYLIE
                        Yeah!

           Wylie grabs her phone and presses shuffle.  He presses PLAY.  
           Kid Cudi’s, “Pursuit of Happiness” plays for a beat.  He 
           stops it. 

                                 WYLIE (CONT’D)
                        Pursuit of Happiness.  Kid Cudi. 

           Emanuela takes a breath and then sings a very languid, 
           beautiful, slow version of the song.  
                                 EMANUELA
                        If I fall if I die know I lived it 
                        to the fullest, If I fall if I die 
                        know I lived and missed some 
                        bullets.  I'm on the pursuit of 
                        happiness and I know everything 
                        that shine ain't always gonna be 
                        gold...

           She has an incredible voice.  Chilling.  Wylie fades off to 
           sleep, a smile on his face.   

           INT. JANE’S OFFICE - NIGHT

           From the spread of coffee cups, empty dishes, note pads, it’s 
           clear Jane hasn’t moved from her desk all night.  Blue tooth 
           head set on, she jots notes on a sheet.

           Emanuela stands in the door frame, knocks on the wall.  

                                 EMANUELA
                        I’m heading out.  Wonder boy is 
                        asleep.    

                                 JANE
                        Okay.  Thanks, Emanuela.

           Emanuela pauses, surveying the scene.  

                                 EMANUELA
                        Can I, is there anything I can do?

                                 JANE
                        Nope.  I’m good. 

           She walks to Jane’s desk, starts looking at her things.  It’s 
           what Emanuela does. 

                                 EMANUELA
                        Have you been calling people all 
                        night? 

                                 JANE
                        Calls, texts, e-mails, i-chat.  A 
                        long process of elimination.  I 
                        didn’t realize how many unreliable 
                        friends I had. 

                                 EMANUELA
                        Well.  It’s LA.  Everyone’s a 
                        little selfish.  You’re a little 
                        selfish.
           Jane looks up from her screen. 

                                 JANE
                        I’m not selfish.  Why would you 
                        think I’m selfish? 

                                 EMANUELA
                        I just mean, it’s different here. 

           Emanuela leans over, reading a SPREAD SHEET, almost knocking 
           a cup of coffee over.

                                 JANE
                        Emanuela... can I have some space, 
                        here?

           Emanuela grabs the spread sheet.  

                                 EMANUELA
                        What about all of these names?  All 
                        of the one’s in the “yes” column?

                                 JANE
                        It’s complicated.
                            (beat)
                        None of those people live in LA. 

                                 EMANUELA
                        So?  What’s wrong with Wylie living 
                        somewhere else?  

                                 JANE
                        I need to vet out the families.  I 
                        haven’t seen some of those people 
                        in ages.  

           Emanuela’s cell DINGS.  As Emanuela makes for the door...

                                 EMANUELA
                        Well, you gotta figure something 
                        out ‘cuz if you don’t he’s just 
                        gonna end up with your parents. 

                                 JANE
                        I will never let that happen. 

           Emanuela shrugs.  Jane thinks for a moment.  She looks back 
           at the spread sheet. 

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        What do you think about going on a 
                        road trip?
                                 EMANUELA
                        Me and Wylie?

                                 JANE
                        No.  The three of us. 

                                 EMANUELA
                        I think that’s rad.  But you?  On 
                        the road? 

                                 JANE
                        I can handle it. 

                                 EMANUELA
                        You can only stand being in a car 
                        for as long as a venti latte lasts 
                        you.

                                 JANE
                        I guess we’ll drink a lot of 
                        lattes.

            Off Emanuela looking at Jane, unsure. 

           INT. WYLIE’S BEDROOM - MORNING

           Jane crouches by Wylie’s bedside.  She rubs his head.

                                 JANE
                        I love you, son. 

            He stirs.  Blinks his eyes. 

                                 WYLIE
                            (mutters)
                        I love you, mama. 

           This is clearly an exchange they do all of the time.

                                 JANE
                        We’re going to do this together, 
                        okay?  You were right.  You deserve 
                        to have a say.  

                                 WYLIE
                        Huh?

                                 JANE
                        We’re going to meet some old 
                        friends of mine, really good people 
                        who want to take care of you.
                                 WYLIE
                        And, I can make the choice?  

                                 JANE
                        Yes, together we can -- but we’re 
                        driving cross country so you gotta 
                        get up, and get ready--

           Wylie’s eyes BULGE.

                                 WYLIE
                        Wait, wait, wait -- For real!?!

           Jane nods.  He jumps up.

                                 WYLIE (CONT’D)
                        And, you’re coming too?

                                 JANE
                        Of course I’m coming. 

                                 WYLIE
                        O.M.GEEEEE.  I’m going to put 
                        together an insane road trip 
                        wardrobe.  This is the best thing 
                        ever, Mom!

           He grabs her and gives her a huge hug.  

           EXT. JANE’S HOUSE - DAY

           Jane, iPad in hand, methodically re-counts the luggage and 
           large cooler that is neatly lined up by her HYBRID SUV.   

           ANGLE ON EMANUELA

           She leans against the front steps.  Still in her PJS and 
           serious bedhead.  A backpack by her side.  Not quite awake. 

           Wylie comes BURSTING through the front door in his road trip 
           ensemble -- Lily Pulitzer skinny palm tree pants, a billowy 
           pink tee, a scarf tied on his neck, a fedora. 

                                 JANE
                        Wylie, is that my shirt?

                                 WYLIE
                        Yeah.  I wanted to dress like the 
                        smile I feel inside.   

           How can Jane argue with that?  He does a cute dance routine 
           down the stairs.
                                 WYLIE (CONT’D)
                        It works, right?  It totally says 
                        adventure.  But, with a glamour 
                        twist of course. 

                                 JANE
                            (carefully)
                        You might want to tone it down for 
                        the road.

                                 WYLIE
                        What do you mean? 

                                 JANE
                        Not everywhere is like LA. 

           Wylie still doesn’t get it. 

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        Emanuela, are you going to get 
                        ready?

                                 EMANUELA
                        I am ready.   

           PRE-LAP:

                                 JANE
                        We’ve got three definites lined up.

           INT. HYBRID - SUV - DAY

           Standstill traffic.  Jane, at the wheel, passes out LAMINATED 
           SCHEDULES to Wylie and Emanuela who are in the back.

                                 JANE
                        And two alternate families, just in 
                        case.

                                 EMANUELA
                        Sounds likes you’re organizing a 
                        baseball team.

                                 JANE
                        I also e-mailed you both a copy of 
                        the itinerary.  

                                 WYLIE
                        I have an e-mail address? 

                                 JANE
                        I set it up for you when you were 
                        born.  It’s your name, at gmail.
                                 WYLIE
                            (playful)
                        Radical, mom.  Radical.  

           EXT. 10 FREEWAY - DAY

           The HYBRID SUV inches through the morning slog.  And then it 
           breaks free, leaving Los Angeles. 

           Wylie and Emanuela put their hands out their windows, feeling 
           the air rush through their fingers. 

           EXT. REST AREA - DAY

           Quaint in the middle of nowhere.  Picnic tables.  A wooden 
           structure that houses rest rooms and vending machines. 

           Families mill about.  Jane walks briskly toward the rest 
           room.  Emanuela and Wylie amble toward the picnic tables.  
           Many people stare at Wylie’s outfit. 

                                 EMANUELA
                        Check it out!  Do you see that 
                        bird’s nest?

           Emanuela darts toward the tree.  

           A KID, 10 approaches Wylie.  

                                 KID
                        Are you a fairy or are you a fruit? 

           Wylie looks at the kid. 

                                 WYLIE
                        I don’t believe in labels.  They’re 
                        not healthy. 

                                 KID
                        Well, where I come from, we kick 
                        the sweat outta freaks like you.   

           The kid moves closer to Wylie.  Attempting to intimidate him.  
           But instead, Wylie holds his ground and his innocence. 

                                 WYLIE
                        Why?  

                                 KID
                        Because... because we don’t like 
                        weirdos. 
                                 WYLIE
                        Why?  Weirdos make life more 
                        interesting. 

                                 KID
                        No they don’t.     

                                 WYLIE
                        Well, maybe someday you’ll get it. 

           Wylie shrugs and runs toward Emanuela.  Through an 
           unfortunate amount of practice, he has learned how bullies 
           sniff out fear and sadness and he’s become adept at hiding 
           both. 

                                 KID
                            (yelling after him)
                        I betcha your dad is a fruit too!

           OFF Wylie processing this last insult. 

           INT. REST AREA - REST ROOM - DAY

           Jane stands by the sink, popping pills from her designer pill 
           organizer.  A TEEN watches her, curious.  There are A LOT.

                                 JANE
                        Vitamins.  They’re really important 
                        for your health.   

           The teen nods politely.   

           EXT. REST AREA - DAY

           Wylie and Emanuela marvel over the nest.  Careful not to 
           disturb it, he takes a few pictures.

                                 WYLIE
                        What’s a spirit animal?

                                 EMANUELA
                        An animal that has special meaning 
                        to you, a connection.  Birds always 
                        remind me of my dad. 

                                 WYLIE
                        Because he’s a spirit now?  

                                 EMANUELA
                        My dad used to say I learned to 
                        sing from them.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 EMANUELA (CONT'D)
                        They would perch by my window and 
                        chirp at me when I was a baby.  My 
                        family used to call me Little Bird.  

           Wylie studies the nest, so much running through his mind.  

                                 WYLIE
                        How did you deal with it, Emanuela? 
                        Losing your dad? 

                                 EMANUELA
                        Music.  Music is how I always deal.

                                 WYLIE
                            (in Spanish)
                        Do they still call you Little Bird?

                                 EMANUELA
                        Not so much.    

                                 WYLIE
                            (in Spanish)
                        Why not?  

                                 EMANUELA
                        I guess I grew up. 

           She messes with his hair.     

           INT./EXT. HYBRID - SUV - DAY

           Jane sits in the front.  Wylie comes racing in like a rocket. 

                                 WYLIE
                        Ma!  I got the best idea EVER!

           Emanuela climbs in with a can of soda.

                                 JANE
                        Oh, no.  No drinking or eating in 
                        the car.  Only water and lattes.

                                 WYLIE
                        But, mom.  You’re the only one who 
                        drinks lattes. 

                                 JANE
                        We eat when we stop.  That’s the 
                        rule.  What’s your idea, Wylie? 

           Emanuela steps out of the car and chugs her soda.  Draping 
           himself over the front seat: 
                                 WYLIE
                        Oh my god, oh my god, okay.  What 
                        about my biological dad, mom? 

                                 JANE
                        What about him?

                                 WYLIE
                        Let’s find him!  

                                 JANE
                        That’s... honey, we can’t do that.  
                        He was a sperm donor.  The 
                        information is confidential.  

                                 WYLIE
                        Yeah, I know.  But, everyone gets a 
                        cancer wish.  And, I mean, I don’t 
                        want to take yours away from you, 
                        but maybe part of your wish could 
                        be to find out who he is.  And we 
                        can meet him. 

           Wylie smiles brightly.  A smile that could break your heart.

                                 JANE
                        I don’t think so, Wylie.

                                 WYLIE
                        I mean, I’m not saying like, he 
                        would want to be my dad or 
                        anything.  But, we share the same 
                        DNA.  So, maybe we would just kinda 
                        click, you know?

                                 JANE
                        I’m really sorry, Wylie.  That’s 
                        just not a possibility. 

                                 WYLIE
                        Mom.  You always tell me anything 
                        is possible.

                                 JANE
                        Well.  Not this.  

           Wylie slumps back into his seat.  

           INT. HYBRID - SUV - LATER - DAY

           Wylie and Emanuela are in the back, belting out 80’s tunes, 
           dancing.  Having a blast. 
                                 WYLIE
                        Come on, Mom!  Join for the chorus!  
                        Shake your booty in the seat!

           She doesn’t respond.  Wylie notices that she has ear buds in.  
           He looks at Emanuela and shrugs.

           INT. HYBRID - SUV - LATER - DUSK

           Jane concentrates on the road, sans ear buds.  Suddenly:

                                 EMANUELA
                        Oh, my God!  Oh, my God!  Stop the 
                        car!

           Jane, startled, swerves and slows toward the shoulder.

                                 JANE
                        What’s wrong?

                                 EMANUELA
                        Look!

           Emanuela points to a mama deer on the side of the road with a 
           few calves. 

                                 JANE
                        Emanuela... we’ve got a schedule.

                                 WYLIE
                        Mom!  If we don’t do anything they 
                        will die!  We have to do something.  
                        We have to!  

           EXT. ROAD - MOMENTS LATER

           Emanuela, Wylie, and Jane shoo the deer so they run toward 
           the hills, away from the road.

           Wylie glances up at the incredible starlit sky.  He focuses 
           on a star.  Squeezes his eyes shut.  Makes a silent wish. 

           INT. HYBRID - SUV - NIGHT

           Jane, fighting exhaustion at the wheel.  

           Emanuela CHEWS GUM.  Suddenly it falls out of her mouth and 
           lands on the seat. 

           Wylie and Emanuela look at each other, covering their mouths.  
           They try to scrape it off, while holding back laughter. 
           INT. HYBRID - SUV - LATER

           Emanuela’s head leans against the window.  Her eyes go WIDE.

                                 EMANUELA
                        Check out that moon!  I’ve never 
                        seen anything like that!

                                 WYLIE
                        Awwwww, cool... it’s like a 
                        painting!  Ma, can we stop?  Can 
                        we?  I wanna take a picture. 

                                 JANE
                        Guys, we can’t do this.  I’m not 
                        going to make it if we stop every 
                        time we see something interesting 
                        or beautiful.  It’s not that kind 
                        of trip.  I’m sorry, kids.  We have 
                        a time limit.

           Wylie presses his face against the window.  Watching the moon 
           race alongside him.  

           EXT. HOTEL - COLLEGE TOWN - BOULDER, CO

           The SUV pulls up to the VALET.  Inside, Wylie sleeps.  Jane 
           and Emanuela quietly pull luggage from the car.  

           Emanuela offers to help Jane with a large suitcase.

                                 JANE
                        I’m fine, I’m fine.  

           Emanuela backs off.  But watches Jane to make sure.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        I’m not there yet.  Okay.  I’m not 
                        an invalid.  By the time I get to a 
                        point where I can’t carry my own 
                        crap, I’ll be out of sight.  So, 
                        you can stop worrying about me.  

           Emanuela glances in the car.  Wylie is still asleep.

                                 EMANUELA
                        Jane, is there anything you want to 
                        do?  Before you, you know... it’s 
                        too late.     

           Jane is annoyed. 
                                 JANE
                        No.  It’s fine.  It’s all really 
                        fine.   

                                 EMANUELA
                        When my dad passed away, it was 
                        sudden.  I wished we could have had 
                        one last party, or trip or 
                        anything.

                                 JANE
                        Well, that’s not me.  I’ve taken 
                        care of what I’ve needed to take 
                        care of.   

           Wylie tumbles out of the car, waking up.  He looks around.

                                 WYLIE
                        Air feels different here.  Smells 
                        like trees and earth.  

                                 JANE
                        This is my college town. 

           Wylie, Jane and Emanuela head for the entrance.

                                 WYLIE
                            (doing a dance)
                        Campus tour!  Campus tour! 

                                 JANE
                        Maybe.  I’m doing a book signing at 
                        the local shop.  So, if we can fit 
                        it in.

                                 WYLIE
                        Whattttt?  But, it’s not on the 
                        itinerary. 

                                 JANE
                        I e-mailed you both an addendum.   

                                 WYLIE
                        We don’t have time for that, mom.  
                        It’s not that kind of a trip.  
                        Don’t we have a schedule?   

           Jane feels uncomfortable hearing him regurgitate her words. 
           INT. BOOK STORE - DAY

           ON a display of Jane’s books and several large poster boards 
           announcing her appearance.

           Jane, in her element, behind a table, signs books, engages 
           her fans.  This is where she shines -- in the small moments 
           of surface adoration, she draws people in, making them feel 
           like she is the best friend they always wanted. 

           ANGLE ON WYLIE

           Between bookshelves, crouched in hiding.  Emanuela POUNCES 
           into frame.  He YELPS.  And then, RUNS away from her.  

           BACK ON JANE

           A bright smile as she chats with a PATRON.

                                 JANE
                        Totally!  The mint-orange smoothie 
                        is my morning crack, basically.    

                                 PATRON
                        It seriously helped me kick my 
                        coffee habit.  I feel like a 
                        thousand times younger.   

           Jane opens her book to sign.

                                 JANE
                        Awww, that makes me so happy to 
                        hear!  What’s your name?

                                 PATRON
                        Gigi, G, I, G--

           Suddenly Jane’s face BLANCHES. She gets up quickly.

                                 JANE
                        I’m sorry.  I gotta.  I just need 
                        to uh, do something.  

           Jane makes a bee-line toward the maze of towering book 
           shelves.  Emanuela watches, amused, curious.   

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                            (whispering)
                        Fuck, fuck, fuck...

           She grabs a large book, and buries herself in it when-- 
                                 MALE VOICE
                        Well, well, well, if it ain’t Janie 
                        Worthington, come to grace us with 
                        her bright, shining presence...  

           Reveal LEVI, 40’s, attractive in that roughed up don’t-even-
           gotta-try way.  Probably has a shadow of a beard too.  

                                 JANE
                        Actually, it’s Jane Skye, now.

                                 LEVI
                        Ohhhh, right.  Like it says on your 
                        books.  You got hitched, did ya?  
                        Well, shit.  Some of us gotta grow 
                        up, I guess. 

                                 EMANUELA
                        No.  She changed her name for 
                        marketing purposes.

           Jane looks at Emanuela like, where did you come from?  Levi 
           can’t take his eyes off of Jane. 

                                 LEVI
                        Huh.  Is that right?  No ring, no 
                        man, no problemo. 
                            (to Emanuela)
                        Sorry, I’m Levi.  Levi Jones.  
                        Janie and I go wayyyyy back.  

           She shakes his hand.  Sizing him up.

                                 EMANUELA
                        Emanuela.  I take care of Wylie.

                                 LEVI
                        Wylie?  Who’s Wylie?  You gotta 
                        dog?  You hate animals. 

                                 EMANUELA
                        Guess you go a little too far back. 

                                 LEVI
                        What are you doing here anyway, 
                        sunshine?   

                                 JANE
                        I’m on a book tour.  

                                 EMANUELA
                        She’s dying from cancer and trying 
                        to find her son a home. 
           Jane glares at Emanuela.  Levi looks like he’s been kicked in 
           the gut.

                                 JANE
                        Thank you, Emanuela.  

                                 LEVI
                        Seriously?  Jane?

                                 JANE
                        It’s not a big deal, okay.     

                                 LEVI
                        What?  Not a big deal?
                            (letting it land)
                        Shit...

                                 JANE
                        Look.  I’m not that girl.  I don’t 
                        need pity.  I’ve come to terms and 
                        all of that.  We really gotta -- It 
                        was nice seeing you, Levi.

           Jane walks away.  Levi follows her.  

                                 LEVI
                        Janie.  You can’t just do that.  I 
                        mean, come on.  Let me at least... 
                        buy you a drink, or lunch, or a 
                        ticket to Cabo.    

           He puts his hand on her shoulder.  His touch floods her with 
           a sense memory she can’t fight.

                                 LEVI (CONT’D)
                        Please.  My shack has the best BBQ 
                        in the state.

                                 JANE
                        You own a restaurant?

                                 LEVI
                        I don’t own nothing, and nothing 
                        owns me. 
                            (beat)
                        I manage from time to time in 
                        between various adventures.   

           Wylie pops in, out of no where.

                                 WYLIE
                        Did you say BBQ?  Oh my god, mom, 
                        pleeeeease.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 WYLIE (CONT'D)
                        If I have one more tofu-cup, my gut 
                        is going to bust open and cry. 

                                 LEVI
                        Tofu what?  Duuuude... I’ll fix you 
                        up something that will blow your 
                        mind. 

           Off Wylie’s shining smile. 

           INT. EFFIE’S BBQ & SPORTS GRILLE - DAY

           Jane, Levi, Emanuela, and Wylie sit in a booth.  Everyone is 
           covered in BBQ sauce except for Jane. 

           Wylie is wrapped up in Levi’s story telling.  Emanuela holds 
           a careful, cool watchful eye on Levi.  

                                 LEVI
                        So, we had been walking around for 
                        hours and hours, it was crazy-hot 
                        Indian Summer hot, I swear to God.  
                        And your mom, you know, alls she 
                        got are her flip-flops and pretty 
                        little toes, and they are blistered 
                        as Fuuu-- 
                            (re: Jane/Wylie)
                        Fudge buckets.  They are beat up.  
                        We just lost track of time.  This 
                        is before cell phones.  We don’t 
                        have a wallet.  But, your mom, 
                        see... she’s got the brains.  Has 
                        the most genius idea --

                                 WYLIE
                        Hitch hike like in the movies?

                                 LEVI
                        Nooooo, man.  Your mom is way 
                        classier than that. 

                                 JANE
                        Yeah, Wylie.  That’s not safe.  You 
                        know that, right?

                                 WYLIE
                        Yeah, yeah, just go on with the 
                        story.

                                 LEVI
                        She marches into a pizza shop.  
                        Orders a pizza to be delivered to 
                        our dorm.

                                 LEVI (CONT'D)
                        And asks the delivery guy if we can 
                        catch a ride.  Brilliant, right?

                                 WYLIE
                        You rode in the pizza car?

                                 LEVI
                        Well, no.  They wouldn’t let us go.  
                        Something about liability bull 
                        crap.

                                 WYLIE
                        So, what’d you do?

                                 LEVI
                        The only sensible thing.  Carried 
                        your mom on my back for two miles 
                        until we got back to the dorm.

           Emanuela can’t stand it.  So done with Levi.

                                 EMANUELA
                            (to self)
                        Oh, God. 

                                 WYLIE
                        No wayyyyy.

                                 LEVI
                        Way.

                                 WYLIE
                        Wait.  How long ago were you guys 
                        engaged?

           Levi and Jane exchange a look.  Who should answer?

                           LEVI
           Thirteen years ago.
                                                         JANE
                                             A long time ago.

           Wylie quickly does the math on his hand.  Darn it.  Levi’s 
           not his dad. 

                                 WYLIE (CONT’D)
                        Tell us another story!!

                                 LEVI
                        Oh, well there’s the one when we 
                        drove to Mexico --

                                 JANE
                        No.  Enough.  Let’s move onto 
                        something else.
                                 EMANUELA
                        Yeah, please. 

                                 LEVI
                        Alright, alright.  How about this?

           He pulls our a roll of quarters, motions to the arcade games. 

                                 LEVI (CONT’D)
                        Have at it.

           Wylie grabs them, jumps up excited.  Emanuela follows him, 
           but eyes Levi.  She does not like him. 

                                 JANE
                            (re: BBQ)
                        This is your recipe.

                                 LEVI
                        Indeed it is. 

                                 JANE
                        It’s gotten better over time.

                                 LEVI
                        Many things get better over time. 

           He winks.  And then --

                                 LEVI (CONT’D)
                        Jane.  Let me come with you on this 
                        trip.  As back up.

                                 JANE
                        What?  Levi...

                                 LEVI
                        First stop is Telluride?

                                 JANE
                        Yeah...?  Oh, right.  I got it.  A 
                        free ride.   

           Levi is noticeably insulted. 

                                 LEVI
                        Noooooooo.  That’s not it.  I’ve 
                        got mad slope skills. I can teach 
                        your kid how to handle the pow.

                                 JANE
                        Uh, yeah.  That’s not going to 
                        happen. 
           Levi cocks his head.

                                 LEVI
                        Oh, Jane.  It’s our song.  It’s a 
                        sign...

                                 JANE
                        We don’t have a song. 

           As The Talking Heads, “This Must be the Place” plays, Levi 
           pulls Jane out of the booth.  

                                 LEVI
                            (singing)
                        Heyyyy I got plenty of time... you 
                        got light in your eyes... Never for 
                        money, always for love...

           Jane shakes her head but enjoys being twirled and dipped as 
           Levi states his case. 

                                 LEVI (CONT’D)
                        Look.  Thing is.  My friend’s dad 
                        had your cancer and you know, he 
                        was good until he wasn’t.  Boom.  
                        It hit him.  

           ANGLE ON

           Wylie watching his mom dancing.  His face lights up.  He 
           loves to see her this way. 

                                 LEVI (CONT’D)
                        I know you love to fly your Lil 
                        Miss Independence flag like a 
                        champ, but come on.  If something 
                        happens.  You don’t want your kid 
                        to have to deal.

                                 JANE
                        I’ve got Emanuela.  I’ve got a cell 
                        phone.  I’ve got a plan.

                                 LEVI
                        She’s a grown kid.  I mean, look, 
                        it takes one to know one, right?  
                        Janie-pie.  Just, let me do the 
                        right thing.

           Off Levi’s infectious half-smile.  As if he’s already won the 
           battle. 
           EXT. HYBRID SUV - DAY

           Jane leans into the car, gathering various pieces of trash, 
           water bottles, etc. in mid-convo with Emanuela. 

                                 EMANUELA
                        What?!?  He’s going to totally 
                        wreck our vibe!  He’s so schmarmy.  
                        He’s like one of those bros, you 
                        know?  Ugh.  I vote no.

                                 JANE
                        Sorry, there isn’t a vote on this 
                        one.

                                 EMANUELA
                        How come you never mentioned him 
                        before?  Huh?

                                 JANE
                        Because, it was a long time ago.  
                        And-- 

                                 EMANUELA
                        Lemme guess, he screwed you over?

           Jane doesn’t respond. 

                                 EMANUELA (CONT’D)
                        He just wants to get into your 
                        pants.

                                 JANE
                        Emanuela.  

                                 EMANUELA
                        Jane.

                                 JANE
                        I’m sure he’s got plenty of eager 
                        women in his rotation.  And, I am 
                        definitely not one of them. 

           Levi appears with Wylie on his shoulders, and a total bro-
           travel bag slung on his shoulder.

                                 EMANUELA
                            (sotto)
                        Yeah, we’ll see.  

                                 WYLIE
                        Emanuela!  Take a photo!
                                 EMANUELA
                        My batteries are low.

           INT. HYBRID - SUV - DAY

           Levi is at the wheel.  Jane rests her head on the window.  He 
           looks at her, smiles.  Feels like the good guy.

           Levi starts singing to himself.  Rapping his hands on the 
           steering wheel.  A song akin to “Sweet Home Alabama.”

           Emanuela can’t stand it.

                                 EMANUELA
                        That’s not how it goes.  You are so 
                        out of tune.  It’s insulting to 
                        Lynrd Skynrd. 

                                 LEVI
                        Oh, yeah?  Can you do it better?

           Wylie smiles big.  He nudges Emanuela. 

           Emanuela BELTS OUT a few lines.  It’s absolutely stunning.  
           And she knows it.

                                 LEVI (CONT’D)
                        Well, where in the hell did that 
                        come from?

           Jane stirs awake.

                                 WYLIE
                        She’s gonna be famous some day.  
                        She came to the states because a 
                        record company wanted to sign her, 
                        right, Em?

                                 LEVI
                        Is that so?

                                 EMANUELA
                        Yeah, what did you think?  Just 
                        because I’m Latina I only do 
                        domestic work?

                                 LEVI
                        What happened with the record 
                        company?

           Emanuela looks away.  It’s a sore spot for her.  Wylie knows 
           this so...
                                 WYLIE
                        Okay.  I made personal score card 
                        sheets so we can all rate the 
                        families.   

           Wylie passes out the sheets. 

                                 JANE
                        That’s clever, Wylie.

           He passes TWO up front.  Emanuela notices.

                                 EMANUELA
                        Why are you giving him a vote?   He 
                        doesn’t know you.

                                 WYLIE
                        Fun for everyone.

                                 LEVI
                        What’s the scoring system, Wy?

           Emanuela simmers at Levi’s use of his nickname.

                                 WYLIE
                        Well, I’m working on it.  I listed 
                        a few things that mom’s mentioned 
                        before, educated, has money--  

                                 JANE
                        Financially secure, Wylie.

                                 LEVI
                        Is there a difference? 

                                 WYLIE
                            (reading from ipad)
                        Our first family is your college 
                        bestie, mom?  Becca and her 
                        husband, Jon.

                                 LEVI
                        Oh, good ol’ Becca Beef Squirt!  
                        What the hell is she doing in a ski 
                        town?

           Levi chuckles.  Jane shoots him a look.

                                 LEVI (CONT’D)
                        Sorry.  She just, you know, was 
                        short and beefy... and that was...
                                 EMANUELA
                        A really un-cool, dick nickname for 
                        her?  

                                 LEVI
                        Ahhhh, it was a joke.  We were all 
                        having fun. 

                                 WYLIE
                        Can I see a picture? 

           Jane eyes Levi as if to say: See what you did?

                                 JANE
                        It’s on the iPad in the road trip 
                        folder. 

           ON the photo.  She is in fact a short, round, mousy woman. 

                                 WYLIE
                        Stats?

                                 JANE
                        She’s an anthropology professor at 
                        Brown.  But she’s taking a hiatus 
                        to write one of her academic papers 
                        in Telluride.  

                                 WYLIE
                        Is she... fun?

                                 JANE
                        She’s a very passionate teacher.  
                        Super bright, responsible, 
                        caring...

                                 WYLIE
                        Boring?

                                 JANE
                        Wylie.

                                 WYLIE
                        JK mom.

           Wylie glances at Emanuela and they both quietly make a big 
           “X” mark on their voting card. 

           EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - TELLURIDE, COLORADO - DAY

           The SUV makes it way up the winding pass.  The green and 
           brown landscape gives way to patches of snow and ice. 
           EXT. TELLURIDE TOWN - DAY

           An old mining community turned ski town.  Colorful VICTORIAN 
           homes dot the quaint streets.  The massive mountain offers a 
           dramatic view from almost every angle of town. 

           Our crew approaches one of the VICTORIAN homes, LOUD hip-hop 
           music blasts from within.

                                 WYLIE
                        What’s that smell?

                                 JANE
                        Maybe I got the address wrong.

                                 LEVI
                        That would be grade-A ganja. 

                                 WYLIE
                        What’s ganja?

                                 JANE
                        It’s nothing.  It’s an herb.  It’s--

                                 EMANUELA
                        Legal here.  

                                 JANE
                        Something we’ll talk about later. 

                                 EMANUELA
                        The whole town smells like it.  

           Levi rings the bell.  A beat.  Music goes off. 

           The door swings open and all JAWS DROP as they are greeted by 
           a very different BECCA, 40’s.  Petite, tight body, newly done 
           breasts, a Hollywood Housewife kind of outfit. 

                                 JANE
                        Becca?

                                 LEVI
                        Holy.  Me.  Oh.  My...

                                 BECCA
                        Jane!!

           Becca pulls Jane into a big hug.  Levi can’t take his eyes 
           off Becca, who clearly has been hitting the bong.  

                                 JANE
                        Becca, you look so...
                                 BECCA
                        I know, I know.  I’ll catch you up 
                        on the metamorphosis as my 
                        colleagues have so endearingly 
                        labeled it.  You look the same!  
                        Healthy. 

           It wasn’t meant to, but this stings Jane.  

                                 BECCA (CONT’D)
                        Come on in, come on in...

           INT. BECCA’S HOUSE - LIVING AREA - CONTINUOUS

           The typical ski shack rental that hasn’t been updated in 
           decades but offers a nostalgic kind of comfort.    

           Becca extends her hand to Wylie, who doesn’t know what hit 
           him. 

                                 BECCA
                        You must be the progeny. It’s a 
                        pleasure to meet you, Wylie Jameson 
                        Skye.
                            (extends hand)
                        And, Emanuela Ortega. 
                            (to Jane)
                        I did my homework. 

                                 WYLIE
                        I like your earrings. 

                                 BECCA
                            (leaning in)
                        I recently discovered on-line 
                        shopping.  It’s quite efficient. 
                            (and then)
                        Levi?  Are you two...

                                 JANE
                        No, no.  He’s just along for...

                                 LEVI
                        Wherever the wild road may take us. 

                                 JANE
                        Support.  Where’s Jon? 

                                 BECCA
                        Oh, we’re on hiatus too.  Exploring 
                        different lifestyles.   
                                 JANE
                        When did that happen?

                                 BECCA
                        Few years ago.  

           BYRON, 22, traipses through in the b.g., half-dressed in 
           snowboarding gear.  Inexplicably he is shirtless.   

                                 JANE
                        You have roommates? 

                                 BECCA
                        When the need arises.     

           Byron heads to the door and gives Becca a pat on the butt. 

                                 BYRON
                        See ya, babe.  

           He nods to the rest of our gang and is out.   

                                 BECCA
                        So, how about a tour of my humble 
                        habitat? 

           Jane’s mind is spinning.  

                                 JANE
                        Bathroom?  Where’s a bathroom?

                                 BECCA
                        Oh, just down the right, that way.

           Jane grabs Levi and makes a bee-line. 

           INT. BECCA’S HOUSE - BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           A tight airport-like bathroom.  Jane pulls Levi in with her.  
           Whispering:

                                 JANE
                        What the fuck?!?  I mean, what the 
                        fuck!?! 

           Levi is so entertained by all of this.

                                 LEVI
                        Right?  That’s some serious body 
                        swap, Freaky Friday shit going on 
                        back there.      

           Jane begins to breath fast.  Nearing a panic attack. 
                                 JANE
                        This isn’t a joke. 
                            (breathing rate increases)
                        I don’t know what happened to the 
                        Becca I knew, but this isn’t good.  
                        We need an escape plan.  

           She sits down on the ground.  Beginning to hyperventilate. 

                                 LEVI
                        Jane? 

                                 JANE
                        We can’t stay here.  We gotta go. 

           Jane tries to get up, but can’t.  Levi sits on the ground, 
           their knees touching, he grabs her face. 

                                 LEVI
                        Janie.  Look at me.  Follow my 
                        breathing.  Slooooooow.  Okay? 

           She nods.  Attempts to take in a slow breath.   

                                 LEVI (CONT’D)
                        It’s all gonna be alright.  Say it 
                        with me...

                                 JANE
                        It’s.... 

           Not really working.  She takes in more breaths.

                                 LEVI
                        I promise you, your sweet little 
                        Becca Beef Squirt still resides in 
                        that newly tight and tan bod of 
                        hers.  She’s gonna be a fine 
                        parent.  

                                 JANE
                        I need... my emergency... Xanex.

                                 LEVI
                        Okay, Okay.  I gotcha.  Whatever I 
                        can do. 

           She points to her purse.  Levi quickly fishes out a PILL 
           BOTTLE.  He pulls out the ONE PILL, it FALLS from his hand, 
           BOUNCES off the sink and lands in the toilet. 
           INT. BECCA’S HOUSE - GUEST BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Becca stands with Wylie and Emanuela in a small, bare bones 
           bedroom. 

                                 BECCA
                        If you should choose to live with 
                        me, this would be your room.  

                                 EMANUELA
                        Can he paint the walls or decorate 
                        it?  

                                 BECCA
                        Of course.  Paint, hang pictures, 
                        new furniture.  I’m a huge 
                        proponent of self-expression in all 
                        forms.     

           Emanuela’s phone RINGS.  She looks at it.  Silences it. 

                                 WYLIE
                        Your mom again? 

            Emanuela pulls the curtains.  Looks out the window. 

                                 WYLIE (CONT’D)
                        Don’t you think you should call her 
                        back?

                                 EMANUELA
                        I will.  I try to average a call a 
                        week.  

                                 WYLIE
                            (correcting)
                        Bi-weekly. 

                                 BECCA
                        Emanuela, there’s a room for you 
                        too. 

           Emanuela is caught off guard.  She and Wylie follow Becca 
           into...

           INT. BECCA’S HOUSE - HALLWAY/SECOND BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Pieces of Byron’s temporary stay can be found in here -- 
           boots, caps, boxers. 

                                 BECCA
                        This will all be cleared out. 
                                 EMANUELA
                        Oh, Okay.

                                 BECCA
                        I don’t know what the arrangement 
                        is, but you’re welcome to stay with 
                        us.

           Emanuela is uncomfortable.  Is this what she wants?

                                 WYLIE
                        Awesome!  We share a wall.  We can 
                        create a secret knocking code.

                                 BECCA
                        I’m going to check on your mom.  
                        Feel free to explore the house. 

           Becca heads out, while Wylie studies Emanuela for a beat.  

                                 WYLIE
                        What do you think?

                                 EMANUELA
                        It doesn’t matter what I think, 
                        it’s up to you bud--

           Emanuela’s phone DINGS with a text.  She sighs, reading it.  

                                 WYLIE
                        Just call her. 

                                 EMANUELA
                        I’ve run out of spin.

                                 WYLIE
                        What do you mean?

                                 EMANUELA
                        Nothing.  She’s just always hoping 
                        I’ve got good news. 

                                 WYLIE
                        About your music?

                                 EMANUELA
                        No matter how many years go by, she 
                        doesn’t give up...

           INT. BECCA’S HOUSE - BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Jane is in worse condition.  Sweating, now full-on 
           hyperventilating.  Becca and Levi are squished in there.  
           Becca hands her a CANDY CHEW.

                                 BECCA
                        Take this.  It’s the closest thing 
                        to an anxioltytic-- 

                                 LEVI
                        Anxio-what?

                                 BECCA
                        Xanex.  But, better. 

                                 JANE
                        What... is... it?

                                 BECCA
                        It’s an edible.

                                 JANE
                        Pot?!?

                                 BECCA
                        You used to smoke all of the time 
                        in college.    

                                 JANE
                        I’m a mother...  Wylie needs...

                                 LEVI
                        Wylie needs you to not be freaking 
                        out.  It’s the best we can do.  If 
                        anything goes wrong, I’ll take you 
                        to the ER. 

                                 JANE
                        Promise?

           He nods.  She takes the candy and eats it.  

           ON JANE -- LATER

           Seated.  A dopey, happy grin.  

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        This is so nice.  It’s like a 
                        bubble bath without the water.  
                        Becca, you were right.  
                            (and then)
                        Wait, are we moving?  Why are we 
                        moving?

           Jane laughs as we reveal we are:
           INT. GONDOLA - DAY

           Jane sits between Wylie and Levi.  Opposite her are Becca and 
           a SKIER who is amused by Jane.

                                 WYLIE
                        Mom.  You wanted to take a ride to 
                        see the mountain.  Remember? 

           Jane shrugs and smiles.  Content with it all. 

                                 BECCA
                        It’s the medicine, Wylie.       

                                 LEVI
                        She’ll return to her type-A persona 
                        soon enough.  You should really 
                        enjoy it, kid while it lasts.  

                                 JANE
                        If I’m type-A, then you’re type-Z, 
                        Levi.  Zippity-Z.   

                                 LEVI
                        Okay, cowgirl.  

           Wylie snaps photos with his phone. 

                                 WYLIE
                        Look!  A bunch of moguls!  Levi, do 
                        you ski moguls?

                                 LEVI
                        Sure do.  Maybe you will too, 
                        someday.

                                 WYLIE
                        They make such beautiful patterns.  
                        It’s like snow art.   

           Or maybe not.  

                                 JANE
                        Where’s Emanuela?

                                 WYLIE
                        She’s afraid of heights. 

                                 JANE
                        Oh.  I don’t think she likes snow 
                        either.  

           For seemingly no reason at all, Jane grabs Levi’s hand.  He 
           glances at her, smiles, as she gazes out the window. 
           INT. BECCA HOUSE - LIVING AREA - NIGHT

           Jane, in a cute wintery get-up grabs her jacket.  Becca 
           primps herself in the mirror.  Wylie approaches in PJ’s.

                                 WYLIE
                        Why can’t I go with you? 

                                 JANE
                        It’s a book party, you’ll be bored. 

                                 WYLIE
                        No, I won’t.  I don’t believe in 
                        boredom.  

                                 BECCA
                        A bunch of my crunchy old academic 
                        goons gathering to talk about your 
                        mom’s books.  Is that really how 
                        you want to spend your night?

                                 WYLIE
                        They’re going to talk about 
                        recipes? 

                                 BECCA
                        Something like that. 

                                 JANE
                        Besides, you need to be in bed in 
                        an hour.  

                                 WYLIE
                        I think I liked it better when you 
                        took that medicine.

           Wylie walks off as Levi, dressed as though he’s going on a 
           date, runs up to them.

                                 LEVI
                        Hey, Janie.  Is it okay if I borrow 
                        your ride for tonight?

           Jane is caught off guard.  

                                 JANE
                        Oh.  Sure.  Where are you going?

           She rifles through her purse.  

                                 LEVI
                        You know me.  Wanderer at heart.  
                        Got a friend on every road I 
                        travel.  
           She hands him the keys:

                                 JANE
                        Right.  I mean, of course you don’t 
                        have to hang out with the kids 
                        tonight.  You didn’t come along to 
                        baby-sit. 

           He kisses her on the cheek and runs out the door.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        Friend on every road?  More like 
                        girl in every port.

                                 BECCA
                        Well, Levi is Levi.   

                                 JANE
                        Hey, Becca?
                            (quietly)
                        Can I have another one of those 
                        candies?

                                 BECCA
                        Are you sure?

                                 JANE
                        Yeah.  I’m sure.    

           Becca fishes the container from her purse.  

                                 BECCA
                        Know what, keep the bottle.  
                        Consider it a welcome gift. 

           Jane pockets the bottle and they go out the door. 

           EXT. TELLURIDE VILLAGE - NIGHT

           Becca and Jane walk through the snow covered sidewalks, in 
           mid-convo.

                                 BECCA
                        ....you want Wylie in a home where 
                        he is raised to be comfortable with 
                        his sexual expression whatever that 
                        may be. 

           They walk toward another VICTORIAN ski shack. 
                                 JANE
                        Well, it’s pretty clear that Wylie 
                        won’t be hetero.

                                 BECCA
                        You truly never know.  Sexuality 
                        isn’t so black and white.  It’s a 
                        spectrum.

           Jane is uncomfortable with this statement.  She needs labels.  
           She needs to know who her son is, before she goes.   

                                 JANE
                        Becca.  What... what happened?  

           Becca laughs.

                                 BECCA
                        You mean all this?

           Waves her hand over her body. 

                                 JANE
                        Uh.  Yeah. 

                                 BECCA
                        Gosh, where do I start?  How do you 
                        put so many years into a few 
                        sentences?

                                 JANE
                        Well... you’re the smart one.

                                 BECCA
                        Exactly!  

                                 JANE
                        What?

                                 BECCA
                        So much of my M.O. was what was 
                        told to me.  Good girl, smart girl.  
                        It was how I got places, for the 
                        most part.  But, you know, you get 
                        to a certain age and suddenly you 
                        realize your tax receipts have had 
                        zero variance for decades.  Like I 
                        was living on auto-pilot.  Like I 
                        was living someone else’s version 
                        of myself. 

           They walk onto the porch of a victorian home.  
                                 JANE
                        I never knew you felt like that. 

                                 BECCA
                        But you are a bit of the same, no?  
                        All of us drawn to you, like 
                        fireflies to the light.   

           Jane smiles at this compliment.

                                 BECCA (CONT’D)
                        Always admired from afar, but 
                        somewhat untouchable.  Like a 
                        stunning Grecian statue.

           Jane’s smile fades.  Something about this is so true and so 
           sad.  Becca opens the door and they walk into-

           INT. PARTY HOUSE - LIVING AREA - CONTINUOUS

           A warm gathering of MIDDLE AGED ACADEMICS and SKI BUMS 
           sitting on floor cushions, each other’s laps, draped over the 
           arms of a couches.  Jane’s BOOKS are on display by a BUFFET. 

           A BONG is passed around as though it’s a bottle of wine. 

                                 JANE
                            (re buffet)
                        Are those all my recipes?   

           Becca gives her arm a squeeze.  

                                 BECCA
                        It’s your legacy.

           Jane bristles at the word.  The BONG comes their way.  Jane 
           takes a BIG HIT.  Byron approaches. 

                                 BYRON
                        You hit that, girrrrrl.

           Jane laughs in a stoned haze.

                                 JANE
                        I used to be so fun.  Right, Becca?

           But Becca isn’t there.  Byron moves in real close to Jane. 

                                 BYRON
                        I bet you still are. 

           Jane smiles, likes the attention.     
                                 BYRON (CONT’D)
                        Do you ski?

                                 JANE
                        No.  I used to, a little, but it’s 
                        been forever.

                                 BYRON
                        Lucky for me.  I’m a ski 
                        instructor.  I can teach you some 
                        tricks.  

                                 JANE
                        Oh, I’m not here for long.  That 
                        would’ve been great, though. 

                                 BYRON
                        It’s all gonna turn to slush soon 
                        anyway, but next season -- you ask 
                        for me, and I’ll show you what it’s 
                        all about.  Deal? 

           She pauses for a moment.  She’s not high enough to forget 
           that she won’t be here next season.

                                 JANE
                        Yeah, deal. 

           She eyes the bong.  

           INT. PARTY HOUSE - LIVING AREA - LATER

           A smoky haze hangs over the room.  Everyone’s looser, 
           messier.  

           A stoned Becca approaches a GUY with ski goggles on his head. 

                                 BECCA
                        Have you seen Jane?

                                 SKI GOGGLES
                        Who’s that?

                                 BECCA
                        The statuesque author of the Green 
                        and Clean series.

                                 SKI GOGGLES
                        Who?  What?  

           Becca points to one of the cookbooks. 
                                 BECCA
                        Her.

                                 SKI GOGGLES
                        Naw, dude.  But if you find her, 
                        let me know.  She’s alllllright.    

           Becca surveys the room.  Gets lost in a platter of munchies. 

           ANGLE ON

           Jane’s CUTE BOOTIES from underneath the buffet table.  We go 
           under the table to find --

           Jane laying on Byron, in a deep, deep, conversation. 

                                 JANE
                            (breathing him in)
                        I miss that man smell. 

                                 BYRON
                        Come on.  You must have a line of 
                        guys waiting. 

                                 JANE
                        No, no, no.  I’m a guy repellent. 
                            (of Byron’s look)
                        It’s true, men are intimidated by 
                        my success.  

                                 BYRON
                        Well, I’m not. 

           He kisses her neck crazy-like.  She giggles.

                                 JANE
                        Do you think Becca will be mad?

                                 BYRON
                        About what?

                                 JANE
                        Aren’t you two dating or something?

                                 BYRON
                        Becca’s into all sorts of crazy 
                        shit.  She’s not territorial or 
                        anything like that.  Trust me. 

                                 JANE
                        It feels like I’ve got wings on my 
                        back.  Maybe we can fly away?   

           Jane laughs and laughs. 
           INT. PARTY HOUSE - EARLY MORNING

           ON Jane’s make-up smeared face.  She squints her eyes awake.  
           Looks around.  Confused.

           Realizes she’s on a bed.  Between two bodies.  Oh, they’re 
           naked.  One of them is Becca.  The other, Byron.  She 
           reluctantly looks at herself. She’s naked too.  WTF. 

           She slowly slides out of bed.  Grabs whatever clothes she can 
           find.  And RUNS out the door. 

           EXT. PARTY HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Jane in a FUCHSIA pajama top and fuzzy leggings waits 
           nervously.  Freezing.  

           Levi pulls up in the SUV with a shit-eating grin. Reaches 
           over and opens the door for her.

                                 LEVI
                        Wow.

           Jane climbs in.

           INT. HYBRID - SUV - CONTINUOUS

                                 LEVI
                        The Queen of clean ain’t so pure 
                        this rough morning!

                                 JANE
                        Don’t.  Just do what you do best 
                        and get us the hell out of here. 

                                 LEVI
                        Not a problem, boss!

           The wheels screech as the SUV shoots out of the driveway.

           INT. BECCA’S HOUSE - GUEST BEDROOM - MORNING

           Jane carefully wakes Wylie and Emanuela up, while Levi 
           gathers all of their stuff in the background.

                                 WYLIE
                        What?  What’s going on?

                                 EMANUELA
                        The sun is barely up, man.
                                 JANE
                        We gotta go.  Now. 

           Off Wylie and Emanuela fumbling out of bed, confused.

           EXT. BECCA’S HOUSE - MORNING

           The car PEELS out of the driveway and onto the road.

           INT. HYBRID - SUV - MORNING

           Wylie is in the back with Emanuela.  Jane at the wheel.  
           Levi, still with that grin, in the front.

                                 WYLIE
                        Did you even say goodbye?  I don’t 
                        get it.  What happened?

                                 JANE
                        Nothing happened.  We just need to 
                        get back on track.

           Wylie pulls out his score card. 

                                 WYLIE
                        So, I guess Becca is a no?

                                 JANE
                        We have other options.

                                 WYLIE
                        Sperm donor!  Sperm Donor!

                                 LEVI
                        Huh?

                                 EMANUELA
                        His biological father.

                                 LEVI
                        Ohhhhh.  So you did it that way? 
                            (to Wylie)
                        You’re lucky, kid.  Your mom 
                        probably chose top pedigree spooge 
                        for you. 

                                 WYLIE
                        What?--

                                 EMANUELA
                        --Ew.  You are so disgusting. 
                                 JANE
                        --Levi please. 

                                 LEVI
                        Come, on.  It’s a technical term.

           Wylie suddenly notices his mom’s outfit.

                                 WYLIE
                        Mom, what are you wearing? 

                                 LEVI
                        There’s so many sides of Jane we 
                        have yet to see.

                                 JANE
                        I spilled some food on me at the 
                        book party. 

                                 LEVI
                        I bet you did, Janie.  That must 
                        have been one delicious meal y’all 
                        had. 

           Jane wants to punch him.  Instead she drives faster. 

           EXT. REST STOP - LATER

           The SUV pulls to a stop.  Jane jumps out and runs to the rest 
           room.  Levi follows her. 

           Wylie watches concerned.  Emanuela slips her earbud into his 
           ear.  Tries to get him to dance with her.

           INT. REST ROOM - DAY

           Jane runs into a stall and throws up.  Levi holds her hair.  
           A WOMAN stares at him, shooting a disapproving look.

                                 LEVI
                        She’s dying okay?  I need to make 
                        sure she’s gonna be okay.

           The Woman hurries out of the rest room, red-faced.  Jane 
           wipes her mouth.  She’s pale, sweating. 

                                 JANE
                        It’s just a hangover.  It’s not the 
                        cancer. 
           She tries to stand up, but a huge wave of vertigo overcomes 
           her.  Levi makes her sit.  He grabs a bottle of water from 
           his back pocket, gives it to her.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        Can you promise me something?

                                 LEVI
                        Anything.

                                 JANE
                        I know your deal.  I know that 
                        eventually this gallant cowboy act 
                        is going to fade and you’re going 
                        to jump ship. 

                                 LEVI
                        No.  That’s not my deal, Jane.    
                        That’s not my deal.

                                 JANE
                        And, I’m fine with it.  But, Wylie 
                        really likes you.  Please, give him 
                        a heads up before you ghost.  Don’t 
                        just disappear on him.  Okay?

                                 LEVI
                        Come on, Janie.  That’s not me. 

                                 JANE
                        I know your deal.

           Jane slowly stands up.  Levi attempts to help her, she pushes 
           him away.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        I’m fine. 

           INT. HYBRID - SUV - DAY

           Emanuela is at the wheel.  Jane is in the front, perspiring 
           heavily, folded into herself.

           Levi attempts to teach Wylie poker in the back.  Emanuela’s 
           erratic driving causes the cards to slide around. 

                                 LEVI
                        Hey, Emanuela, you think you can 
                        try and avoid the pot-holes?

                                 EMANUELA
                        Hey, you think you can try and not 
                        be a tool? 
                                 LEVI
                            (sotto)
                        Okay, I’ll have to teach you the 
                        gentleman’s game when we’re not 
                        being driven on Mr. Toad’s Wild 
                        Ride.

                                 WYLIE
                        Alllll right!  Score cards 
                        everyone!

           Wylie passes out paper. 

                                 WYLIE (CONT’D)
                        Our next family lives in a tree 
                        house, so you know, be prepared.

                                 EMANUELA
                        Well, that rocks.

                                 JANE
                        It’s not what you think.  It’s an 
                        architectural home.  It was 
                        featured in magazines and blogs.

                                 LEVI
                        Well, heck, if it’s been in 
                        magazines...

                                 WYLIE
                        Their names are Aisha and Nigel.
                            (re: ipad)
                        Wow.  Power couple.  Is she a 
                        model?

                                 JANE
                        No.  We worked together years ago 
                        in publishing.  We were actually 
                        pregnant at the same time.

           ON a photo of a very attractive fit, yogini, Aisha and her 
           equal, ex-athlete, Nigel. 

                                 LEVI
                        What the fuck kinda name is Nigel?
                            (off Jane)
                        I mean, fudge. 

                                 WYLIE
                        How many kids do they have?

                                 JANE
                        Three.
                                 WYLIE
                        Yikes.

           Levi checks out the photo.

                                 LEVI
                        Pretty?  She is Fiiiiiiiiine, I 
                        mean capitol F, fine. 

                                 JANE
                        She’s taken, Levi.

                                 LEVI
                        Hey, just ‘cuz she’s on a diet 
                        don’t mean I don’t get to look at 
                        the dessert tray.  Hooo-ahh!  Get 
                        it?  See what I did there? 

                                 WYLIE
                        Wait, wait, wait... So, if you were 
                        pregnant before you moved, that 
                        means that the sperm donor isn’t 
                        from LA?

           A beat.

                                 JANE
                        Right.

                                 WYLIE
                        Where then?

           Car is silent.  Even Emanuela is listening closely. 

                                 WYLIE (CONT’D)
                        Mom, where’s the sperm from?

                                 JANE
                        Honey, does it really matter?

                                 WYLIE
                            (duh)
                        Yeah.

                                 JANE
                        New York.

                                 LEVI
                        Ha!  New Fuu- flippin’ York.  What 
                        are we talking, Park Avenue elite?--  

                                 JANE
                        Levi, stop.
                                 LEVI
                        Ivy league educated?  CEO?  Or, no -
                        - med student!  I bet you chose a 
                        tall, athletic, MD with a 4.0 
                        Average.

                                 JANE
                        Stop it!  Stop.  It.  My choices 
                        are not up for discussion.  Not in 
                        this car, and certainly not with 
                        you, Levi.

                                 EMANUELA
                        Told you we shouldn’t have let him 
                        come.  He’s not one of us. 

                                 LEVI
                        Well, I’ve never been one of 
                        anything so...

                                 EMANUELA
                        You make your bed, you lie in it. 

                                 LEVI
                        That you do. 

           OFF Levi, stoic, owning it. 

           EXT. AISHA’S TREE HOUSE - DAY

           A stunning architectural home built into the trees by a lake. 
           Our crew approach the stairs.  Wylie is dazzled.

                                 WYLIE
                        I didn’t know places like this 
                        existed. 

           INT. AISHA’S TREE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           A rich hippie’s paradise, re-purposed wood, large picture 
           windows, a loft, hand-made furniture, tribal accents, etc. 

           AISHA, 40’s, in high-end yoga clothes and NIGEL, 40’s, and 
           their FOUR KIDS ages 3-12, greet everyone with over-flowing 
           warmth.  A big cacophony of hugs, and intros and laughter.

           Aisha crouches down when she sees Wylie.

                                 AISHA
                        Oh, my gosh!  Look at you little 
                        man!  
                                 (MORE)
                                 AISHA (CONT'D)
                        You still have those incredibly 
                        soulful eyes.  Not your mom’s, no.  

           Jane tenses at Aisha’s comment.  Wylie is intrigued.  
           SAMSARA, 9, approaches Wylie, gleeful. 

                                 SAMSARA
                        We were in our mom’s bellies, the 
                        same time!

                                 WYLIE
                        Cool.  I’m Wylie.

                                 SAMSARA
                        I’m Samsara.  And that’s Bhodi--

           She points to a TWELVE YEAR OLD BOY.

                                 SAMSARA (CONT’D)
                        And Naji is the one hiding behind 
                        my dad.

           They both giggle. 

           ANGLE ON EMANUELA

           She and Nigel speak in her native tongue.  Nigel’s Spanish is 
           decent for a Brit.

                        I played soccer as a teen around 
                        there.  Beautiful town.  You miss 
                        it?

                        All of the time.  But hey... 
                        this isn’t so bad, either.  

           ANGLE ON AISHA  
           She gets to Jane, there is a tension both attempt to hide.

                                 AISHA
                        Jane... it’s...

                                 JANE
                        I know.  It’s been a long time. 

                                 AISHA
                        It has.

           They exchange an awkward hug.  Jane noticing the kids:

                                 JANE
                        Is that?  Did you have a fourth?

                                 AISHA
                        We sure did, this is Axel. 

           Aisha swoops him up.  Jane plays with his cheeks.

                                 JANE
                        Hi, Axel.  What a cutie!  

           INT. AISHA’S TREE HOUSE - DINING/LIVING AREA - NIGHT

           Post dinner.  The ADULTS and KIDS are around the table, 
           drinking wine, finishing bits of dessert.  Except for Jane 
           who naps nearby on a Moroccan day bed.   

                                 LEVI
                        I know jack about wine... but this 
                        is damn tasty. 

                                 AISHA
                        The kids helped make it.

                        What?  Really?  How?

                        We went to a local vineyard and got 
                        to pick the grapes, crush them, 
                        ferment them, and then bottle it 
                        all up!

                                 WYLIE
                        Sooooooo cool!!  I wanna crush 
                        grapes!

           Naji climbs all over Nigel.
                                 NIGEL
                        We’ll put that on the list, then.

                                 BODHI
                        Already done.  And done. 

                                 AISHA
                        We try to make everything into a 
                        learning opportunity.  But fun.  
                        You know, so there’s a sense of 
                        understanding of how our world 
                        works.

                                 EMANUELA
                        I love that.  That’s kind of how my 
                        parents did it too.

                        On the farm?

           Emanuela nods and smiles as she gets up. 

                                 EMANUELA
                        Where’s the rest room?

                        Dude, this is a slam dunk!

           Wylie smiles at him.  Nigel rises with an empty bottle.

                                 NIGEL
                        I’m going to get some 
                        reinforcements...

           INT. AISHA’S TREE HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Nigel stares at the pantry, holding a bottle of wine, 
           waiting.  He hears the bathroom door open and he --  

           SWINGS AROUND, grabs Emanuela, presses her against the wall 
           as he kisses her.  Eyes AFLAME, she shoves him off of her.

                                 EMANUELA
                            (loud whisper)
                        What the hell, man?!?
                                 NIGEL
                        You were giving me the signal...

                                 EMANUELA
                        Signal?  You’re married!

                                 NIGEL
                        Your naivete is adorable... and 
                        those jeans, christ, what it does 
                        for your body.

           He plays with a strand of her hair, she pushes his hand away.

                                 EMANUELA
                        Let me be clear.  My clothing, my 
                        body, your attraction toward me, 
                        and your delusional ability to mis-
                        read “signals” gives you absolutely 
                        no right to assault me--

                                 NIGEL
                        Whoa, whoa, assault?  Come on 
                        darling-

                                 EMANUELA
                        I’m not finished.  If you so much 
                        as look at me sideways for the rest 
                        of the stay I will for sure, bruise 
                        more than your ego, report you, and 
                        press charges.  Got it?  

                                 NIGEL
                        All I did was--

           Emanuel pulls out her cell phone.

                                 EMANUELA
                        You wanna test me?  Go ahead.  See 
                        what happens.

           Nigel backs away, shaking his head.  We notice a FIGURE in 
           the hall, it quickly moves away.

           INT. AISHA’S TREE HOUSE - DINING/LIVING AREA - NIGHT

           Aisha and Levi clear the table.  The kids play nearby.  
           Emanuela enters, jacked up.

           ANGLE ON WYLIE 

           As he JUMPS off an INDOOR SWING. 
                                 WYLIE
                        Wanna have your mind blown?

                        Emanuela?  Can we show them song 
                        roulette?

                                 EMANUELA
                        Not now, Wy.

                                 KIDS/WYLIE
                        Pleasssse!!!

                                 WYLIE
                        Just one song, that’s all. 

                                 EMANUELA
                        I’m really not feeling it.

           Nigel strolls in, approaches Aisha and kisses her on the 
           head. 

                                 NIGEL
                        I’m going for a night jog. 

                                 AISHA
                        Okay, honey.  
                            (to Naji)
                        Naji, my love, please don’t sit on 
                        the Buddha statue.   

           Wylie holds Emanuela’s phone, taps the screen.

                                 WYLIE
                        You know you can’t resist a tune.  
                        It’s your magic.  I’m shuffling... 
                        and BAM --   

           We suddenly hear Emanuela’s STUNNING VOICE singing.  Emanuela 
           turns CRIMSON as she moves toward him. 

                                 WYLIE (CONT’D)
                        Is this your own music?

                                 EMANUELA
                        Turn it off!

                                 WYLIE
                        But... this is awesome.  This is 
                        what’ll make you big time--  
           She grabs the phone and shuts it off. 

                                 EMANUELA
                        When I say no, I mean it!  I’m not 
                        your puppet, Wylie!

           Emanuela RUNS outside.  Wylie watches.  Stunned.  He’s about 
           to go for her when Aisha approaches.

                                 AISHA
                        Hey, how about you all take Wylie 
                        on the ice cream trail.

           The kids jump up and CHEER, excited.  

                                 WYLIE
                        But... Emanuela...

                                 AISHA
                        Emanuela is a grown up.  She can 
                        take care of herself. 

                                 KIDS
                            (chanting)
                        Ice cream trail!  Ice cream trail!

                                 WYLIE
                        What’s the ice cream trail? 

                                 AISHA
                        You’ll just have to find out!

           Wylie matches the kids enthusiasm with a bright smile. 

           EXT. AISHA’S TREE HOUSE - PORCH - NIGHT

           Emanuela sits, staring at the lake.  Levi approaches, sits 
           next to her.  She ignores him.

                                 LEVI
                        Well, shit.  Tough day.  Huh?

                                 EMANUELA
                        What do you care? 

                                 LEVI
                        I saw what happened.  With Nigel.      

           Emanuela didn’t expect that.   

                                 EMANUELA
                        Awesome.  I’m sure it was 
                        entertaining. 
                                 LEVI
                        I was gonna intervene, but you 
                        owned that little limey.  
                        Impressive.  I mean, really.    

                                 EMANUELA
                        Yeah, well, the music industry was 
                        great training ground on how to 
                        deal with entitled pervs like him. 

                                 LEVI
                        Oh, so that’s it.  Was trying to 
                        figure it out. 

                                 EMANUELA
                        Figure what out?

                                 LEVI
                        How someone like you, with crazy 
                        talent, isn’t just going for it. 

                                 EMANUELA
                        Oh, God, here it comes -- You 
                        should, you know, you really, 
                        really should, you’re so this and 
                        you’re so that...  That’s what they 
                        all say when they hear me sing.

                                 LEVI
                        Sounds like you’re getting a load 
                        of compliments. 

                                 EMANUELA
                        Compliments can be a jail sentence.        

                                 LEVI
                        Always work for me.

                                 EMANUELA
                        That’s ‘cuz you’re full of shit, 
                        Levi.

                                 LEVI
                        Well, tell me this -- how long have 
                        you been nannying and how long have 
                        you been singing?   

                                 EMANUELA
                        That’s the thing.  Everyone just 
                        thinks the helpless nanny needs a 
                        life lesson, because who really 
                        wants to be a nanny anyway?  What a 
                        terrific underachievement for such 
                        a talent.

                        Maybe I love nannying, maybe I do 
                        want to take care of other people's 
                        children for the rest of my life, 
                        what's wrong with that? 

                                 LEVI
                        Nothing is wrong with that, nothing 
                        at all.  I’ve lived my life the 
                        same, actually, kinda.  Easy job, 
                        easy days, a whole lotta freedom.  
                        More than most.  

           Levi reaches into a cooler and pulls out TWO BOTTLES.  Pops 
           one open with his key chain.  Offers other to Emanuela, she 
           takes it with an impish smile.

                                 LEVI (CONT’D)
                        No wife, no kid, no hard earned 
                        snazzy title.  A life, fantastic.  
                        If you’ve got nothing, no one can 
                        take anything away from you, know 
                        what I’m saying? 

                                 EMANUELA
                            (can’t help it)
                        Freedom’s just another word for --

                                 LEVI/EMANNUELA
                        Nothing left to lose...

           Levi takes a swig from the bottle as Emanuela continues 
           singing and then -- 

                                 LEVI
                            (spitting it up)
                        What in the hell?

                                 EMANUELA
                        Oh, that’s kombucha. 

                                 LEVI
                        Kom-what?  It tastes like my nuts. 

                                 EMANUELA
                        You know what your nuts taste like?  

           Levi shrugs.  Emanuela rises, tips her bottle toward him.

                                 EMANUELA (CONT’D)
                        Well, cheers to a life of freedom.  
                        A life, fantastic.   
                                 LEVI 
                        Oh, yeah, that.  Didn’t get to 
                        finish.  Well, turns out that kind 
                        of living becomes its own little 
                        jail sentence as you say.  Maybe I 
                        am full of shit, but maybe also, 
                        people tell you, you should because 
                        they wish they coulda and they 
                        didn’t.  That’s all.  People trying 
                        to pass on their mess-ups so that 
                        you don’t have to. 

           INT. AISHA’S TREE HOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Jane, up from her nap, agitated, grills Aisha.

                                 JANE
                        He’s only nine.  He shouldn’t be in 
                        the woods alone at night!  He’s 
                        never been in the woods alone!

           Jane searches for shoes.  Can’t find any.  Pacing.

                                 AISHA
                        Jane, he’s with the kids.  Bodhi’s 
                        twelve.  They know where they’re 
                        going.  It’s really okay.

                                 JANE
                        No!  It’s not okay!  You should 
                        have woken me up.  You should have 
                        asked me. 

                                 AISHA
                        Let’s just sit.  Take a breath, 
                        this isn’t healthy--  

                                 JANE
                        Which direction did they go in?

                                 AISHA
                        Jane, please.  Just take a moment-- 

                                 JANE
                        WHICH direction.

           Aisha gives in and points.  Jane RUNS out of the tree house 
           as though this is life or death.
           EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

           ON Bare feet as they scramble over rocks, moss -- branches 
           slap Jane’s face.

                                 JANE
                        Wylieeeee!!  Wylieeee!

           She looks around -- she can’t find her son.  She runs FASTER. 

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        Wylieeeee!

           And then -- a bunch of LITTLE LIGHTS.  All of the kids with 
           flash lights in tow, are laughing, totally fine.  The ICE 
           CREAM SHOP is in plain view a few feet away.

           All of the kids STARE at Jane.  Wylie is both embarrassed and 
           concerned.  Jane runs to him.  Hugs him tightly. 

                                 WYLIE
                        Mom?

                                 JANE
                        I thought -- I didn’t know where 
                        you were.  I got scared.  

           Wylie looks at the other kids.

                                 WYLIE
                        Do you want me to walk back with 
                        you?  I don’t have to go. 

           Jane realizes she’s overreacted.  She gathers herself. 

                                 JANE
                        No, no.  It’s fine.  I’m fine.  You 
                        guys, you go ahead.  Enjoy your ice 
                        cream.

                                 WYLIE
                        You sure?

                                 JANE
                        Yeah.  Go ahead.  I love you, son. 

                                 WYLIE
                        I love you, mama. 

           He looks at her for a beat, and then continues on with the 
           other kids.  Jane watches. 
           INT. AISHA’S TREE HOUSE - MORNING

           Aisha and Nigel are setting up for a yoga class with the 
           family.  Candles are lit, yoga mats lined up, new age music. 

           Jane, drinking coffee, shuffles over, pale and tired looking. 

                                 AISHA
                        This is part of the family routine.  
                        Sometimes kids are all in, 
                        sometimes not.  We don’t force it. 

           Jane nods.  Aisha notices Jane’s demeanor. 

                                 AISHA (CONT’D)
                        Are you sure you want to join us?

                                 JANE
                        Yeah.  Just, feeling a little stiff 
                        this morning.

           It’s clear it’s more than that.  

                                 AISHA
                        Nigel, let’s do a yin class.  All-
                        levels. 

           Nigel nods. 

                                 LEVI
                        Yes.  Please.  Do whatever’s going 
                        to make me not look like a fool. 

           Reveal Levi in sweats and a tee.  

                                 EMANUELA
                        That will be a challenge.

           ON Emanuela.  Yoga pants, tank, hair up.  She somehow looks 
           more womanly, different.  Levi notices.  Tries to hide it.  
           But, Jane caught it. 

           Nigel sits in the front and avoids Emanuela’s eye-line.  

                                 NIGEL
                        None of the kiddos? 

           Aisha glances up toward the loft, sounds of Happy CHATTER.

                                 AISHA
                        I think they’re in love with their 
                        new brother. 
           Ouch.  Maybe this was too much.  Jane flushes red as she sits 
           on a mat next to Aisha.   

                                 AISHA (CONT’D)
                        I shouldn’t have said that.

                                 JANE
                        It’s okay.  Don’t worry about it.  

           But it’s really not.  Jane is starting to feel reality close 
           in on her. 

                                 NIGEL
                        Let’s start in an easy cross-legged 
                        position.  Breath in... and out...

           As Nigel leads the class, ANGLE ON THE KIDS

           Upstairs in the loft, overlooking the yoga class, Wylie, 
           Samsara, Naji and Bodhi play cards in a hand-made tee-pee.  

           Axel toddles toward them, carrying Jane’s IPAD.  

                                 BODHI
                        Whatcha got there, Axel?

                                 WYLIE
                        Is that my mom’s?  

           Samsara grabs it.  ON the screen: Jane’s message to Wylie. 

                                 SAMSARA
                        It’s a video of her.  

           Wylie watches for a second.  Turns it off.    

                                 WYLIE
                        I don’t think we should watch.    

                                 SAMSARA
                        Could be fun, though.  

                                 WYLIE
                        Nah.  My mom likes to keep certain 
                        things private.  

                                 SAMSARA
                        Should we tell her?

           Wylie shrugs. 

                                 WYLIE
                        Maybe we should hide it?  And put 
                        it back in her purse later.  
                                 SAMSARA
                        I can help you find a good spot!

                                 BODHI
                        I don’t know if we should do that.  
                        It breaks our family vow of 
                        honesty.

           BACK ON the yoga class --

           Everyone is in pigeon, except for Levi who is tangled up.  
           Nigel tries to help him.  Levi gives him the evil eye. 

                                 JANE
                            (quietly)
                        You and Nigel should do a book 
                        series.  Like a couple’s take on 
                        yoga.

                                 AISHA
                        Nah.  We’re good with the DVD’s and 
                        merch.

                                 JANE
                        I can hook you up with my 
                        publisher. 

                                 AISHA
                        That’s a little ironic.   

                                 JANE
                        What? 

                                 AISHA
                        Nothing. 

                                 JANE
                        Oh, God.  You’ll never let it go. 
                        Will you?  

                                 AISHA
                        Let it go?  You bogarted  my idea 
                        for the green food series.  You 
                        never gave me anything for it.  Not 
                        even an apology.  

                                 JANE
                        Oh, like you’re suffering.

                                 AISHA
                        That’s not the point. 
                                 JANE
                        It was our idea and you gave up on 
                        it.  

                                 AISHA
                        That’s the story you tell yourself.

                                 JANE
                        What was all of that hippie talk 
                        about not owning intellectual 
                        property, sharing with the world?    

           Nigel approaches and attempts to quiet them down. 

                                 NIGEL
                        Let’s stay focused on our breath, 
                        Aisha, Jane. 

                                 AISHA
                        Nigel -- don’t.  
                            (to Jane)
                        I never said anything like that.    

           ANGLE ON Wylie, and kids, listening intently from above. 

                                 JANE
                        You’re lying, Aisha.  

                                 AISHA
                        I’m the liar?  Oh, I’m the liar?   
                        Are you that delusional?!?  You lie 
                        so much you end up drinking your 
                        own trippy-ass Kool-Aid.  You know 
                        what lies do?  They create cancer.  

                                 NIGEL
                        Aisha, my love.  Come on.      

                                 AISHA
                        I can’t play this juvenile game of 
                        pretend anymore!  Jane, you lied 
                        about everything from your finances 
                        to imaginary sperm donors and you 
                        want us all to slap on a smile and 
                        pat you on the back.  I’m not going 
                        to do it, anymore.   

           Cold silence.  Jane gets up.  Filled with fire. 

                                 JANE
                        I told you that in confidence.  

           Jane walks away.  Levi and Emanuela exchange an oh shit look. 
           EXT./INT. HYBRID - SUV - DAY

           Silence in the car as they pull away.  Aisha and her entire 
           brood are lined up, waving as the car drives off.  It’s 
           awkward.  It’s painful.  It’s confusing as hell for Wylie. 

           Jane, looking pale and weak, is at the wheel.  Levi in the 
           front, Wylie and Emanuela in the back. 

                                 WYLIE
                        Mom.  What did Aisha mean about the 
                        sperm donor? 

                                 JANE
                        She didn’t mean anything.  We’re 
                        just... it’s an old fight.  I mean, 
                        I did the right thing, the book 
                        series was never going to happen.  
                        She ditched the idea to pursue a 
                        thousand other offers.  I was 
                        passionate about it, I wanted to 
                        bring something good to the world.  
                        I didn’t do anything wrong.   

           A beat.  No one knows what to say.

                                 WYLIE
                        Okay, Mom.  

                                 LEVI
                        Jane, it’s not a big deal.  We all 
                        trip up a little. 

                                 JANE
                        But, I didn’t.  I wanted to see a 
                        project through.  There’s nothing 
                        dubious about that. 

                                 EMANUELA
                        My sister, Teresa used to write 
                        poems.  And there was this one 
                        time, I used one of her poems as a 
                        song for a school performance.  I 
                        thought she would be happy.  But, 
                        because, I didn’t ask, well, she 
                        was really mad.  For days, she 
                        wouldn’t talk to me.  So, maybe, 
                        you know, it’s just cuz you didn’t 
                        give Aisha a heads up?

           Jane doesn’t say anything.  Can’t admit her faults.  So Wylie 
           attempts to lighten the mood:
                                 WYLIE
                        They’re a cool family.  I really 
                        liked them.   

                                 JANE
                        Of course you did.  Everyone loves 
                        Aisha.  

                                 EMANUELA
                        They were okay. 

                                 WYLIE
                        You didn’t like them?

                                 EMANUELA
                        Things aren’t always what they 
                        appear to be.  That’s all.  Anyway, 
                        fill us in on the deets of your big 
                        first kiss--

                                 WYLIE
                        Emanuela!

                                 EMANUELA
                        I didn’t know it was a secret, 
                        dude. 

                                 JANE
                        What? 

                                 WYLIE
                        It was nothing.  Just on the lips.  
                        It was really nothing, mom.  

                                 JANE
                        Wylie, you’re nine.  Bodhi is way 
                        too old to be involving you in 
                        those kinds of things... God, he’s 
                        almost a teen.

                                 WYLIE
                        Bodhi?  It wasn’t Bodhi.

                                 JANE
                        Who was it?

                                 WYLIE
                        Samsara.  

           A beat. 

                                 JANE
                        Samsara?  The girl?
                                 WYLIE
                        Yeah. 

           Jane looks at Levi.

                                 LEVI
                        Don’t look at me.  I had nothing to 
                        do with it.

                                 JANE
                        Yeah you did.  You’re pushing your 
                        hetero-normative agenda and 
                        lifestyle by all of your... 
                        chauvinistic comments.  He’s trying 
                        to emulate you.  I want him to be 
                        who he is.  Not what society wants 
                        him to be!

           The car screeches as Jane pulls to the side of the road and 
           qets out -- 

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        I need some air. 

           EXT. SIDE OF ROAD - CONTINUOUS

           Jane walks down the empty road.  Levi and Wylie start after 
           her.  Jane puts up her hand, as if to say, give me space.  
           Emanuela grabs Levi. 

                                 EMANUELA
                        Just, let her be... for a moment.  

           Levi pauses.  Watches Jane become smaller as she walks off.      

                                 WYLIE
                        Is she mad at me? 

                                 EMANUELA
                        No.  She’s not mad at you.  It’s 
                        just her way of dealing right now. 

                                 WYLIE
                        Levi?

                                 LEVI
                        Yeah, kid.

                                 WYLIE
                        What do you think Aisha meant about 
                        the imaginary sperm donor? 

           Levi looks at Emanuela.   
                                 LEVI
                        I have no clue. 

                                 WYLIE
                        Do you... do you think my mom lied 
                        to me?  About my dad?  

                                 LEVI
                        I.... think your mom is trying to 
                        do the best she can. 

                                 WYLIE
                        Is there any way, any tiny 
                        possibility, even the tiniest 
                        little bit of a possibility that 
                        you’re my dad?

           Levi’s face softens.  He crouches down. 

                                 LEVI
                        I wish I could of had that honor.  
                        But no, it’s not me. 

           Wylie looks away, thinking.  Emanuela studies Levi, touched 
           by his handling of this.

                                 LEVI (CONT’D)
                        Alright.  Should we get her?

           All load into the car.  

           EXT. ROAD - CONTINUOUS

           Jane walking listlessly on the side of the road.  Looking 
           into the great big nothing.  The SUV approaches.  

           INT./EXT. HYBRID - SUV - CONTINUOUS

           Levi reaches over, opens the door.  

                                 LEVI
                        Everything, good?

                                 JANE
                        Yup.  We’re going to my parents 
                        house. 

                                 LEVI
                        What?  You sure about that?    

                                 JANE
                        I need some documents signed. 
                                 WYLIE
                        Are they gonna adopt me?

                                 JANE
                        Absolutely not.  It’s purely for 
                        financial matters.  This is the way 
                        we deal.  We show up.  We smile.  
                        We don’t provoke.  A simple, swift, 
                        efficient visit. 

                                 LEVI
                        As you wish, Captain. 

           All eyes on her as she climbs into the car. 

           EXT. THE WORTHINGTON HOUSE - NIGHT

           An imposing colonial home built in the 1800’s.  THROUGH the 
           orange glow of the windows we push in to see: 

           INT. WORTHINGTON HOUSE - FOYER - NIGHT

           CATHERINE WORTHINGTON 60’s, Martha Stewart in appearance and 
           demeanor, studies Jane for a bit.  Notices her fraility, the 
           sickness beginning to show.  

           She pulls her daughter into a hug that lasts a beat longer 
           than Jane is used to.

                                 CATHERINE
                        Oh, Jane.  You shouldn’t wear 
                        black, honey.  It makes you look so 
                        pale. 

           ANGLE ON EMANUELA 

           She stands off to the side and leans into Levi, conspiring.

                                 EMANUELA
                            (sotto)
                        Yes, Catherine.  That’s what it is.  
                        The shirt.  Not the cancer, but the 
                        shirt. 

           Levi stifles a laugh. 

           Jane forces a smile and moves onto her father -- WILL 
           WORTHINGTON, 60’s.  All man.  Stands stiffly, nods his head 
           in greeting. 

                                 JANE
                        Hi, Dad.
                                 WILL
                        Jane. 

           Catherine sees Levi, brightens.  Levi gives her a big hug.

                                 CATHERINE
                        Levi!  What a sweet surprise! 

                                 LEVI
                        You haven’t aged a day, Cat.  
                        What’s the secret, huh?

                                 CATHERINE
                        It’s all in the genes.  And 
                        bourbon. 

           She winks.  

                                 LEVI
                        Do you know Emanuela, Cat?

           Levi pulls Emanuela into the fold.  

                                 CATHERINE
                        Of course.  Nice to see you, dear. 

           Catherine sees Wylie.  Her heart bursts.  She grabs him. 

                                 WYLIE
                        Hi, Gramma.

                                 CATHERINE
                        Look at you.  You look just like 
                        your mama when she was your age.  

                                 WYLIE
                        I do?

           Catherine nods, studying her grandson.  Love is there, no 
           doubt, but also --

                                 CATHERINE
                            (re: his outfit)
                        Aren’t you a little too old to be 
                        playing dress up, sweetie?

                                 JANE
                        Mother. 

                                 CATHERINE
                        I’ve got something to show you, 
                        Wylie.  Come with Grandmother.

           Wylie looks to Jane.  She nods and they walk away.
                                 WILL
                        We uh... got beds set up for 
                        everyone for the night. 
                            (to Jane)
                        I presume you and Levi are in 
                        separate rooms?

                                 JANE
                        Yes.  Of course. 

           Off Jane, embarrassed by the slight dig from her father. 

           INT. WORTHINGTON HOUSE - HALLWAY/BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Catherine leads Wylie toward a bedroom.

                                 CATHERINE
                        We set something up just for you.

                                 WYLIE
                        Is there a space for Emanuela?  
                        She’s usually my bunk mate. 

                                 CATHERINE
                        Well, not for tonight, dear.  
                        She’ll have her own room.

           She leads Wylie into...

           INT. WORTHINGTON HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Decorated in nautical theme.  Large letters on the wall spell 
           out Wylie’s name.  Boat-shaped bed.  It’s clear this room 
           isn’t just for the night, it’s set up for permanency. 

                                 CATHERINE
                        There’s a brand new computer, too. 

           Wylie walks over to the desk.  He’s confused. 

                                 WYLIE
                        Thank you.  

                                 CATHERINE
                        Anything that you need, you just 
                        ask.  Okay?

                                 WYLIE
                        Okay. 
           INT. WORTHINGTON HOUSE - DEN - NIGHT

           The couch is opened up to a bed, and there is an air mattress 
           on the floor.  Emanuela and Levi stand awkwardly by Will.

                                 WILL
                        It’s the best we can do.  We’re not 
                        used to having an encampment at the 
                        house. 

           Emanuela and Levi exchange a look. 

                                 LEVI
                        Well, it’s alright.  I’ll take the 
                        floor. 

                                 WILL
                        Of course you will, Levi.  I coulda 
                        put you in the garage, but 
                        Catherine wasn’t for it. 

                                 LEVI
                        Well.  That’s mighty kind. 

                                 WILL
                        And, I expect you’ll behave 
                        yourself, Levi.

                                 LEVI
                        With all due respect, sir, I’m not 
                        a child.

                                 WILL
                        Are you kidding?  Wylie’s less of a 
                        child than you are. 

           Will exits.  Emanuela looks at him wide-eyed, laughing.

                                 EMANUELA
                        Oh my God.  What did you do to 
                        him?!? 

                                 LEVI
                        Walked out on his daughter.

                                 EMANUELA
                        Oh.  Right.  
                            (beat)
                        Is that why you’re doing this?  

                                 LEVI
                        You don’t always get a second 
                        chance.  I’m not going to fuck it 
                        up.  Not this time. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 LEVI (CONT'D)
                        It’s something crazy that she’s let 
                        me back in.  So, yeah, I’m gonna do 
                        all I can to make it right.    

           Levi throws his bag on the floor, sits against the wall. 

                                 EMANUELA
                        Why’d you wait so long?  I mean, if 
                        that’s how you feel, why didn’t you 
                        try sooner?

                                 LEVI
                        Oh, god did I try.  Letters, and 
                        flowers, and gifts, and e-mails.  
                        But, with Jane, when she’s done 
                        she’s done.  There’s no going back.  
                        It’s like she’s got a switch she 
                        can just turn on and off like that.    

                                 EMANUELA
                        I can see that.  When stuff gets 
                        real, she just... pretends it’s all 
                        the same.  

           Emanuela begins to cry into her hands.  

                                 EMANUELA (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry.  I’m sorry.  This is all 
                        just... she doesn’t talk about it.  
                        I feel like I’m not going to get a 
                        chance to say goodbye, because she 
                        like, she won’t admit she’s dying.  
                        I have no idea what’s going to 
                        happen.  With Wylie, with me... 
                        it’s such a mess.  

           Levi sits next to her, puts his arms around her.  She falls 
           into his shoulder and begins to sob hungrily.  He let’s her 
           have this moment for a beat. 

                                 LEVI
                        Well, you can’t control what Jane 
                        does, but you can think about you. 

                                 EMANUELA
                            (wiping tears)
                        Huh?

                                 LEVI
                        If you had what Jane had, and if 
                        you were gonna die, what would you 
                        wanna be doing?  Free pass.     
                                 EMANUELA
                        You know the answer, everyone knows 
                        the answer. 

                                 LEVI
                        So, say it. 

                                 EMANUELA
                        Music.

                                 LEVI
                        Be more specific. 

                                 EMANUELA
                        I don’t know.  I just know, music 
                        somehow, someway.  Don’t know what, 
                        don’t know where my place is.  

                                 LEVI
                        Make a guess, this is a game, no 
                        wrong answers. 

           A beat.  Emanuela weighs her thoughts. 

                                 EMANUELA
                        Sometimes I think about this old 
                        conservatory in Mexico.  
                        Conservatorio de Las Rosas.  It was 
                        the first music school built in my 
                        country.  It’s got crazy history, 
                        crazy talented instructors. 

                                 LEVI
                        Well, shit.  That sounds awesome.  
                        Bam.  There’s your answer.

                                 EMANUELA
                        It’s too close to home.  

                                 LEVI
                        So?

                                 EMANUELA
                        Ehh... I already messed up once and 
                        if it happens again.  I don’t want 
                        to be that close to home.

                                 LEVI
                        Well, no one does.  But sometimes 
                        you gotta face those ghosts.  We 
                        all do eventually. 
           INT. WORTHINGTON HOUSE - DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           A table set in the old formal southern style.  Silver, linen 
           table cloth, napkins, china, taper candles.  The whole deal.

           Will sits at the head.  An empty chair by his side as 
           Catherine rushes around doing finishing touches. 

           Jane, Wylie, Emanuela, and Levi are all seated.  Tension can 
           be felt in the awkward silence. 

                                 LEVI
                        Can I give you a hand, Cat?

                                 CATHERINE
                        No, no, I’m fine. 

                                 LEVI
                        Alright.  How’s business these 
                        days, Will?

                                 WILL
                        You got a mind for business, now?

           Catherine shoots Will a look, he shifts. 

                                 WILL (CONT’D)
                        It’s fine.  Strong.  But since that 
                        scumbag Edgar--

                                 CATHERINE
                        William.

                                 WILL
                        Edgar left with half of my clients.  
                        It’s been a slow build. 

                                 CATHERINE
                        It was a decade ago.  You don’t 
                        have to hold a grudge.  Forgive, 
                        forget, move on.  Okay.  Let’s have 
                        grace, shall we?

           Catherine reaches for Will’s hand, everyone follows suit. 

                                 CATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        Bless us, O Lord, and these your 
                        gifts, which we are about to 
                        receive from your bounty. Through 
                        Christ our Lord. Amen.

                                 WILL
                        Amen.
           The rest mutter a few weak “Amens.”

                                 EMANUELA
                        I would like to say a blessing in 
                        Spanish. 

                                 CATHERINE
                        Oh.  Of course.  That would be 
                        pleasant. 

           Emanuela throws Wylie a quick smile like: watch me.

                                 EMANUELA
                            (in Spanish)
                        Heavenly father, I really don’t 
                        like it when gringos treat me like 
                        the help.  I hope this food gives 
                        them indigestion and gassy poops.  

           ON Wylie.  As he tries so hard not to laugh. 

                                 EMANUELA (CONT’D)
                        Except for the dude next to me.  
                        And his mom.  His mom deserves more 
                        than this.  Amen.

                                 WYLIE
                        AMEN!

                                 CATHERINE/WILL/LEVI
                        Amen. 

           Catherine carves a slice of roast and serves it to Jane.

                                 CATHERINE
                        Our guest of honor.

                                 JANE
                        Oh, I’m not eating red meat now.

                                 CATHERINE
                        But, this is your favorite recipe.

                                 JANE
                        Fifteen years ago.

                                 CATHERINE
                        Why didn’t you tell me?  I would 
                        have cooked you something else.

                                 JANE
                        It’s not a big deal.  I’ll have the 
                        salad.
           Catherine is clearly upset.

                                 LEVI
                        I’ll eat her portion.  I’m hungrier 
                        than a wild wolf!

           Levi grabs the plate before anything else can be said.  

           Plates are passed around as Catherine serves everyone.

                                 CATHERINE
                        Jane, and her eating fads.  Changes 
                        all of the time.  Remember when you 
                        were a teen?  And you took the 
                        truck out?

                                 JANE
                        Yes, Mom.   

                                 CATHERINE
                            (to everyone)
                        She didn’t even have her license!  
                        But she drove herself down to her 
                        daddy’s office to picket ‘cuz of 
                        animal cruelty, this and that.  

                                 JANE
                        Mom, please. 

                                 CATHERINE
                        Oh, it was a hoot.  A hoot until 
                        the sheriff caught up to her.  Your 
                        dad, just about lost all of his 
                        hair when he saw you took the 
                        truck.  I think it was Edgar of all 
                        people who spilled the beans.   

           To Catherine it’s a lighthearted moment, but we can assume by 
           Jane’s glower, her version is much darker and heavier. 

                                 JANE
                        How many times are you going to 
                        tell that story?  Is that all you 
                        remember of my childhood?    

           Jane has to hold herself back from saying more.  But it’s 
           clear she’s champing at the bit to lay it all out. 

                                 CATHERINE
                        So, how’s the road trip going? 

                                 JANE
                        Fine.    
                                 WYLIE
                        Awesome! 

                                 CATHERINE
                        Is that so?  What’s been your 
                        favorite part so far, Wylie?

                                 WYLIE
                        The tree house-house.   

                                 CATHERINE
                        Sounds fun.  Was that an amusement 
                        park?  

                                 WYLIE
                        No.  It’s a family I might live 
                        with.  They were my favorite so 
                        far. 

           Catherine looks to Will and then quickly to Jane.

                                 CATHERINE
                        Excuse me?  I don’t think I heard 
                        right.  A family you might live 
                        with?

                                 JANE
                        Yes, mother.  Our arrangement in LA 
                        fell through, so, we’ve been 
                        meeting with other families.

                                 WILL
                        What are you talking about, other 
                        families?

                                 CATHERINE
                        But, he’s going to live with us.      

                                 JANE
                        Why in any world would you assume 
                        that? 

                                 CATHERINE
                        Because we are his family, that’s 
                        why.   

                                 JANE
                        Our definitions of family are 
                        vastly different.   

                                 WILL
                        Family is family.  You’re being 
                        idiotic, Jane.  Isn’t it hard 
                        enough on the boy already?
           Levi attempts to de-escalate -- 

                                 LEVI
                        Okay!  Wow.  This roast is really 
                        something, don’tcha think so, Wy--

                                 JANE
                        Hard enough?  I’ll tell you what’s 
                        hard.  Hard is growing up in an 
                        environment where every single 
                        feeling, thought, choice you make 
                        is judged, ridiculed, challenged.  
                        He will never have the freedom to 
                        be who he is.  You will destroy him 
                        like you destroyed me.  And there 
                        is no way in hell that I will let 
                        you bring upon that torture to my 
                        son.  A pirate fucking bedroom--

                                 WILL
                        Enough.

                                 JANE
                        Do you even know who your grandson 
                        is?  

                                 CATHERINE
                        Well, you turned out okay, Jane.  
                        Whatever “torture” you endured must 
                        not have been that bad.

           Emanuela and Levi exchange a look.  What should they do?

                                 JANE
                        Really? You think this
                            (waves hand over herself)
                        Is okay?  I’ve never been married, 
                        I’ve struggled my entire career to 
                        barely make it on the page, I’m 
                        practically in debt, I don’t have 
                        any real friends, and I’m dying at 
                        42.  What is okay about that?

                                 CATHERINE
                        Oh, sure, blame us for your 
                        choices!  You have built a life 
                        trying to prove you can do it all 
                        on your own.  And, bravo, you’ve 
                        done it.  Had a baby on your own, 
                        career on your own, and now you’re 
                        going to die alone.

           A stunned silence.  
                                 JANE
                        I would rather die alone than have 
                        you and him sitting on your high-
                        fucking-horse telling me how I 
                        could have been better. 

                                 WILL
                        It’s simple, then.  You think 
                        you’re too good for us, I’m not 
                        signing those papers.  Wylie’s out 
                        of the will. 

           Jane looks as though she’s been slapped. 

                                 WILL (CONT’D)
                        Oh, what?  Does that change things?  
                        The way I was raised, blood is 
                        blood.  You take care of your own.  
                        No matter what.  

                                 JANE
                        Is that how you were raised, 
                        father?  No matter what?  What if 
                        your blood, your grandson shares 
                        blood with Edgar Wells? 

                                 WILL
                        What are you talking about?

                                 JANE
                        Figure it out.

           Will’s face turns into a purple-red rage as he puts it 
           together. 

                                 WILL
                        Get out.

           Jane is shocked at her confession, at her father’s boiling 
           rage. 

                                 WILL (CONT’D)
                        GET THE HELL OUT OF MY HOUSE!  I 
                        NEVER WANT TO SEE YOUR FACE EVER 
                        AGAIN!

           But this is her freedom.  And her pain.  She slowly rises.

           We PULL OUT through the picture window and see through the 
           orange glow a now EMPTY dining room except for Will who 
           stares straight ahead stone cold.  And Catherine who sobs 
           into her hands. 

           Continuing pulling back and PUSH into another window of--
           INT. HISTORIC VICTORIAN B&B - NIGHT

           Our sad crew, Jane, Levi, Wylie and Emanuela shuffle up the 
           stairs led by an INN KEEPER.  

           INT. HISTORIC VICTORIAN B&B - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Jane sits on a bed forlorn.  Levi washes up in the bathroom.  
           Wylie enters in PJ’s.  He grabs her forehead and leans it 
           into his. 

                                 WYLIE
                        Mom.  Mom.  I got an idea. 

           She looks at him.  Puts her palm on his cheek.

                                 WYLIE (CONT’D)
                        Dance it out.  Okay?  

           She offers a half smile.  Wylie backs away, holding a finger 
           up, as he puts music on. 

                                 WYLIE (CONT’D)
                        I know you don’t wanna, but you 
                        gotta. 

           He BLASTS The Talking Heads THIS MUST BE THE PLACE, grabs his 
           mom’s arms, swings them. 

                                 WYLIE (CONT’D)
                        Pick me up and turn me around...

           Levi comes out, tooth brush in mouth, surveying the scene.  
           And then he jumps right in -- grabs Jane, dips her -- 

                                 LEVI
                        And you’re standing here beside me.    
                        I love the passing of time.

           Emanuela comes in. 

                                 EMANUELA
                        What the... Why didn’t you tell me?

           She grabs Wylie, everyone moves, shaking out the bad night, 
           the bad everything, singing the chorus.  Jane is into it now, 
           stomping her feet, angrily belting out the lyrics -- 

           And there’s a knock on the door. 

           All eyes widen.  Jane turns off the music, as they all fall 
           into a pile on the bed, laughing.  Levi catches Jane’s eye.  
           God he loves her.  God he misses what never was.
           INT. HISTORIC VICTORIAN B&B - BEDROOM - LATER

           Just Jane and Levi now.  Side by side, both stare up at the 
           ceiling.  He grabs her hand. 

                                 LEVI
                        Let’s pretend we’re snow angels.  

                                 JANE
                        Okay.

           They move their arms and legs against the sheets as though 
           they’re in the snow.    

           She rolls onto her side, Levi does the same, their foreheads 
           hit.  They kiss.

           Slowly.  The white sheets bleed into frame, moving, in and 
           out, like waves of a quiet ocean.  We see a Levi’s hand on 
           Jane’s bare back.  His lips on her neck.     

           Outside the window -- indigo night blends into an early 
           morning sky and we find --

           Jane awake.  It’s possible she hasn’t slept.  Levi stirs.  
           Reaches for her.  Smiles when he sees her.  

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        I need to tell Wylie.  

                                 LEVI
                        Tell him what?

                                 JANE
                        About his father. 

                                 LEVI
                        Okay. 

           A beat. 

                                 LEVI (CONT’D)
                        Jane.

                                 JANE
                        Yeah?

                                 LEVI
                        You know, I won’t let you die 
                        alone.  

           She doesn’t look at him.   
                                 JANE
                        But, that’s what I want, Levi.  I 
                        want to be alone.  My mom was 
                        right.  

           He pushes her hair away from her face.

                                 LEVI
                        You know when I saw that flyer, 
                        said you were going to be in 
                        town... it was like time stopped 
                        for a second.  All over again.

                                 JANE
                            (quietly)
                        You came and found me.   

           He nods.    

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        I should have known.  You don’t 
                        hang out at bookstores.  

                                 LEVI
                        Sure don’t.  And then, there you 
                        were... oh, man, flash of light, 
                        flash of something else.  And, for 
                        a second I thought... shit, I got 
                        another chance.  I saw what it 
                        could be.  It was like it happened 
                        for a reason, you stumbled into my 
                        life again for a reason. 

           Jane looks away.  Not wanting to feel these words.  

                                 JANE
                        But, then, you realized there was 
                        really no reason at all.  Life 
                        isn’t like that.  Reasonable.

                                 LEVI
                        Couldn’t disagree more.  This has 
                        been my best thing.  Even if only 
                        for this now, it’s something to me.  
                        It really is. 

           He kisses her forehead and leans in.

                                 LEVI (CONT’D)
                        Remember what we used to say we 
                        were gonna do? 

           She fights a smile.  He whispers something into her ear.  Her 
           smiles grows.  For a moment we see what they once were.  
           INT. HISTORIC VICTORIAN B&B - WYLIE’S ROOM - MORNING

           Jane lies on Wylie’s bed, in her robe.  She looks weak.  
           Wylie is sitting next to her, in pajamas.  

                                 WYLIE
                        He’s coming here.  To meet me? 

                                 JANE
                        Yes.  I’m going to tell you the 
                        truth, Wylie.  Okay? 

                                 WYLIE
                        Okay. 
                            (beat)
                        But, why did you lie, Mom? 

                                 JANE
                        I thought it was better that you 
                        didn’t know.  

                                 WYLIE
                        Because he’s grandpa’s old business 
                        partner?

                                 JANE
                        No, because I did something... I 
                        shouldn’t have.   

                                 WYLIE
                        What? 

           A beat as Jane braces herself.  

                                 JANE
                        I had a relationship with a married 
                        man.  He already had a family.  
                        That’s something you should never 
                        do, Wylie.  But I did it.  I made a 
                        mistake.  

                                 WYLIE
                        Why?  Why did you do that?

                                 JANE
                        I don’t know.  I was sad.  
                        Sometimes when we’re sad we make 
                        bad choices.  And he made me feel 
                        not sad for a moment.     

                                 WYLIE
                        My dad?
                                 JANE
                        Yes.  Edgar.  
                            (beat)
                        But, it wasn’t so bad, because I 
                        got you.  And that has been 
                        everything to me.   

           She squeezes his arm, pushes down a sob that’s been hovering 
           at the surface.  She can’t look at him.  

           And then -- Emanuela BURSTS through the door.  Her hair wet, 
           towel barely wrapped around her body.  Cell phone in hand.

                                 EMANUELA
                        My baby sister’s getting married!!

                                 WYLIE
                        You mean, Teresa?  What?  When? 

                                 EMANUELA
                        I don’t know.  It’s, well, I think 
                        it may be a shotgun wedding.  
                        That’s why my mom’s been hounding 
                        me! 

           Emanuela giggles.  Over-joyed.  Levi pops his head in.

                                 LEVI
                        What’s all the screaming about?  
                        Did I hear something about a gun? 

           He notices Emanuela, tries not to stare at her bare skin.  
           She sees him looking at her in that way.  Both avert their 
           eyes quickly.  Jane sees all of this. 

                                 JANE
                        That’s really great news, Emanuela.    

           Levi notices Jane seems more fatigued than usual. 

                                 LEVI
                        Hey, Janie.  Want me to take the 
                        kid out for a bit?  

                                 WYLIE
                        Yeah!

                                 LEVI
                        Maybe we can go to a shooting 
                        range, movie, the park--

                                 WYLIE
                        Or shopping!!
           Wylie jumps off the bed, excited. 

                                 LEVI
                        Yeah, or that. 

           EXT. HISTORIC VICTORIAN B&B - BACK PORCH - DAY

           Jane sits on large rocking chair, iPhone in hand, next to a 
           teary-eyed Emanuela.  Bird song surrounds them.  

                                 JANE
                        You’re going.  It’s your sister’s 
                        wedding.   

           Jane taps a few things into her phone.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        Ticket has already been purchased.   

                                 EMANUELA
                        Jane. 

                                 JANE
                        Emanuela.

           Jane puts her hand on Emanuela’s knee.  A moment of 
           understanding between them.

           Levi and a pumped up Wylie BURST onto the porch, holding 
           shopping bags.  Wylie wears a blanket like a cape. 

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        That was fast.  What did you guys 
                        get?

                                 LEVI
                        Well, your son, he’s got an eye.  
                        Knows what he wants.  Are we ready 
                        for the unveiling? 

           Emanuela claps her hands and stomps her feet. 

                                 EMANUELA
                        Yeah!  Yeah!  Let’s see!

           Wylie, dramatically flings off the blanket to reveal -- a 
           very Levi-like outfit -- dark jeans, a Longhorn belt buckle, 
           a casual tee.  

           Jane’s face falls. 

                                 WYLIE
                        Oh!  And the finishing touch!
           Wylie reaches into the bag and pulls out a TRUCKER HAT.  He 
           looks adorable, but it’s so average-boy. 

                                 JANE
                        You picked this outfit, Wylie?

                                 WYLIE
                        Yeah.  I wanted to go for a more 
                        local look.  Something different 
                        when I meet my dad. 

           Jane looks at Levi.  

                                 LEVI
                        I swear to God, I had nothing to do 
                        with it.  I mean, check out those 
                        kicks.

           Wylie does a quick tap dance showing off BRIGHT FUCHSIA 
           cowboy boots with rhinestone accents.  

                                 WYLIE
                        You don’t like it?

                                 JANE
                        No.  It’s great.  I just want you 
                        to be you.

                                 WYLIE
                        Well, yeah.  Today I’m feeling 
                        this.  

                                 JANE
                        Okay. 

           Jane smiles weakly. 

           EXT. HISTORIC VICTORIAN B&B - BACK PORCH - LATER

           Wylie, still in his new outfit, rocks on the chair.  Levi and 
           Emanuela play a lazy game of horse shoes on the lawn. 

                                 WYLIE
                        Did he always know about me?

                                 JANE
                        Yes.
                            (beat)
                        He’s not like us, honey.  When you 
                        meet him.  Just know, he’s not like 
                        us.
                                 WYLIE
                        What’s he like?

                                 JANE
                        Conservative.  Opinionated.   

                                 WYLIE
                        Oh.  Like grandpa.

                                 JANE
                        Yeah.  Like grandpa. 

                                 MALE VOICE
                        William and I got as much in common 
                        as a tadpole and a cheetah do. 

           Reveal: EDGAR, 60’s, a shadow of cowboy hides behind his meat-
           lover’s belly, and expensive seersucker suit.  

           Jane stands up.  Doesn’t know whether to shake his hand or 
           hug.  They compromise with a weird in-between gesture.

                                 JANE
                        You found us. 

                                 EDGAR
                        It wasn’t rocket surgery. 

           He laughs at his own joke.  And then noticing Wylie...

                                 EDGAR (CONT’D)
                            (puts out his hand)
                        You must be Wyatt.

                                 WYLIE
                        Wylie.

                                 EDGAR
                        Oh, right, Wylie.  Like the coyote? 

           Wylie doesn’t get it.

                                 EDGAR (CONT’D)
                        You’ve never seen that show?  I 
                        guess it’s before your time.  

                                 WYLIE
                        How old are you?  

           Edgar is taken aback and then cracks up.  Grabs his belly.

                                 EDGAR
                        Right to the point, huh?  I admire 
                        that.  You’ve got courage.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 EDGAR (CONT'D)
                        That’s good, son.  That’s a good 
                        thing.  I’ll be 62 in September.  
                        How do you like that?   

                                 WYLIE
                        I’m nine.  

                                 EDGAR
                        That’s a fun age.  Catching fish, 
                        climbing trees, chasing bugs. 

                                 JANE
                        I’m so sorry... I just... I’m going 
                        to go to the bathroom.

           She gets up, wobbly.  Levi rushes over.  

                                 LEVI
                        You okay?

                                 JANE
                        I’m, yeah.  
                            (re: Wylie)
                        I’ll be back, sweetie.  You guys 
                        are good?

           Wylie nods.  Edgar smiles like a politician.   

           INT. HISTORIC VICTORIAN B&B - BATHROOM - DAY

           Jane hangs over the toilet.  Drenched in sweat.  Her body 
           trembling.  Breathing heavily.  

           She stands up.  But needs to sit again.  She buries her head 
           in her knees.

                                 JANE
                        Shit, shit, shit.  Not now.  God, 
                        please.  Not now.  I’ll do 
                        anything.  Just not now.  

           She quickly lunges for the toilet as she wretches.

           EXT. HISTORIC VICTORIAN B&B - PORCH

           Wylie is warming up to Edgar as he shows him photos on his 
           phone.

                                 EDGAR
                        That’s our dog, Colt.  She makes 
                        sure the chicks don’t run amok.

                        Oh, and that there is sunset over 
                        our dock.   

                                 WYLIE
                        Can I see pictures of your other 
                        kids?

                                 EDGAR
                        Uhh.... You know what, maybe some 
                        time later.  

                                 WYLIE
                        Okay. 

                                 EDGAR
                        We got some catching up to do, 
                        don’t we?

                                 WYLIE
                        We sure do.  

                                 EDGAR
                        What is it you like, Wylie?  What 
                        makes you tick?

           Wylie’s face shines he breaks out of his semi-shy stature, 
           throws open his arms --

                                 WYLIE
                        Fashion!  

                                 EDGAR
                        What?  

           Suddenly Edgar notices Wylie’s pink boots and pieces together 
           the whole picture along with his nail polish... 

                                 EDGAR (CONT’D)
                            (studying him)
                        Are you one of those queer kids?  

           This hits Wylie like a bullet.  He tries to maintain his 
           stature.

                                 WYLIE
                        I don’t... I don’t believe in 
                        labels. 

                                 EDGAR
                        Well, don’t matter what you 
                        believe, because it’s what you are.   
                        Awww, shit.  How did I not... this 
                        ain’t right.  You are not right, 
                        boy. 
           Edgar starts to walk away, all befuddled.  

                                 EDGAR (CONT’D)
                        I don’t know what your mama done, 
                        but I’ll tell you, I’m not going to 
                        lay claim to any fairy in my 
                        bloodline.   

           And then suddenly --

                                 LEVI
                        What did you call him?

                                 EDGAR
                        Kid is queer as a queen!  What’s it 
                        to you?

           Levi lunges for Edgar, who stops him like a linebacker.  The 
           two continue to fight as....

           INT. HISTORIC VICTORIAN B&B - DAY

           Jane shuffles through the rooms, toward the back porch.  She 
           hears SHOUTING.  Jane’s feet pick up pace as she enters --

           EXT. HISTORIC VICTORIAN B&B - BACK PORCH

           Levi is on top of Edgar, his fists pummeling into his face.  
           Edgar attempts to fight him off.  Blood, saliva, torn clothes 
           -- an all out brawl. 

           Wylie and Emanuela stand by, watching in awe.  

                                 LEVI
                        You don’t call a kid that!  What 
                        the heck is wrong with you?

                                 EDGAR
                        You’re nuts!  Get off of me!

                                 JANE
                        What the hell is going on?

                                 EDGAR
                        Your boyfriend is gonna get sued up 
                        the wazoo!  That’s what.

           And BAM Levi clocks him in the jaw.  Edgar gets the look of 
           the devil in him and SLAMS his fist into Levi’s eye.  Levi 
           CRASHES to the ground.  

           Jane buries her hands in her face. 
                                 EDGAR (CONT’D)
                        That ain’t no seed of mine, I’ll 
                        tell you that much. 

           Edgar stomps off.  Levi lifts his aching head.

                                 LEVI
                        Sorry, Jane.  

           Off the crew standing in a shocked silence. 

           EXT. GAS STATION - DAY

           Levi fills the tank.  He has a black eye.  Jane is in the 
           front seat, on her iPad, window rolled down.          

                                 LEVI
                        Hey, Janie.  

                                 JANE
                        Yeah?

                                 LEVI
                        I wanna take him.      

                                 JANE
                        Huh?  Take him where? 

                                 LEVI
                        I wanna be Wylie’s dad. 

                                 JANE
                        What--Levi?  Are you insane? 

                                 LEVI
                        I thought long and hard about it.  
                        Makes alotta sense.  

                                 JANE
                            (shaking her head)
                        Oh, Levi... no, it doesn’t.

                                 LEVI
                        Janie, hear me out.  You know when 
                        you’re trying to screw on the top 
                        of a pickle jar, and the grooves 
                        don’t quite match up, so you gotta 
                        keep working it?  Well, that’s how 
                        my life has always felt.  Just not 
                        on the right path.  And... and, I’m 
                        with you and him, and it’s like 
                        I’ve found that thing--
                                 JANE
                        Levi.  Don’t do this.  Not now.  
                        It’s not going to happen.   

                                 LEVI
                        Just, let me give it a shot.

           Jane opens up the car door, and comes at him, all fire.  iPad 
           in hand. 

                                 JANE
                        Give it a shot?  This isn’t a game 
                        of paint-ball.  And, what -- you 
                        think because you’ve spent a few 
                        days with us on the road you’re 
                        ready to become a parent?  What the 
                        hell, Levi?  This is what you do.  
                        You, you get dazzled by the image, 
                        a fantasy.  Parenting is not a 
                        fantasy.  It’s tedious and mundane 
                        and heartbreaking.  And when 
                        reality hits you, when you see how 
                        it’s not just card games and 
                        shopping sprees, what then?  You 
                        have the freedom to jump onto the 
                        next adventure.  Wylie doesn’t. 
                        Wake up, Levi.  You’re not a 
                        parent.  It’s not who you are.  And 
                        for God’s sake please do not share 
                        this scheme of yours with Wylie.      

                                 LEVI
                        Scheme?  Jesus, Jane.  You’re so 
                        stuck in the past.  I’m trying to 
                        do a good thing--

                                 JANE
                        Stop trying to do the good thing.  

                                 LEVI
                        Well, it’s too late.  I already 
                        talked to him about it.

                                 JANE
                        Whoa.  Whoa.  You -- you what?  
                        Please, for God’s sake please tell 
                        me you did not talk to my son about 
                        this. 

                                 LEVI
                        Yeah, I mean, I wanted to run it by 
                        Wylie first.  
                                 JANE
                        He is a child.  You don’t do this!  
                        You don’t make choices for someone 
                        else’s child!   

                                 LEVI
                        It’s his life, too.

           Jane is fuming.  

                                 JANE
                        This has nothing to do with Wylie.  
                        This is all about you and your need  
                        to be loved, it’s never enough.  
                        You need a god damn fan club, not a 
                        child.  And certain as fuck, not my 
                        child.     

                                 LEVI
                        Life isn’t perfect, Jane.  I’m not 
                        perfect Jane, but I care about that 
                        kid.  And shit happens sometimes, 
                        life is messed up sometimes but--

                                 JANE
                        No!  Shit does not happen.  Not to 
                        me, not in my life.  I’ve made sure 
                        of it.  Every decision I’ve made is 
                        so that shit doesn’t happen.  I 
                        mean for fucks sake I’m the organic 
                        queen and I’m dying of cancer.  
                        What the fuck?!?  No, shit does not 
                        happen.  Not to me.   

           But of course it does and it did to Jane.  This is the real 
           pain she’s running from.  Levi attempts to comfort her, 
           putting a hand on her-- 

                                 LEVI
                        Jane--

                                 JANE
                        Get away from me!  

           She pushes him away.  As she does the iPad goes FLYING.  
           Lands with a THUD.  CRACKED.  She runs to it.   

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        No, no, no, no.  Oh my God, no.  

                                 LEVI
                        Oh, shit.  
                                 JANE
                        Get out of my face, Levi.  

           Emanuela and Wylie approach, with treats from the store.

                                 WYLIE
                        Mom, what’s wrong?  

                                 EMANUELA
                            (re: iPad)
                        You didn’t back it up?

                                 JANE
                        No.  I didn’t.  There was something 
                        for Wylie on here.  Oh my God.  
                        It’s gone.    

                                 LEVI
                        Let me just--

                                 JANE
                        No.  You.  Stay away.  Emanuela, 
                        Wylie in the car.

                                 WYLIE
                        But, Mom--

                                 JANE
                        Now.

           They listen.  Jane makes for the car, cradling the trashed 
           iPad. 

                                 LEVI
                        Don’t do this, Jane.  Come on.  

           She gets in the car, and peels out.  Levi fruitlessly chases 
           after the car, yelling something, but he’s left in the dust. 

           INT. HYBRID - SUV - CONTINUOUS

           Jane, accelerates.  Sweat beading around her scalp.  Wylie, 
           distraught, confused, next to Emanuela who is in shock.

                                 WYLIE
                        Mom?  What’s happening?  Why are we 
                        leaving him? 

                                 JANE
                        Levi’s no longer a part of this 
                        trip.
                                 EMANUELA
                        Jane, come on.  Let’s maybe think 
                        about this.

                                 WYLIE
                        But, mom... but, does this mean, 
                        you’re not going to let him adopt 
                        me?

                                 JANE
                        Wylie.  He’s not capable.  He 
                        shouldn’t have even mentioned the 
                        idea to you.  

                                 WYLIE
                        Yes he is capable.  Mom?  We have 
                        to go back and get him!  We can’t 
                        just leave him!  I want him to be 
                        my dad!  Mom!

                                 JANE
                        I’m sorry, Wylie, but it’s just how 
                        we-- 

           Wylie BANGS on the window, attempting to open the car door.  
           Jane has never seen him like this.

                                 WYLIE
                        You can’t do this!  You can’t do 
                        this!!

           Jane pulls over to the side of the road.  As soon as the car 
           stops, Wylie opens the door and RUNS out.  Jane goes after 
           him.  But she is weak and the tall grass soon consumes him.   

           Jane keeps going, seeing glimpses of his hair, hand, legs 
           pumping against the dirt.  She pushes herself to gain on him 
           until -- 

           She SMASHES into him and they tumble into the mud.  Both a 
           mess.  Wylie’s face is wet with tears, dirt, and saliva.

                                 WYLIE (CONT’D)
                        I don’t want to be alone.  I don’t 
                        want to die alone! 

                                 JANE
                        Wylie, honey, you’re not going to 
                        be alone--

                                 WYLIE
                        YES I AM!  You made me not have a 
                        dad my whole life and now you took 
                        Levi away from me too!  
                                 (MORE)
                                 WYLIE (CONT'D)
                        Emanuela is going to Mexico.  
                        There’s no one left, ma, there’s no 
                        one. 

           She leans into her son, closely.

                                 JANE
                        I always make it work, Wylie.  I 
                        will make this work too.  I 
                        promise.   

           Wylie erupts into convulsive sobs, pushes her away.  

                                 WYLIE
                        You can’t promise!  You’re dying!  
                        You won’t even say it.  Emanuela’s 
                        too much like a kid, Levi breaks 
                        rules, you hate Aisha, I don’t even 
                        know what happened with Becca... no 
                        one is good enough for you.  

                                 JANE
                        Wylie, look at me.  We will find a 
                        home. 

           Jane tries to put her arm around her son, but he pushes her 
           off.   

                                 WYLIE
                        No we won’t!  I’m different and 
                        that scares people.  And I’m scared 
                        too.  I just wish you never had me! 

           He erupts into humongous sobs.  Jane doesn’t know what to do.  
           She’s crestfallen, numb. 

           INT. HYBRID - SUV - DAY

           A sad silence permeates the car.  Emanuela drives.  Jane is 
           in the passenger seat.  In and out of sleep.  

                                 JANE
                        Where are we?  How far are we? 

                                 EMANUELA
                        Close to Texas. 

                                 JANE
                        Emanuela.  The airport.  Your 
                        sister.

                                 EMANUELA
                        Jane.  I can’t.  
           Jane looks defeated.  She feels like she’s screwed it all up. 

                                 JANE
                        We’re not so far from Jalisco.  

                                 EMANUELA
                        We gotta get you home. 

                                 JANE
                        We could make it to Mexico in less 
                        than a day. 

           Emanuela does a double-take.

                                 EMANUELA
                        No.  No way.  We can’t do that. 

                                 JANE
                        Wylie?  It’s your call.  Mexico or 
                        LA?

           Wylie looks at his mom, surprised.  And then resumes his 
           scowl.

                                 WYLIE
                        I don’t care.  It doesn’t matter. 

                                 JANE
                        We’re going to Mexico.  

           Jane smiles at Emanuela.    

                                 EMANUELA
                        Jane, I can’t do that.  I’m sorry.  
                        You’re too sick.  

                                 JANE
                        It’s my cancer wish.  I get a 
                        cancer wish, right?  I want to go 
                        to Mexico.  I want you to see your 
                        sister get married.  I don’t want 
                        to... I don’t want to die knowing 
                        that I’m a primo asshole.     

                                 EMANUELA
                        Jane...

                                 JANE
                        I want to do something right.  
                        Something... 
                            (a beat)
                        I love you, son. 

           But, this time Wylie doesn’t answer.  Still angry with her.
           EXT. THE ROAD - DAY/NIGHT/DAY

           A wide shot of the SUV driving though Texas Highways, and 
           then the BORDER, and then small Mexican farm villages. 

           As the landscape changes, Wylie’s expression does too.  He’s 
           in awe and excited -- they are really doing this.  He looks 
           to his mom for a beat and smiles without her seeing him. 

           EXT. ORTEGA FARM - JALISCO, MEXICO - DAY

           The SUV pulls into a dirt drive way.  Several white stucco 
           cottages line the land.  Rows and rows of GRAIN.  It’s a 
           gorgeous landscape.

           MARIA ORTEGA, 50’s, TERESA ORTEGA, 24, and ABUELITA 70’s, run 
           toward the car.  All smiles.  

           INT./EXT HYBRID - SUV - CONTINUOUS

           Emanuela has an apprehensive expression.  It’s been so long.  
           But as soon as her eyes meet her family’s -- she jumps out of 
           the car and runs into their arms.  Lots of tears, embraces.  

           From now on all italicized dialogue is in Spanish. 

                                 MARIA
                        Oh, my baby!  My darling little 
                        bird!

                                 EMANUELA
                            (to Teresa)
                        You’re really getting married? 

                                 TERESA
                        Can you believe it? 

                                 EMANUELA
                        You’re making me look bad!

           Jane comes out of the car.  She is visibly weak and gaunt. 
           Abuelita immediately, rushes to her side, offering a support.

                                 ABUELITA
                        Come with me, come with me.  You 
                        need rest.  

                                 MARIA
                            (to Jane)
                        Thank you.  Thank you for taking 
                        good care of our daughter. 
                                 JANE
                        She’s taken good care of us.  

           Abuelita ushers Jane toward the cottages.  She resists, 
           looking back at Wylie.  But then, feels too tired to fight it 
           and allows Abuelita to take her.  

           Wylie watches.  Maria gives him a giant hug and a kiss.

                                 MARIA
                        Que Lindo!  Look at this boy.  Are 
                        you hungry? 

           Wylie nods.  

                                 MARIA (CONT’D)
                        We’re making fajitas, corn 
                        tortillas, garlic soup, salsa...  

           She continues on as we float through the ranch and go to: 

           INT. ORTEGA HOME - ABUELITA’S ROOM - DAY

           Simple, white stucco walls.  A wooden cross.  Basic hand-
           carved bed frame that looks as though it’s been passed down 
           for generations.  This is where Jane sleeps, peacefully.

           A clay pitcher of water by her side.  Abuelita, soaks a 
           cloth, and sprinkles dried herbs on it.  She waves the cloth 
           under Jane’s nose and then places it on her head.

           We follow the happy sounds of CHATTER into...

           INT. ORTEGA HOME - KITCHEN - DAY

           Rustic, exposed beams.  Stucco walls.  Colorful pottery and 
           dishes.  Steam and fire come from the ancient gas stove.  
           Chopped vegetables.  A beautiful kind of chaos. 

           Wylie sits on the counter, chopping up garlic.  Maria and 
           Emanuela tend to mixing beans, rolling dough, etc.  There is 
           a faded FRAMED PHOTOGRAPH, of a man in his 40’s, above the 
           sink. 

                                 MARIA
                        Emanuela, this kitchen has missed 
                        you, this land has missed you, we 
                        have missed you. 
                            (she tastes the beans)
                        Roberto, I can’t remember, is it 
                        three chilies or four? 
                            (a beat)
                                 (MORE)
                                 MARIA (CONT'D)
                        Ah! Yes, thank you.  Right as 
                        always. 

                                 EMANUELA
                        I’ve missed you too, mama.

                                 MARIA
                        Ha!  Is that so?  Then why wait 
                        until a wedding to come and see us, 
                        tell us that much. 
                            (a beat)
                        Oh, is that it, Roberto? 

                                 EMANUELA
                        Mom, don’t. 

                                 WYLIE
                        Who’s Roberto?

           Maria points to the framed photo. 

                                 EMANUELA
                        My dad.  

                                 WYLIE
                        Oh.  And you talk to him?  He can 
                        hear you? 

                                 EMANUELA
                        She likes to believe that. 

                                 MARIA
                        Emanuela, I speak English too.
                            (to Wylie)
                        Yes, yes he does.
                            (a beat)
                        Okay, Okay, Roberto.  I heard you! 
                        I’ll ask her.  
                            (to Emanuela)
                        What’s been troubling you, little 
                        bird?

                                 EMANUELA
                        Nothing, Mama.  Nothing at all.

                                 MARIA
                        Are you still singing? 

                                 EMANUELA
                        The beans need more chilies.  Of 
                        course I’m still -- I mean, I 
                        guess, not professionally though.  
                        I don’t know.  Can we not talk 
                        about this? 
           Maria takes the chilies out of Emanuela’s hands. 

                                 MARIA
                        No, more chilies.  Too 
                        overpowering, your papa says.  Does 
                        it still bring you joy... to sing?         

                                 EMANUELA
                        Mom.  Please.     

           Emanuela busies herself with a dish.  Maria puts her arm 
           around her. 

                                 MARIA
                        Or, is it something else you want? 

                                 EMANUELA
                        There’s nothing...
                            (begins to tear up)
                        You always ask about my singing!

                                 MARIA
                        But, I thought you liked to talk 
                        about it. 

                                 EMANUELA
                        Look, I messed it up.  I had my one 
                        chance, and it’s passed and I feel 
                        so guilty, okay?  Is that what you 
                        want to hear?  I feel so damn 
                        guilty that you used your savings, 
                        and your prayers, and I left you 
                        and Teresa, only a few years after 
                        Papa died, and I didn’t make it 
                        happen.  I’ve failed you both.  Is 
                        this what you’ve waited to hear?

           Maria brings her hand to her cheek, sweetly. 

                                 MARIA
                        My sweet daughter, it’s not good to 
                        hold onto pain like that.  I wanted 
                        to hear your truth.  Oh, and... 
                        papa says he’s not mad, you needn’t 
                        feel guilty at all.  Guilt is such 
                        a silly waste of time and energy.

                                 EMANUELA
                        No he didn’t, Mama, he’s not saying 
                        that.

                                 WYLIE
                        Yeah, he is!  I think I heard him 
                        too!  He’s not mad.  He loves you!
                                 MARIA
                        Ah, you have the gift, little boy, 
                        do you?

                                 EMANUELA
                        You both are crazy.

                                 MARIA
                        And he says to stop dating boys who 
                        still live with their parents. 

           Emanuela bursts out laughing.  Wylie stares wide-eyed, looks 
           at the photo, thinking about the after-life... 

           INT. ORTEGA HOME - ABUELITA’S ROOM - BATHROOM

           Jane carefully bathes herself in a claw foot tub.  Dried 
           Lavender floats in the water.  She picks up a sprig and 
           smells it.        

           She glances at the MIRROR.  Sees her hallowed face, dark 
           circles around her eyes.  She quickly looks away. 

           INT. ORTEGA HOME - ABUELITA’S ROOM - LATER

           Abuelita helps Jane into a wheel chair.  Hands her a hat.  

                                 ABUELITA
                        The air will be good for you, now.  
                        Healing for the spirit.         

           Jane is lethargic, her body beginning to break down but she 
           attempts to use hand gestures to communicate with Abuelita.  

                                 JANE
                        You have a beautiful home.  Truly, 
                        it’s so beautiful.  I’ve never seen 
                        anything like it.   

           Abuelita smiles. 

           EXT. ORTEGA FARM - JALISCO, MEXICO

           Jane sits in her chair underneath a tree.  A view of the 
           rolling hills in the distance, the crops.   

           Abuelita guides Jane out of the chair. 
                                 ABUELITA
                        A little walking.  It will give you 
                        some peace.  You want to move some 
                        of that old energy. 

           Jane steadies herself, leaning a little on Abuelita. 

                                 JANE
                        Abuelita, I’m going to die here.  
                        Aren’t I? 

           Abuelita smiles and pats her hand.  Maybe because Jane knows 
           she can’t understand her, she feels a freedom in her ability 
           to speak her mind.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        I’m so tired.  I’m so tired of 
                        trying to make it all fit.  I’m 
                        just so tired.    

                                 ABUELITA
                        This is where my son was buried.  
                        Roberto.      

                                 JANE
                        Roberto... Emanuela’s father?  
                        Padre, Emanuela?

           Abuelita smiles and nods. 

                                 ABUELITA
                        He had a heart condition.  I like 
                        to believe it’s because his heart 
                        was so big and with each loving 
                        word and gesture and thought it 
                        grew to a magnitude that his body 
                        could no longer hold so it expanded 
                        and emerged with the ether.  And 
                        now, he can be with us all, the 
                        blessed and the cursed, the wicked 
                        and the pious, infusing us with 
                        love when we need it. 

                                 JANE
                        That’s tough to out-live a son.  
                        Well, it’s also tough to leave a 
                        son.   

           Jane begins to cry into her hands.  Covering her face.  
           Abuelita comforts her, pats her on the back. 

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        I don’t know what to do.  I’ve done 
                        it all wrong, I think.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        All of my life I've spent trying to 
                        be a better parent, but I'm not a 
                        good mother, I'm not really a good 
                        mother, I want for Wylie what I 
                        want, not what he wants.  I want 
                        him to be free and expressive and 
                        safe and all of these things that I 
                        think are good, but I've never 
                        asked him what he wants.  Oh, my 
                        God, I’ve failed him.    
                            (she sobs into her hands)
                        I’ve failed him.  I haven’t found a 
                        home.  I haven’t done the right 
                        thing.  I don’t know what the right 
                        thing is anymore.

                                 ABUELITA
                        I asked Roberto to be with you.  He 
                        will usher you to the other side, 
                        when it’s time. He’s a good man, 
                        Roberto.     

           Jane looks at the landscape.  Really takes it in.  Feels a 
           sense of relief after that release.  Abuelita leads Jane back 
           into the wheelchair.  Jane looks at Abuelita. 

                                 JANE
                        Abuelita, thank you.  

                                 ABUELITA
                        De nada.  

           And the two head back toward the cottages. 

           EXT. ORTEGA FARM - JALISCO, MEXICO

           Brightly colored banners, paper lanterns, table clothes, are 
           being set up as Maria, Emanuela, and Abuelita rush about, 
           readying for the wedding.  

           We notice a FIGURE in the window -- push through to:

           INT. ORTEGA HOME - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Wylie sits on the sink, watching the beautiful chaos outside.  
           He looks up at Roberto’s photo. 

                                 WYLIE
                        Roberto.  Will you take care of my 
                        mom for me?  

           Wylie pauses as if he’s listening. 
                                 WYLIE (CONT’D)
                        I want to stay here.  I want to 
                        live here, Roberto.  

           Wylie smiles, jumps off the sink and runs off.  REVEAL: Jane 
           standing by the entryway, leaning on the wall for support.  
           She’s heard everything. 

           EXT. ORTEGA FARM - JALISCO, MEXICO - NIGHT

           Stringed lights, a gorgeous starlit sky, provide a magical 
           backdrop for a wedding reception that is in full swing.  

           Dancing, and eating, and drinking.  Teresa in a wedding gown, 
           does the rounds with her HUSBAND.  

           Wylie, dressed in borrowed clothes, dances with Emanuela and 
           a bunch of YOUNG KIDS.  

           INT. ORTEGA HOME - ABUELITA’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Jane, gaunt, propped up in bed takes in the sounds of 
           celebration.    And then--

                                 MALE VOICE 
                        Hey.  Janie.  

           Jane turns and sees Levi walking toward her.  She covers her 
           face, embarrassed.   

                                 JANE
                        Levi.  What are you doing here?  I 
                        don’t have make up.  

           Levi sits gently on the bed.  Pulls  her hands away.

                                 LEVI
                        You don’t need to do that, come on.  
                        I’ve seen you worse.  All of those 
                        gin-soaked mornings...    

                                 JANE
                        What are you doing here?

           He looks at her.  

                                 LEVI
                        I made a promise.  

           She looks away. 
                                 JANE
                        Levi, I’m sorry...

           He puts his finger to her lips.  Trying not to become too 
           emotional.  It’s hard to see someone this close to death. 

                                 LEVI
                        Shhhh... I know you are.  I am too.  
                        In another life... you know, me and 
                        you.  But, we’ve got this one, so 
                        let’s just, let it all be.  

                                 JANE
                        Okay.  

                                 LEVI
                        I brought someone with me.  

           He motions and Catherine enters.  Jane is shocked.  

                                 JANE
                        Mom?  

                                 CATHERINE
                        Hi, honey.  

           Catherine’s eyes fill with tears.  She can’t hold back, she 
           runs to the bed and grabs her daughter.  

                                 CATHERINE (CONT’D)
                        I’m so sorry, I’m just so sorry, 
                        I’m so sorry.

           Levi gets up and quietly exits.  

                                 JANE
                        I can’t believe you flew to Mexico. 

                                 CATHERINE
                        I’m here.  I’m going to stay here, 
                        as long as you don’t mind.  You’re 
                        father... he just...

                                 JANE
                        It’s okay mom, it’s okay.  

                                 CATHERINE
                        How are you feeling? 

           Jane looks away for a beat.  
                                 JANE
                        Really... odd.  It feels like a big 
                        event is about to happen, a 
                        holiday.  And it is.  I am going to 
                        die.  

           EXT. ORTEGA FARM - JALISCO, MEXICO

           Wylie dances with Emanuela when suddenly his EYES BULGE -- he 
           breaks away and LEAPS into Levi’s arms.

                                 WYLIE
                        You’re back!  You’re back!

           Levi hugs him.  Choked up by how much love Wylie has. 

           INT. ORTEGA HOME - ABUELITA’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Catherine now lays next to her daughter.  Holds her hand.

                                 JANE
                        I don’t know what to do.  He wants 
                        to live here. 

                                 CATHERINE
                        Here?  As in Mexico?  With the 
                        Ortegas? 

           Jane nods. 

                                 JANE
                        I heard him talking to Roberto 
                        about it--   

                                 CATHERINE
                        Roberto?  Who’s that? 

                                 JANE
                        Emanuela’s dead father.  I know, 
                        it’s weird.  But, I feel like I can 
                        feel his presence too, actually.  

                                 CATHERINE
                        Oh.  Well, does he answer Wylie 
                        back? 

           Jane laughs at the whole absurdity of it all, Catherine 
           begins to as well.   

                                 JANE
                        I wish he did. 
                                 CATHERINE
                        Well.  Maybe Wylie has the answer, 
                        maybe you don’t need to have the 
                        answer this time.  You’ve done 
                        enough already.  You’ve raised an 
                        incredible, happy boy.   

           Jane looks at her mom curiously, she’s never heard her talk 
           like this.  She leans into her mom’s chest, like a little 
           girl. 

           INT. ORTEGA HOME - ABUELITA’S ROOM - MORNING

           Jane’s lies in bed, hoarse breathing.  Catherine holds her 
           hand.  Levi is on the other side of her, his hand resting on 
           her arm.  

                                 JANE
                            (panicked)
                        I don’t want to be in here.  I want 
                        to be outside, can I be outside?  

           She tries to lift herself up.  Levi gently stops her. 

                                 LEVI
                        Whatever you want, Janie.  We can 
                        make that happen, right? 

           He looks to Catherine and she nods her head. 

                                 CATHERINE
                        Yes, of course. 

           EXT. ORTEGA FARM - JALISCO, MEXICO

           Levi, Catherine, Emanuela, Maria, and Abuelita carry a 
           mattress, pillows, blankets, paper lanterns from the wedding, 
           etc.  

           They set it beneath the tree where Roberto is buried.  

           EXT. ORTEGA FARM - JALISCO, MEXICO - MOMENT LATER

           Jane is carried up the hill in a make shift stretcher, by 
           Levi, Catherine, Maria, and some other HELPERS. 

           JANE’S POV: The hands that carry her, the moving earth 
           beneath her, the sky, Wylie’s floppy hair, his sideways 
           glance toward his mom, and his sweet smile.   
           EXT. ORTEGA FARM - JALISCO, MEXICO - LATER

           Jane rests underneath the tree.  Wylie is snuggled with her.  
           She rubs his face, looks into his eyes. 

                                 WYLIE
                        I think I know my values now, mom.

           Jane’s speech is belabored.  But this moment is so important 
           to her.  She wants to make it last. 

                                 JANE
                        You do?  

                                 WYLIE
                        Yeah.  I didn’t before but... this 
                        whole trip, making the lists and 
                        meeting people...

                                 JANE
                        Tell them to me.  I would love to 
                        hear. 

                                 WYLIE
                        Well... I don’t have a word for 
                        this but I like being around people 
                        who believe in good things.  Who 
                        are good to all people.  Who do the 
                        right thing, cuz it’s the right 
                        thing to do, not because someone 
                        told them or anything like that.    

                                 JANE
                        It’s a feeling more than a word.  
                        Isn’t it?  

           Wylie smiles.

                                 WYLIE
                        Uh-huh.  Yeah, it is and that’s 
                        kind of like my other one too... I 
                        value people that are really 
                        loving, like you can feel it kind 
                        of love, not just words, but with 
                        hugs and cuddles. 

           Jane snuggles into him, smiling. 

                                 JANE
                        That’s a good one too. 
                                 WYLIE
                        And... I value people who help make 
                        a place have a lot of laughter, and 
                        cooking, playing, dancing, and 
                        being together.

                                 JANE
                        Community?

                                 WYLIE
                        Yeah, that.  And then, together all 
                        of us can make a life fantastic. 

           Jane looks at him curiously.

                                 JANE
                        How do you know that?  That phrase?  

           Wylie’s unsure if he should tell her.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        Did you watch the video on my iPad 
                        before it broke? 

           Wylie shakes his head.  Jane is confused. 

                                 WYLIE
                        No.  Levi said it to me.  A while 
                        ago.  He said that if he were my 
                        dad, we could build a life 
                        fantastic together.  And we talked 
                        about how... 

           This is all Jane needed to hear.  She knows now what she 
           needed to know.  She kisses him on the cheek. 

                                 JANE
                            (quietly)
                        Levi and I used to say that to each 
                        other.  We were going to build a  
                        life fantastic.

           EXT. ORTEGA FARM - JALISCO, MEXICO

           As the sun sets, flickering lights march up the hill toward 
           Jane and Wylie. Emanuela, Levi, Catherine, Abuelita, all hold 
           a candles. 

           Wylie snuggles in closer to his mom.  Her breathing is 
           shallow, hoarse and slowing down. It’s clear this is it.  
           Tears fall down their faces. 
                                 WYLIE
                        I love you, mama.

                                 JANE
                        I love you, son. 

           Abuelita gathers everyone into a circle around Jane’s bed.   
           Jane looks at all of the faces filled with love surrounding 
           her.  She looks to Emanuela.

                                 JANE (CONT’D)
                        Emanuela, will you sing? 

                                 EMANUELA
                        Yes, of course.  What would you 
                        like? 

                                 JANE
                        Anything. 

           Emanuela thinks a moment, smiles...

                                 EMANUELA
                        Home is where I want to be, pick me 
                        up and turn me around.  I feel 
                        numb, born with a weak heart, I 
                        guess we must be having fun... Home 
                        is where I want to be but I guess 
                        I’m already there...

           Emanuela’s stunning and languid version of The Talking Heads, 
           “This Must be the Place” continues... Jane looks up, she 
           grabs Levi’s hand, she grab’s Wylie’s hand and places them 
           together. 

           She closes her eyes.  The song continues as we float above, 
           the flickering lights of the candle casting a beautiful 
           circle around her, all fades to white and we see the lost 
           IPAD FOOTAGE of Jane’s life fantastic:

           - Jane messy crying as she holds NEWBORN WYLIE for the first 
           time.  Way before that pristine photo was taken.   

           - Jane holding INFANT WYLIE as she dances with him in their 
           bare empty new home, time blends as baby Wylie grows into a 
           toddler, a boy, the home becomes more lived in, and they’re 
           still dancing, we see his eyes smile, we see his polished 
           nails, we see the joy and love in both of their faces...

           THE LUMINEERS VERSION OF THIS MUST BE THE PLACE OVERLAPS 
           Emanuela as the images blend into BARE FEET moving to the 
           BEAT of the racing guitar riff on a floor --
           INT. ORTEGA HOME - KITCHEN - MONTHS LATER

           Reveal Wylie dancing his pain and sadness out with Levi who 
           lip syncs using a spoon as a mic --

           Levi twirls him  toward Maria who chops, but breaks for a 
           moment to dance with him, and then with mad skills he moves 
           to Abuelita, who stops washing dishes to join Wylie’s dance, 
           we push through a SIDE WINDOW -- 

           EXT. ORTEGA HOME - DRIVE WAY

           Emanuela steps out of a car, luggage in hand.  She looks 
           vibrant, a shine about her.  She pauses as she watches the 
           dancing through the window.  A soft smile. 

           INT. ORTEGA HOME - KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           Emanuela RUSHES into the dance party, swoops Wylie up and 
           spins him around. 

                                 WYLIE
                        Emanuela!!!

           Maria, Abuelita, and Levi all greet Emanuela with hugs.

                                 EMANUELA
                        I’m happy to see that everyone is 
                        still dancing. 

                                 WYLIE
                        How’s the Conservatorio de las 
                        Rosas?  When can I visit? 

                                 EMANUELA
                        Oh my God, it’s better than 
                        anything I could have imagined... 

           She notices Levi, blank-faced.  He doesn’t understand much 
           Spanish yet.  She switches to English. 

                                 EMANUELA (CONT’D)
                        You can feel the history, the 
                        centuries of music in the stone 
                        walls and under the archways.  It’s 
                        really something magical. 

                                 LEVI
                        You found your place. 

                                 EMANUELA
                        I did. 
           Wylie smiles, makes his way to the dishes, picking up where 
           Abuelita stopped.  A FRAMED PHOTO of Jane is now right next 
           to Roberto.  

                                 WYLIE
                            (quiet)
                        I love you, Mama.

           He pauses as if he hears a response and then he looks up -- 

           TWO birds land on the window sill, they chirp at Wylie.  And 
           then we follow them through the window as they take flight, 
           move up the hill, and to the tree where Jane now rests with 
           Roberto.  

           THE END.
