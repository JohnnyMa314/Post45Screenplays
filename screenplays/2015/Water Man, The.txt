           SWEEPING ACROSS THE MONTANA WILDERNESS - DUSK

           A CHILD SINGS:

                                 CHILD (V.O.)
                        One, two three, four / Close your 
                        windows, lock your door --

           EXT. EDGE OF THE WILD HORSE FOREST - DUSK

           Massive pine trees rise like gothic spires.

           A group of BOYS (mid-teens) watch as a LANKY KID (15) inches 
           closer to the forest.

                                 CHILD (V.O.)
                        Cuz you never know for sure / Who 
                        it is he’s coming for --

           The Lanky Kid’s friends egg him on -- 

                                 FRIENDS
                        Go on! Don’t be a pussy! Do it, 
                        dude!

                                 CHILD (V.O.)
                        Five, six, seven, eight / By the 
                        time it’s getting late --

           He disappears into the forest -- 

           EXT. WILD HORSE FOREST - CONTINUOUS

           Dark. Dense. Strange CARVINGS scar a few of the trees.

           WHOOSH! A gust of ICE-COLD WIND hits him -- something deep 
           within the forest SHRIEKS.

           The Lanky Kid turns around and bolts out of the forest --

                                 CHILD (V.O.)
                        All you can do is wait / Til the 
                        Water Man decides your fate.

           The boys jump on their bikes, pedaling down the dirt road.
           EXT. WILLOW SPUR, MONTANA - MAIN STREET - NIGHT

           A faded mom-and-pop antique store, two gas pumps with a 
           general store behind, and Willow Spur Liquor Mart, the most 
           modern and groomed of them all. 

           Small-town Montana, stuck decades in the past. 

                                 CHILD (V.O.)
                        Nine, ten, eleven, too / Ain’t a 
                        thing that you can do --

           FLASHES AROUND WILLOW SPUR

           ONE OF THE KIDS on a bike finally makes it home -- he runs 
           inside his house, locking every bolt on the front door.

                                 CHILD (V.O.)
                        If the Water Man comes through / 
                        And his hungry eyes’re set on you --

           Two SISTERS (8-9) watch TV -- the WINDOW suddenly blows open -- 
           the older one wraps her arms around the younger.

                                 CHILD (V.O.)
                             (slowing down)
                        One, two three, four / Close your 
                        windows, lock your door --

           In the dark, a YOUNG BOY huddles under the covers, eyes glued 
           to SOMEONE’S SILHOUETTE visible through the door frame.

           DEEP IN THE FOREST

           The trees are faintly outlined by the half-moon. A SHADOW 
           passes through the trees.

           Or was that just a trick of the eye?

                                 CHILD (V.O.)
                        Cuz you never know for sure / Who 
                        it is he’s coming for.

                                                              FADE OUT.

           FADE IN:

           EXT. WILLOW SPUR - TOWN LIMITS - DAY

           Angel-hair grasses. Emerald trees. Royal purple mountains. A 
           sky so deep and blue it gives “infinite” real meaning. 
           A SIGN reads: “WELCOME TO WILLOW SPUR, MONTANA; POPULATION 
           728.” 

           Something mechanical WHIRS out of frame --

           GUNNER BOONE (10, a small boy always lost in his imagination) 
           speeds past on his bike. A RED WAGON attached to the back 
           CLATTERS over the dirt road, not meant for such high speeds.

           Wherever he’s going, he’s trying to get there NOW.

           EXT. FLATHEAD COUNTY CEMETERY - DAY

           FUNERAL ATTENDEES gather around an open grave -- the coffin 
           descends into the earth. The PREACHER (40s) gives his sermon.

                                 PREACHER
                        ... until you return to the 
                        ground...

           Gunner pulls up, red-faced and winded. He sets his bike-wagon 
           against the cemetery fence and sneaks toward the funeral.

                                 PREACHER (CONT’D)
                        ... since from it you were taken...

           He hides behind a tree, pulling out BINOCULARS. He focuses on 
           the COFFIN going into the ground -- the widow’s face, 
           streaked with TEARS -- the preacher giving his sermon.

                                 PREACHER (CONT’D)
                        ... for dust you are and to dust 
                        you will return.

           Gunner watches the funeral, fascinated.

           INT. GUNNER BOONE’S ROOM - DAY

           The floor, bedside table, and bookshelf are filled with BOOKS -- 
           stacked in a corner is a pile with “FLATHEAD COUNTY PUBLIC 
           LIBRARY” STICKERS on their jacket covers.

           Gunner is bent over a NOTEBOOK, filling in self-drawn COMIC 
           BOOK PANELS --

                                 GUNNER (V.O.)
                        “Detective Richard Knoxx floated 
                        through the police tape, looking 
                        around the crime scene...”
           FLASH INSIDE GUNNER’S IMAGINATION

           POLICE TAPE circles an old log cabin -- the investigation 
           already underway. A TRANSPARENT GHOST, DETECTIVE KNOXX (40s, 
           a film noir-esque detective) floats through the scene, eyes 
           scanning the area.

                                 GUNNER (V.O.)
                        “It was his third crime scene of 
                        the day and it wasn’t even noon --”

                                 MARY BOONE (O.S.)
                        Gunner?

           BACK TO REALITY

           Gunner’s head snaps up -- MARY BOONE (late 20s, a loving 
           mother, very thin) is in the doorway. 

                                 MARY
                        Wanna help me set the table?

           Gunner nods, tucking the notebook away. He grabs a SHERLOCK 
           HOLMES BOOK from the bedside table.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        What’d you do today?

                                 GUNNER
                        Went to a funeral.

                                 MARY
                        A funeral?

                                 GUNNER
                        I have writer’s block. My main 
                        character is investigating his own 
                        murder, but I don’t know how to 
                        describe a dead body ‘cause I’ve 
                        never seen one.

                                 MARY
                        The detective is investigating his 
                        own murder?

                                 GUNNER
                        Yeah, Detective Knoxx is a ghost.

                                 MARY
                        You don’t need to see a dead body 
                        to write about it. How would 
                        Sherlock Holmes describe a dead 
                        body?
                                 GUNNER
                        I want to describe it in a new way, 
                        not how Sir Arthur Conan Doyle did!

           Their conversation fades as they leave the book-filled room.

           PRELAP: A heavy, grating NOISE -- 

           EXT. FLATHEAD COUNTY CONSTRUCTION SITE - LATE AFTERNOON

           A BUZZSAW cuts through wood.

           Gunner’s father, AMOS BOONE (early 30s, too young to look so 
           worn), walks through the site, CLIPBOARD in hand, marking off 
           progress on a report.

           INT./EXT. AMOS’S TRUCK - MOVING - DUSK

           Amos drives his ‘74 Chevy, his mind a million miles away. He 
           swerves, giving a wide berth to KIDS riding their bikes.

           EXT. GUNNER BOONE’S HOUSE - DUSK

           The Boone home is sagging and worn-down, but Mary’s strict 
           maintenance schedule keeps it tidy and presentable. 

           Amos parks in the dirt driveway.

           His NEIGHBOR (30s) plays baseball with his SON (13) in his 
           yard. A “PROUD PARENT OF A WILLOW SPUR WILDCAT” SPORTS SIGN 
           is planted near their front door. 

           Amos watches the happy father-and-son scene before entering 
           his own house.

           INT. DINING ROOM - GUNNER BOONE’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Amos, Mary, and Gunner eat a simple dinner of chicken, 
           potatoes, and broccoli at the dining table. An antique RIFLE 
           hangs ceremoniously above the fireplace nearby.

           Gunner reads Sherlock Holmes, nestled covertly in his lap.

                                 AMOS
                        No books at the table. 

           Gunner didn’t hear. Or didn’t listen. 

                                 AMOS (CONT’D)
                        Gunner --
                                 MARY
                        Baby, put the book away.

           Gunner closes the book.  

                                 AMOS
                             (to Gunner)
                        You go outside at all today? 

           Gunner stabs at a piece of chicken with his fork.

                                 MARY
                        He did. Went to a funeral. 

                                 AMOS
                        A funeral?

                                 MARY
                        It’s research for a book he’s 
                        writing.

                                 AMOS
                        Why the hell you goin’ to funerals, 
                        Gunner? Go outside and have fun.

                                 MARY
                        Maybe you boys could do something 
                        together this weekend?

           Amos stares at his son -- Gunner keeps his eyes on his food.

                                 AMOS
                        Yeah, sure. Maybe we could play 
                        baseball.

                                 GUNNER
                        I hate baseball. It’s...
                             (enunciating carefully)
                        ... sophomoric.

                                 AMOS
                        We can drive out to the high school 
                        field, toss a couple.

                                 GUNNER
                             (challenging)
                        Do you even know what that word 
                        means?

                                 AMOS
                        It means lose the attitude or 
                        you’re goin’ to bed hungry.

           Gunner drops his gaze and OPENS HIS BOOK --
                                 MARY
                        Gunner!

                                 AMOS
                        That’s the way it’s gonna be, huh? 
                        To your room, now. 

           Gunner looks at his mom, pleading. 

                                 MARY
                        Uh-uh, no soft eyes for me, mister. 
                        Time for a time-out. 

                                 GUNNER
                        I’d rather read in my room, anyway.

           Gunner skulks away, SLAMMING his door shut. Mary turns, 
           giving Amos “the look” --

                                 AMOS
                        What?! What did I do?

           INT. GUNNER’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Gunner crouches by the side of his bedroom door, listening --

                                 MARY (O.S.)
                        You made him feel weird about going 
                        to the funeral.

                                 AMOS (O.S.)
                        Well, it is weird. He can’t be 
                        filling his head with stuff like 
                        that. ‘Specially now.

           Silence. Gunner frowns, jamming his ear against the door -- 

                                 AMOS (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Oh, Mary. I’m sorry. 

           The scuffling of a chair being moved.

                                 MARY (O.S.)
                             (voice wavering)
                        No, you’re right... You’re right... 
                        Oh, Jesus... Amos...

           Their voices fade to muffled whispers and consolations.

           Gunner creaks his door open and peers out -- but Mary and 
           Amos have retreated to their bedroom, the DOOR CLOSED.

           Gunner jumps in bed.
           In the stillness, Gunner’s HEART BEAT starts to pound loudly. 
           He puts his hand on his chest -- it QUICKENS.

           Duh-duhn, duh-DUHN! Then -- it STOPS. 

           Gunner’s eyes widen in terror. He balls his hands into fists 
           and hits his sternum again and again.

           But his heart is still -- his skin turns WHITE, like the 
           blood is being sucked out of him.

           He hits his chest harder --

                                 MARY (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Gunner?

           Gunner sits up straight in bed -- Mary stands in the open 
           doorway, a PLATE OF FOOD in her hand. She comes over and sits 
           next to him, setting the plate on the night stand.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        Gunner, baby, what are you doing?

           Sweat beads on his forehead. He pants like he saw a ghost.

                                 GUNNER
                        My heart stopped.

                                 MARY
                        But that would mean you’re dead. 
                        And if you’re dead, who’s going to 
                        eat this toast house?

           On the plate are pieces of TOAST cut into strips and arranged 
           like a log cabin. Smaller pieces of toast lean together on 
           top like a roof. 

           Gunner wraps his arms around his mother, burying his head 
           against her. She rubs his hair tenderly. 

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        You know, it hurts Dad when you’re 
                        rude to him at dinner. Just keep 
                        his feelings in mind, okay?

           He stares at a drawing of Detective Knoxx --

                                 GUNNER
                        Do you think you actually go to 
                        heaven or hell when you die?
                                 MARY
                        I’ve always felt that you make your 
                        own heaven or hell right here on 
                        Earth. 

                                 GUNNER
                        How?

                                 MARY
                        Say you’re a bad person. You’ve 
                        spent all your life doing bad 
                        things, and after you die, that’s 
                        how it is for eternity. So all you 
                        got to remember are those bad 
                        things you did. That sounds like 
                        hell to me. 

           Gunner absorbs this. Mary kisses the top of his head.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        You’re not going to die for a long 
                        time, baby.

           He nods, leaning against her. She rocks him back and forth, 
           biting her lip to hold back tears.

           INT. GUNNER’S ROOM - MORNING

           Gunner is asleep, splayed across his sheets. The door opens --

           Amos enters, carrying two BASEBALL GLOVES and a BASEBALL. He 
           jostles Gunner awake. 

                                 AMOS
                        Hey...

                                 GUNNER
                             (groggily)
                        What time is it?

                                 AMOS
                        Quarter to eight. 

                                 GUNNER
                        It’s summer!

           Gunner tries to pull the covers over his head.

                                 AMOS
                        Come on, let’s toss a couple before 
                        I gotta go. 
                                 GUNNER
                        I’m not playing baseball.

           Amos and Gunner glare at each other. 

                                 AMOS
                        Either way, you’re getting up and 
                        going outside. 

           Amos leaves, but keeps the door open -- SUNLIGHT floods 
           Gunner’s room.

           EXT. COUNTY ROAD 82 - DAY

           Gunner bikes lazily down the county road. Up ahead, he spots 
           a LINE OF KIDS snaking down from something in the forest.

           Through the trees, Gunner spots what they’re looking at -- a 
           RAGTAG FORT -- DEER SKULLS and a faded AMERICAN FLAG adorn 
           the structure -- a CURTAIN obscures the entrance.

           A kid’s laborious efforts toward a kingdom of his own.

           Gunner brakes as he approaches the last kid in a line -- a 
           PUDGY KID (9), eagerly craning his neck toward the front.

                                 GUNNER
                        What are you guys waiting for?

                                 PUDGY KID
                        Joseph Riley’s telling about how he 
                        got attacked by the Water Man.

           A FRECKLED BOY (11) turns around in line.

                                 FRECKLED BOY
                        Yeah, chargin’ a dollar for it, 
                        too.

                                 PUDGY KID
                        A dollar?

                                 GUNNER
                        How do you know he’s not ripping 
                        you off?

                                 PUDGY KID
                        Crap, I only have fifty cents --

           The curtain on the fort PULLS BACK -- a brooding boy with a 
           FRESH SCAR ON HIS FACE -- JOSEPH RILEY (12), the alleged 
           Water Man survivor, stands before the line of kids.
           A YOUNG BOY (10) leaves the fort, visibly shaken. The kids in 
           line watch in silent, fearful awe.

           Joseph Riley motions for the next kid in line. They disappear 
           into the fort.

           Gunner plants his feet on his bike pedals and rides away.

           INT. GROCERY STORE - NIGHT

           Amos sets assorted GROCERIES on the check-out counter -- 
           among them is a white paper PHARMACY BAG. 

           The PLUMP CHECKER (30s) scans the items. Amos watches the 
           tally rise. The white pharmacy bag jumps the price up $50.

                                 PLUMP CHECKER
                        Any coupons?

           Amos shakes his head “no.”

                                 PLUMP CHECKER (CONT’D)
                        One oh-nine eighty-five.

           Amos digs through his wallet -- 

                                 AMOS
                        I only got eighty...

           He and the checker start putting things back. PEOPLE in line 
           watch him -- judging, annoyed, amused.

           INT. GUNNER’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Gunner, in bed, writes in his notebook -- the ghostly 
           DETECTIVE KNOXX floats through a crime scene.

                                 GUNNER (V.O.)
                        “Detective Knoxx had searched eleven 
                        months and twelve days for his body -
                        - now, finally, he was going to see 
                        who, or what, killed him...”

           From the bathroom, Mary COUGHS loudly. Gunner sets the 
           notebook aside and jumps out of bed.

           INT. AMOS AND MARY’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Gunner knocks on his parents’ bathroom door --
                                 GUNNER
                        Mom? Mom! Are you sick again?

           Behind the door, we can hear Mary VOMITING. 

                                 MARY (O.S.)
                             (shakily)
                        I’m okay, baby... I’m okay...

           The front door CREAKS OPEN -- 

                                 AMOS (O.S.)
                        Hello?

           INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Gunner runs out.

                                 GUNNER
                        Mom’s sick again! 

           Amos drops the GROCERY BAGS he’s carrying and sprints to his 
           room. Gunner follows --

                                 AMOS
                             (sharply)
                        Stay out here.

           Amos closes the bedroom door, leaving Gunner alone. 

           Gunner turns -- sees the spilled groceries. The white 
           pharmacy bag is among them. Gunner grabs it -- “500 MG KYTRIL 
           FOR MARY BOONE.”

           Gunner looks to his parents’ bedroom door -- silence. He grabs 
           the phone, dialing the number on the pharmacy bag.

                                 PHARMACIST (O.S.)
                             (on the phone)
                        Flathead County Pharmacy.

                                 GUNNER
                        Hello, can you tell me what...
                             (reading the label)
                        Kytril is for?

                                 PHARMACIST (O.S.)
                        Kytril... let me see here. “Nausea 
                        and dizziness following 
                        chemotherapy” --

           Gunner, stunned, hangs up.
           INT. AMOS AND MARY’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Amos is helping Mary to bed. Gunner enters. He has an OPEN 
           DICTIONARY balanced in his arms.

                                 AMOS
                        I told you to stay out --

                                 MARY
                        No, it’s okay. Come here, baby.

           She opens her arms, an invitation to jump in bed. Gunner 
           instead reads from the dictionary --

                                 GUNNER
                        Chemotherapy, “the treatment of 
                        disease by means of chemicals that 
                        have a specific toxic effect upon 
                        the disease-producing 
                        microorganisms or that selectively 
                        destroy cancerous tissue.”

           Amos and Mary exchange a glance. 

                                 GUNNER (CONT’D)
                        Chemotherapy is for cancer. 

           Mary swallows hard -- struggling to maintain composure --

                                 MARY
                        Please, come here.

                                 GUNNER
                        You said you were fine! 

                                 MARY
                        I... I have a certain kind of 
                        leukemia that is very hard to treat --

           Tears brim in his eyes.

                                 GUNNER
                        I can help you get better... I can 
                        make you toast houses and chicken 
                        soup --

                                 MARY
                        Baby, listen to me...

           Amos grabs Mary’s hand. Her voice wavers. 

                                 GUNNER
                        -- I’ll go to the library tomorrow 
                        and get all the books on leukemia --
                                 MARY
                             (losing it)
                        Gunner! I’m not getting better! 
                        There’s nothing anyone can do.

                                 AMOS
                        Do you understand, Gunner?

           Gunner’s chest rises and falls with short, panicked breaths.

                                 GUNNER
                        I can help you! I can make you get 
                        better! You can’t die! You can’t!

           Mary rushes over to Gunner, holding him tight. 

                                 MARY
                        I’m sorry, Gunner... I’m sorry...

           Gunner wails into her chest. She rocks him back and forth, 
           the tears streaming from her cheeks into his hair. Amos 
           watches from across the room.

           INT. WILLOW SPUR PUBLIC LIBRARY - DAY

           MISSUS BAKEMEYER (50s, a plump, cheerful woman) carefully 
           files books in the modest library.

           The BELL on the front door RINGS -- Gunner enters with his 
           bike and wagon.

                                 MISSUS BAKEMEYER
                             (to Gunner)
                        I read to Chapter Twelve last 
                        night. Holmes and Watson just 
                        entered the abandoned house. Where 
                        did you leave off?

           Gunner’s WAGON is chock full of books. The librarian sees the 
           Sherlock Holmes book “A STUDY IN SCARLET” on top.

                                 MISSUS BAKEMEYER (CONT’D)
                             (re: “Study in Scarlet”)
                        You finished already? 

                                 GUNNER
                        No, but I need to trade these in 
                        for other books.

                                 MISSUS BAKEMEYER
                        But... what about your research for 
                        Detective Knoxx?
                                 GUNNER
                        I’m doing new research. I need all 
                        the books you have on death. And 
                        cancer. Leukemia, specifically. 

           Missus Bakemeyer blinks at him.

           INT. GUNNER’S ROOM - DAY

           Gunner sits in bed, studying MEDICAL TEXTBOOKS intensely.

           INT. GUNNER'S HOUSE - DAY

           Gunner watches from the corner of the hallway as --

           MEDICAL STAFF enter their house, setting up IVs and other 
           medical equipment inside Mary and Amos's room. 

           Mary is in bed. Amos stands beside her, tense. A NURSE (40s) 
           sticks an IV in Mary’s arm. Gunner shudders and turns away as 
           the needle pierces skin.

           EXT. GUNNER’S HOUSE - DAY

           The nurse is about to get in her car when Gunner approaches, 
           MEDICAL BOOK in hand.

                                 GUNNER
                        The medicine you’re giving my mom 
                        isn’t for treating cancer.

           The nurse turns around --

                                 NURSE
                             (like he’s a toddler)
                        That’s right, sweetie. It's medicine 
                        to make all her pain go away. 

           She slides inside the driver’s seat. Gunner opens the medical 
           book to a dog-eared page --

                                 GUNNER
                        You could give her Methotrexate, 
                        that’s specifically for leukemia. 
                        Or Doxorubicin Hydrochloride, 
                        that’s used for a lot of different 
                        cancers.

                                 NURSE
                        We’re doing everything we can.
           She reaches out to shut the car door --

                                 GUNNER
                        Or Nelarabine. That’s used for 
                        cancer patients who haven’t 
                        responded well to chemotherapy.

           He looks up at the nurse like she’s guilty. 

                                 NURSE
                        I... I'm sorry, sweetheart. 

           The nurse shuts the car door and drives away. Gunner watches 
           her go -- anger, fear, and frustration swirling in his eyes.

           INT. AMOS AND MARY’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Amos enters -- Mary eats soup in bed, propped up by pillows. 
           An IV drips rhythmically beside her.

                                 MARY
                             (re: Gunner)
                        Has he come out?

                                 AMOS
                        No. I set his dinner by the door. 

           Her face wrinkles -- she starts to cry --

                                 MARY
                        I-I don’t know what’s going to 
                        happen to you boys... 

           Amos sits beside her, gently rubbing her neck.

                                 AMOS
                        Don’t worry about us, focus on you 
                        right now.

                                 MARY
                        Amos! That’s all I worry about! 
                        What happens to you boys after I’m 
                        gone, it’s the only thing I have 
                        left to deal with.

           She takes Amos’s hand, squeezing tight.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        It’s no secret you two don’t get 
                        along. But he had me. You had me. 
                        It was going to be okay. But now...

           She closes her eyes. 
                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        I don’t know anymore.

           Amos hangs his head, guilt weighing on his shoulders...

           INT. GUNNER’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Gunner’s bedroom door OPENS -- Amos steps in.

                                 AMOS
                        Gunner?

           He looks around the room, his eyes widening.

                                 AMOS (CONT’D)
                             (under his breath)
                        Jesus...

           Gunner sleeps in bed, surrounded by books. The WALLS are 
           covered with PAGES AND PAGES OF NOTES. The work of someone 
           obsessed.

           Amos closes the door, a tense expression across his face.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - EARLY THE NEXT MORNING

           Amos takes the prized HUNTING RIFLE down from its mantle. 
           Gunner stands nearby, his eyes puffy from exhaustion.

                                 AMOS
                        Life is the most unfair part of 
                        living. Either you can hide under 
                        your bed and cry or face it like a 
                        man.

           He hands Gunner the rifle. Gunner reluctantly takes it.

                                 AMOS (CONT’D)
                        I think you’re ready to face it 
                        like a man.

           Gunner looks more and more miserable by the second.

           EXT. FOREST - MORNING

           Amos and Gunner pad through the forest.

           Something GLINTS in the early morning light, catching 
           Gunner’s eye -- he stops, scanning the forest.
           Everything is still, almost lifeless -- a hazy morning FOG 
           swallows the trees in the distance. 

           Through the haze, there’s MOVEMENT -- something BLACK, 
           seeming to levitate off the ground...

                                 GUNNER
                             (screaming)
                        Dad!

           Gunner sprints for Amos --

                                 AMOS
                             (hushed tone)
                        Keep your voice down.

           He demonstrates how to check that the gun is loaded. 

           Gunner turns around, staring into the woods -- whatever it was 
           that he saw, it’s now GONE.

                                 AMOS (CONT’D)
                        A gun is a dangerous tool. But if you 
                        use it right, it can mean the 
                        difference between death or survival.

           Amos inspects PAW PRINTS in the dirt.

                                 AMOS (CONT’D)
                        Life and death go hand in hand, 
                        Gunner. Something you got to 
                        accept. 

           Amos jams the butt of the gun against Gunner’s shoulder. 
           Gunner winces.

                                 AMOS (CONT’D)
                        Look through the sight here. Close 
                        one eye. Find your target.

           Gunner brings the sight of the gun up to his eyes. He closes 
           one shut, aiming with the other.

                                 AMOS (CONT’D)
                        Finger ‘round the trigger.

                                 GUNNER
                        I don’t want to do this.

                                 AMOS
                        Finger on the trigger.

           Gunner wraps his finger around the trigger.
           GUNNER’S POV: A faded CONVERSE SNEAKER ENTERS THE RIFLE’S 
           SIGHTS.

           Amos shouts in the distance and pulls the gun away.

                                 AMOS (CONT’D)
                        What the hell are you doing?

           Joseph Riley, holding an armful of CANNED FOOD, freezes in 
           the clearing -- his scar even more menacing in the early 
           light.

           Joseph looks at Gunner -- then to the rifle.

                                 AMOS (CONT’D)
                        Hey! I said, what the hell --

           Joseph takes off running, balancing the canned food in his 
           arms.

                                 AMOS (CONT’D) 
                        Crazy kid.

           Gunner watches Joseph disappear between the trees.

           INT. AMOS AND MARY’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Mary is asleep in bed -- the IV drips by her side. More 
           hospital than home. 

           INT. DINING ROOM/LIVING ROOM - SAME

           Amos scrapes CHARRED MEAT off a frying pan, BLACK SMOKE 
           spurting off the burnt food --

                                 AMOS
                        Goddammit. 

           INT. DINING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Gunner and Amos eat CHEERIOS with milk. 

           Amos watches TV from the table -- Gunner reads a book. It’s 
           awkward. It’s unpleasant. They both feel it.

           Gunner pours more cereal in his bowl -- a PRIZE falls out of 
           the box into the milk. He picks it up -- a RED COMPASS.
           INT. GUNNER'S ROOM - NIGHT

           Gunner reads in bed. Amos enters --

                                 AMOS
                        Hey, bud. 

           Gunner looks up as Amos sits down beside him. 

                                 AMOS (CONT’D)
                        Things... aren’t looking good with 
                        Mom...

                                 GUNNER
                        She has type A-L-L leukemia. There’s 
                        a thirty percent survival rate --

                                 AMOS
                        Just... listen to me, okay?

           He takes a deep breath --

                                 AMOS (CONT’D)
                        There’s gonna be changes around 
                        here. I work long hours, sometimes 
                        six days a week. Means you gotta 
                        learn to take care of yourself.  

                                 GUNNER
                        I can help her. 

                                 AMOS
                        If the doctors can’t, no one can. 
                        It’s unfair, but that’s how life 
                        is. You have to become a man sooner 
                        than --

                                 GUNNER
                        You might have given up. But I 
                        haven’t. 

           Gunner returns to his book, dismissing Amos. Amos stares at 
           his son for a moment, then stands up and heads for the door.

           LATER

           Gunner is halfway through the book “TALES OF RESURRECTION” --

                                 GUNNER (V.O.)
                             (from the book)
                        “In Virginia, 1932, a groundskeeper 
                        was patrolling a cemetery late at 
                        night...”
           FLASH INSIDE GUNNER’S IMAGINATION

           An OLD CEMETERY IN VIRGINIA -- the GROUNDSKEEPER (50s, 
           scruffy) wanders along the GRAVESTONES.

                                 GUNNER (V.O.)
                        “He passed by a grave of a man who 
                        was buried not two days before and 
                        heard scratching.”

           The groundskeeper STOPS -- EYES WIDE at the sound of 
           SCRATCHING. He takes a SHOVEL and starts to dig.

           He opens the coffin -- a very much ALIVE MAN gasps for air.

           BACK TO REALITY

           A NOTE is scrawled in the margins -- Gunner squints, bringing 
           the book close to his nose.

           The words come into focus --

           “The Water Man.”

           Gunner gasps, setting the book down. The PAGES flip over, 
           exposing the inside jacket cover. The name “J.M. BUSSEY” is 
           written on the flyleaf. 

           INT. LIBRARY - DAY

           Gunner shows Missus Bakemeyer the book with “J.M. BUSSEY” 
           written on the front jacket cover. 

                                 MISSUS BAKEMEYER
                        That’s Jim Bussey, lives over in 
                        Columbia Falls. Retired mortician, 
                        don’t know what he’s up to now. 

           Gunner considers this, the gears turning in his head.

           EXT. COUNTY ROAD 82 - DAY

           Gunner bikes down the highway. A TRUCK PASSES, kicking DUST 
           up. Gunner perseveres. 

           EXT. OLD VICTORIAN HOUSE - DAY

           Gunner sets his bike beside the gate. He grabs the book from 
           the wagon and goes to the front door. 
           He RINGS THE BELL -- JIM BUSSEY (80s, a reclusive, prickly 
           man) peeks out from behind the screen door --

                                 JIM BUSSEY
                        Can I help you?

                                 GUNNER
                        Is this yours?

           Gunner holds up the “TALES OF RESURRECTION.”

                                 MR. BUSSEY
                        At one point. It’s the county 
                        library’s now. Why exactly are you 
                        here, young man?

                                 GUNNER
                        You have a note in here, about the 
                        Water Man. I... I want to know more 
                        about this.

                                 MR. BUSSEY
                        About what?

                                 GUNNER
                        If it’s possible to stop someone 
                        from dying.

           A long beat.

                                 MR. BUSSEY
                        Who are you?

                                 GUNNER
                        My name’s Gunner. Gunner Boone. 

                                 MR. BUSSEY
                        Seems we share a common interest, 
                        Mister Boone.

           Mr. Bussey opens the screen door --

           INT. MR. BUSSEY’S OFFICE - DAY

           A SKELETON stands in the corner, DIAGRAMS of the human body 
           hang on the walls, SKULLS adorn the shelves.

           The man is obsessed with death.

           Mr. Bussey sits behind his cluttered desk, Gunner facing him 
           on a sunken floral chair.
                                 MR. BUSSEY
                        Death is a strange thing, Gunner 
                        Boone. One instant, you’re alive. 
                        Regenerating cells. Forming 
                        memories. Interacting with the 
                        world around you.  Then, in the 
                        blink of an eye, your heart stops 
                        beating. Your organs, your blood, 
                        it all begins to decay. Cookie?

           Mr. Bussey offers Gunner a PLAIN SUGAR COOKIE from a half-
           empty box. Gunner takes one.

                                 GUNNER
                        But people have come back from the 
                        dead.

                                 MR. BUSSEY
                        I’ve spent my whole life 
                        researching the dead, looking for 
                        an answer. I’ve never come close to 
                        anything real.
                             (chewing a bite of cookie)
                        Except for the Water Man...

           Gunner leans forward.

                                 GUNNER
                        He isn’t just a ghost story? 

                                 MR. BUSSEY
                        The Water Man is real, Gunner. 
                        Name’s Edward Schaal. He was killed 
                        by a flood when the Wild Horse dam 
                        failed...

           Gunner stares at Mr. Bussey, entranced, horrified -- 

           PRELAP: WOOD CRACKING --

           EXT. WILD HORSE FOREST - DAY - FLASHBACK

           As a wooden dam breaks -- water erupts through, rushing fast.

           EXT. WILD HORSE, MONTANA - DAY - FLASHBACK

           A small mountain town in the early 1920s. Quiet and peaceful.

                                 MR. BUSSEY (V.O.)
                        Wild Horse started as a mining 
                        town. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MR. BUSSEY (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        But the only rocks in those 
                        mountains were igneous rock, 
                        obsidian. Worth less than iron.

           EDWARD SCHAAL (mid 20s, a burly, bearded man) sits by a 
           simple cottage, sanding down a piece of OBSIDIAN ROCK into a 
           necklace pendant.

           He pauses, ears pricked by a thunderous noise --

                                 MR. BUSSEY (V.O.)
                        The flood came suddenly. No 
                        warning. No time to escape.

           The ground under Edward trembles. He looks up to see the 
           flooding water careen down the river.

                                 MR. BUSSEY (V.O.)
                        He and the whole town were 
                        swallowed up. 

           Edward jumps to his feet and starts to run --

                                 MR. BUSSEY (V.O.)
                        Some bodies made it downstream. 
                        Others disappeared.

           The water overtakes the town, the log cabin, then Edward 
           himself.

           EXT. WILLOW SPUR, MONTANA - DAY - FLASHBACK

           The SHERIFF (40s) inspects dead, waterlogged bodies -- Edward 
           Schaal among them.

                                 MR. BUSSEY (V.O.)
                        My father was just a boy, right 
                        about your age. Lived in Willow 
                        Spur.

           JOEL (10, Bussey’s father), sneaks up to the gruesome scene. 
           He wanders past the bodies --

                                 MR. BUSSEY (V.O.)
                        All the bodies were officially 
                        declared “deceased.” That is...

           Joel stops in front of Edward Schaal’s body -- 

                                 MR. BUSSEY (V.O.)
                        ... until Edward Schaal woke up.
           Edward’s EYES OPEN -- Joel SCREAMS. The sheriff and other 
           townspeople rush toward Edward, helping him up.

                                 MR. BUSSEY (V.O.)
                        But his wife... eight months 
                        pregnant... she never turned up.

           EXT. LAKE - DAY - FLASHBACK

           Edward, remarkably hallow, stares across a LAKE. 

                                 MR. BUSSEY (V.O.)
                        Edward returned to Wild Horse, but 
                        the whole town was underwater. 

           VIEW FROM UNDERWATER

           Edward dives in the lake to the submerged town below. 

                                 MR. BUSSEY (V.O.)
                        Found his wife’s body still in 
                        their house.

           EDWARD’S WIFE (20s) hovers in their underwater cottage. He 
           SCREAMS in agony, bubbles erupting from his mouth.

           INT. MR. BUSSEY’S OFFICE - DAY - BACK TO THE PRESENT

           Gunner is on the edge of his seat.

                                 MR. BUSSEY 
                        Last anyone heard, he was living 
                        out there, alone in the woods.

           Mr. Bussey strenuously pushes himself up and goes over to a 
           cabinet. He sifts through papers --

                                 MR. BUSSEY (CONT’D)
                        I’ve heard the rumors that he’s 
                        still alive. Tried to go to Wild 
                        Horse myself, but there’s no clear 
                        trail in. Got spooked being in that 
                        forest after just two days. 

           Mr. Bussey pulls out a folded PIECE OF PAPER -- he hands it 
           to Gunner. Gunner opens --

           It’s a PHOTOCOPIED MAP, dated 1920. WILD HORSE is circled.
                                 MR. BUSSEY (CONT’D)
                        You can keep it. Wild Horse won’t 
                        appear on any other map.

           Gunner’s eyes dance across the map.

           INT. GUNNER’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Gunner is in bed, studying Mr. Bussey’s old map. He fiddles 
           with the RED COMPASS CEREAL PRIZE in his hand. He puts the 
           map and compass aside and turns OFF his bedside lamp.

           LATER THAT NIGHT

           Gunner stirs awake -- something CREAKS under his bed.

           Gunner bolts up, pushing himself against the corner. From the 
           shadows, a GNARLED HAND reaches up --

           Gunner SHRIEKS then leaps out of bed, scrambling from his 
           room before the clawed hand can get him.

           INT. GUNNER’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Gunner dashes out of his room --

                                 GUNNER
                        Mom!

           EXT. AMOS AND MARY’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Mary’s side of the bed is EMPTY. The IV hangs limply. Amos is 
           asleep, snoring gently.

           Gunner peers in. The door to his parents’ bathroom is open.

           Gunner can barely make out a figure standing up in the 
           bathroom, looking in the mirror.

           INT. PARENTS’ BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Gunner gently pushes the bathroom door open --

           A bald, thin FIGURE is in front of the mirror. It’s spindly 
           fingers hold a clump of HUMAN HAIR. 

           Its fingers grow claws at an unbelievable rate.
           Spidery blue veins appear over the monster’s skull, pulsing, 
           growing larger --

           THE WATER MAN!

           Gunner SCREAMS. 

           The figure turns --

           It’s MARY -- in her underwear and sickly thin. She drops her 
           WIG, swings her BATHROBE around herself, and runs over to 
           him.

                                 MARY
                        Gunner, baby, what’s wrong --

           Gunner drops to the ground, screaming bloody murder.

           Amos rushes in from the bedroom -- 

                                 AMOS
                        What is it? What happened?

                                 MARY
                        He saw me... I-I think I scared 
                        him...

           Amos kneels down and grabs Gunner’s shoulders --

                                 AMOS
                        Stop screaming! You’re upsetting 
                        your mother!

           Mary cowers in the bedroom door frame, ashamed. Gunner keeps 
           screaming.

                                 AMOS (CONT’D)
                        I SAID STOP!

           Amos pulls his hand back and SLAPS GUNNER ACROSS THE FACE.

           The stinging pain silences Gunner. He blinks through the 
           tears and looks up at his father.

           Amos’s face is full of horror, like he’s party to a gruesome 
           crime.

                                 AMOS (CONT’D)
                        I... just wanted you to be quiet...  

           And then Gunner sees it - his father is terrified. 

                                 MARY
                        What have you done, Amos...
           Mary rushes over to Gunner, examining his quickly swelling 
           cheek. Gunner’s eyes never leave his father’s.

           INT. GUNNER’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Gunner is in bed but his eyes are wide open. His parents’ 
           MUFFLED VOICES come through the door --

                                 AMOS (O.S.)
                        I’m sorry, Mary... I wasn’t 
                        thinking, I just reacted...

           Their conversation tapers off. Silence descends. 

           TIME SPEEDS UP -- the hours pass like seconds. Gunner lays in 
           bed, unmoving. Soon, it’s --

           EARLY MORNING

           Gunner pushes himself up to gaze outside the window. The 
           horizon is tinged with light. 

           He grabs the compass and map.

           INT. AMOS AND MARY’S ROOM - MORNING

           The door opens -- a SLIVER OF LIGHT cuts across the bed. 

           Gunner goes to Amos’s bedside table -- opens the drawer -- 
           extracts his father’s WALLET. Takes all the cash inside -- 
           FIVE TWENTIES. 

           Gunner pads over to Mary’s side -- he stares at his mother 
           for a moment, then sets a NOTE down on the bedside table.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Gunner carefully takes the hunting rifle down. 

           He knocks over a PICTURE FRAME on the mantle -- he spins 
           toward his parents’ bedroom nervously.

           But all is quiet. He bolts from the house.

           EXT. WILLOW SPUR MAIN STREET - MORNING

           Gunner -- a dark BRUISE across his cheek -- bikes through the 
           sleepy town. His wagon totes a LARGE PACK, the FAMILY RIFLE, 
           and various SUPPLIES. 
           The COMPASS hangs around his neck. 

           EXT. EDGE OF THE FOREST - MORNING

           Gunner parks his bike the side of the road, facing something 
           with grim determination --

           Joseph’s RAGTAG FORT.

           Gunner sits down in front of the fort, waiting patiently.

           INT. GUNNER’S HOUSE - AMOS AND MARY’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Amos wakes up groggily.

           INT. KITCHEN - DAY

           Amos pops bread in the toaster, suited up for work. He turns 
           his gaze to the living room -- his eyes narrow --

           The RIFLE IS MISSING from its usual mantle.

           INT. GUNNER’S ROOM - DAY

           The door swings open -- Amos steps in.

                                 AMOS
                        Gunner?

           There’s only an EMPTY BED to greet him.

           INT. BEDROOM - DAY

           Amos runs back into his room -- spots a FOLDED NOTE on Mary’s 
           bedside table. 

           Amos opens it -- “I know how to make you better. I hope you 
           won’t get mad. Love, Gunner.”

           Mary stirs -- Amos quickly pockets the note.

           INT. GUNNER’S HOUSE - DAY

           The PHONE CORD snakes from its hook to the hallway, where 
           Amos talks quietly on the phone --
                                 AMOS
                             (into the phone)
                        Jim? Yeah, it’s Amos... I know, 
                        first day in seven years I’ve been 
                        late... listen, I need today off...

           He glances into his bedroom -- Mary is still asleep.

           EXT. JOSEPH’S FORT - DAY

           Gunner has his map splayed across his lap, studying it 
           intently. 

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        You steal that gun from your dad?

           Gunner’s head snaps up. Joseph Riley stares at him from the 
           fort’s curtained entrance -- his cheeks are sallow and gaunt, 
           his clothes a size too big.

                                 GUNNER
                        I, I have a question about the 
                        Water Man...

           A hint of a smirk spreads across Joseph’s face.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Cost ya a dollar.

           Gunner digs the twenties out of his pocket. Joseph’s eyes 
           widen -- that’s a FORTUNE.

                                 GUNNER
                             (holding out a single 
                              bill)
                        Got any change?

                                 JOSEPH
                        We’ll figure something out. 

           He pushes the curtain back further, inviting Gunner inside --

           INT. JOSEPH’S FORT - MORNING

           Gunner and Joseph face each other on faded lawn chairs. The 
           fort is cluttered with clothes, cigarettes, playing cards 
           with sexy women on the back. Empty CANS OF FOOD are stacked 
           in tower in a corner. 

                                 GUNNER
                        Whoa... do you live here?
                                 JOSEPH
                        For now. So, the money?

           Gunner holds out a twenty note -- as Joseph reaches for it, 
           Gunner pulls back.

                                 GUNNER
                        I need change to buy supplies, 
                        though.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Supplies?

                                 GUNNER
                        Why I need to know your Water Man 
                        story. I’m going to find him.

           Joseph’s expression turns dark -- he leans close to Gunner -- 
           SHADOWS from the wooden slats backlit by the sun ripple 
           across his face -- highlighting the SCAR ALONG HIS CHEEK.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Ever been alone in these woods, 
                        kid?

                                 GUNNER
                        No.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Ever seen anything supernatural?

                                 GUNNER
                        No...

                                 JOSEPH
                             (standing up and pacing)
                        Let’s say you survive the woods, 
                        make it all the way past the river, 
                        the cliffs... the wolves...

           Gunner’s grip on his pack tightens.

                                 JOSEPH (CONT’D)
                        You’ll find yourself face-to-face 
                        with the devil himself. Look in his 
                        eyes’n you’ll go crazy. Keep your 
                        eyes closed...

           He turns his cheek, indicating his SCAR --

                                 JOSEPH (CONT’D)
                        Not many of us around to tell that 
                        side of the story.
           Gunner considers -- weighing the threat of danger against his 
           goal...

                                 GUNNER
                        I’m paying you a dollar. That means 
                        you owe me.
                             (fearlessly)
                        What do you know about the Water 
                        Man?

                                 JOSEPH
                        I’ll do you one better. Give me all 
                        the money you got and I’ll take you 
                        to him myself.

                                 GUNNER
                        Seriously?

                                 JOSEPH
                        I know where he is. If I guide you, 
                        you won’t get lost.

                                 GUNNER
                        But I have to buy supplies.

           Joseph grabs a CIGARETTE from a half-empty pack and lights up.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Sure, sure, we’ll buy supplies. 
                        Then I keep the rest, my fee for 
                        leadin’ you. Fair warning, kid...
                             (exhales a cloud of smoke)
                        Woods’ll scare the shit outta you. 
                        I keep the money even if you back 
                        out.

           Joseph extends his hand to shake on it. 

           Gunner looks in Joseph’s eyes -- then to his hand, 
           considering. 

           He reaches forward and shakes.

           INT. AMOS’S TRUCK - MOVING - DAY

           Amos drives around town, scanning the streets for his son.

           EXT. MAIN STREET - DAY

           Amos’s truck rumbles past the general store.

           As he turns down another street --
           GUNNER AND JOSEPH 

           approach the general store from the woods behind. Gunner 
           pushes his bike by his side, the RIFLE sticking out of his 
           pack.

           INT. GENERAL STORE - DAY

           Gunner and Joseph enter --

           CHUCK (50s), the stringy, sun-weathered general store owner, 
           watches a BASEBALL GAME on a mini TV at the front counter. He 
           barely looks up as the kids enter.

                                 GUNNER
                             (handing Joseph a list)
                        Here’s everything we need, but for 
                        two of us we’ll need double. 

                                 JOSEPH
                        Jesus, you planning on being out 
                        there for a month? Only need half 
                        this shit.

           Joseph takes items off the shelf, placing them in Gunner’s 
           arms.

           Gunner spots a number of HEADLAMPS on a shelf --

                                 GUNNER
                        These, too.

           Joseph shrugs and grabs the two headlamps off their hook.

           The boys set their wares on the front counter. Chuck 
           reluctantly looks away from the game and tallies up the 
           supplies. 

           As Gunner hands him the money, Chuck nods over Gunner’s 
           shoulder --

                                 CHUCK
                        That what I think it is?

                                 GUNNER
                        What?

           Gunner cranes his neck -- the RIFLE pokes out above his 
           shoulders. He turns around -- face reddening.

                                 CHUCK
                        I know that ain’t your gun. 
                                 JOSEPH
                        It’s mine. I mean... my father’s. 
                        We’re meeting up with him now. 

           Chuck looks at the bounty of supplies on the counter.

                                 CHUCK
                        Any reason I should be concerned 
                        ‘bout you boys?

           Chucks seems to loom over them -- Gunner gulps, unsure of 
           what to do -- he’s frozen with fear...

                                 JOSEPH
                             (menacing)
                        We’re fine, man.  

           Joseph elbows Gunner -- they gather the supplies and head out 
           of the store.

           Chuck shakes his head and returns to the game.

           EXT. EDGE OF THE WILD HORSE FOREST - DAY

           Joseph and Gunner step off the dirt road and toward the 
           forest. Gunner pushes his bike/wagon.

                                 JOSEPH
                             (re: bike/wagon)
                        Can’t take that in there. 

                                 GUNNER
                        How’re we going to carry all the 
                        supplies?

           Joseph slings his own BACKPACK around --

                                 JOSEPH
                        Load up.

           The boys take everything from the wagon and stuff it inside 
           their backpacks. 

           Gunner nestles the bike inside a dense bush, hiding it from 
           view. They walk inside the woods, ignoring a SIGN --

           “FOREST FIRE DANGER TODAY: HIGH.”

           EXT. WILD HORSE WOODS - LATER

           The boys weave between stout pine trees, the sun now high in 
           the sky. It’s quiet. Serene.
           Joseph, in the lead, stops and turns to face Gunner, holding 
           his hand out --

                                 JOSEPH
                        Okay, so where’s my money?

           Gunner reaches into his pocket and pulls out two twenties, 
           handing them to Joseph.

                                 JOSEPH (CONT’D)
                        You owe me another thirty-five.

                                 GUNNER
                        The rest after we find the Water 
                        Man.

           Joseph shakes his head, pocketing the bills. They resume 
           their trek.

                                 GUNNER (CONT’D)
                        You wanna check my map?

                                 JOSEPH
                        That’s what amateurs do, kid. 
                        You’re with somebody who knows 
                        where the Water Man is. Without me, 
                        you’ll never find him or your way 
                        out.

           Joseph glances over his shoulder at Gunner -- Gunner’s eyes 
           are on the ground, navigating the tangled forest floor 
           cautiously.

           EXT. SHERIFF’S OFFICE - DAY

           Amos pulls his truck into the parking lot.

           INT. SHERIFF’S OFFICE - DAY

           SHERIFF ROGER GOODWIN (50s, a good ol’ boy) and his deputy, 
           STEPHANIE GRAY (early 30s, eager and optimistic), face Amos.

                                 SHERIFF GOODWIN
                        What’s your boy’s name, Mr. Boone?

                                 AMOS
                             (tense)
                        Gunner Boone.

                                 SHERIFF GOODWIN
                        Age?
                                 AMOS
                        Ten. He, he took my rifle, too. 

           Deputy Gray has a PAD OF PAPER and a PEN, scribbling notes.

                                 SHERIFF GOODWIN
                        Your rifle? He know how to use it?

                                 AMOS
                        Not really. Took him hunting for 
                        the first time a couple days ago.

                                 SHERIFF GOODWIN
                        Did he take anything else?

                                 AMOS
                        Some cash out of my wallet.

                                 SHERIFF GOODWIN
                        Sounds like a run-away. Any reason 
                        you know of why he’d run?

           Amos freezes -- a guilty look crossing his face --

                                 SHERIFF GOODWIN (CONT’D)
                        Mr. Boone?

                                 AMOS
                             (recovering)
                        No, no reason. 

                                 SHERIFF GOODWIN
                        This happens with kids. Most of the 
                        time, they run to someone else’s 
                        house. Usually back home by dinner,  
                        too spooked to be out alone after 
                        dark. Any family in the area?

                                 AMOS
                        No, no one close.

                                 SHERIFF GOODWIN
                        Any friends he may have gone to?

           Amos shakes his head.

                                 SHERIFF GOODWIN (CONT’D)
                        Any... anywhere you think he 
                        could’ve gone... teacher’s house 
                        maybe, or a coach?

                                 AMOS
                        I, uh, I’m not sure. 
           The sheriff leans forward. 

                                 SHERIFF GOODWIN
                        Can’t think of anyone in this whole 
                        town he may have gone to?

                                 AMOS
                        I don’t know.

           For Amos, it’s a sad realization.

                                 SHERIFF GOODWIN
                        Well, keep us updated. And bring in 
                        a recent photograph of Gunner. 
                        Chances are he’ll be back by 
                        tonight, sleeping with the lights 
                        on.

           Amos nods, forlorn.

           EXT. WILD HORSE FOREST - DAY

           Gunner and Joseph gnaw on BEEF JERKY as they hike. Joseph 
           tosses the wrapper out onto the ground. Gunner stuffs his 
           wrapper inside his pack.

                                 GUNNER
                        What’s he like?

           Joseph jumps on a fallen log, walking precariously across it.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Who, the Water Man?

           Gunner nods, staring up at Joseph.

                                 JOSEPH (CONT’D)
                        You know what mountain lions do 
                        when they hunt? Stalk their prey. 
                        Follow whatever animal around til 
                        it’s worn out, then, once it’s at 
                        its weakest, they attack.

           Joseph swipes his hands like claws. 

                                 JOSEPH (CONT’D)
                        Same with the Water Man. He’ll 
                        drive you in circles ‘round the 
                        forest, til you think you’re going 
                        crazy -- then BAM!

           Joseph jumps down from the log in front of Gunner.
                                 JOSEPH (CONT’D)
                        You’ll be too tired to even scream.

                                 GUNNER
                        I heard he’s a real person. Name’s 
                        Edward Schaal.

                                 JOSEPH
                             (defensive)
                        You heard this from someone who 
                        actually saw him?

           Gunner shakes his head, “no.” Satisfied, Joseph continues 
           with his story, using his hands to add extra theatrics --

                                 JOSEPH (CONT’D)
                        People can say whatever they want. 
                        But ‘til you’ve seen him up close 
                        and he’s comin’ after you, you’re 
                        no expert.

                                 GUNNER
                        How’d you escape?

                                 JOSEPH
                        The Water Man didn’t realize I know 
                        this forest better’n even him.

           Joseph picks up the pace. Gunner follows behind, looking 
           after Joseph in awe.

           SERIES OF SHOTS

           Gunner and Joseph trek through the woods under canopies of 
           white-trunked aspens -- lush meadows speckled with yellow 
           wildflowers -- they’re boys on a mission.

           LATER

           Joseph holds his arm out, halting Gunner. He puts his finger 
           to his lips.

           Joseph points in the distance --

           Two HIKERS (20s) pack up their tent into large backpacks, 
           their conversation just out of earshot.

                                 JOSEPH
                             (whispering)
                        We gotta go around, can’t risk 
                        trouble.
           Gunner nods -- the boys give the hikers a wide berth as they 
           continue on their journey.

           LATER

           Joseph has his shirt off and wrapped around his head like a 
           tribal warrior.

           Gunner has a piece of straw in his mouth, taking in the open 
           woods.

           A sense of hope permeates the air.

           EXT. WILD HORSE FOREST - DUSK

           MOSS carpets the ground. The trees seem bigger, thicker -- 
           the waning light gives them an eerie BLUE TINGE. 

           Gunner, now somberly nervous, pulls a JACKET from his 
           backpack and puts it on. Up ahead, Joseph inspects the area.

                                 GUNNER
                        What is it?

                                 JOSEPH
                        We should set up camp.

                                 GUNNER
                             (suddenly embarrassed)
                        Oh...

           Joseph looks at Gunner -- “what?”

                                 GUNNER (CONT’D)
                        I didn’t bring a tent.

                                 JOSEPH
                             (scoffing)
                        First rule of camping is that you 
                        sleep outside.

           Joseph plops down where he’s standing.

                                 JOSEPH (CONT’D)
                        See? A perfect place to sleep.

           Gunner sits down next to him, wiggling out of his pack.

                                 GUNNER
                        Can you make a fire?
                                 JOSEPH
                        Second rule of camping is know how 
                        to make a fire.

           Joseph pulls a LIGHTER out of his pocket.

                                 JOSEPH (CONT’D)
                        Rule number three: whoever makes 
                        the fire doesn’t have to get 
                        firewood.
                             (pointing at Gunner)
                        That means you, kid.

                                 GUNNER
                        Really? You’re not going to help 
                        me?

                                 JOSEPH
                        You think the Water Man is gonna 
                        care if your feet hurt when he’s 
                        trying to eat you for a snack?

           Gunner sighs -- Joseph wins. This time.

                                 GUNNER
                        This fire better be big.

           As Gunner rises, he looks around the dark, isolated forest. 
           Danger seems to lurk in every shadow.

           Gunner gulps hard and grabs the rifle from his pack, holding 
           it close. He ventures off in the dark forest, scanning the 
           ground for suitable logs. 

           Joseph watches him go, a subtle smirk forming on his lips.

           EXT. GUNNER’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Amos’s truck rumbles into the driveway. 

           INT. GUNNER’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Amos quickly enters --

                                 AMOS
                        Gunner?

           The room is vacant.

           Amos sits on the floor, sifting through the mess of papers 
           and books, searching for any clues.
           He spots a SHOEBOX under the bed -- Amos pulls it out. 

           He opens, finding SKETCHES of Detective Knoxx and other 
           characters. Amos looks through the drawings, surprised and 
           impressed. 

           A BOY’S SCREAM rings out from the window. Amos jumps to his 
           feet and hurries out of the room --

           EXT. GUNNER’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Amos steps onto the front porch as two BOYS (12) barrel down 
           the street on their bikes, laughing hard.

                                 AMOS
                        Hey!

           The boys brake hard and stop, facing Amos.

                                 AMOS (CONT’D)
                        You know a kid named Gunner Boone?

           One of the boys shakes his head. The other boy considers --

                                 BOY #1
                        Is he that kid in fifth grade? 
                        Kinda quiet?

                                 AMOS
                        Yeah.

                                 BOY #1
                        I know who he is. Haven’t seen him 
                        around though.

                                 BOY #2
                        Maybe The Water Man got him.

           They laugh and continue biking. Amos glances around the 
           street, but there’s not another soul in sight.

           EXT. WILD HORSE FOREST - NIGHT

           The forest is a collage of silhouettes and shadows. 

           Gunner’s pile of FIREWOOD is big -- Joseph kneels by a 
           makeshift campfire ring, holding the LIGHTER under a pile of 
           KINDLING. The kindling catches -- the wood burns.

           Gunner shivers. He holds his hands out to the fire. 

           Joseph focuses his dark eyes on Gunner --
                                 JOSEPH
                        That’s your dad’s gun, right? He 
                        just let you take it?

           Gunner pauses -- thinking of an excuse. He pauses too long. 

                                 JOSEPH (CONT’D)
                        You did run away!

                                 GUNNER
                        Did not. I left a note.

                                 JOSEPH
                             (laughing)
                        You left “a note.” Cute.

           Gunner stares at the fire, cheeks flushing red.

                                 JOSEPH (CONT’D)
                        Don’t you think your dad’s gonna 
                        come after you?

                                 GUNNER
                        My dad? No. He doesn’t care. He’s 
                        probably happy I’m not home 
                        anymore. One more thing off his 
                        plate.

           He pokes the fire with a stick.

           Joseph looks at Gunner -- small, innocent -- alone.

                                 GUNNER (CONT’D)
                             (looking up to Joseph)
                        What about your dad?

                                 JOSEPH
                        My dad?

           Joseph fiddles with his sneaker lace.

                                 JOSEPH (CONT’D)
                        Well, he, uh...

                                 GUNNER
                        You don’t have to talk about it. If 
                        you don’t want.

           SOMETHING HOWLS in the distance. Gunner pulls his knees close 
           to his chest. Joseph concentrates hard, ears pricked.

                                 GUNNER (CONT’D)
                        Is that --
                                 JOSEPH
                        That’s a wolf, alright. You got 
                        your gun loaded?

           Gunner struggles to open the barrel. When he finally gets it 
           open, he checks -- a couple ROUNDS are tucked inside. 

                                 GUNNER
                        Yeah. 

                                 JOSEPH
                        We’ll take turns keeping watch. You 
                        see anything move, don’t think -- 
                        shoot. You only got a few seconds 
                        ‘fore a wolf tears your face off. 

           Gunner gulps hard.

                                 JOSEPH (CONT’D)
                        You take first watch.

           Joseph snuggles close to the campfire, nuzzling his arm under 
           his head like a pillow. 

           Gunner looks around the forest --

           The darkness is suffocating. The once-quiet forest seems 
           ALIVE WITH NOISES -- scratching, scuffling, chirping, 
           howling, twisting, ripping. 

           Gunner claws for his backpack, pulling out the HEADLAMP. He 
           secures it to his head, then hugs the rifle.

           INT. GUNNER’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Amos prepares Mary’s MEDICINE in the kitchen. 

           INT. AMOS AND MARY’S ROOM - LATER

           Amos hands Mary a few pills with a glass of water -- she takes 
           her medicine, then lies back down.

                                 MARY
                             (woozy)
                        Thanks, Amos...

           Amos lovingly strokes her head, a SCARF replacing the wig.

                                 AMOS
                        How you feeling, baby?
                                 MARY
                        Is Gunner okay?

           Amos stiffens, fear eclipsing his face -- 

                                 AMOS
                        He, uh...

                                 MARY
                             (noticing his fear)
                        What, what is it?

           She tries to push herself up. 

                                 AMOS
                        No, Mary, it’s fine. He’s fine. 

                                 MARY
                             (worried)
                        Where is he? What happened?

                                 AMOS
                        Nothing. We talked things over. 
                        He’s asleep now.

           Mary stares at him, unsure.

                                 MARY
                        Should I check on him?

                                 AMOS
                        You need rest. 

           She nods, settling onto her pillow.

                                 MARY
                        I’ll check on him in the morning.   
                             (squeezing his hand)
                        I’m glad you two made up.

           Amos’s eyes fall to a FRAMED PICTURE of Gunner on her bedside 
           table -- younger but no less melancholic. 

           EXT. FOREST - NIGHT

           The campfire is reduced to smoldering embers. 

           Joseph snores softly beside it. Gunner is awake, drawing in 
           his notebook, illuminated by the headlamp.

                                 GUNNER (V.O.)
                        “Detective Knoxx saw the mangled 
                        corpse...”
                                 (MORE)
                                 GUNNER (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                             (erasing)
                        “Detective Knoxx saw the chalk 
                        outline...”
                             (erasing again)
                        “What Detective Knoxx saw made his 
                        ghostly jaw drop --”

           A TWIG SNAPS -- Gunner’s head shoots up.

           He scans the dark forest -- immense yet claustrophobic at the 
           same time.

           Something REFLECTS the headlamp’s light -- two little ORBS 
           glow in the dark.

           Gunner’s breath stops short... his eyes bulge...

           He shines the light back to where the two orbs were.

           There they are AGAIN -- the only other light in the entire 
           forest. 

           Gunner stares at them... his heart racing...

           The orbs BLINK -- they’re EYES!

           Gunner drops the drawing pad and stands.

           He gropes for the gun, then pulls the hammer back, locked and 
           loaded.

           He takes a few tentative steps forward. The eyes stare at 
           him. 

           EXT. DEEPER IN THE FOREST - NIGHT

           Gunner slowly inches forward, his campground swallowed in 
           darkness behind him... 

                                 GUNNER
                        Hello?

           The EYES TURN -- and DISAPPEAR.

           Gunner halts, terror-stricken.

           He tilts his head up -- shining the light deep into the 
           forest -- the eyes SHIMMER and turn the other way...

           They’re not eyes. Gunner exhales and steps forward, 
           illuminating --

           TWO ORNAMENTS hang from a tree.
           Gunner inspects them -- twine wrapped around OBSIDIAN ROCKS -- 
           the “eyes” reflecting his light.

           A CARVING is etched onto the two tree trunks -- two squiggly 
           lines that faintly resemble a river.

           Gunner reaches out and touches one of the necklaces.

           SOMETHING MOVES behind him --

           Gunner spins around -- the headlamp light REVEALS --

           A GHOSTLY FACE

           White-washed and ethereal.

           Gunner SCREAMS -- he reflexively PULLS THE TRIGGER.

           BOOM!

           The rifle goes off. 

                                 JOSEPH (O.S.)
                        What the hell?!

           Gunner reaches for his headlamp, aiming it toward the voice -- 
           Joseph on the ground, ducking for cover.

                                 JOSEPH (CONT’D)
                        What the hell is wrong with you, 
                        man?!

                                 GUNNER
                        I thought I saw a ghost...

                                 JOSEPH
                        You’re crazy, you know that?!

           Joseph shakes his head, pushing himself to his feet.

                                 JOSEPH (CONT’D)
                        Last time I ever check on you. 

           Gunner also rises. Joseph storms back for the campsite, 
           Gunner hurrying to keep up.

                                 GUNNER
                        I’m sorry, Joseph, you scared me --

                                 JOSEPH
                        You want to survive these woods? 
                        Rule number four: don’t shoot your 
                        guide.
           Gunner trails sheepishly behind. He turns around, taking one 
           more look at the strange ornaments behind him.

           The orbs stare back at him in the dark.

           INT. GUNNER’S HOUSE - AMOS AND MARY’S ROOM - MORNING

           Amos grabs the FRAMED PHOTOGRAPH of Gunner on Mary’s bedside 
           table. 

           He leaves a NOTE: “Took G to library -- A.”

           EXT. SHERIFF’S OFFICE - MORNING

           As Sheriff Goodwin approaches the office, he spots Amos 
           already there, waiting beside the front door.

           INT. SHERIFF GOODWIN’S DESK - MORNING

           Sheriff Goodwin and Amos take seats at the sheriff’s desk as 
           the DESK OFFICER (40s) opens up the office and turns on the 
           lights.

                                 SHERIFF GOODWIN
                        No sign yet?

                                 AMOS
                        He didn’t come home last night. And 
                        I asked a few kids around town, no 
                        one’s seen him. 

                                 SHERIFF GOODWIN
                        You got a recent photo?

           Amos hands the sheriff the framed photograph of Gunner.

                                 SHERIFF GOODWIN (CONT’D)
                        We’ll distribute posters around, 
                        start askin’ if anyone’s seen him. 
                        Anything else you can tell us?

           Amos shakes his head, crestfallen.

           EXT. FOREST - MORNING

           Joseph blinks awake and pushes himself up. He spots Gunner’s 
           quivering shoulder just behind a tree trunk. 

           Gunner clutches the gun, WHIMPERING. TEARS run down his 
           cheeks. Joseph comes around the tree to face him.
                                 JOSEPH
                        Hey, man, you okay?

           Gunner, ashamed, wipes his nose.

                                 GUNNER
                        I... I can’t do this. I thought I 
                        could, but I can’t. 

           His head falls against the crook of his arm.

                                 GUNNER (CONT’D)
                        I wanna go home.

           Joseph watches Gunner cry, an awkward, pitiful expression on 
           his face. 

           Then, suddenly, Joseph freezes, ears pricked, intensely 
           listening...

                                 JOSEPH
                        You hear that?

           Gunner sniffles.

                                 GUNNER
                        No, what?

                                 JOSEPH
                        RUN!

           Joseph stands up, running for a tree. 

           Gunner jumps to his feet, panicking.

                                 GUNNER
                        What? Why!

           Joseph starts climbing the tree as he responds --

                                 JOSEPH
                        Wolves!

           Joseph disappears between the branches.

                                 GUNNER
                        Joseph, wait!

           Gunner is totally and utterly alone. He spins around 
           frantically -- the shadows of the forest seem like snarling, 
           feral wolves. 

                                 GUNNER (CONT’D)
                        Help me!
           A BRANCH SNAPS in the woods -- Gunner freezes.

           “AWOOO” -- the HOWL of a WOLF echoes through the forest. And 
           it’s close. 

                                 GUNNER (CONT’D)
                             (cracking with fear)
                        Joseph... 

           “AWOOOOO!” It’s getting louder.

           Gunner runs to the tree Joseph climbed and grabs the first 
           branch he can. He struggles to pull himself up.

           “AWOOOOOOOOOO!”

           He SCREAMS and scrambles up the tree.

           EXT. TOP OF TREE - DAY

           TEARS streak Gunner’s face as he ascends the branches --

           His left hand grabs a dying branch -- he puts his weight on 
           it -- the branch SNAPS.

           He dangles by one hand -- seconds away from falling --

                                 GUNNER
                             (screaming)
                        AHHH! Help, Joseph!

           Gunner catches his balance, grabbing another branch -- he’s 
           made it, for now.

           He spots Joseph’s worn CONVERSE SNEAKER through the leaves. 

                                 GUNNER (CONT’D)
                        Joseph! Help!

           “AWWWOOOOOOO!” 

           The wolf’s howl is close... too close. It’s like it’s in the 
           tree... 

           Joseph sticks his head through a branch, grinning at Gunner. 

                                 JOSEPH
                             (cupping his hands over 
                              his mouth)
                        AWOOOOOOOO!

           Gunner glares through tear-streaked eyes.
                                 GUNNER
                        I almost fell! I could’ve died!

                                 JOSEPH
                        Okay, but you didn’t! Look, you 
                        wanna find the Water Man, you can’t 
                        be a sissy about anythin’ -- 

                                 GUNNER
                        The deal’s off! You can’t come with 
                        me anymore. 

           Gunner starts to descend, sniffling. Joseph’s grin 
           disappears, replaced with concern --

                                 JOSEPH
                        Hey, hey, hey! Hold on! I also came 
                        up here to scout where the Water 
                        Man is. Wanna see where we’re 
                        going?

           Gunner pauses -- can Joseph be trusted?

                                 JOSEPH (CONT’D)
                        No bullshit. Come on.

           He extends his hand. 

           Gunner climbs back up, pushing Joseph’s hand out of the way. 

           Gunner tops out by Joseph -- a completely unobstructed view 
           of the entire forest before them.

           Green trees blanket rolling hills -- blue MOUNTAINS form a 
           spinal column along the horizon -- a RIVER BED cuts a path 
           through the trees.

                                 JOSEPH (CONT’D)
                             (pointing)
                        See there?

           Gunner squints his eyes -- BLACK SMOKE rises from a distant 
           hill. 

                                 JOSEPH (CONT’D)
                        The Water Man’s hut.

           Gunner takes it in -- physical evidence of The Water Man -- a 
           long hike yet visibly close -- attainable. 

                                 GUNNER
                        That’s... that’s really The Water 
                        Man? He’s there? Alive?
                                 JOSEPH
                        Yep, and hungry as ever. 

           Gunner nods -- the fierceness of a warrior in his eyes. 

                                 GUNNER
                        We’re wasting daylight. Come on, 
                        let’s go.

           EXT. FOREST - DAY

           Gunner and Joseph hike through the thick forest, deep in 
           debate --

                                 JOSEPH
                        C’mon, man. Everybody curses.

                                 GUNNER
                        Not me. 

                                 JOSEPH
                        Never in your life?

                                 GUNNER
                        Cursing is for lowlifes and dirt 
                        bags.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Who told you that, your mommy?

           Gunner spins around. 

                                 GUNNER
                        Don’t talk about my mom. Ever.

                                 JOSEPH
                        I won’t. If you curse.

           Gunner scowls at him. He turns around and continues walking.

                                 JOSEPH (CONT’D)
                             (pretending to be a mom)
                        “Don’t you ever, ever curse, Gunner 
                        boo-boo --”

           Gunner whips around and PUSHES Joseph.

                                 GUNNER
                        Shut up!

                                 JOSEPH
                        Make me, shithead!
           Joseph pushes back. 

                                 JOSEPH (CONT’D)
                        Mommy’s not here to save you!

                                 GUNNER
                        I said SHUT UP!

           Gunner tackles Joseph -- they wrestle on the ground. 

           Joseph, bigger, older, and stronger than Gunner, pins him 
           down in a headlock.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Say “shit!” Say it!

                                 GUNNER
                        Get offa me!

                                 JOSEPH
                             (squeezing harder)
                        SAY IT!

                                 GUNNER
                        SHIT! Get off me! Get off!

           Joseph lets go -- Gunner, red-faced, pops back on his feet, 
           backing away from Joseph. 

           Gunner seethes while a grin spreads across Joseph’s face.

                                 GUNNER (CONT’D)
                        Don’t you ever, EVER, talk about my 
                        mom.

           Joseph stands up, proud of his pupil. He extends his hand.

                                 JOSEPH
                        You got yourself a deal, bitch.

           Gunner looks at Joseph’s hand --

                                 GUNNER
                        Okay, asshole.

           They shake. Joseph pulls him up, and the boys keep walking. 
           The roar of RUSHING WATER sounds in the distance.

                                 GUNNER (CONT’D)
                        Whoa!

           He starts to run --
                                 GUNNER (CONT’D)
                        You hear that?!

                                 JOSEPH
                        What? What is it?

           Joseph chases after him -- 

           Gunner leads -- they jump over fallen logs -- scramble over a 
           pile of rocks -- weave through thorny shrubs.

           Finally, they come across a RIVER -- it churns fast, white 
           rapids foaming above rocky crags.

                                 JOSEPH (CONT’D)
                        You’re freaking out over a river?

                                 GUNNER
                        Look!

           He points -- the WOODEN REMAINS OF AN ANCIENT DAM lay just a 
           stone’s throw upstream.

                                 GUNNER (CONT’D)
                        A broken dam! That’s how the Water 
                        Man almost died! We have to be near 
                        Wild Horse, then, right?

                                 JOSEPH
                        Sure...

           Gunner looks at him, worried --

                                 GUNNER
                        Isn’t that where he is? 

                                 JOSEPH
                        I mean... I don’t know about a dam, 
                        but, yeah, I knew about following 
                        the river. I... I was leading us 
                        here.

           Gunner nods excitedly --

                                 GUNNER
                        Come on, we can get a bit farther 
                        before the sun sets.

           Gunner keeps walking, a newfound hope in his step. Joseph 
           follows, skeptical.
           INT. FLATHEAD COUNTY LIBRARY - DAY

           Missus Bakemeyer sits in front of her PC. The BELL over the 
           front door PINGS as a patron enters. She looks up --

                                 MISSUS BAKEMEYER
                        How can I help you?

           Amos approaches her desk, a few MISSING PERSON POSTERS in 
           hand. 

                                 AMOS
                        Could you post these flyers?

                                 MISSUS BAKEMEYER
                        Sure thing.

           He hands her a few flyers. Her face falls as she reads them.

                                 MISSUS BAKEMEYER (CONT’D)
                             (devastated)
                        Gunner... is missing?

                                 AMOS
                        I’m Amos. His father. Please let me 
                        know if you hear from him or 
                        anything.

                                 MISSUS BAKEMEYER
                        Oh, Amos, of course I will! 

           She reaches for scotch tape to hang the flyers up. 

           A COMIC BOOK on her desk catches Amos’s eye -- the same 
           drawings he saw in Gunner’s room. 

           Missus Bakemeyer notices --

                                 MISSUS BAKEMEYER (CONT’D)
                        He’s good, isn’t he?
                             (re: the comic panel)
                        Gunner’s detective story. I’ve been 
                        helping him with his research.

           Amos picks up the comic book --

                                 MISSUS BAKEMEYER (CONT’D)
                        I’ve never met a child so smart. 
                        We’re reading Sherlock Holmes’ 
                        “Study in Scarlet” together. He 
                        always out-reads me.

           Gunner’s words and drawings captivate Amos.
                                 MISSUS BAKEMEYER (CONT’D)
                        Let me know if there’s anything, 
                        anything at all, that I can do.

           His eyes water, taking in this new side of his son. 

           EXT. WILD HORSE FOREST - DAY

           Gunner, still in the lead, suddenly stops, examining the 
           compass around his neck. Joseph comes up beside him.

                                 JOSEPH
                        What now?

                                 GUNNER
                        I don’t get it.

           Gunner shows Joseph the compass -- the NEEDLE is going 
           haywire, erratically moving around the circle.

                                 GUNNER (CONT’D)
                        Why is it doing that? 

                                 JOSEPH
                        Holy shit... 

           Joseph stares at the compass, disturbed.

                                 GUNNER
                             (looking at the sun)
                        C’mon, we gotta keep moving.

           The boys continue hiking along the river.

           EXT. WILD HORSE FOREST - DUSK

           The sun glimmers between the pine trees. Gunner and Joseph 
           walk side by side.  

           A SNOWFLAKE falls from the sky, drifting in front of Gunner. 

           Gunner stoops to pick it up. He smiles with amazement.

                                 GUNNER
                        Joseph! Look!

           Joseph inspects the snowflake. 

                                 JOSEPH
                        No way it’s snowing...

           Gunner breathes on the snowflake. It doesn’t melt.
           He looks up -- SNOWFLAKES float down from the sky. Some are 
           small -- some are bigger, like torn-up pieces of paper. 

                                 GUNNER
                        This is amazing!

           Gunner spreads his arms wide -- spinning under the falling 
           flakes.

                                 GUNNER (CONT’D)
                        Snowing in July! It’s magic!

           Gunner is filled with glee and hope. Joseph watches, too 
           perplexed to know how to react.

                                 GUNNER (CONT’D)
                        We have to be getting close!

                                 JOSEPH
                        We should set up camp soon. 

           Joseph continues hiking. Gunner follows after, still in awe.

           VIEW OF THE SPRAWLING WILD HORSE FOREST

           SMOKE billows up, choking out the sky. The horizon above the 
           trees GLOWS RED.

           EXT. WILLOW SPUR - EVENING

           Amos hangs up MISSING CHILD FLYERS around town -- on wooden 
           telephone poles, by the church, near the post office.

           EXT. GENERAL STORE - NIGHT

           Amos's truck pulls up in front of the store. Chuck, the 
           general store owner, is outside, locking up the front doors --

                                 AMOS
                        Excuse me?

           Chuck turns.

                                 CHUCK
                        I’m closin’ for the day, mister.

                                 AMOS
                        I’m just wonderin’ if you could 
                        hang this poster in your store?
                                 CHUCK
                        Sure, sure thing.

                                 AMOS
                        Much obliged. 

           He hands Chuck a few POSTERS. 

                                 AMOS (CONT’D)
                        Case you need extras. 

           He returns to his truck. Chuck glances over the posters as 
           Amos starts his engine.

                                 CHUCK (O.S.)
                        Hey! Wait!

           Amos rolls down his window as Chuck approaches --

                                 CHUCK (CONT’D)
                        I saw this boy. 

           He points to the photocopied picture of Gunner.

           INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE - NIGHT

           Chuck sits with Amos, Sheriff Goodwin, and Deputy Gray. 

                                 CHUCK
                        -- A day ago, early morning. This 
                        boy, Gunner, and another kid. 

                                 DEPUTY GRAY
                        Another kid? Can you describe him?

                                 CHUCK
                        Yeah, long dark hair. Kinda... I 
                        don't know, what's the word, “rock 
                        and roll,” maybe.

                                 SHERIFF GOODWIN
                             (to Amos)
                        Sound like anyone your son knows?

                                 AMOS
                        I’ve never seen Gunner hanging out 
                        with a kid like that. 

                                 CHUCK
                        One more thing.

           All eyes on Chuck --
                                 CHUCK (CONT’D)
                        This kid, he had a big scar across 
                        his cheek.

                                 AMOS
                        A scar?

                                 SHERIFF GOODWIN
                        Something ringin’ a bell?

                                 AMOS
                        Told you I went hunting with Gunner 
                        last week. We saw this kid in the 
                        woods. Think he had a scar.

                                 SHERIFF GOODWIN
                        Know the kid’s name?

                                 AMOS
                        Not a clue.

           Amos leans back in the office chair, bone-weary.

           EXT. FOREST - NIGHT

           The boys trudge through the woods, illuminating their path 
           with the headlamps. Joseph stops Gunner, shining his light on 
           something in the distance.

                                 JOSEPH
                        See that?

           A FALLEN TREE is held a couple feet off the ground by its 
           roots and a clump of rocks. It’s SPLAYED OPEN, providing a 
           roof-like structure. 

           The boys walk over, inspecting the tree. 

                                 GUNNER
                        Whoa, what happened?

           A burnt-black SCAR runs down the tree trunk.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Lightning strike. Never hits the 
                        same place twice.

                                 GUNNER
                        Looks like it was set on fire. 

                                 JOSEPH
                        Looks like a fort. 
           He nestles underneath it. 

                                 JOSEPH (CONT’D)
                        See?

           Gunner sets down his pack and sits down next to Joseph -- 
           shredded bark hangs down in front of the boys like a hairy 
           canopy.

           LATER

           A little FIRE burns in front of the boy’s fallen tree fort. 
           The boys huddle close to its warmth, wearing every bit of 
           clothing they have. Their breath form puffs of vapor.

           Gunner draws another PANEL in his graphic novel story. Joseph 
           leans over, catching a glimpse of Gunner’s drawing.

                                 JOSEPH
                        You take classes or something to 
                        learn how to do that?

                                 GUNNER
                        No. I just draw a lot.

                                 JOSEPH
                        You’re pretty good. 

           Gunner erases Detective Knoxx’s face -- can’t quite get it to 
           look right.

                                 JOSEPH (CONT’D)
                        That’s like a comic book or 
                        something?

                                 GUNNER
                        It’s a graphic novel, about a ghost 
                        detective who’s investigating his 
                        own murder.  

           Joseph nods, impressed --

                                 JOSEPH
                        That’s a pretty cool story. What 
                        happens at the end?

                                 GUNNER
                        I don’t know yet.

                                 JOSEPH
                        You don’t know yet? It’s your 
                        story, how do you not know the 
                        ending?
           Gunner looks up --

                                 GUNNER
                             (condescending)
                        Writing a story is hard. You can’t 
                        just make anything up, it has to 
                        all relate to the beginning and 
                        middle. 

                                 JOSEPH
                        You should know the ending before 
                        you start writing the whole thing.

                                 GUNNER
                        Read Sherlock Holmes. Then you 
                        might understand.

           The boys glare at each other for a moment -- then Joseph’s 
           eyes go wide, a horrified expression on his face --

                                 JOSEPH
                        Holy shit!

                                 GUNNER
                        What?

                                 JOSEPH
                             (whispering)
                        Don’t. Move. A. Muscle. 

           Gunner freezes, terror-stricken. Joseph’s hand reaches out 
           toward Gunner’s ear. 

                                 GUNNER
                             (also whispering)
                        What is it?

           Something CLICKS over and over again near Gunner’s ear. 
           Gunner whimpers.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Shit, man, don’t move.

           Gunner MOANS -- terrified, about to get sick with fear...

           Joseph’s hand curls around SOMETHING -- he FLINGS IT AWAY. 
           Gunner SCREAMS.

           Joseph laughs, pointing -- a MASSIVE BEETLE scurries up the 
           side of the dead tree, disappearing into the cavernous 
           insides.
                                 JOSEPH (CONT’D)
                             (laughing)
                        You were scared shitless!

           Gunner wipes down his hair, checking for more bugs.

                                 GUNNER
                        Why would you joke about that?!

                                 JOSEPH
                        It’s just a bug. Calm down.

                                 GUNNER
                        No! You always mess with me. I’m 
                        sick of it!  

           Gunner crawls to the far side of the tree fort, away from 
           Joseph.

           He grabs a STICK and draws a line in the dirt.

                                 GUNNER (CONT’D)
                        This is my side. Don’t cross it.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Are you kidding me?

                                 GUNNER
                        Don’t cross my line!

                                 JOSEPH
                        Fine. 

           He turns the opposite way -- the boys hunker down in their 
           respective corners underneath the dying tree. 

           INT. GUNNER’S HOUSE - AMOS & MARY’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Amos enters, dragging his feet. He notices Mary’s side of the 
           bed is EMPTY.

                                 AMOS
                             (worried)
                        Mary?

           He rushes out of the room --

           INT. GUNNER'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Amos peers inside --
           Mary sits on Gunner's bed, staring at the crazed research 
           taped on the walls.

                                 AMOS
                        Jesus Christ, Mary, you shouldn’t 
                        be up! Doctors said --

                                 MARY
                        Why didn’t you tell me Gunner was 
                        missing?

           A beat.

                                 AMOS
                        I... I was gonna tell you, I 
                        promise...

                                 MARY
                        I called the sheriff. He told me 
                        everything.

           Mary’s eyes water as she looks over Gunner’s copious notes on 
           death.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        I remember when Gunner first 
                        learned about death. He was five 
                        years old. There was that stray 
                        cat... she'd always come right 
                        outside his window. He asked me to 
                        put some milk out for it. I didn't, 
                        said it'd never leave then. 

           Amos wrings his hands nervously.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        A couple weeks later, he saw the 
                        cat’s body on the road. Hit by a 
                        car. He didn't understand why it 
                        wouldn’t move. I had to explain to 
                        him... that it wasn’t going to ever 
                        move again... 

           She angrily brushes a TEAR off her cheek. 

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        Sometimes I think... I think that 
                        it was my fault. That I was the one 
                        that scared him, that I told him 
                        about death too early.

                                 AMOS
                        No, baby, it wasn’t your fault --
                                 MARY
                        I never wanted to treat him like a 
                        child. Like he was too stupid or 
                        too young. I always wanted to tell 
                        him the truth.

           She looks at Amos -- there’s a dark despair to her gaze.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        But I didn’t trust Gunner could 
                        handle knowing that I have cancer. 
                        And I think not knowing is worse 
                        than the truth itself, no matter 
                        how devastating.

           Amos reaches for her --

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        Don’t touch me!
                             (softly)
                        I guess in a way I deserve it. I 
                        lied to him about the truth same 
                        way you lied to me. You didn’t 
                        think I could handle it. 

           Her lip quivers.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        If anything happens to him or, or 
                        if I die before he’s back safe...

           Mary holds her head in her hands.

           EXT. WILD HORSE FOREST - NIGHT

           Gunner and Joseph are fast asleep.

           A MASSIVE BEETLE clicks its way out of the split-open tree. 
           It crawls along the top of the burned wood.

           It climbs up Gunner’s pant leg.

           It rises over Joseph’s shoulder... then crawls on the top of 
           the tree canopy...

           Wait -- it’s not the same beetle.

           From deep in the belly of the tree, DOZENS OF BEETLES crawl 
           out, silhouetted in the moonlight. 

           Gunner groans and sleepily opens his eyes. 

           He stirs -- the entire ground seems to move.
           BEETLES ARE EVERYWHERE!

           Gunner tries to stand -- but that startles the bugs -- the 
           calm of the beetles is sent into an uproar. 

           They swarm the boys -- Joseph snaps awake.

                                 GUNNER
                        Joseph! HELP!

           Huge beetles IN THE HUNDREDS skitter down from the tree. They 
           cover the boys’ faces, WAVES OF WIGGLING BLACK. 

           Gunner’s mouth clamps shut -- they swarm his lips. His 
           fingers grope -- shoving beetles out of the way.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Run!

           Gunner scrambles blindly out from under the tree --

           BUGS SQUISH under them -- the wet sound of insides CRUNCHING. 

           Gunner reaches for his gun and SLIPS -- his ARM GOES THROUGH 
           THE TREE. 

           Like a waterfall, even MORE BEETLES CASCADE out of the hole.

           It’s a nightmare that would make Stephen King shudder. 

           The boys run away from the tree -- but the beetles FOLLOW.

           Gunner’s HEADLAMP bounces light across the skeletal trees.

                                 GUNNER
                        There’s too many! What do we do?!

           The beetles start to gain on them.

                                 JOSEPH
                        There!

           RUSHING WATER sounds from further in the forest.

                                 JOSEPH (CONT’D)
                        We swim!

                                 GUNNER
                        What about my pack?

                                 JOSEPH
                        What?!
           The boys run toward the river -- WHITE RAPIDS churn against 
           huge river rocks.

                                 GUNNER
                        I LEFT MY PACK!

           They stop by the side of the river and turn around --

           The whole forest floor is ALIVE WITH BEETLES.

                                 JOSEPH
                        SCREW YOUR PACK!

           Joseph wraps his arms around Gunner and the rifle --

           The beetles reach them -- the first dozen latch onto their 
           shoes and start to climb --

           Joseph pulls Gunner into the water with him. 

           They disappear in the churning rapids.

           EXT. WILD HORSE FOREST - MORNING

           Dew coalesces off rigid pine needles. Water in a river eddy 
           gently laps over rocks. Not a soul in sight.

           Almost peaceful -- the sky full of thick, black smoke.

           INT. GUNNER’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

           The PHONE RINGS -- Amos runs to answer it.

                                 AMOS
                             (into the phone)
                        Hello?

           He peeks into his bedroom -- Mary is just waking up.

           EXT. EDGE OF WILD HORSE FOREST - CONTINUOUS

           Sheriff Goodwin ambles by the shoulder of County Road 82 --

                                 SHERIFF GOODWIN
                        Amos, it’s Sheriff Goodwin. Your 
                        boy have a blue bike with a wagon 
                        attached to it?
           INTERCUT

           Amos grips the phone hard -- lips pursed tight. 

                                 AMOS
                        Yeah, that’s his, all right. 

           The sheriff passes by Deputy Gray, who’s snapping PHOTOS of 
           Gunner’s bike. 

                                 SHERIFF GOODWIN
                        Looks like he may have gone into 
                        the Wild Horse forest. Any idea 
                        why?

                                 AMOS
                        Only time I know he’s been in there 
                        was when I took him hunting. He 
                        doesn’t like the woods much.

           Mary comes out of the bedroom, her face tense with fear.

                                 SHERIFF GOODWIN
                        I got some real bad news. There’s a 
                        wildfire growin’ in the Wild Horse 
                        forest...

                                 AMOS
                        What does that mean?

                                 SHERIFF GOODWIN
                        Means we got about thirty homes 
                        that need evacuating. I already 
                        should be on the road headin’ their 
                        way.

                                 AMOS
                        What about Gunner? Is he near this 
                        fire?

           On hearing “fire,” Mary grabs the remote and turns the TV on --

                                 SHERIFF GOODWIN
                        We gotta deal with these 
                        evacuations first. Then we’ll get 
                        to Gunner --

                                 AMOS
                        This is my goddamn son you’re 
                        talking about!

                                 SHERIFF GOODWIN
                        I wanted to give you the heads up, 
                        we’re doin’ everything we --
           Amos hangs up. Mary lowers onto the couch, her trembling hand 
           covering her mouth. Amos comes over, eyes on the TV. 

           A LOCAL NEWS STATION shows footage of the FIRE --

                                 NEWSCASTER (O.S.)
                             (from TV)
                        -- the Wild Horse forest fire is 
                        growing by the second after strong 
                        winds picked up and blew the fire 
                        toward Willow Spur and the 
                        surrounding towns. All residents in 
                        the area should check with their 
                        local fire or police station for 
                        evacuation details --

                                 MARY
                        Oh, Jesus...

           Amos rushes away from the TV, heading into his bedroom. Mary 
           watches the news, transfixed. Amos reemerges seconds later 
           with a HEAVY BACKPACK.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        Where are you going?

                                 AMOS
                        I’m goin’ to find him.

                                 MARY
                        Find him where? In the forest?

           Mary moves to Amos, who’s throwing a FLASHLIGHT, MATCHES, and 
           HEAVY JACKETS into the pack.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        Amos... 

           He looks up -- tears brim her eyes.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        I’ll help you pack.

           EXT. WILD HORSE FOREST - RIVERBANK - DAY

           Gunner, shivering for warmth in his soppy clothes, wakes up. 
           The rifle is slung across his body. 

           He pushes himself up, looking around.

           Joseph is awake, sitting cross-legged by the river, 
           trembling, his clothes also soaked. His face is ghostly pale 
           and sweat beads down his forehead and upper lip.
           Gunner moves to sit beside him.

                                 GUNNER
                        Thanks for saving me last night.

           Joseph stares into the water. 

                                 JOSEPH
                             (teeth chattering)
                        There’s some weird shit going on.

                                 GUNNER
                        Maybe it’s a sign that we’re 
                        getting close.

           Joseph shakes his head.

                                 JOSEPH
                        I don’t know, man. We lost 
                        everything.

                                 GUNNER
                        Got my gun still.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Okay, besides that, we lost 
                        everything. And the crap with your 
                        compass, the snowflakes... I say we 
                        call it quits.

           Shock fills Gunner’s face --

                                 GUNNER
                        What do you mean, “quits?” We’re 
                        fine! Probably will find the Water 
                        Man by the end of the day!

           Joseph’s eyes stay on the ground.

                                 GUNNER (CONT’D)
                        I’m scared, too. But I know I can’t 
                        do this without you. Please... 
                        Joseph, don’t leave me.

           Joseph looks into Gunner’s wide, pleading eyes.

                                 GUNNER (CONT’D)
                        If we don’t find him by tonight, 
                        we’ll go home. Promise. 

                                 JOSEPH
                        Okay. One more day. Then we go 
                        home.
           Gunner smiles and stands.

                                 GUNNER
                        Deal.

           He helps Joseph to his feet. The two continue following the 
           river downstream.

           INT. AMOS’S TRUCK - MONTANA STATE HIGHWAY - DAY

           Amos is in his truck, speeding along the two-lane state 
           highway. 

           Coming the other way is a steady stream of CARS, packed full 
           of families and their valuables, evacuating their homes.

           Amos listens to the radio --

                                 RADIO VOICE (O.S.)
                        More and more people in the 
                        Flathead and Glacier counties are 
                        encouraged to pack essentials and 
                        valuables. Already two homes have 
                        been destroyed --

           HIGHWAY PATROL CARS are ahead, blocking the road. 

           Amos HONKS his horn in frustration, but the PATROL OFFICERS 
           shake their heads, pointing Amos back in the opposite 
           direction.

           Amos looks to the side of the road -- the shoulders are 
           CLEAR. He thinks for a moment, and then --

           SWERVES HIS TRUCK OFF THE ROAD.

           A patrol officer holds his hands up for Amos to stop, but 
           Amos speeds past. 

           EXT. WILD HORSE FOREST - DAY

           Gunner comes to a cliff -- he looks down -- 

           There’s at least a fifteen-foot difference from where they 
           stand to the rocky shelf below. 

           The river CASCADES down a steep drop, creating treacherous 
           rapids between massive boulders. 

           Joseph approaches Gunner’s side, surveying the cliff --
                                 JOSEPH
                        No way we can climb down.

           Gunner gazes across the river -- that side gently rolls down, 
           easy to descend.

           Upstream, a couple FALLEN LOGS create a makeshift bridge.

                                 GUNNER
                        There! We can cross!

           Gunner heads for the logs. Joseph follows, violently 
           shivering. He’s looking more ill by the minute.

           EXT. LOGS ACROSS THE RIVER - MOMENTS LATER

           Gunner and Joseph examine the makeshift log bridge and the 
           roaring waters underneath.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Uh, uh. No way, man. I’m not 
                        crossing that thing.

                                 GUNNER
                        You have a better idea?

                                 JOSEPH
                        Yeah, we go home.

           Gunner, unwilling to accept defeat, puts one foot on the log.

                                 JOSEPH (CONT’D)
                        Are you serious?!

           Gunner takes another step. He gulps hard but keeps moving.

           The river flows fast and mercilessly under his feet.

           Gunner breathes steadily, arms balancing in the air.

           One shaky step after another, he makes it to the half-way 
           point. 

           Gunner exhales, a victorious smile on his lips. 

                                 GUNNER
                             (over his shoulder)
                        See? Not so bad!

           Gunner turns back around and takes a step --

           CRACK!
           One of the logs bends under his foot -- held together only by 
           its thin, papery bark.

                                 GUNNER (CONT’D)
                        Joseph?!

                                 JOSEPH
                        Run, man!

           Gunner pulls his foot off -- the log BREAKS.

           Gunner SCREAMS as he PLUMMETS DOWN.

                                 JOSEPH (CONT’D)
                        Gunner!

           Gunner’s flailing arms grasp the second log -- barely 
           catching himself.

           His legs dangle in the water. 

                                 JOSEPH (CONT’D)
                        Holy shit!

                                 GUNNER
                        Help! Help me!

           Gunner’s grip loosens -- the churning water pulling him in.

                                 GUNNER (CONT’D)
                        I’m slipping!

           Joseph crawls on all fours on the log, inching his way 
           forward.

           But he’s still got about eight feet to go...

                                 GUNNER (CONT’D)
                        Joseph! I can’t hold!

           Gunner slides farther -- he grabs a BRANCH with one hand -- 
           it SNAPS OFF. 

           His other hand digs into the log.

                                 GUNNER (CONT’D)
                        HELP!

           Joseph reaches for him -- too late --

           THE WATER PULLS GUNNER OFF THE LOG.

                                 GUNNER (CONT’D)
                        AHH!
           The RIFLE STRAP tenses -- catching under his arm -- keeping 
           him in place as the water tugs on his waist and legs. 

           Gunner looks up --

           Joseph has the rifle strap in his grip -- his legs squeeze 
           against the log.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Kick!

           Instinct takes over -- Gunner kicks with all his might, 
           clutching the rifle for dear life.

           Joseph pulls Gunner up -- every muscle straining...

           Gunner plants one hand on the log -- Joseph reaches down and 
           grabs the waistline of Gunner’s soaked jeans, heaving him up.

           Gunner climbs on the log, wrapping his legs around it.

           Both boys pant, winded and emotionally drained.

                                 GUNNER
                        Thanks...

                                 JOSEPH
                        Man, you’re nuts!

           Gunner shivers, gazing at the churning rapids that could’ve 
           been his demise.

                                 GUNNER
                        Come on. We’re halfway across.

           Gunner scoots forward. Joseph watches him incredulously, then 
           follows.

           Amos holds a WHISTLE to his lips -- he blows into it, then 
           listens for any response.

                                 AMOS
                        Gunner! Gunner, can you hear me?

           Silence -- except for the sound of RUSHING WATER in the 
           distance...
           BIRD’S EYE VIEW OF THE WILD HORSE FOREST

           The Montana wilderness stretches to the horizon and beyond. 
           Red, pulsing light from the FOREST FIRE flickers in the 
           distance.

           INT. SHERIFF’S OFFICE - DAY

           The office is a frenzy of ringing phones, impatient citizens, 
           and bustling staff. 

           Deputy Gray punches in a number on her desk phone, eyes on a 
           PAPER in front of her --

                                 DEPUTY GRAY
                             (into the phone)
                        Sheriff! ‘Member that boy with the 
                        scar Chuck was tellin’ us about? 

           The paper is a HOSPITAL RECORD.

                                 DEPUTY GRAY (CONT’D)
                        Think I found something.

           EXT. WILD HORSE FOREST - DAY

           Gunner and Joseph walk through woods, bedraggled, dirty, 
           hungry. The fun of the woods long gone. 

           Gunner glances over to Joseph -- Joseph hugs his arms, his 
           eyes glazed over -- pale and sickly. 

                                 GUNNER
                        What did the Water Man do last time 
                        he stalked you?

                                 JOSEPH
                        What are you talking about?

                                 GUNNER
                        Before he attacked you, he stalked 
                        you, right? Tired you out?

           Joseph stops walking --

                                 JOSEPH
                        Got anything to eat, man?

           Gunner shakes his head, fidgeting. Joseph coughs raggedly.
           EXT. DOUBLE-WIDE TRAILER HOME - DAY

           Rusted truck carcasses, crushed beer cans, and a redneck feel 
           that deters unwanted company. 

           Deputy Gray knocks on the door. A DOG BARKS VICIOUSLY --

                                 MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                             (from inside)
                        Shut the hell up!

           Scuffling and grumbling sounds as someone approaches the 
           front screen door, OPENING UP --

           GEORGE RILEY (late 30s, a back-country lowlife) sizes up the 
           deputy, his eyes glazed over from a few drinks despite the 
           early hour.

                                 GEORGE RILEY
                        Can, can I help you?

                                 DEPUTY GRAY
                        Are you George Riley?

                                 GEORGE RILEY
                             (getting nervous)
                        What’s this about?

           A LARGE MUTT runs to the front door, BARKING FOR BLOOD. 
           George Riley grabs the dog by the collar and throws him 
           behind the screen door, then steps onto the front porch. 

                                 DEPUTY GRAY
                        I just want to ask you a few 
                        questions about your son, Joseph.

           George’s eyes narrow --

                                 GEORGE RILEY
                        What’d that kid do now?

           EXT. FOREST - DAY

           Joseph leans back against a smooth slab of granite rock and 
           closes his eyes.

                                 GUNNER
                        You said that the Water Man tired 
                        you out.

                                 JOSEPH
                        I don’t wanna talk about this... I 
                        feel like shit.
           He spits to the side. He has a strained look across his face. 
           Gunner’s getting anxious himself.

                                 GUNNER
                        But what did you do when he 
                        attacked you?

                                 JOSEPH
                        I don’t know, I just fought him 
                        off.

                                 GUNNER
                        Yeah, but how?

                                 JOSEPH
                        I don’t know, just did, okay?!

                                 DEPUTY GRAY (PRELAP)
                        When’s the last time you saw 
                        Joseph?

           EXT. RILEY DOUBLE-WIDE TRAILER HOME - SAME

           Riley leans against his trailer home while the deputy 
           questions him --

                                 GEORGE RILEY
                        Boy’s in and out a lot. Can’t say 
                        for sure last time I saw him.

                                 DEPUTY GRAY 
                        Have you ever seen him hang around 
                        with this kid? 

           Deputy Gray holds up the poster of Gunner’s face. George 
           squints, looking at the photo. 

                                 GEORGE RILEY
                        No, never seen that boy in my life. 

           The DOG BARKS violently -- George kicks the screen door --

                                 GEORGE RILEY (CONT’D)
                             (to the dog)
                        Shut the hell up!

                                 DEPUTY GRAY
                        This boy went missing two days ago. 
                        A witness says he saw him and a boy 
                        with a scar across his cheek 
                        together before they disappeared.

           George Riley tenses -- Deputy Gray notices.
                                 GEORGE RILEY
                        Like I said, I’ve never seen that 
                        kid ‘fore in my life.

           EXT. FOREST - SAME

           Joseph averts his eyes from Gunner’s --

                                 JOSEPH
                        I’m heading back.

                                 GUNNER
                        You promised me one more day!

                                 JOSEPH
                        You gotta know when to quit, man. 
                        I’m sick. Feel like shit. We have 
                        no water, no food, nothing.

                                 GUNNER
                        There’s a river with water right 
                        here, and... and we’re almost 
                        there.

           Joseph frowns -- his nervousness replaced by irritation.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Gunner, man, forget about the Water 
                        Man. It’s a bunch of crap.

           Gunner gulps hard --

                                 GUNNER
                        No, it’s not. You saw him. 

                                 JOSEPH
                        Okay... Look, Gunner... Maybe I was 
                        making that up.

           Gunner looks like he just got hit in the stomach. The whole 
           world seems to spin around him --

                                 GUNNER
                        But... what about your scar?

           EXT. RILEY DOUBLE-WIDE TRAILER HOME - SAME

           The deputy puts her hands on her hips -- emphasizing the 
           PISTOL in its holster. George shifts his weight 
           uncomfortably.
                                 DEPUTY GRAY
                        Pulled some files from the county 
                        hospital. Joseph got fifteen 
                        stitches for a cut on his cheek a 
                        couple months ago.

           The deputy’s cold stare bores into George Riley.

                                 DEPUTY GRAY (CONT’D)
                        Wanna tell me about that scar of 
                        his?

           George licks his lips -- his voice is steady and calm.

                                 GEORGE RILEY
                        Joseph’s the kind of kid that’s 
                        always finding himself in trouble. 
                        You know how boys do.

           EXT. FOREST - SAME

           Joseph drops his gaze -- staring darkly at the ground. 

                                 GUNNER
                        Joseph! What about your scar!

           Gunner is frantic, on the verge of losing it...

           EXT. RILEY DOUBLE-WIDE TRAILER HOME - SAME

           Deputy Gray returns to her patrol car --

                                 DEPUTY GRAY
                             (calling back)
                        Call me as soon as Joseph gets 
                        home. And Mr. Riley...

           The deputy shoots George a nasty look.

                                 DEPUTY GRAY (CONT’D)
                        This isn’t the last time you’ll be 
                        seeing me.

           She ducks into the driver seat. The dog continues to BARK. 

           EXT. FOREST - DAY

           Joseph’s breaking point teeters on a hair-trigger...

                                 GUNNER
                        Joseph, tell me!
                                 JOSEPH
                             (exploding)
                        I didn’t get it from the Water Man, 
                        alright!

                                 GUNNER
                        Then where did you get it?

                                 JOSEPH
                        You know what, man? Screw you!

           Gunner grabs Joseph’s shoulders, shaking him, desperate --

                                 GUNNER
                        Joseph! Where did you get the 
                        scar?!

           Joseph pushes Gunner back.

                                 JOSEPH
                             (screaming)
                        You have no idea the shit I’ve been 
                        through! I survived because I only 
                        look out for number one -- myself.

           Joseph seethes at Gunner --

                                 JOSEPH (CONT’D)
                        And right now, you and this stupid 
                        plan are gettin’ in the way of 
                        that.

                                 GUNNER
                             (desperate)
                        You won’t get the rest of the 
                        money! Our deal was you had to take 
                        me to the Water Man!

                                 JOSEPH
                        I don’t give a shit about your 
                        stupid money.

                                 GUNNER
                        You know why I’m looking for the 
                        Water Man? 

           Gunner’s mouth quivers -- anger and fear staving off tears.

                                 GUNNER (CONT’D)
                        Because my mom is dying. Everyone 
                        thinks she’ll never get better. The 
                        doctors. Nurses. My dad. Everyone 
                        except me.
           Joseph leans his head back against the granite slab.

                                 JOSEPH
                        You got a sick mom, who you love, and 
                        you’re chasing a ghost in the woods?
                             (genuinely)
                        Let’s go home, Gunner.

           Gunner stares at him, anger boiling in his whole body.

                                 GUNNER
                             (screaming)
                        So you think I should give up on 
                        her, too, huh?! The Water Man is 
                        the only chance I have to save her! 

                                 JOSEPH
                        Everyone you love will one day 
                        leave you! They’ll die or just pack 
                        their bags and leave. Grow up, kid.

           Joseph coughs wretchedly, spitting thick mucus to the side. 
           He’s in bad shape.

                                 GUNNER
                        I’m going to find him, with or 
                        without you. 

           He turns and storms away, following the water downstream. 
           Joseph watches him go, taking shallow, raspy breaths.

           EXT. WILD HORSE FOREST - DUSK

           The dark, skeletal trees seem to moan -- moss and fungus gnaw 
           on plant carcasses.

           Amos tears through the woods. SOMETHING catches his eye. He 
           pauses, turning back --

           Two ORBS REFLECT THE EVENING SUN back to him.

           OBSIDIAN PENDANTS hang from branches -- the strange carvings 
           scar the tree trunks.

           He CRUNCHES on something -- looks down --

           A PIECE OF PAPER, wadded up. 

           Amos picks it up and opens -- a page from Gunner’s drawing 
           pad -- a cartoon DETECTIVE KNOXX hovers mid-page.

           He looks across the forest floor --
           Scattered across the ground are Gunner’s belongings: his 
           pack, food wrappers, clothes... chewed up by something. 

           EXT. WILD HORSE FOREST - NIGHT

           The night sky is salted with stars -- the FULL MOON fills the 
           forest with monochromatic light. 

           Gunner marches through the dark, lonely forest. He rubs his 
           arms, trying to keep warm. His breath comes out as steam.

           ANOTHER PART OF THE FOREST

           Joseph stumbles through the thick brush, hugging his scrawny 
           bare arms to his chest. He begins to sing, hauntingly and 
           deliriously -- 

                                 JOSEPH
                        One, two, three four... Close your 
                        windows, lock your doors...

           He’s dwarfed by thick, looming pine trees -- a sinister 
           darkness fills the spaces between.

                                 JOSEPH (CONT’D)
                        ‘Cause you never know for sure... 
                        who it is he’s coming for...

           Joseph’s eyelids flutter, fighting to stay open.

           DEEP IN THE WOODS

           Gunner weaves between logs, rocks, and hillsides. 

           SMOKE starts to fill the forest, descending like dark, 
           choking fog. 

                                 JOSEPH (V.O.)
                             (slowing down)
                        Five, six, seven, eight... by the 
                        time it’s getting late...

           EXT. WILD HORSE LAKE - NIGHT

           Gunner shivers in his dirty, threadbare shirt. His shoes sink 
           into fine-grained sand. He looks up --

           He’s on the shore of a LAKE, its surface covered with a thin 
           layer of GRAY ASH. 
                                 JOSEPH (V.O.)
                        All you can do is wait... 

           Across the lake is a RAMSHACKLE HUT, worn from years of harsh 
           weather and neglect. The FLICKERING GLOW OF A FIRE lights up 
           the inside, smoke rising from the chimney.

                                 JOSEPH (V.O.)
                        Til the Water Man decides your 
                        fate.

           Gunner cautiously creeps around the lake toward the hut, 
           entranced... scared... curious...

           EXT. HUT - NIGHT

           Gunner walks carefully toward the rickety hut, GUN at the 
           ready.

           The same type of OBSIDIAN ROCKS decorate the wooden door of 
           the hut. Gunner runs his hand along the rocks. They glint 
           like eyes, challenging him, beckoning him in. 

           He KNOCKS on the door, then backs up, clenching his rifle 
           tight. His finger hovers above the trigger.

           SOMETHING RUSTLES IN THE BUSHES BEHIND HIM.

           Gunner spins around -- accidentally PULLING THE TRIGGER --

           BOOM!

           EXT. WILD HORSE FOREST - SAME

           The GUNSHOT echoes around the forest -- Amos freezes.

           He spins around the forest, ears pricked. No clue what 
           direction the shot was fired from.

                                 AMOS
                             (at the top of his lungs)
                        Gunner!

           He picks a direction and takes off running.

           EXT. HUT - NIGHT

           Gunner runs to the side and ducks under a bush for cover -- 
           BIRDS take flight from its thorny branches.
           His whole body trembles with fear -- he searches for any sign 
           of movement.

           A cold, eerie silence descends on the lake. 

           Tears brim in Gunner’s eyes -- he gingerly steps out from 
           hiding.

           He creeps forward, opening the door to the hut. 

           INT. HUT - CONTINUOUS

           Gunner steps through -- a CLICKING NOISE draws his gaze down --
           BEETLES scuttle along the ground. One crawls over his shoe. 

           Gunner swallows hard and looks up, forcing his eyes to stay 
           focused on the firelight. He lets his hand fall from the wood 
           door.

           The door closes behind him.

           A cot with a ratty blanket, rusty pots and pans, dried meat 
           hanging in strips along a clothesline, an ORNATE ROCKING 
           CHAIR set right in front of the hearth.

           The hut is EMPTY -- not a soul in sight.

           THEN --

           The WOOD DOOR CREAKS. Gunner spins around --

           A FIGURE pushes the door open, heaving something behind them. 

           Gunner drops to his stomach by the cot, wiggling underneath. 

           From Gunner’s vantage point beneath the cot, he can only see 
           from the knees down -- WORN BOOTS enter frame -- re-sewn over 
           years of use. They walk feebly toward the campfire, dragging 
           a MASSIVE BRASS POT behind them. 

           The figure sets an old GRILL above the fire, plopping the 
           brass pot on top of it.

           The firelight dances in Gunner’s wide, fearful eyes.

           The rocking chair creaks as the figure sits down. They tend 
           to the heavy pot nestled on the grill above the campfire.

                                 GRUFF MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        No point in hidin’, son. 

           The voice is slow like molasses but rough as sandpaper. 
           Decaying, hopeless.
           Every muscle in Gunner’s body tenses. 

                                 GRUFF MALE VOICE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        I seen you walk in after you fired 
                        your rifle. Under my bed, I ‘spect. 
                        Tends to sag, so if you’re down 
                        there when I retire you won’t be 
                        able to breathe.

           Gunner considers staying put, but decides against it. He 
           slowly shimmies his way out from under the cot. 

                                 GRUFF MALE VOICE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        There ya go. Was afraid I’d have to 
                        drag you out.

           Gunner stares forward, eyes wide -- 

           THE WATER MAN rocks gently in the chair, his back to Gunner.

           He’s dangerously thin and feeble -- hunched shoulders, the 
           hint of a long, white beard.

           Gunner clutches his gun, fearing the Water Man might turn 
           around and swallow him whole...

           EXT. WILD HORSE FOREST - NIGHT

           A FLASHLIGHT BEAM illuminates clouds of thick smoke pouring 
           through the trees and rolling over the river.

           Amos emerges, flashlight in hand, his mouth covered with a 
           BANDANA. 

                                 AMOS
                        Gunner, can you hear me?!

           Despite the thick smoke, Amos runs between the trees, racing 
           the river next to him.

           INT. THE WATER MAN’S HUT - NIGHT

           The fire dances under the massive pot -- a frothy red 
           substance BUBBLES and BOILS over the fire.

                                 THE WATER MAN
                        Stew’s about done. Hungry?

           Gunner opens his mouth -- finally finding his voice, 
           remembering how to speak.
                                 GUNNER
                        N-not really...

           The old man stirs the pot.

                                 THE WATER MAN
                        Neither am I, truthfully. Haven’t 
                        been hungry in years. 

           Gunner opens his mouth, but the words catch in his throat.

                                 THE WATER MAN (CONT’D)
                        What is your name, son?

                                 GUNNER
                             (finding his courage)
                        Gunner... Gunner Boone.

           The Water Man nods, tending his stew.

                                 THE WATER MAN
                        Gunner Boone, what are you doing in 
                        my home?

                                 GUNNER
                        I, I’m here...
                             (takes a deep breath)
                        ... to find the Water Man. 

           Gunner waits for a reaction... but the Water Man just stirs 
           the stew. Finally --

                                 THE WATER MAN
                        I hope you haven’t sacrificed too 
                        much trying to find him. 

           Gunner’s lip quivers.

                                 GUNNER
                        He... He’s my only hope.

                                 THE WATER MAN
                        You speak of the Water Man in the 
                        way a religious man speaks of God. 
                        I fear a hopeful man more’n I do a 
                        demon.

           The old man shifts in his seat -- the rocking chair creaks.

                                 THE WATER MAN (CONT’D)
                        I think you should head back to 
                        your home, Gunner Boone. 

           Gunner stands defiant --
                                 GUNNER
                        I think you’re the Water Man.

                                 THE WATER MAN
                        Go home, son.

                                 GUNNER
                        The Water Man came back to life 
                        after he died. My mom is dying. 
                        Everyone, even my father, they... 
                        they’ve given up on her. But I 
                        haven’t.
                             (a beat)
                        If the Water Man can come back to 
                        life, maybe he can help my mom. 

           The Water Man finally turns -- his eyes are COMPLETELY BLACK -- 
           sunken and hopeless -- lifeless, lonely voids.

                                 THE WATER MAN
                        Hope can drive a man to madness 
                        well ‘fore he’s driven to the 
                        grave.

           Gunner freezes in fear.

           EXT. ALONG THE RIVER - WILD HORSE FOREST - NIGHT

           Amos sprints beside the river, dodging rocks and fallen logs. 
           In the distance, it seems like a dawn from hell is breaking, 
           smoke choking out the stars above.

                                 THE WATER MAN (V.O.)
                        But love makes a man even madder. 
                        And while I’ve never understood 
                        hope... I understand love.

           INT. HUT - NIGHT

           The Water Man dips a worn metal bowl into the pot, ladling 
           out stew. He indicates for Gunner to take it -- Gunner looks 
           at the frothing red liquid -- shakes his head. 

           The Water Man brings the bowl to his own lips, slowly 
           sipping. 

                                 GUNNER
                        Can you help me? Please?
                                 THE WATER MAN
                        You got one thing wrong, son. I 
                        never came back from the dead. I 
                        just refused to die. 

           Gunner slowly circles around the fire until he’s facing THE 
           WATER MAN, rocking in his chair.

                                 THE WATER MAN (CONT’D)
                        Dying... that’s easy. Living’s much 
                        harder. When my life was spared, it 
                        came with a price. I may not have 
                        died, but I created my own living 
                        hell...

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. WILD HORSE WOODS - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

           Edward Schaal etches a CARVING into the tree above a FRESHLY 
           DUG GRAVE -- the strange symbol all around the forest -- 

                                 THE WATER MAN (V.O.)
                        Sarah Schaal... she was the only 
                        part of my life that mattered.

           The strange symbol is two S’s, side by side, looking like a 
           crude drawing of a river. He hangs an OBSIDIAN PENDANT on a 
           branch above the grave.

                                 THE WATER MAN (V.O.)
                        I ran ‘stead of trying to save her.

           His eyes are empty and hopeless. 

           INT. THE WATER MAN’S HUT - BACK TO THE PRESENT

           The Water Man’s trembling fingers set the bowl down on the 
           ground. He reaches into his pocket --

                                 THE WATER MAN
                        I haven’t left these woods since. 
                        Partly ‘cause I never wanted to see 
                        another human again... 

           EXT. WOODS - DAY - FLASHBACK

           Edward Schaal, older but still just as grief-stricken, stares 
           grimly at the sinister forest --
                                 THE WATER MAN (V.O.)
                        And ‘cause I could feel myself 
                        going mad. I couldn’t remember 
                        where I buried my Sarah. Maybe I 
                        imagined it. Maybe I was dead after 
                        all.

           Every tree before him is branded with the initials that mark 
           his wife’s grave, making it impossible to know the 
           original...

           INT. HUT - BACK TO THE PRESENT

           The Water Man pulls something from his pocket -- an OBSIDIAN 
           PENDANT.

           He extends the pendant over the fire for Gunner, his HANDS 
           visible in the light -- his fingers way too thin, the 
           KNUCKLES stark white.

           His hands are BONES.

                                 THE WATER MAN
                        This is the answer you’ve been 
                        looking for, Gunner Boone.

           Though terrified, Gunner reaches for the pendant, clasping 
           the twine. The Water Man leans back in his rocking chair. The 
           pendant... it’s...

           FLASH TO EDWARD SCHAAL COMING BACK TO LIFE

           Edward Schaal gasps and sits up, taking in the world around 
           him, overwhelmed and terrified. 

           He looks down in his hands -- he’s holding an OBSIDIAN 
           PENDANT.

           BACK TO THE PRESENT

           Gunner inspects THAT SAME PENDANT.

           Gunner looks up -- the Water Man seems to gaze at the fire, 
           but the light doesn’t reflect in his eyes.

                                 THE WATER MAN
                        Give it to your mother. Perhaps it 
                        will do the same for her as it’s 
                        done for me...
           Gunner sidesteps around the fire -- BEETLES scurry out from 
           the shadows.

                                 THE WATER MAN (CONT’D)
                        Goodbye, Gunner Boone. 

           Gunner sprints out of the hut --

           EXT. WILD HORSE LAKE - NIGHT

           Outside the hut, Gunner comes face-to-face with billowing 
           clouds of SMOKE -- he covers his mouth and runs around the 
           lake.

           He meets the junction of river and lake -- he follows the 
           river upstream.

           EXT. BESIDE THE RIVER - NIGHT

           The smoke grows thicker and thicker. ASH RAINS DOWN around 
           Gunner as he hurries up the river.

           LATER

           Gunner pulls himself up a couple of boulders, looking at the 
           granite slab where he last saw Joseph --

           No one’s there. 

                                 GUNNER
                        Joseph? Joseph!

           FOOTPRINTS indicate Joseph dragged himself into the forest.  

           Gunner glances upstream -- the way home, to his mother -- 
           then in the woods where the footprints lead. 

           Gunner takes off into the forest, following the footprints.

           EXT. DEEP IN THE FOREST - NIGHT

           The smoke clears in the dense brush. 

           Gunner creeps forward, scanning the dark woods methodically.

                                 GUNNER
                        Joseph? 

           Something RATTLES -- CAWS -- RUSTLES -- SNAPS. Every sound 
           magnified in the dark.
           Gunner swings the gun around, holding it up defensively.

           SHADOWS pass through the trees.

                                 GUNNER (CONT’D)
                        Hello?

           Gunner raises the gun -- panic seizing his body.

                                 GUNNER (CONT’D)
                        Who’s there?!

           He cocks the rifle, finger poised on the trigger. He holds 
           the gun up, looking through the sights --

           A FADED CONVERSE SNEAKER --

                                 GUNNER (CONT’D)
                        Joseph!

           He lowers the gun. Joseph lies sprawled on the forest floor.

           Gunner runs to Joseph.

                                 GUNNER (CONT’D)
                        Joseph, it’s me, Gunner!

           Joseph’s eyes focus on Gunner -- a small smile breaks across 
           his blue-tinged lips.

                                 JOSEPH
                        You came back for me...

                                 GUNNER
                        No way I’m leaving your ass behind!

           Gunner wraps Joseph’s arm around his neck, heaving him up.

                                 JOSEPH
                             (weakly)
                        Hey man, cursing is for lowlifes 
                        and dirt bags.

                                 GUNNER
                             (straining under the weight)
                        Who told you that, your mommy?

           Joseph’s head hangs down -- his body too weak to move. 

                                 JOSEPH
                        I have to tell you...
                                 GUNNER
                        We gotta get out of here, there’s 
                        more smoke every minute!

           Gunner nudges Joseph, forcing him to take a step. Joseph 
           plants his feet down hard --

                                 JOSEPH
                        Gunner... my dad is how I got the 
                        scar. My drunk, asshole dad. I 
                        tried to runaway, but I was scared 
                        out here alone...

           Joseph’s eyes brighten, growing lucid --

                                 JOSEPH (CONT’D)
                        But you... you were gonna come out 
                        here all by yourself. I couldn’t 
                        run ‘til you showed up.

                                 GUNNER
                        You’re my first real friend, 
                        Joseph.

                                 JOSEPH
                             (smiling weakly)
                        I guess me too.

           Joseph coughs wretchedly, doubling over.

                                 JOSEPH (CONT’D)
                        I’m scared, man. I don’t think I 
                        can make it back... 

           Gunner’s face brightens with an idea --

                                 GUNNER
                        Soup! I can get you some soup, 
                        maybe a jacket, too!

           Joseph’s consciousness ebbs... he leans limply on Gunner’s 
           shoulder.

                                 GUNNER (CONT’D)
                        Just wait til you see, Joseph! The 
                        Water Man is alive!

           Gunner half-drags, half-carries Joseph back toward the lake.

           EXT. THE WATER MAN’S HUT - MOMENTS LATER

           Gunner and Joseph approach the hut --
                                 GUNNER
                        It’s going to be okay, Joseph.

           Gunner looks up -- freezes, a look of confused horror 
           spreading over his face --

           The hut is still there... but it’s different...

           The roof is CAVED IN -- the wood rotten -- MOSS AND FUNGUS 
           grow in patches -- it’s dark and lifeless.

           Looks like no one’s lived there for DECADES. Gunner lets go 
           of Joseph, staring at the derelict hut in shocked horror.

                                 GUNNER (CONT’D)
                        What happened...

           Gunner reaches into his pocket and pulls out the obsidian 
           pendant -- still very much real.

           A HEAVY CRACKLING SOUND grows behind him -- he turns --

           The WILD HORSE FIRE pulses on the other side of the lake, 
           leaping from tree to tree with terrifying dexterity.

                                 JOSEPH
                        Fire...

           Joseph FALLS OVER into the lake --

                                 GUNNER
                        Joseph!

           Joseph sinks. Gunner jumps in after him --

           UNDERWATER

           The eerie GHOST TOWN is illuminated by firelight below -- 
           Joseph’s silhouette descends toward it.

           Gunner jumps in the water, scanning --

           EERIE SHAPES rise from the submerged buildings below -- a 
           trick of the eye, or GHOSTS...

           Gunner’s dives deeper for Joseph, wrapping his arms around 
           Joseph’s midsection. 

           He frantically kicks his way toward the surface, Joseph in 
           tow, AIR BUBBLES leaking from his nose.

           The OBSIDIAN PENDANT falls from his pocket, sinking...
           Gunner’s eyes go wide -- he lets one hand free.

           He tries to grab the pendant -- fingers grasping through the 
           water. 

           His grip on Joseph loosens -- the pendant plummets further.

           Joseph’s head lolls limply on Gunner’s shoulder.

           Gunner lets go of Joseph for one more attempt to grab the 
           pendant -- his fingers just barely graze the twine --

           The last air bubble leaves Joseph’s nose. He sinks deeper --

           Gunner turns away from the pendant.

           With all his might, he kicks against the water, pulling 
           Joseph toward the surface.

           EXT. LAKE - NIGHT

           Gunner bursts above the water, Joseph in tow. Gunner drags 
           him to shore. The smoke is EVERYWHERE.

           Gunner spots THE WATER MAN through the smoke, watching him.

                                 GUNNER
                             (screaming)
                        Why are you doing this?

           The Water Man remains silent -- black eyes boring into 
           Gunner. 

                                 GUNNER (CONT’D)
                        Help us out of here!

           No answer. 

                                 GUNNER (CONT’D)
                        I said HELP US!

           Gunner grabs a ROCK on the shore of the lake and hurls it 
           toward the Water Man.

           The rock swirls the smoke -- the Water Man disappears in the 
           moving particles.

           Gunner chokes -- eyes and throat burning. 

           He plops down beside the river, lying Joseph down beside him.

           He slaps Joseph’s face -- but Joseph just lies there limply.
                                 GUNNER (CONT’D)
                        Joseph! Stay with me!

           Gunner shakes Joseph HARD -- Joseph’s eyes open for a second.

                                 GUNNER (CONT’D)
                        You gotta get up, man! We can’t 
                        stay here!
                             (coughing)
                        Joseph!

           Gunner looks around -- darkness and emptiness everywhere. 

                                 GUNNER (CONT’D)
                        Is anybody out there?

           Then --

           A BRIGHT LIGHT grows steadily toward him, jumping and jolting 
           as it gets closer.

           Gunner freezes, terrified.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Gunner!

           Gunner blinks through the tears -- the light shines to the 
           side, and as Gunner’s eyes adjusts, he sees Amos with a 
           flashlight.

                                 GUNNER
                        DAD!

           Gunner jumps to his feet -- sprinting toward his dad -- 

           They reunite -- Amos picks Gunner up, holding him close. He 
           kisses Gunner’s cheeks, tears pouring from his eyes.

                                 AMOS
                        My baby... my baby boy, it’s 
                        okay... I got you...

           Gunner also cries, safe in his father’s arms.

                                 AMOS (CONT’D)
                        We have to get out of here --

                                 GUNNER 
                        Joseph! We can’t leave Joseph!

           Gunner points behind him -- Amos spots the unconscious boy. 

           He hands Gunner the flashlight then goes over to Joseph, 
           scooping the boy up and hoisting him over his shoulder.
           They take off into the woods -- the silhouette of the Water 
           Man barely visible through the smoke, watching them flee...

           EXT. WILD HORSE FOREST - DAWN

           Thick smoke obscures the warm sunrise colors -- but the 
           dawn’s SHADOWLESS LIGHT illuminates the forest.

           Amos walks steadily through the trees, both Gunner and Joseph 
           slung over his shoulders. His eyes are sharp and lucid, but 
           the skin around them is strained.

           Erratic FLASHES of POLICE LIGHTS beam through the trees -- 
           Sheriff Goodwin, Deputy Gray, and FOREST SERVICE WORKERS run 
           to Amos and the two boys. 

           INT. FOREST SERVICE EMERGENCY TRUCK - MOVING - EARLY MORNING

           Two rangers attend to Joseph -- Amos holds Gunner -- they 
           bounce along the rough forest road, holding OXYGEN MASKS to 
           their faces.

                                 NEWSCASTER (PRELAP)
                        After a long night of evacuating 
                        homes and setting up fire barriers, 
                        the Wild Horse Fire is under 
                        control.

           CLOSE ON TELEVISION SCREEN

                                 NEWSCASTER (CONT’D)
                        There have been no casualties and 
                        only minor property damage from the 
                        sudden and powerful brush fire. 

           EXT. WILD HORSE FOREST - MORNING

           FOREST SERVICE WORKERS spray the remaining embers with water 
           and red fire retardant. 

                                 NEWSCASTER (V.O.)
                        But most of the beautiful forest 
                        has been burned, and will take 
                        decades to regrow.

           EXT. WILD HORSE FOREST - DAY

           Now a black, barren forest. 
           The lake littered with ash and debris. The Water Man’s hut 
           reduced to smouldering ashes -- BLACK OBSIDIAN STONES the 
           only remaining evidence of its existence...

           INT. GUNNER’S ROOM - DAY

           Gunner’s eyes open lethargically --

           Soft sunlight streams in. His parents’ MUFFLED VOICES waft 
           from the kitchen. A child safe at home. 

                                 MARY (O.S.)
                        I’m going to check on him. 

           Her footsteps pad down the hallway -- she peeks her head in.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                             (seeing him awake)
                        Gunner!

           She goes to his bed -- a SCARF covers her bare head -- she’s 
           gaunt, but seeing her boy awake brings color to her cheeks. 

                                 GUNNER
                        Mom!

           He sits up and wraps his arms around her -- she holds his 
           head to her chest, clutching him close. TEARS fall down her 
           cheeks.

                                 MARY
                        My baby... you’re safe. You’re 
                        home.

                                 GUNNER
                        I messed up, Mom. I tried to save 
                        you and I... I messed up...
                             (burying his face into 
                              her)
                        I’m sorry! I’m so sorry!

                                 MARY
                        Gunner...

           She pulls him back, looking into his eyes. She sniffs and 
           wipes a tear away --

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        Remember what I told you? About 
                        heaven and hell?

                                 GUNNER
                        We make our own here on Earth...
                                 MARY
                        Exactly. And I couldn’t ask for a 
                        better heaven. I got a husband who 
                        loves me. A son who will do 
                        anything to help me, even go off 
                        into the woods.

           A smile forms on Gunner’s lips.

           INT. HALLWAY RIGHT OUTSIDE GUNNER’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Amos listens outside the door --

                                 MARY (O.S.)
                        And this son of mine... he’s so 
                        smart. Reads books I never even 
                        heard of. Even writing one himself.

           Amos’s lips curl in a small, wistful smile.

           INT. GUNNER’S ROOM - DAY

           She strokes Gunner’s hair tenderly.

                                 MARY
                        And I know that both my darling 
                        husband and amazing son are going 
                        to be okay, no matter what happens.

           She smiles -- Gunner snuggles in her arms. 

           A KNOCK on the door -- Amos steps in, a bit tentative. 

                                 AMOS
                        Hey, Gunner. 

                                 GUNNER
                        Hey... Dad.

           Awkward. Amos clears his throat --

                                 AMOS
                        I, uh... I found this in the woods...

           He extends the crumpled-up page from Gunner’s graphic novel. 
           Gunner takes it.

                                 AMOS (CONT’D)
                        I... I just wanted you to know, I 
                        have an idea. For the ending of 
                        Detective Knoxx.
           Gunner’s face lights up --

                                 GUNNER
                        You... you read my story?

                                 AMOS
                             (tearing up)
                        Yeah... It’s really... really good, 
                        Gunner. The best thing I’ve ever 
                        read.

           Gunner beams --

                                 GUNNER
                        What’s your idea?

           Amos comes over and sits on the bed. 

                                 AMOS
                        Well, so Detective Knoxx is walking 
                        into a crime scene, but what if... 
                        what if it isn’t the crime scene of 
                        his murder... 

           Mary keeps one arm around Gunner, the other grabbing Amos’s 
           hand. 

           EXT. DOUBLE WIDE TRAILER HOME - DAY

           The rickety screen door opens -- Joseph, back to full health, 
           bounds out of the trailer, hoisting a DUFFEL BAG over his 
           shoulder. 

           Deputy Gray and a CHILD PROTECTIVE SERVICES REP (40s) follow 
           Joseph out of the trailer.

                                 AMOS (V.O.)
                        What if it’s the crime scene of the 
                        case he never closed, died trying 
                        to solve...

           George Riley watches from behind the screen door, a cold, 
           bitter expression plastered on his face.

           EXT. WILLOW SPUR BASEBALL FIELD - DAY

           Joseph, suited up with a BALL and GLOVE, warms up his 
           throwing arm on the pitcher’s mound -- 
                                 AMOS (V.O.)
                        And when he goes in, he’s a ghost, 
                        right, so he can slip through 
                        walls...

           Gunner has the BAT, preparing to swing. Amos plays catcher, 
           his glove ready for Joseph’s throw. 

                                 GUNNER (V.O.)
                        And there’s a clue inside the wall!

           Joseph throws the ball -- Gunner HITS IT -- it flies a couple 
           feet -- a SMILE breaks across Gunner’s face.

                                 AMOS (V.O.)
                        Exactly.

           SWEEPING ACROSS THE MONTANA WILDERNESS

           The forest is burnt and dead for acres.

                                 GUNNER (V.O.)
                        And that clue, that leads him to 
                        find the murderer of the crime he 
                        was investigating!

           THE SEASONS PASS IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE -- WHITE SNOW 
           blankets the BLACK ASH -- then the snow melts away.

           EXT. FLATHEAD COUNTY CEMETERY - DAY

           Mary’s FUNERAL -- springtime flowers bloom. The cemetery is 
           PACKED WITH MOURNERS.

           Gunner and Amos stand side-by-side. Tears streak down their 
           face as Mary’s COFFIN is lowered into the ground. 

                                 AMOS (V.O.)
                        And maybe, maybe he doesn’t even 
                        find his body... maybe at that 
                        point, it doesn’t matter anymore.

           Amos wraps his arm around Gunner. 

           INT. GUNNER’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - EVENING

           Amos helps Gunner bind the FINISHED GRAPHIC NOVEL. 

                                 AMOS (V.O.)
                        He finished his purpose. And that 
                        lets his soul be free. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 AMOS (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        And he lets himself leave the Earth 
                        after that, no longer a lonely 
                        ghost.

           They laugh, comfortable and happy together.

           EXT. WILLOW SPUR K-12 SCHOOL - DAY

           First day back at the small rural school -- buses and kids 
           pour in from all directions. 

                                 GUNNER (V.O.)
                        I love it, Dad. 

           Gunner and Joseph stand outside the front steps, selling the 
           finished graphic novel.

                                 AMOS (V.O.)
                        Really?

                                 GUNNER (V.O.)
                        You wanna... You wanna write it 
                        with me?

           Two GIRLS (11-12) come up and buy the graphic novel -- one 
           dollar each. One of the girls smiles at Gunner. 

           Gunner beams -- Joseph elbows him playfully.

           EXT. WILD HORSE LAKE - DAY

           The lake is surrounded by barren, burnt land and trees -- 
           obsidian rocks the only evidence of the Water Man’s hut. 

                                 AMOS (V.O.)
                        I’d love that more than anything, 
                        Gunner.

           From below the ashes, A SPRIG OF GREEN GROWS.

                                         THE END.
