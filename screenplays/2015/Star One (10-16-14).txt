           EXT. MOUNTAINS - DAY

           The rugged mountains of Northern Mongolia. Cold wind blows 
           across harsh, unforgiving terrain. Snow-capped peaks gleam in 
           stark contrast to the deep blue sky. 

           SUPER:        MONGOLIA/RUSSIA BORDER 

           DOUGLAS MACKIERNAN (30’s, chiseled features under weeks of 
           stubble) sits by a smoldering campfire, whittling a... 

           WOOD CARVING of a LITTLE GIRL ON A PONY. He works delicately 
           with a Bowie knife, adding detail to the girl’s face. He’s no 
           Degas, but there’s love in it. 

           MacKiernan checks his watch, then lays the carving down and 
           peers north through a TELESCOPE. What’s he looking at?

           The CRACK of a twig nearby. 

           MacKiernan whips out a HANDGUN and aims.

           A SKINNY MOUNTAIN GOAT wanders out of the brush. MacKiernan 
           lowers the gun.

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Hello, Martin.

           The goat stares at a plate of BOILED BEETS near MacKiernan.

                                 MACKIERNAN (CONT’D)
                        Don’t even think about it. If you 
                        get meat on your bones, our 
                        relationship will take a turn you 
                        won’t like.
           A CHIRP from a MILITARY RADIO startles the goat.

                                 MACKIERNAN (CONT’D)
                        Hold that thought.

            MacKiernan puts on a set of EARPHONES and flips a switch.

                                 MACKIERNAN (CONT’D)
                        Echo bravo, Bird’s Nest. I read 
                        your ping. Switching to five. 
                            (turns a knob)
                        Confirming five, do you read, over?  

           The goat nibbles at the beets. MacKiernan kicks DIRT at it.

                                 MACKIERNAN (CONT’D)
                        What did I just tell you?
                              (into radio)
                        Negative, Echo Bravo. No signs of 
                        thunder. Skies are clear, over. 
                            (listens)
                        Copy that. Bird’s nest out.

           He pulls off the headset and points at the goat.

                                 MACKIERNAN (CONT’D)
                        And YOU...

           A WHITE FLASH SUDDENLY ILLUMINATES THE ENTIRE SKY. A 
           SHOCKWAVE SLAMS MacKiernan onto his back, hard, whipping his 
           skin with flying dirt and rocks!

           The goat runs away, terrified! MacKiernan scrambles to his 
           knees and stares north in shock at...

           ...a MASSIVE NUCLEAR MUSHROOM CLOUD rising in the distance 
           across the Russian border, expanding high over the tundra 
           like an angry God, spewing radioactive dust into the sky. 

           It’s Russia’s first nuclear test, and it’s terrifying.

           MacKiernan yanks on the headset and flips a switch. 

                                 MACKIERNAN (CONT’D)
                        Echo bravo, we have thunder! I 
                        repeat, we have thunder! 

           MacKiernan grabs a CAMERA and begins snapping PHOTOS of the 
           massive MUSHROOM CLOUD in the distance, disturbed.

           At his feet, the wood carving of the little girl on the pony 
           lies in the coals of the campfire, burning ominously...

           INT. NATE’S HOUSE - DAY

           NATE FELLOWS (29, CIA analyst) shaves in front of a mirror.

                                 NATE
                        It is my belief that Tibet... 
                            (frowns, rephrases)
                        All available intel suggests that 
                        Tibet...
                            (grim)
                        Mr. Director, Tibet is about to be 
                        invaded by communist forces.

           EXT. SUBURBAN HOME - DAY

           Nate walks out his front door and picks up his paper. He sees 
           his NEIGHBOR’S KID playing in the yard.

                                 NATE
                        Shouldn’t you be at school?

                                 NEIGHBOR’S KID
                        Mommy says no school because of the 
                        Bomb.

           Confused, Nate unfolds his newspaper. On the cover is 
           MACKIERNAN’S NUKE PHOTO and the headline...

                         “Russians have The Bomb”

           Nate looks down the street, seeing families packing up their 
           cars nervously. In the distance is the WASHINGTON MONUMENT.

           EXT. WASHINGTON D.C STREET - DAY

           Nate drives through a city gripped in fear. People walk with 
           their noses in newspapers, others are glued to TV sets in 
           store windows. Nate turns on NEWS RADIO...

                                 JOSEPH MCCARTHY (O.S.)
                        ...this is the direct result of the 
                        administration’s weakness in the 
                        face of Russian aggression. When 
                        Stalin occupied Ukraine, this 
                        president did nothing. A madman has 
                        the Bomb now, because we lacked the 
                        backbone to stop him... 
           Nate pulls up to the gate of the CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE AGENCY 
           (pre-Langley) and shows his ID badge to a Guard.

           INT. DIRECTOR BEDELL’S OFFICE - DAY

           Nate is led into a wood-paneled office, where WALTER BEDELL 
           SMITH (50s, CIA Director) shakes his hand and introduces TWO 
           MEN seated on sofa, smoking cigarettes.

                                 WALTER
                        Nate, this is Donald Dawson, the 
                        President’s Chief of Staff, and I’m 
                        sure you recognize Secretary of 
                        State Dean Acheson. 

                                 DAWSON
                        You believe Tibet is about to be 
                        attacked by communist forces?

                                 NATE
                        Yes sir, I do. 

           Dawson gestures - let’s hear it. Nate clears his throat, 
           moves to a WORLD MAP on the wall and points to China.

                                 NATE (CONT’D)
                        The civil war in China is nearing 
                        an end. With the Soviets backing 
                        Mao’s communists, it won’t be long 
                        until he takes the whole country. I 
                        believe that an invasion of Tibet 
                        will follow immediately.

                                 ACHESON
                        Why?

                                 NATE
                        Because the greatest obstacle to 
                        communism isn’t capitalism, it’s 
                        religion. That’s why Stalin leveled 
                        every church and synagogue in 
                        Russia and executed anyone who 
                        resisted. The State is their faith.
                            (beat)
                        Stalin wants to unite ALL of Asia 
                        under communist rule, but he has a 
                        major problem - 90 million 
                        Buddhists. It makes no sense to 
                        kill them all when they can simply 
                        eradicate Buddhism with one move, 
                        which is already in motion. 
                                 DAWSON
                        How do you eradicate a religion?

                                 NATE
                        You destroy its leadership and its 
                        holiest place, which happen to be 
                        in the same location. 
                            (points to..)
                        Lhasa, Tibet, home of the Dalai 
                        Lama. When Mao wins his civil war, 
                        which will be any day now, look 
                        where his army will be. 

           He points to the region along the China/Tibet border.

                                 NATE (CONT’D)
                        That’s no accident. Tibet is 
                        defenseless and unaware. Leveling 
                        Lhasa and killing the Dalai Lama 
                        solves their religion problem once 
                        and for all. It’ll be a massacre, 
                        and it will be soon.

                                 DAWSON
                            (to Walter)
                        The President will not go to war 
                        over Tibet.

                                 WALTER
                        He doesn’t have to. Tibet has to go 
                        to war over Tibet. 

                                 DAWSON
                        They’re a 16th-century backwater 
                        with nothing but mountains and 
                        monks. They don’t stand a chance.

                                 WALTER
                        They do if we arm them.

           Silence in the room. They may not know it yet, but this is 
           the moment the modern CIA is born. 

                                 ACHESON
                        How do we arm Stalin’s enemies 
                        without sparking a nuclear 
                        conflict?

                                 WALTER
                        We send someone in complete secrecy 
                        to convince the Dalai Lama that the 
                        invasion is coming and that we’re 
                        willing to help him prepare for 
                        war.
                                 ACHESON
                        The Dalai Lama is a fifteen year-
                        old Buddhist pacifist. That’s going 
                        to be a tough sell. 

                                 NATE
                        I know a man who could do it. 
                            (they all look over at him)
                        But he’s going to be an even 
                        tougher sell. 

                                                               FADE TO:

           EXT. MONGOLIAN STEPPES - EVENING

           Endless fields of grass stretch to infinity in the golden 
           light of sunset.

           SUPER:
                             Anar, Mongolia
                   20 miles north of the Chinese border

           Standing in the waist-high grass is FRANK BESSAC (29, 
           American, intellectual, goatee). 

           Frank is BLINDFOLDED.

                                 FRANK
                        Hello?

           The tall grass around him RUSTLES - something is moving 
           stealthily around him, stalking him.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        I know you’re there. 

           Another rustle. Frank spins, then GRABS blindly...

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Gotcha!

           ...but gets nothing but air. Behind him, a ten year-old 
           Mongolian Girl (ASCHA) pops up out of the grass and WHACKS 
           Frank across the thigh with a RIDING CROP.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Ow, crap! 
                            (yanks off the blindfold)
                        Okay, that’s enough. We’re done. 
           FIVE MONGOLIAN KIDS rise out of the grass, laughing 
           hysterically. Frank rubs his sore thigh.

                                 ASCHA
                        No, is game!

                                 FRANK
                        I don’t think so, Ascha, I think 
                        you’re playing a joke on me.
                            (the kids laugh, busted)
                        Let’s get back to the English 
                        lesson, okay? 

           A distant, ominous RUMBLE makes them all go silent. 

           Frank pulls on a pair of THICK GLASSES and peers south. 

           An ORANGE GLOW flashes on the horizon, followed by another 
           deep rumble. 

           It’s distant ARTILLERY - the unmistakable sounds of WAR. The 
           kids shrink back, scared.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        It’s all right. It’s far away.

                                 MONGOLIAN BOY
                        Who is fighting?

                                 FRANK
                        That’s a good question. What 
                        country is to the south?

                                 MONGOLIAN BOY
                        China.

                                 FRANK
                        That’s right. The people of China 
                        are fighting each other. It’s 
                        called a civil war. My country went 
                        through one too. 

                                 ASCHA
                        Are we safe here?

           Frank is conflicted how to answer, as another RUMBLE shakes 
           the earth. 

           Frank hears a WHISTLE and sees PRINCE DE (40, Oxford-educated 
           Mongolian royalty) atop a horse on a nearby hilltop. De 
           gestures to Frank to approach.
                                 FRANK
                            (to the kids)
                        Back to your yurts, all of you.

           The kids run off, as Frank walks over to Prince De. 

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        The artillery sounds closer than 
                        usual, De. 

                                 PRINCE DE
                        Mao’s revolution is bleeding over 
                        our borders.
                            (spits)
                        Hell with him. Come, eat with me. 

           De rides off, but Frank lingers on the hilltop, noticing the 
           SUNSET over the endless hills of grass. The view is STUNNING.  

           Frank slowly takes off his glasses and looks out again.

           Without his glasses, IT’S ALL A BLUR. Green beneath orange, 
           like a Rothko painting. No detail at all.  

           Frank stares for a moment, concerned, then puts his glasses 
           back on and heads off after Prince De.

           INT. YURT OF PRINCE DE - NIGHT

           Mongolian men in wool garments are gathered in the yurt. The 
           air is thick with the smoke of torches and tobacco. 

           Frank sits in the back as Prince De addresses the men (in 
           Mongolian).

                                 PRINCE DE
                        China has dictated our destiny for 
                        too long, but now they are 
                        embroiled in civil war. It is time 
                        for Mongolia to be free.

           A Mongolian man, TUKA (40’s, fierce) rises to his feet.

                                 TUKA
                        Communism is the future, Prince. By 
                        resisting, you lead your people to 
                        certain death.

                                 PRINCE DE
                        Only a coward would rather be alive 
                        than free, Tuka.
                                 TUKA
                            (points at Frank, livid)
                        You have allowed this American spy 
                        to poison your mind. 

           Frank looks around, uncomfortable. The others shout angrily 
           at Tuka and throw food, forcing Tuka to retreat outside. De 
           slumps onto a cushion by Frank and pours himself some wine.

                                 FRANK
                        You’re going to get me killed, De. 
                        Your people think I’m some sort of 
                        secret agent.

                                 PRINCE DE
                        Are you not?

                                 FRANK
                        I’m an anthropologist. 
                            (off De’s skepticism)
                        Why would I lie?

                                 PRINCE DE
                        Because first word in secret agent 
                        is “secret.” 
                            (leans in, whispers)
                        You are CIA, Frank Bessac. I have a 
                        sense for these things. So when are 
                        we going to talk like men?

           Frank meets his eyes, serious.

                                 FRANK
                        You don’t want anything to do with 
                        the CIA, De. And neither do I. So 
                        don’t ever ask me that again.
                            (De frowns, unconvinced)
                        All I’m doing is seeing cultures 
                        like yours while they’re still 
                        here...
                            (re: his eyes)
                        ...while I still can. That’s it.

           De studies him carefully, weighing Frank’s honesty.

                                 PRINCE DE
                        Agh, you are scholar and useless to 
                        me. 

           Frank smiles and sips his wine.
           EXT. MONGOLIAN STEPPES - NIGHT

           Tuka walks angrily away from the yurt up a grassy slope to 
           where TEN HORSEMEN sit astride their horses, holding rifles 
           and torches.

           A BLACK CAR rests behind them in the moonlight. In the car 
           sits MARKO DUROV (40s, KGB to the core), barely visible 
           except for the glowing tip of his cigarette.  

           Tuka meets Marko’s eyes and shakes his head.

           Marko flicks his cigarette and gestures - do it. Tuka swings 
           himself onto a horse, grabbing a RIFLE from the saddle.

                                 TUKA
                        Hya!

           Tuka and the ten horsemen GALLOP DOWN toward the yurt.

           INT. YURT OF PRINCE DE - CONTINUOUS

           Frank and Prince De feel a VIBRATION shaking the ground. 

                                 FRANK
                        What the hell is that?

           De yanks back a tent-flap and peers into the night, seeing 
           Tuka and his horsemen GALLOPING toward them, rifles raised!

                                 PRINCE DE
                            (in MONGOLIAN)
                        To arms!

           Everyone in the yurt leaps to their feet, drawing weapons. 
           Frank looks around, alarmed.

           EXT. MONGOLIAN STEPPES - NIGHT

           Tuka and the horsemen HURL TORCHES onto the yurt, setting it 
           ablaze, then OPEN FIRE with their rifles.

           INT. YURT OF PRINCE DE - NIGHT

           Frank dives to the ground as BULLETS RIP through the animal-
           skin walls of the yurt! A Mongolian man is struck and falls 
           next to him. The smoke is thick, the fire is spreading.

           Prince De grabs Frank, and the two men squeeze UNDER the yak-
           skin wall of the yurt, out into...
           THE COLD NIGHT

           The yurt is now fully afire. Prince De and Frank sprint away, 
           but Tuka and another RIDER catch up. Tuka SLASHES at De with 
           a curved sword, sending him crashing to the ground. 

           Frank looks back, realizing De is no longer with him. 

                                 FRANK
                        De!

           Tuka jumps from his horse and stands over Prince De. He draws 
           a pistol... and SHOOTS Prince De.

           Frank is horrified. Tuka then spots Frank and points.

                                 TUKA
                            (in Mongolian)
                        Kill the American.

           Frank takes off running, as Tuka and the other rider jump on 
           their horses and give chase. Frank reaches a STEEP, ROCKY 
           RAVINE and skids to a stop. DEAD END.

           There’s nothing but open tundra in every other direction, and 
           the horsemen are almost on him!

           Frank looks down the steep slope, terrified... 

           ...then LEAPS! Frank tumbles down the hill, slamming over 
           unforgiving rocks.

           The horsemen try to follow Frank down the slope, but their 
           horses resist, whinnying angrily. 

           Frank SLAMS to the bottom of the hill and looks up slowly. 
           One of his glasses lenses has cracked. 

           He meets eyes with Tuka at the top of the slope, then limps 
           away into the night. 

                                                               FADE TO:

           EXT. RURAL ROAD - DAY

           Frank, battered and bruised, walks along a dirt road, as 
           Mongolian families hurry past, carrying all of their worldly 
           possessions with them. It’s a country in chaos.

           Frank suddenly notices TUKA and THREE HORSEMEN riding down a 
           hillside in the distance. They begin scanning the refugees, 
           looking for him. 
           Frank quickly pulls his robe up over his head and tries to 
           blend in with the others. Reaching the crest of a hill, his 
           eyes go wide with relief at seeing... 

                                 FRANK
                        Oh thank God...

           A SMALL AIRFIELD at the bottom of the hill with a single 
           PLANE on the runway! He taps a MONGOLIAN MAN on the arm.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                            (in Mongolian)
                        Do you know where that plane is 
                        going?

                                 MONGOLIAN MAN
                        Away from here. 

                                 FRANK
                        Good enough for me. 

           Frank hurries down the hill and moves through THRONGS OF 
           REFUGEES pounding on the airfield’s gate, trying to get in. 

           An ARMED GUARD with a machine gun keeps everyone back. Frank 
           sees Tuka and his men drawing closer. He’s out of time.  

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                            (to Guard, in Mongolian)
                        Please, I need to get through.

           The Guard isn’t moved. Frank pulls out a WAD OF CASH.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        I have money.

           The crowd goes silent at seeing the cash, which is more than 
           any of them make in a year. Frank pales... CRAP. 

           The crowd RUSHES AT FRANK, and he takes off running. But 
           there’s nowhere to go, just more fucking hills. 

           Tuka hears the commotion and sees Frank running from the mob. 

                                 TUKA
                            (in Mongolian)
                        There! Go!

           Frank, sprinting, sees the horsemen galloping toward him. 

           He THROWS HIS CASH into the air, and the crowd descends on 
           the cloud of money, blocking Tuka’s way. 

           Frank runs hard, knowing he only bought himself seconds...
                                 MACKIERNAN (O.S.)
                        You spend like my ex-wife. 

           Frank is stunned to see a PACKARD CONVERTIBLE keeping pace 
           with him. MacKiernan is at the wheel, wearing sunglasses.

                                 FRANK
                        Are you American???

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        As baseball. Get in.

           Frank DIVES into the car. MacKiernan floors it, weaving 
           through refugee tents, as the horsemen gallop in pursuit. 
           Tuka raises a rifle and FIRES, barely missing! MacKiernan 
           holds out a HANDGUN to Frank.

                                 MACKIERNAN (CONT’D)
                        Here, shoot back.
                            (off Frank’s surprise)
                        It’s what you do in a gunfight, 
                        Frank. 

                                 FRANK
                        How do you know my name?

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Lucky guess. 
                            (cocks the gun)
                        Fine, steer.

           MacKiernan lets go of the wheel and FIRES BACK at the 
           horsemen, as Frank struggles to steer the speeding car.

                                 FRANK
                        Who the hell are you?

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Doug MacKiernan. Call me Mac.
                            (points ahead)
                        Mule, Frank.

                                 FRANK
                        What?

           Frank looks ahead and PALES - they’re about to hit a MULE 
           laden with suitcases! Frank VEERS, barely missing it. The 
           mule rears up, suitcases spilling from its back. 

           Tuka and the horsemen race past the mule in pursuit, gaining 
           ground on the car. 

           MacKiernan FIRES, sending one of the horsemen toppling off 
           his horse, dead. He points ahead.
                                 MACKIERNAN
                        There, get on that road south.

                                 FRANK
                        South is China!

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        So?

                                 FRANK
                        There’s a WAR in China!

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Yeah, God forbid we get shot at.

           Tuka FIRES, shattering their windshield!

                                 FRANK
                        South it is.

           Frank steers toward the paved road, weaving through refugees.

           MacKiernan UNLOADS on the horsemen behind them, sending two 
           more toppling into the dust. Only Tuka remains in pursuit.

           MacKiernan aims at Tuka, but... CLICK. His gun’s EMPTY.

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Shit. 

           Tuka grins coldly, WHIPS his horse for more speed and raises 
           his rifle for the kill shot. 

           MacKiernan sees Frank about to steer around a RICKETY WATER 
           TOWER, but...

           ...MacKiernan grabs the wheel and CRASHES THEM THROUGH one of 
           the tower’s wooden supports, covering them with wood shards! 

                                 FRANK
                        Jesus!

           The water tower CRASHES to the ground, sending a TIDAL WAVE 
           OF WATER into Tuka, blasting him off his horse.

           MacKiernan thumps back down into the driver’s seat, grinning, 
           then steers the car over an embankment onto the PAVED ROAD. 

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Airports. Always a nightmare.

           Frank looks at him in disbelief. The car speeds down the 
           isolated road in the afternoon sun. 
           MacKiernan reaches into the back seat and grabs a...

                                 MACKIERNAN (CONT’D)
                        Beer?

                                 FRANK
                        No, I don’t want a beer! I want you 
                        to tell me what the hell’s going 
                        on!

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        We’re crossing the border into 
                        China. We’ll be safe in the 
                        American Consulate.

                                 FRANK
                        Like hell we will. The Consul’s 
                        probably long gone by now. Or dead.

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Consul’s sitting right next to you, 
                        Frank. 

                                 FRANK
                        You?

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Yeah, me. I’ve got flags on my car, 
                        for God’s sake.

           Sure enough, there are small AMERICAN FLAGS flapping on the 
           hood. Frank studies MacKiernan suspiciously.

                                 FRANK
                        What were you doing at that 
                        airport?

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Saving your ass. You’re welcome, by 
                        the way.

                                 FRANK
                        How did you know I’d be there?

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        You’re an American in a country 
                        that’s collapsing. That screams 
                        “airport”.

                                 FRANK
                        No, pull over. Whatever this is, I 
                        want no part of it.
                            (MacKiernan ignores him)
                        Stop the car!
           MacKiernan reluctantly stops the car, and Frank gets out.

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Where you gonna go, Frank? You’re 
                        in bumfuck Mongolia and you threw 
                        all your money away.
                            (re: Tuka)
                        You think that asshole will stop 
                        hunting you because he got wet?

           Frank walks away from the car.

                                 MACKIERNAN (CONT’D)
                        Oregon. 

                                 FRANK
                        Is that supposed to mean something 
                        to me?

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Yep.

           Frank looks off, frowning.

                                 FRANK
                        I knew it. You’re CIA.

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        So are you. 

                                 FRANK
                        No, I’m ex-CIA. I quit.

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        A situation’s come up. You’ve been 
                        re-activated. 

                                 FRANK
                        That’s not how it works!

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        That is how it works. “Re-
                        activated” means you weren’t 
                        active, and now you are. So say the 
                        response, Frank. 

           Frank shakes his head and keeps walking.

                                 MACKIERNAN (CONT’D)
                        I have a plane.

           Frank stops, reluctantly tempted. 
                                 MACKIERNAN (CONT’D)
                        You help me with one small thing, 
                        and I’ll fly you anywhere you want. 
                        Deal?

                                 FRANK
                        And if I say no?

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        I stuff you in the trunk and we go 
                        anyway. 

           MacKiernan again holds out the BEER with a smile. 

           Frank reluctantly takes the beer and gets into the car. They 
           roar away down the road in a cloud of dust. 

           EXT. BORDER CROSSING - DAY

           The convertible weaves through refugees as they approach a 
           CHINESE BORDER STATION.

                                 FRANK
                        I don’t have any papers, they won’t 
                        let me through.

                                 MACKIERNAN
                            (points)
                        Who, them?

           Frank sees DEAD CHINESE SOLDIERS hanging by their necks from 
           the border gate, then realizes the border station is BURNED 
           OUT and riddled with bullet holes.

                                 FRANK
                        Jesus...

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Welcome to the new communist 
                        utopia.

           As they drive through, MacKiernan flicks his cigarette, 
           bouncing it off of a POSTER of CHAIRMAN MAO’s face.

           EXT. URUMQI CITY - AMERICAN CONSULATE - EVENING

           MacKiernan steers the convertible through deserted streets. 
           Loudspeakers spout Communist Revolution propaganda.

           They pull up to the gate of the 
           AMERICAN CONSULATE, a colonial mansion that’s beat to hell. 
           The gate is wide open, the lock broken off. All of the 
           windows of the consulate are SHATTERED. 

                                 FRANK
                        You live here?

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        I evacuated when that picture of 
                        the Soviet nuke came out. The KGB 
                        is slitting throats to find the guy 
                        who took it.   

                                 FRANK
                        Wouldn’t want to be him. They’re 
                        gonna nail his ass to the roof of 
                        the Kremlin.

                                 MACKIERNAN
                            (grins proudly)
                        Gotta catch him first.

           Frank’s face falls, realizing...

                                 FRANK
                        Oh shit.

           INT. AMERICAN CONSULATE - EVENING

           MacKiernan leads Frank through the vandalized interior of the 
           consulate. Frank reaches for a LIGHT SWITCH, but...

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Jesus, do you have a shred of 
                        situational awareness?

                                 FRANK
                        I was a paratrooper in the war. I 
                        saw combat.

                                 MACKIERNAN
                            (re: glasses)
                        I’m surprised you saw anything 
                        through those things. 

                                 FRANK
                        I didn’t need them then. 

           MacKiernan stops and studies him.

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        You go from no glasses to those in 
                        five years? How blind are you?
                                 FRANK
                        If my eyesight isn’t up to your 
                        standards, I’m happy to be on my 
                        way.
                            (MacKiernan waits for an 
                              answer)
                        I have nerve damage. My sight will 
                        be gone within a year. Anything 
                        else you want to know?

           MacKiernan frowns, concerned.

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Let’s just do the job quickly and 
                        get out of here. 

                                 FRANK
                        What job?

           MacKiernan pulls on a BOOKSHELF, which slowly opens, 
           revealing a HIDDEN VAULT DOOR behind it.

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Housecleaning.
                            (nods to a FIREPLACE)
                        Get a fire going. 

                                 FRANK
                        With what?

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        You’re in a library. Figure it out. 

           MacKiernan unlocks the heavy vault door and swings it open, 
           disappearing inside. Curious, Frank follows MacKiernan into..

           THE VAULT

           One wall is lined with WEAPONS. Colt handguns, Browning 
           machine guns, grenades, M1 Carbines - a fucking arsenal. 

                                 FRANK
                        Holy shit.

           MacKiernan moves to a wall of FILE CABINETS. He pulls out 
           stacks of sensitive CIA papers and hands them to Frank.

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Burn it all. 
           TIME CUT

           It’s later. Top-Secret documents and photos smolder in the 
           fireplace. Frank eats beans from a dusty can as MacKiernan 
           stacks GUNS on a dolly. 

                                 FRANK
                        What are we doing with those?

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        They’re coming with us. 

           Frank then notices a FRAMED PHOTO on the wall and examines 
           it.

           It shows a LITTLE GIRL sitting on a pony, with MacKiernan 
           holding the pony’s rope. Someone else was in the photo, but 
           they’ve been awkwardly CUT OUT with scissors. 

                                 FRANK
                        Is that your daughter?

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Gail. She’s crazy about ponies. At 
                        least, she was four years ago.

           Frank points to the CUT-OUT HOLE in the photo.

                                 FRANK
                        Wife? 
                            (Mac frowns)
                        You two seem happy. How can you 
                        stay over here when you have a 
                        beautiful daughter back home? 

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        It’s because I have a daughter back 
                        home. 

                                 FRANK
                        Keep telling yourself that.

           MacKiernan frowns and puts the photo in his bag.

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        If you want a family so bad, Frank, 
                        go make your own. 

                                 FRANK
                        That’s not in the cards for me 
                        anymore, I’ll be blind soon.
                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Being blind makes your dick fall 
                        off?

                                 FRANK
                        It might as well. 

           MacKiernan pulls a book off a shelf and is about to burn it, 
           when...

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Wait, don’t. 

           Frank takes the book from him and examines it. 

           It’s a leatherbound copy of “WAR AND PEACE” by Tolstoy. Frank 
           runs his hand over the cover, feeling the leather. 

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Always wanted to read this. I 
                        probably should, while I still can. 

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Burn it, it’s dead weight. 

                                 FRANK
                            (re: the weapons)
                        No, twenty machine guns for two 
                        people is dead weight. 

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Not where we’re going. 

                                 FRANK
                        An airfield?

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Haven’t had the best luck with 
                        airfields, Frank.

           Frank stares at the guns, concerned.

                                 FRANK
                        If I leave the consulate with you 
                        in a car full of guns, Mac, I’m 
                        committing a hostile act against a 
                        foreign power. 

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Got a problem with that?

                                 FRANK
                        If it means getting executed.
                                 MACKIERNAN
                        That’s the risk you take in war. 

                                 FRANK
                        We’re not at war. 

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Like hell we aren’t. 

           The CREAK of a floorboard. MacKiernan puts a finger to his 
           lips, then quietly picks up an M-1 Carbine machine gun. 

           He tosses a HANDGUN to Frank, then gestures - come on. 

           HALLWAY

           MacKiernan and Frank move down the hallway, guns raised.

           They reach a landing overlooking the GRAND STAIRCASE. 
           MacKiernan peers down, but sees no one. 

           A GUN emerges from a dark doorway and presses to MacKiernan’s 
           head. 

                                 MACKIERNAN (CONT’D)
                            (slowly raises hands)
                        Okay, easy there... 
                            (under his breath)
                        Little help, Frank?

           MacKiernan glances back at Frank, but Frank is frozen in 
           place - someone else has a gun to Frank’s head.

                                 MACKIERNAN (CONT’D)
                        Or not. 

           The man aiming at MacKiernan steps into view. He is VASILI 
           ZVANSOV (41, Russian, bearded, clad in thick furs).

                                 VASILI
                            (in Russian)
                        I smell your fire for miles.

                                 MACKIERNAN
                            (in flawless RUSSIAN)
                        I smell your mother from even 
                        further.

           Vasili grins, and so does MacKiernan. The two men EMBRACE. 
           Frank watches, confused.

                                 VASILI
                            (in Russian, re: Frank)
                        Who is your friend?
                                 MACKIERNAN
                        That’s Frank. Say hi, Frank.

                                 FRANK
                        Hi..?

           The Russian behind Frank lowers his weapon. Frank now sees 
           that the “man” behind him is actually a YOUNG BOY. 

           He is LEO ZVANSOV (13, Vasili’s SON, dressed in furs).

                                 VASILI
                            (in Russian)
                        Is your friend CIA too?

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        I don’t know, Frank, are you CIA?
                            (off Frank’s look)
                        Frank’s in denial. 

                                 FRANK
                        What the hell’s going on here?

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        This is Vasili, a friend of mine. 
                        You speak Russian?

                                 FRANK
                        No.

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Good. You’ll get along fine. 

           INT. AMERICAN CONSULATE - LIBRARY - NIGHT

           Leo warms his hands by the fire as Vasili inventories the 
           weapons. Frank approaches MacKiernan, speaking low...

                                 FRANK
                        You’re collaborating with Russians?

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        They’re White Russians, Frank. Anti-
                        Communist exiles. They’re going to 
                        take us where we’re going. 

           MacKiernan yanks back a RUG revealing A FLOOR SAFE. He 
           swivels the dials and pulls open the heavy door, revealing...

                                 FRANK
                        Dear god... 
           GOLD BARS - dozens of them - gleaming like a pirate’s 
           treasure in the flickering firelight.

           Leo and Vasili begin loading the gold into suitcases.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        I’m an idiot for waving cash 
                        around, but you’re okay with 
                        lugging gold bars through a war 
                        zone?

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        I’m not leaving it for the Commies, 
                        Frank. You know, if you helped as 
                        much as you bitch, this would go 
                        quicker. 

           Vasili says something to Leo in Russian.

                                 LEO
                            (in broken English)
                        Father ask why you no follow 
                        orders.

                                 FRANK
                        Because I quit. 

           Leo translates for Vasili, who mutters a response.

                                 LEO
                        Father say, “A man does not quit 
                        being a spy. But sometimes a spy 
                        quits being a man.”

                                 FRANK
                            (gives Vasili the FINGER)
                        You understand this? 

           Vasili chuckles. The men zip up the suitcases of gold. 

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Let’s get going, we need to reach 
                        the mountains before dark.

                                 FRANK
                        I thought we’re going to a plane.

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Plane’s in the mountains, Frank. 

           MacKiernan turns to leave, but Frank grabs his arm.
                                 FRANK
                        I don’t think there is a plane. I’m 
                        not going anywhere with you.

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Suit yourself. 

           MacKiernan pulls out a Zippo and SETS THE CURTAINS ON FIRE. 
           Flames RACE UPWARDS, spreading quickly!

                                 MACKIERNAN (CONT’D)
                        How about now?

           Frank, stunned, follows MacKiernan and the others out of the 
           burning room. 

           EXT. AMERICAN CONSULATE - DRIVEWAY - NIGHT

           MacKiernan, Frank and Vasili carry heavy suitcases of gold 
           out of the burning consulate to the car. Leo follows with the 
           dolly of weapons. They load it all into the trunk. 

           MacKiernan snaps off the AMERICAN FLAGS from the hood of the 
           car and tosses them. 

                                 FRANK
                        I want to know right now, is there 
                        really a plane?

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Yes. 

                                 FRANK
                        Where?

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        South. 

                                 FRANK
                        How FAR south?

           MacKiernan frowns.

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Tibet. 

           Frank stares at him, stunned. 

                                 FRANK
                        That’s five hundred miles! 

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Don’t exaggerate, it’s four-eighty.
                                 FRANK
                        Of war zone!

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Hence the guns.
                            (before Frank can respond)
                        Look, can we talk about this in the 
                        car? That burning building is about 
                        to attract a lot of people who want 
                        us dead.

                                 FRANK
                        They don’t want me dead. I’m not a 
                        spy!

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Be sure to mention that when 
                        they’re sticking bamboo up your 
                        dick. I’m sure they’ve never heard 
                        it.

           Hearing a RUMBLING, they see a MILITARY TRUCK in the 
           distance, headed for the consulate.

                                 MACKIERNAN (CONT’D)
                        That’s them. What’s it gonna be, 
                        Frank?

           Frank eyes the truck, conflicted, then gets into the car. He 
           then sees Vasili and Leo nimbly CLIMB the rear wall of the 
           consulate and vanish over the other side.

                                 FRANK
                        Aren’t they coming?

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        We can’t be seen together, they’re 
                        wanted. 

                                 FRANK
                        And we’re not?

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        They’re wanted more.

           MacKiernan floors it, kicking up dust. They CRASH through the 
           REAR GATE of the consulate and disappear... 

           ...just moments before the truck full of COMMUNIST SOLDIERS 
           drives through the FRONT GATE, pulling to a stop in front of 
           the burning consulate.
           EXT. STREETS OF URUMQI - EVENING

           MacKiernan drives cautiously through desolate streets, 
           passing burned-out buildings. Frank studies MacKiernan.

                                 FRANK
                        You know I speak Tibetan, right?

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Good, that’ll come in handy.

                                 FRANK
                        What I mean is, I don’t think 
                        that’s a coincidence.
                            (MacKiernan says nothing)
                        Why would the CIA go through all 
                        the trouble of finding me?

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        We don’t leave men behind. 

                                 FRANK
                        Sure we do. 

           MacKiernan frowns, seeing that Frank isn’t gonna let this go. 

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        I need your help with a mission.

                                 FRANK
                        Which is..?

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        The communists are about to invade 
                        Tibet. We’re gonna stop it. 

                                 FRANK
                        What does Washington expect us to 
                        do?

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Convince the Dalai Lama to let us 
                        prepare Tibet for war.

           Frank laughs in disbelief.

                                 FRANK
                        Good luck with that. Tibetans don’t 
                        trust outsiders, Mac, and you’ve 
                        got “American imperialism” oozing 
                        out of every pore on your body. You 
                        don’t send a guy like you to meet 
                        the Dalai Lama, you send...
                                 MACKIERNAN
                        An affable, scholarly, Tibetan-
                        speaking anthropologist?

           Frank is stunned as the pieces come together. ME?

                                 FRANK
                        Why the hell didn’t you tell me?

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Gee, maybe because you quit the CIA 
                        and disappeared. Or because you 
                        look like fucking Trotsky with that 
                        goatee. I question your resolve.

                                 FRANK
                        Good, because I think we should 
                        leave Tibet alone. 

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        That’s exactly why the Dalai Lama’s 
                        going to listen to you.

           Frank looks off, annoyed.

                                 FRANK
                        I’m not gonna drag an ancient, 
                        peaceful people into your war. 

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Sure you will.

                                 FRANK
                        No, Mac, I won’t. The second we’re 
                        safe across the border, you and I 
                        are finished. 

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        We’ll see.
                            (squints ahead, frowns)
                        Shit... this is bad.

           A ROADBLOCK is up ahead. A COMMUNIST GUARD stands in the 
           road, holding a machine gun. A SECOND GUARD stays behind in 
           the guard hut to stay warm.

                                 FRANK
                        Should we turn around?

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Good idea, Frank. But let’s make a 
                        “We’re Hiding Something” sign 
                        first, in case they don’t get it. 
           MacKiernan slows to a stop well before the checkpoint.

           The COMMUNIST GUARD (YUN) gestures to him - pull up. 

                                 MACKIERNAN (CONT’D)
                            (taps his ear)
                        Sorry, I didn’t catch that.

           Yun walks over, gun ready. MacKiernan holds up an I.D.

                                 MACKIERNAN (CONT’D)
                        I’m the American Consul. This is my 
                        manservant, Tonto.
                            (Frank gives him a look)
                        We’ve been ordered to evacuate.

           Yun doesn’t understand English. He begins walking around the 
           car, inspecting it. He taps the TRUNK - open it. 

                                 MACKIERNAN (CONT’D)
                        Sure, no problem.

           As MacKiernan gets out...

                                 FRANK
                        Mac, what are you doing?

           MacKiernan casts a glance at the other Guard, who is rolling 
           a smoke in the guard house, distracted.

           MacKiernan joins Yun at the trunk and OPENS it.  

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Voila.

           Yun’s eyes go WIDE, seeing all the guns! MacKiernan HEADBUTTS 
           Yun, then STUFFS him into the trunk and closes it. He gets 
           back into the car, handing Yun’s GUN to Frank.

                                 MACKIERNAN (CONT’D)
                        Be ready.

           INSIDE THE GUARD HOUSE.

           The Second Guard lights his smoke and sees the convertible 
           driving up. MacKiernan waves politely as they drive past. 

                                 MACKIERNAN (CONT’D)
                        Xie-xie.

           The guard gives a confused wave, then walks out of the hut 
           and watches the car recede into the night. 
                                 GUARD
                            (looks around)
                        Yun?

           No answer. He frowns. 

                                                               FADE TO:

           EXT. AMERICAN CONSULATE - EVENING

           Communist soldiers search the smoldering remains of the 
           American Consulate, swirling with acrid smoke. 

           Marko Durov moves slowly through the smoke with a flashlight, 
           his dark eyes missing nothing. He kneels beside the skeletal 
           remains of the FIREPLACE.

           In the ashes are the TOP SECRET CIA DOCUMENTS and PHOTOS that 
           MacKiernan was burning. Most are ash, but not all.

           Marko sees his trusted aide, DIMA (27, Russian, intellectual) 
           enter through the gate and head toward him.

                                 MARKO
                        What was the name of the Consul 
                        here?

                                 DIMA
                        MacKiernan. 

           [NOTE: conversations between Marko and Dima are in RUSSIAN]

           Marko reaches into the fireplace and pulls out a HALF-BURNT 
           8x10 OF THE NUCLEAR TEST. 

                                 MARKO
                        I believe we’ve found our spy.

           Dima takes the burnt photo and looks at it, intrigued. 

           Marko then notices the small AMERICAN FLAG that MacKiernan 
           broke off the car. He studies it, thinking.

                                 MARKO (CONT’D)
                        This fire was set only hours ago. 
                        He couldn’t have gotten far. 

           Dima pulls a large ENVELOPE from his coat pocket. 

                                 DIMA
                        This arrived for you as I was 
                        leaving. It’s from General Kovalev.
           Marko frowns and opens it, finding a FOLDED NEW YORK TIMES, 
           bearing the announcement of the Soviet nuke. 

                                 DIMA (CONT’D)
                        Why would he send you this?

                                 MARKO
                        He’s reminding me that this breach 
                        occurred on my watch.

           A PHOTO falls out of the newspaper, and Marko picks it up. 

           The photo is of a RUSSIAN WOMAN and a YOUNG BOY. They’re 
           smiling, but the smiles are forced. They’re nervous. 

                                 DIMA
                        Your wife and son?

           Marko’s eyes grow cold. He crumples the photo and lets it 
           fall to the ground. 

                                 DIMA (CONT’D)
                        What does it mean?

                                 MARKO
                        It means we must find and kill 
                        MacKiernan...

           Marko stares coldly out the broken gate into the night.

                                 MARKO (CONT’D)
                        ...at any cost.

           EXT. MOUNTAIN PASS - NIGHT

           MacKiernan steers the convertible along a winding mountain 
           road at the base of a HIGH CLIFF. 

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        So why the bug up your ass for the 
                        agency, Frank?

                                 FRANK
                        When they recruited me, they said 
                        I’d study ancient cultures and help 
                        them. 

           MacKiernan snorts a laugh.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        But that’s not what we do. We let 
                        them help us, and then we bail on 
                        them. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        One day I decided I wouldn’t let 
                        any more people who trusted me die. 
                        So I disobeyed my orders and went 
                        back to help. 
                            (taps SCAR near his eyes)
                        I took a shrapnel wound, and they 
                        all died anyway. Never again.

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        So now you just wander, like some 
                        overeducated hobo?

           Frank reluctantly laughs. 

                                 FRANK
                        Pretty much.
                            (looks into mountains)
                        Every anthropologist has their 
                        white whale. I came here to find 
                        mine while I still can. 

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Who was it?

                                 FRANK
                        A Muslim warlord named Osman Bator.
                            (off MacKiernan’s chuckle)
                        Heard of him?

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        I’ve heard of a terrorist by that 
                        name, yeah.

                                 FRANK
                        He’s no terrorist. His people are 
                        nomads, living as they did a 
                        thousand years ago. Problem is, 
                        he’s impossible to find.

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Osman’s a thug, half his fighters 
                        are kids. Wanna study somebody? 
                        Study me.

                                 FRANK
                        Oh, believe me, I am.

           MacKiernan frowns and keeps driving. Pan behind them to....

           INT. CAR TRUNK - NIGHT

           In the CAR TRUNK, Yun jerks awake, disoriented. He squints in 
           the darkness, slowly remembering where he is. 
           He digs around in MacKiernan’s BACKPACK and finds a 
           FLASHLIGHT. He clicks it on and smiles, remembering...

           ...the trunk is filled with WEAPONS!  

           Yun then notices something else - dossiers on KGB OFFICIALS, 
           marked “Top Secret”. There’s even a photo of MARKO. Yun 
           stares, worried - what am I in the middle of here?

           He feels the car SLOW DOWN, and he clicks off the light and 
           grabs a MACHINE GUN, ready...

           EXT. RURAL ROAD - NIGHT

           MacKiernan pulls the car onto a NARROW DIRT ROAD and stops 
           near a cluster of bushes at the base of a cliff. 

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        End of the line, Frank. 

           FOUR MULES are tied to the bushes.

                                 FRANK
                        Those are for us? 
                            (MacKiernan nods)
                        Why are there four?

           MacKiernan points UP. Frank looks up the cliff, seeing...

           ...Vasili and Leo RAPPELLING DOWN the cliff toward them. No 
           advanced gear, just an old rope and their bare hands.  

           The Russians reach the ground, and Vasili heads for the car’s 
           trunk, but...

                                 MACKIERNAN
                            (in Russian)
                        Careful, we have a passenger. 

           Vasili draws a GUN... and carefully OPENS the trunk.

           Yun POPS UP holding the machine gun! He lets out a WAR CRY 
           and PULLS THE TRIGGER!!

           CLICK - CLICK. Not loaded. 

           Vasili PUNCHES Yun, knocking him the fuck out. 

           Vasili and Leo unload the guns and the suitcases of gold and 
           begin tying it all to the mules.

           Weak THUMPS then come from the closed trunk. It’s Yun. 
           Vasili draws his gun and aims at the trunk lid.

                                 FRANK
                        What are you doing?

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        We can’t leave him alive, Frank. 
                        He’s seen us. 

                                 FRANK
                        So did the other guard. We didn’t 
                        kill him. 

           Vasili keeps the gun pressed to the trunk, impatient...

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        This is murder. You know that word?

           Vasili glares at Frank and says something in Russian. Frank 
           looks at Leo for translation.

                                 LEO
                        Father say, “This is not murder. 
                        What men like this did to my wife, 
                        that was murder.” 

           Frank sees deep sadness in Leo’s eyes. The boy has seen far 
           too much death in his short life.

                                 FRANK
                        I’m sorry about your mother, Leo. 
                            (re: Yun)
                        But he didn’t do it. And if we kill 
                        unarmed men, we’re no better than 
                        the ones who did.

           Vasili COCKS the gun and starts to pull the trigger, but...

                                 LEO
                            (in Russian)
                        Father, wait.

           Leo places a hand on his father’s gun. 

                                 LEO (CONT’D)
                        It’s not right.

           Vasili looks over at MacKiernan, who shrugs.

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Jesus, fine. We’ll leave him in 
                        there. Happy?
           Frank nods, relieved.  As Vasili and Leo head over to the 
           mules, MacKiernan looks into Frank’s eyes, serious. 

                                 MACKIERNAN (CONT’D)
                        I need to know something, Frank. 
                        Can you pull a trigger when it 
                        counts?

                                 FRANK
                        I think so. But I can’t see shit, 
                        so you’ll want to be behind me if 
                        it comes to that. 

           Frank heads toward the mules as MacKiernan sighs - this 
           fucking guy. 

           EXT. MOUNTAIN GULLY - NIGHT

           Frank, MacKiernan, Vasili and Leo ride cautiously through a 
           narrow mountain pass. With the mules loaded with gold and 
           guns, it’s slow going. 

           Frank notices MacKiernan looking at the photo of his daughter 
           Gail, a slight smile creasing the corners of his mouth.

                                 FRANK
                        Careful, Mac. When you look at her, 
                        you almost seem human. 

           MacKiernan frowns and puts the photo away. Leo chuckles, and 
           Frank turns to him.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Leo, where do you two live when 
                        you’re not out here?

                                 LEO
                        We live where we can be useful.

                                 FRANK
                        In the fight against Russia? 

                                 LEO
                        We fight FOR Russia. 

                                 FRANK
                        Of course, sorry. It’s just that 
                        I’ve been searching for a man who 
                        lives nomadically, as you do. Have 
                        you ever run across a Kazakh 
                        warlord named Osman Bator?

           Leo looks at him strangely, then glances back at MacKiernan.
                                 LEO
                        Is he stupid?

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Jury’s still out.

                                 FRANK
                        You’ve heard of Osman?

                        We are taking you to Osman. 

           Frank slowly looks back at MacKiernan.

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Did I not mention that?

                                 FRANK
                        I think I’d remember that, Mac.

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Tibet’s a long way, and there’s an 
                        army in our path. We’re gonna need 
                        some muscle.  

                                 FRANK
                        An hour ago, you called Osman a 
                        terrorist!

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Whoa, easy with that word. From now 
                        on, it’s “freedom fighter.”

           Frank laughs darkly, realizing something.

                                 FRANK
                        I get it. I speak Kazakh, so I get 
                        to talk the Muslim warlord into 
                        being CIA cannon-fodder.

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        The gold will be doing most of the 
                        talking, Frank. 

                                 FRANK
                        Is this the CIA’s plan now? 
                        Guerilla wars?

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Beats nuclear wars. 

           Vasili holds up a hand, and they slow to a stop near a copse 
           of THICK TREES. 
           Vasili WHISTLES like a bird, and TWENTY HIDDEN KAZAKHS in fur 
           clothing appear from EVERYWHERE around them, aiming rifles at 
           the group. 

                                 MACKIERNAN (CONT’D)
                        Stay very still.

           One of the men talks quietly with Vasili for a moment, then 
           hands woven SCARVES to MacKiernan and Frank.  

                                 FRANK
                            (in Kazakh)
                        Thank you.

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        It’s not a gift, Frank.

           MacKiernan uses the scarf to BLINDFOLD HIMSELF. Frank 
           reluctantly does likewise.

           EXT. OSMAN BATOR’S CAMP - NIGHT

           The Kazakhs lead the group down a deep RAVINE. Vasili taps 
           MacKiernan, who removes his blindfold.

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        You can look now.

           Frank removes his blindfold and peers ahead.

           Hidden in the ravine is a small VILLAGE of yurts, not unlike 
           the nomadic villages of the Sioux.

           Frank and MacKiernan dismount their mules and are led toward 
           the largest yurt.

                                 FRANK
                        Let me do the talking.

           Mac nods. Vasili makes a comment in Russian, and Leo laughs.

                                 LEO
                            (to Frank)
                        There is game Osman’s people play. 
                        Like polo.

                                 FRANK
                        What, we have to prove our worth in 
                        polo?

                                 LEO
                        No. If Osman no like you, your head 
                        be the ball. 
           Frank looks at MacKiernan, who shrugs. A flap is lifted for 
           them, and they duck as they enter...

           INT. OSMAN BATOR’S YURT - CONTINUOUS

           ...a smoke-filled yurt, lined with furs. Flanked by his three 
           wives is... 

           OSMAN BATOR (60, Kazakh warlord, Muslim, with the scars of a 
           life spent fighting). Frank kneels, bowing his head. 

                                 FRANK
                            (in Kazakh)
                        Allah preserve you, Osman Bator. We 
                        bring many gifts in appreciation of 
                        welcoming us to your fire.

           Osman rises to his feet, frowning. He moves to MacKiernan, 
           then SMILES and EMBRACES him, addressing him in ENGLISH.

                                 OSMAN BATOR
                            (re: Frank)
                        This him?

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        This him. 

                                 FRANK
                        You two know each other?
                            (MacKiernan nods)
                        You didn’t feel like mentioning 
                        that?

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        I wanted to hear your speech. 

                                 OSMAN BATOR
                            (inspects Frank, frowning)
                        He is soldier?

                                 FRANK
                            (in Kazakh)
                        I’m an anthropologist. I would like 
                        to learn your ways, so that I might 
                        teach others.

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Frank’s one of our top agents.

           Both Frank and Osman look at MacKiernan, skeptical. Osman 
           grunts and pushes past Frank, leaving the yurt.
                                 MACKIERNAN (CONT’D)
                            (grins)
                        That went well. 

           MacKiernan follows Osman out, leaving Frank frowning. What 
           the hell have I gotten myself into?  

                                                               FADE TO:

           EXT. RURAL ROAD - NIGHT

           Communist soldiers examine MACKIERNAN’S CAR. Yun is being 
           tended to by a medic.

           A SOVIET DIPLOMATIC CAR pulls up, and Marko steps out with 
           Dima. A soldier moves to intercept them, but...

                                 MARKO
                            (in flawless Mandarin)
                        Stand aside.

           The Soldier glances at his superior officer - who’s this guy? 

           The Superior Officer, sensing Marko is connected to people 
           above his pay grade, barks a command to his men. The soldiers 
           follow him away, and Yun starts to rise, but...

                                 MARKO (CONT’D)
                        Not you.

           Yun sits back down on the car bumper, uncomfortable. 

           Marko moves to the hood, finding the broken STEM where 
           MacKiernan snapped off the American flag.

           Marko pulls out the SINGED AMERICAN FLAG he found and holds 
           it next to the broken stem - it’s a perfect fit.  

           This is MacKiernan’s car. 

           Marko walks back to the rear of the car, where Yun waits. 
           CONVERSATION IN MANDARIN

                                 MARKO (CONT’D)
                        The man who captured you, is this 
                        him?

           Dima shows Yun a DIPLOMATIC HEADSHOT of MacKiernan. Yun nods.

                                 YUN
                        There was another, with a beard and 
                        glasses. They had weapons and gold 
                        and photographs.
                                 (MORE)
                                 YUN (CONT'D)
                            (squints, realizing)
                        I saw a file on YOU.

                                 MARKO
                        I’m very sorry to hear that.

           Marko SHOOTS YUN. 

           The other soldiers REACT and aim their weapons, but the 
           Superior Officer immediately orders them to stand down. 

           Marko, unfazed, stares up into the imposing hills. 

           MacKiernan is up there somewhere.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. OSMAN BATOR’S CAMP - NIGHT

           Osman’s followers sit around a fire, playing Kazakh music on 
           pipes and drums.

           MacKiernan whittles at a hunk of wood with his Bowie knife. 

           He’s making a NEW CARVING OF GAIL ON THE PONY to replace the 
           one that burned up during the nuclear test. At this early 
           stage, though, it’s a nondescript hunk with four stubby legs.

           Frank approaches with a gaggle of Kazakh kids trailing him. 

                                 FRANK
                        Okay, one more time.

           Frank kneels and does the “Disappearing Thumb” trick, and the 
           kids SQUEAL with delight. Frank takes a seat next to 
           MacKiernan and eyes Mac’s carving, curious.  

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        What is that, a dog?

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        It’s not a dog, it’s...
                            (puts it away)
                        Never mind. We leave at first 
                        light. Osman and ten of his best 
                        men will escort us south to the 
                        Tibetan border.

           A HAND touches Frank’s shoulder, and he FLINCHES, before 
           realizing it’s a YOUNG WOMAN, holding a bowl of STEW. 

                                 MACKIERNAN (CONT’D)
                        Little jumpy, Frank?
           Frank gazes at the woman. She is IRINA (21, Kazakh, with 
           dark, striking eyes). He takes the bowl of stew from her.

                                 FRANK
                            (in Kazakh)
                        Thank you...

                                 IRINA
                        You are... welcome.

                                 FRANK
                        You speak English?

           Irina gestures - little bit. She smiles shyly and walks off. 
           Frank’s eyes follow her, but...

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Uh, Frank? 
                            (Frank glances at him)
                        Orlord-way aughter-day.

                                 FRANK
                        I have no idea what you just said.

           MacKiernan nods over at Osman, who is watching Frank.

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Orlord-way aughter-day. 

                                 FRANK
                        Is that pig latin? What are you, 
                        twelve?
                            (off Mac’s serious look)
                        “Warlord’s daught..” Oh. Got it.  

           DRUMS suddenly kick into a new beat. Again Frank FLINCHES. 

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        What’s with you tonight? You’re 
                        wound up like a chihuahua. 

                                 FRANK
                        It’s just something I heard about 
                        Kazakh horse tribes.
                            (leans in, low)
                        Let me ask you; did anything 
                        unusual happen when you first met 
                        Osman?

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Unusual how?
                                 FRANK
                        Did they accept you right away, or 
                        was there a... period of 
                        adjustment?

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Well, let me think back. I met 
                        Osman, we ate a nice dinner...

           WHAM! A massive KAZAKH WARRIOR (NURIK) WHACKS the bowl of 
           stew out of Frank’s hands!

                                 MACKIERNAN (CONT’D)
                        Oh right. Then he sent a huge guy 
                        to beat the shit out of me. Is that 
                        what you meant?

                                 FRANK
                        That would be it. 

           Nurik grabs Frank and THROWS HIM to the ground. Frank crawls 
           to his knees, spitting dirt. Nurik towers over him. 

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Before we do this, I should warn 
                        you; there’s a problem with my 
                        eyes...

           WHAM! Nurik PUNCHES Frank, who crashes to the ground again. 
           Nurik KICKS Frank, knocking the wind out of him. 

           Frank curls into the fetal position, wheezing. 

                                 MACKIERNAN
                            (under his breath)
                        Get up, Frank.

           Nurik SPITS, then walks over to his tribesman, victorious.  
           They laugh and give Nurik a drink. 

           Osman grunts his displeasure, then disappears into his yurt. 
           MacKiernan kneels by Frank as Frank struggles for breath.

                                 MACKIERNAN (CONT’D)
                        That’s not good enough. They’re 
                        never gonna let you ride with them.

                                 FRANK
                        I know.

           Frank rises to his feet and studies Nurik, off laughing with 
           other soldiers.
                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        How did you do it? 

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        I went for the balls. 

                                 FRANK
                        And?

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Terrible idea. 

           Frank notices Irina watching, and the sight of her gives 
           Frank a bit of a second wind. 

           Taking a deep breath, Frank pulls his glasses on and walks 
           straight toward Nurik, whose back is to him, and...

                                 MACKIERNAN (CONT’D)
                            (covers his eyes)
                        Oh Jesus...

           Frank SHOVES Nurik from behind, sending him toppling to the 
           ground. The Kazakhs all turn, surprised. Nurik smiles coldly 
           and rises to his feet, towering over Frank. 

           Frank LUNGES at Nurik, taking a swing. Nurik easily sidesteps 
           the blow and HAMMERS Frank to the ground. 

           Osman Bator emerges from his yurt, hearing the commotion. 

           Frank rises to unsteady feet, then SWINGS again, but Nurik 
           blocks the punch and HURLS Frank roughly to the ground. 

                                 MACKIERNAN (CONT’D)
                            (to Osman)
                        That’s enough, right?

           Osman shakes his head. Frank again rises to his knees, but 
           Nurik grabs him by the hair and...

                                 FRANK
                        Oh God, no...

           Nurik HEADBUTTS Frank, and all goes BLACK.

                                                               FADE TO:
           EXT. KARA GOBI MOUNTAINS - MORNING

           The sun rises over the Kara Gobi mountains. The Mullah of 
           Osman’s tribe sings the Muslim call to prayer, as armed 
           sentries scan the mountains with binoculars, looking for 
           communist troops.

           INT. FRANK’S YURT - MORNING

           Frank lies on a thick fur, still unconscious. His face is 
           bruised badly. A FOOT nudges him. Frank looks up, groggy. 

           It’s Nurik. Frank pales.

                                 FRANK
                        Oh, come on...

           Nurik extends a hand. Frank suspiciously takes it, and Nurik 
           pulls him to his feet. 

           Nurik studies Frank’s bruises. No apology, no regret, just 
           curiosity. Nurik then gestures for Frank to follow. 

           EXT. OSMAN BATOR’S CAMP - DAY

           MacKiernan oversees as Osman’s men prepare for departure. 
           They load horses with weapons as women wrap dried meats. 
           Children run around getting last hugs from their fathers.  

           Several kids run up to MacKiernan, “shooting” him with their 
           fingers. MacKiernan pretends to die, then wrestles the kids 
           to the ground as mothers grin. MacKiernan is popular here.

           ON FRANK

           As he walks with Nurik through the camp. Frank spots Irina 
           loading a HORSE with supplies, and Irina puts a hand to her 
           mouth at seeing Frank’s beat-up face.

                                 FRANK
                        It looks worse than it is.

           Irina touches his black eye gently. If it hurts, Frank 
           doesn’t show it. Noticing her horse...

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Are you coming with us?

                                 IRINA
                        Yes, I take care of father.

           Nurik PULLS Frank onward with his meathook hands.
                                 FRANK
                        I guess I’m going this way.

           Irina laughs. Frank follows Nurik over to MacKiernan. 

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Hey, look who kissed and made up. 
                        Nice shiner, Frank. Almost makes 
                        you look tough. 

           MacKiernan WHISTLES over to Leo, who leads two HORSES over to 
           them, with thick wool BLANKETS draped over them.

                                 MACKIERNAN (CONT’D)
                        Hope you’re a better rider than you 
                        are a boxer.
                            (to Leo)
                        Where are the saddles?

                                 FRANK
                        Kazakhs don’t use saddles, Mac.

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        We’ve gotta ride bareback? What do 
                        we do?

                                 FRANK
                        We?

           Frank SWINGS his body up onto the horse’s back like a 
           seasoned expert. 

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        I just spent four months with the 
                        best bareback riders in the world. 
                        What have you been doing?

           MacKiernan frowns and tries to mount the horse, but the horse 
           shakes and whinnies, sending MacKiernan tumbling to the dirt. 

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Maybe they have a little baby horse 
                        you could ride.

           MacKiernan shoots him a look and prepares to try again, but..

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Mac, wait.

           MacKiernan expects another insult, but Frank nods over toward 
           Osman, who is watching MacKiernan intently.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Do not fall again.
           MacKiernan nods, then grips the horse’s mane and swings his 
           body up. To his relief, he stays on.

           Osman rides to the front of the pack like the seasoned leader 
           he is and lets out a SHOUT! The riders start to follow Osman 
           out through the center of camp.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Hya!

           Frank’s horse takes off. Not to be outdone...

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Hya!

           MacKiernan’s horse takes off as well, with MacKiernan holding 
           on for dear life. 

           The group thunders out of the camp, as their families run 
           after them, waving goodbye.

           The thumping of Kazakh drum music arises, as...

           - The war party rides through tall grass, the horsemen’s 
           practiced eyes sweeping the horizon for signs of trouble. 

           - The group gallops through a field of massive BOULDERS. The 
           Kazakhs weave through the boulders like slalom skiers, 
           getting dangerously close. Frank and Leo race against each 
           other, grinning. Vasili watches his son, proud.  

           MacKiernan struggles to keep up, but he’s getting better. 

           EXT. ABANDONED COAL MINE - NIGHT

           The group is camped for the night in a rocky ravine, near the 
           entrance to an ABANDONED COAL MINE. 

           Freshly killed rabbits cook on a spit. MacKiernan whittles 
           his carving of Gail on her pony, as Frank reads “War and 
           Peace” to Osman’s men, who are transfixed...

                                 FRANK
                            (in Kazakh, dramatic)
                        “He did not run with the feeling of 
                        doubt and conflict as before, but 
                        with the feeling of a hare fleeing 
                        from the hounds...”

           Frank BARKS like a dog! The warriors FLINCH, startled, then 
           laugh. Frank notices Irina smiling at him. 
           MacKiernan frowns at seeing this, then heads over to Osman, 
           who is studying a MAP intently. 

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Is there a problem?

                                 OSMAN BATOR
                        Field hospital to south. Could be 
                        soldiers there. We’ll have to go 
                        arou...

           Osman suddenly GOES STILL, hearing a faint noise on the 
           breeze. 

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        What is it?

           Osman holds up a hand - quiet. He listens carefully, then...

                                 OSMAN BATOR
                        Aza! Hyla!

           Everyone in the camp leaps to their feet. Nurik DOUSES the 
           fire with water, then deftly throws a WET BLANKET over the 
           coals to prevent steam.  

                                 FRANK
                        What’s happening?

                                 IRINA
                        Airplane.

           Osman WHISTLES to a soldier guarding the HORSES. The soldier 
           hustles the horses under cover with the efficiency of a 
           seasoned cowboy.

           Vasili hurries through the camp, looking around for... 

                                 VASILI
                        Leo!

           There’s no sign of Leo. MacKiernan grabs Vasili and pulls him 
           into the trees, along with Frank and the others. 

           Frank looks around, amazed. It took less than ten seconds for 
           this entire camp to vanish. Just in time too, as... 

           ...a MIG-15 FIGHTER JET appears in the sky, zooming low over 
           the moonlit mountains. 

                                 FRANK
                        Chinese?
                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Soviet, MiG-15. 

           The jet ZOOMS past their position and recedes into the 
           distance. All is silent for a moment.

                                 FRANK
                        Why would a Soviet plane be all the 
                        way out...?
                            (realizes)
                        Mac, are they looking for us?

           MacKiernan doesn’t answer, which is all the answer Frank 
           needs. 

           Osman yells the all-clear, and they emerge from hiding. Osman 
           claps, getting morale up. Soon the group is moving to the 
           beat of drums, with Osman moving among them, a true leader.

           Vasili, however, angrily looks around for...

                                 VASILI
                        Leo!

           Vasili moves to the entrance to the COAL MINE, then grabs a 
           torch and heads inside, peering into the darkness.

           Vasili moves past rusted machinery and piles of COAL. In an 
           ALCOVE ahead, he sees a flicker of CANDLELIGHT. 

                                 VASILI (CONT’D)
                        Leo?

           The candle is quickly BLOWN OUT. Vasili frowns. (Conversation 
           in Russian)

                                 VASILI (CONT’D)
                        Come out here, boy. 

           Leo nervously emerges from the alcove. Vasili grabs his arm.

                                 VASILI (CONT’D)
                        What is wrong with you? I must 
                        always know where you are. 

                                 LEO
                        I’m sorry, father. 

           Vasili sees that Leo’s hands are black with coal dust.

                                 VASILI
                        What are you doing in there?
                                 LEO
                        Nothing.  
                            (Vasili moves past him)
                        Please, don’t...!

           Vasili leans in with the torch and goes still, seeing...

           A beautiful CHARCOAL DRAWING of a WOMAN’S FACE on the wall. 
           She is lovely, with long, dark hair and a kind smile.

                                 LEO (CONT’D)
                        Forgive me, father. I know you 
                        don’t like to be reminded of her.

           Vasili stares at the drawing, his heart aching. He kneels and 
           touches the woman’s face. 

                                 LEO (CONT’D)
                        I like to be with mother, so I draw 
                        her sometimes.

           Vasili’s eyes shimmer with tears, moved.

                                 VASILI
                        With all you’ve seen, I sometimes 
                        forget that you are just a boy.

                                 LEO
                            (straightens up)
                        I am a soldier, father. Like you.

           Vasili slowly pulls Leo into a hug. 

                                 VASILI
                        Not tonight. 

           Vasili holds his son close in the flickering torchlight, 
           under the loving gaze of the woman they both miss so much.

                                                               FADE TO:

           EXT. KARA GOBI MOUNTAINS - DAWN

           The sun rises over the Kara Gobi mountains. Hawks soar in the 
           blue sky, searching for prey.

           In a field of tall grass, Vasili and Leo kneel by a pile of 
           ANIMAL DROPPINGS. Vasili looks back at MacKiernan and Frank. 

                                 VASILI
                            (in Russian)
                        This way. We are close.
                                 MACKIERNAN
                        You said that three piles of shit 
                        ago. 

           Vasili and Leo keep moving through the grass, as Frank and 
           MacKiernan follow.

                                 MACKIERNAN (CONT’D)
                        You’d think a suitcase full of gold 
                        would get us out of food duty. 
                            (notices...)
                        Frank, where’s your gun?

                                 FRANK
                        I didn’t bring it. 

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        We’re hunting!

                                 FRANK
                        No, you’re hunting. I’m half-blind, 
                        I’d end up shooting one of you.

           MacKiernan stares at him in disbelief.

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        How the hell did you survive the 
                        war?

           Frank shrugs, and they resume walking after Vasili.

                                 FRANK
                        What’s Vasili’s story? Was he 
                        raised in exile? 

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        No, he was Red Army. 

                                 FRANK
                        What happened?

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Fell in love with a dissident. Hero 
                        of Stalingrad comes home to find 
                        out his wife died in a labor camp. 

                                 FRANK
                        So he defected?

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Rumor I heard is he took out a 
                        member of Stalin’s family on his 
                        way out. Could be bullshit, Vasili 
                        doesn’t talk about it.  
           Ahead, Vasili gestures “Down”, and they all drop to their 
           bellies and crawl through the grass to the edge of a hill. 

           At the base of the hill is a HERD OF ANTELOPE.

                                 MACKIERNAN (CONT’D)
                        All right. Who wants the shot? 
                        How about you, Frank? Wanna kill 
                        one with your intellect?
                            (Frank shoots him a look)
                        Leo, the honor’s yours.

           No answer from Leo. 

                                 MACKIERNAN (CONT’D)
                        Leo?

           They look over at Leo, who seems FROZEN IN FEAR. 

                                 MACKIERNAN (CONT’D)
                        What’s wrong?

           Leo says nothing. Concerned, they edge closer and realize...

           A HABU PIT VIPER is coiled in front of Leo in the tall grass, 
           venom dripping from its fangs. Ready to strike.

           MacKiernan starts to aim his rifle at the snake, but...

                                 VASILI
                        Nyet.
                            (to Leo, in Russian)
                        Remain still.

           The viper’s head rears up, eyes fixed on Leo. 

                                 VASILI (CONT’D)
                        Now, very slowly... move back.

           Leo carefully edges backwards. The snake remains where it 
           is... but Leo’s elbow presses onto a TWIG, which SNAPS! The 
           startled viper STRIKES, SINKING ITS FANGS into Leo’s forearm!

                                 VASILI (CONT’D)
                        Leo!

           Vasili lunges, grabbing the snake’s tail and whipping out a 
           HUNTING KNIFE. The hissing snake lets go of Leo and SNAPS at 
           Vasili, but...

           ...its HEAD EXPLODES - MacKiernan SHOT it. Blood splatters 
           across Vasili’s surprised face. The antelope all take off 
           running across the field. 
           Leo is CONVULSING. The bite on his forearm is SWELLING 
           rapidly, turning purple. 

                                 FRANK
                        Jesus...

           Vasili SUCKS on the wound and spits out venom, but Leo 
           quickly loses consciousness.

           Vasili hoists Leo into his arms and begins running away 
           across the hilltop.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        What’s he doing? Camp’s the other 
                        way!

                                 MACKIERNAN
                            (in Russian)
                        Vasili, where are you going?

           MacKiernan and Frank run after him, but even with Leo in his 
           arms, Vasili is faster than they are - his legs carry him 
           swiftly over the rocky terrain. 

           Vasili races across the top of a ridge, then disappears over 
           the other side. MacKiernan and Frank reach the top and look 
           down a steep slope, seeing...

           ...a CLUSTER OF WHITE TENTS in the distance, surrounded by a 
           BARBED WIRE FENCE. A dozen locals linger outside the fence. 
           Vasili runs toward the tent complex with Leo. 

                                 MACKIERNAN (CONT’D)
                        Shit, that’s the field hospital 
                        Osman was talking about.

                                 FRANK
                        Isn’t that a good thing?

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        We don’t know who’s there.

           MacKiernan pulls Frank behind large ROCKS and unstraps his 
           RIFLE. Looking through the SCOPE...

           SCOPE POV - people are gathered outside the fence, mostly 
           rural Sinkiangese farmers; some ill, some nursing injuries.

           Vasili carries Leo to the fence and yells through the locked 
           gate for help.

           UP THE HILL

           MacKiernan peers through the rifle scope.
                                 MACKIERNAN (CONT’D)
                        Stop making a scene, Vasili.

           SCOPE POV - MacKiernan sees a COMMUNIST SOLDIER in the crowd, 
           with a CUT HAND, awaiting treatment. The Soldier is staring 
           at Vasili, suspicious.

                                 MACKIERNAN (CONT’D)
                        Shit.

           MacKiernan tracks the Soldier with the rifle’s CROSSHAIRS as 
           he walks around the tent complex to...

           ...a MILITARY JEEP parked nearly out of sight, with a SECOND 
           SOLDIER inside. The injured Soldier talks into a RADIO. 

                                 FRANK
                        What’s happening? 

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Two soldiers. One’s using the 
                        radio.

           MacKiernan COCKS a round into the rifle’s chamber and peers 
           through the scope, taking aim.

                                 FRANK
                        Mac, if you start shooting, Leo’s 
                        never getting through that gate. 
                        He’ll die. 

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        They could be calling for backup.

                                 FRANK
                        And shooting them during the call 
                        will prevent that?

           MacKiernan frowns - good point. He aims the rifle back toward 
           the main tent. 

           SCOPE POV - An ELDERLY SINKIANGESE DOCTOR in filthy operating 
           clothes emerges from the main tent. The crowd erupts with 
           shouts, all trying to be the next one inside. 

           Vasili presses Leo to the fence, begging for treatment. 

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Come on, let him in... 

           The Doctor takes one look at Leo’s bite and opens the gate 
           wide enough to let Vasili through. The crowd tries to push 
           through, but the Doctor locks the gate again.
                                 MACKIERNAN (CONT’D)
                        He’s in.

                                 FRANK
                        Hurry, Vasili...

           INT. MEDICAL TENT - DAY

           Vasili carries Leo through the ramshackle medical tent, 
           following the Doctor. Flies buzz around archaic medical 
           instruments. 

           The Doctor examines Leo’s swollen snakebite. He listens for 
           breath, then opens Leo’s eyelids and studies his pupils. 

           EXT. HILLSIDE - DAY

           MacKiernan scans the horizon with his scope. So far so good. 

           INT. MEDICAL TENT - DAY

           The Doctor unlocks a TRUNK full of medicines and begins 
           sifting through the disorganized mess, looking for antivenom. 
           Vasili rocks Leo in his arms, impatiently.

           EXT. HILLSIDE - DAY

           MacKiernan peers through the rifle scope at the two soldiers 
           in the Jeep. 

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        These two are sitting tight. We 
                        might be okay.

                                 FRANK
                        Do you hear that?

           MacKiernan listens. A distant whup-whup-whup...

           He swings the rifle around and peers into the distance. 

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Damn it. 

           SCOPE POV - A small HELICOPTER is flying low in their 
           direction. Not far behind it, a MILITARY TRUCK rumbles 
           swiftly along a dirt road. 

                                 FRANK
                        We have to warn Vasili.
                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Trust me, Frank, Vasili heard that 
                        chopper way before you did.

           INT. MEDICAL TENT - DAY

           Vasili peers out of a tent flap at the helicopter and truck 
           headed his way. He looks at back Leo, helpless on the table. 

                                 VASILI
                            (in Russian)
                        Hurry.

           The Doctor locates the bottle of Antivenom and roots around 
           for a SYRINGE. 

           EXT. HILLSIDE - CONTINUOUS

           MacKiernan and Frank watch as the helicopter lands near the 
           tent, kicking up dust. The army truck arrives a moment later, 
           and SIX COMMUNIST SOLDIERS get out, armed with rifles.

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        This is bad. 

           MacKiernan peers through the scope as Marko and Dima step off 
           of the helicopter. He zeroes in on Marko with the scope...

                                 MACKIERNAN (CONT’D)
                        Holy shit, that’s Marko Durov. 

                                 FRANK
                        Who is he, KGB?

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        He’s their fucking angel of death.

           Marko, Dima and the soldiers approach the gate. A soldier 
           SHOOTS the lock off. 

                                 MACKIERNAN (CONT’D)
                        Get out of there, Vasili...

           INT. HOSPITAL TENT - DAY

           The Doctor is about to inject a syringe of antivenom into 
           Leo’s leg, when...

                                 MARKO (O.S.)
                        Tingzhi.
           The Doctor freezes, as Marko and the soldiers enter the room. 
           Marko studies Vasili, noting his Russian features. 
           CONVERSATION IN RUSSIAN. 

                                 MARKO (CONT’D)
                        What seems to be the problem? Is 
                        your boy hurt?
                            (Vasili says nothing)
                        I know you speak our language, 
                        comrade. We are countrymen, are we 
                        not?

           Marko takes the syringe from the Doctor’s hand and looks at 
           Vasili. The meaning is clear - tell us what we want to know, 
           and we’ll save your son.

                                 MARKO (CONT’D)
                        Where are your friends in the 
                        hills?

           EXT. HILLSIDE - DAY

           Frank and MacKiernan watch the medical tent, worried.

                                 FRANK
                        We’ve got to do something.

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        There are eight of them, Frank, 
                        loaded for bear. And last I 
                        checked, we only have one gun. 
                            (Frank frowns - shit)
                        Vasili made his call. Our mission 
                        is Tibet. 

                                 FRANK
                        We can’t just let them take him.

           MacKiernan thinks, then draws his BOWIE KNIFE. 

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        You’re right. We can’t.
                            (beat)
                        Wait here. 

           MacKiernan hops over the rocks and sprints down the hillside 
           to the ARMY TRUCK. Frank grabs MacKiernan’s rifle and peers 
           through the scope as...

           ...MacKiernan ducks into the back of the truck and hides the 
           BOWIE KNIFE under a mat. 
           MacKiernan hops out of the truck and tosses his leather 
           SHEATH onto the ground near the truck. A MESSAGE TO VASILI.

           He hauls ass back up the hillside and rejoins Frank. 

                                 FRANK
                        You think he can get out of this 
                        with a knife?

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        If you have a better idea, Frank, 
                        I’m all ears.  

           INT. HOSPITAL TENT - CONTINUOUS

           Two soldiers restrain Vasili as Marko stands over Leo, 
           holding the syringe. CONVERSATION IN RUSSIAN.

                                 VASILI
                        The boy is innocent. Please, I will 
                        go with you if you save him.

                                 MARKO
                        Only you can save him, comrade. 

           Marko then steps closer to Vasili, studying him.

                                 MARKO (CONT’D)
                        I know your face. 

           He looks at Vasili intently, and his eyes widen.

                                 MARKO (CONT’D)
                        My God... can it be? 
                            (smiles, turns)
                        Do you know who this is, Dima?

           Dima, however, is focused on Leo.

                                 DIMA
                        The boy’s heart rate is slowing. 

                                 MARKO
                            (to Vasili)
                        Where are the Americans... Vasili?

           Vasili seethes. Dima then FEELS something in Leo’s pocket. He 
           reaches in and pulls out...

                                 DIMA
                        Marko.
           ...THE LUMP OF COAL that Leo was drawing with. Marko takes it 
           and examines it, curious.

                                 MARKO
                        A strange thing for a boy to have. 
                            (smiles)
                        By any chance, are you camped near 
                        a coal mine?

           Vasili STRUGGLES, FURIOUS! 

                                 MARKO (CONT’D)
                        I’ll take that as a yes.

           He nods to the Soldiers, who drag Vasili away. Vasili 
           struggles and looks desperately back at...

                                 VASILI
                        Leo!!

           EXT. HILLSIDE - CONTINUOUS

           Frank and MacKiernan watch helplessly as soldiers DRAG Vasili 
           toward the truck, thrashing and yelling.

           He’s loaded onto the truck, and the truck’s flap is PULLED 
           SHUT, as the engine fires up.

           Frank, still holding MacKiernan’s rifle, aims the scope at 
           the hospital tent window. 

           SCOPE POV - The Doctor holds out his hand for the syringe, 
           but Marko BREAKS it in his gloved hand and drops the pieces 
           on the floor. 

           The stunned Doctor turns to Leo, who CONVULSES for a 
           moment... then goes still. 

                                 FRANK
                            (leans away from the scope)
                        He let Leo die.

           As Marko and Dima emerge from the tent...

           MacKiernan grabs the rifle from Frank and takes aim, placing 
           the crosshairs on Marko’s head, rage in his eyes. He grips 
           the rifle so hard that his knuckles turn white. 

           Revenge... or the mission? 

           MacKiernan can’t do it. He closes his eyes, distraught.

           Marko and Dima climb into the helicopter, and it RISES.
                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Any chance Vasili will tell them 
                        where we’re going?

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Never.

           The helicopter makes a wide arc, and MacKiernan and Frank 
           press down behind the rocks.

           Marko tosses something out of the chopper, which clatters to 
           the ground down the hill from them.

           As the helicopter flies away, MacKiernan climbs down to the 
           object, curious. He picks it up... and pales. 

                                 MACKIERNAN (CONT’D)
                        We need to run, Frank. Right now.

                                 FRANK
                        What are you talking about?

           MacKiernan holds up Leo’s HUNK OF COAL.

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        They know where the camp is. 

                                                              SMASH TO:

           EXT. KARA GOBI MOUNTAINS - DAY

           MacKiernan and Frank SPRINT across the top of a ridge, 
           pushing themselves hard.

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Move it, Frank! 

           They race down into a gully and through a rushing creek to 
           the other side. As they scramble up the next hill...

           ...a PAIR of MIG-15 JETS streak over their position, their 
           engines deafening!

                                 FRANK
                        Jesus!

           They watch the jets race into the distance, disappearing over 
           the hilltops.

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Come on!
           MacKiernan takes off running, and Frank follows.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. ABANDONED COAL MINE - DAY

           Irina flips through Frank’s copy of “War and Peace”, smiling, 
           running her fingers over the print.

           Osman watches her, concerned, but then hears the faint sound 
           of JET ENGINES.

                                 OSMAN BATOR
                        Aza!

           The group scrambles into action. Osman leaps up onto a ledge 
           and looks out, seeing...

           ...the two MIG-15 JETS streaking directly toward their camp 
           from the distance. Another reconnaissance? His eyes narrow...

           Osman instinctively knows; something’s different this time. 
           TWO jets, flying right at them, it’s all too perfect.

           The jets STREAK over the camp, and Osman closes his eyes...

                                 OSMAN BATOR (CONT’D)
                        Allahu Akb...

           ...as the world around him EXPLODES.

           EXT. HILLTOP - DAY

           MacKiernan and Frank sprint through thick brush and finally 
           reach the edge of the RAVINE where their camp is.

           They look down... and their faces go slack.

           Smoke rises from the RUINS of their camp. BOMB CRATERS pepper 
           the area. Lines of ripped earth suggest devastating STRAFING 
           RUNS from above. 

           Even from this distance, they can see... BODIES.

                                 FRANK
                        My god.

           MacKiernan and Frank run down the hill and enter the smoking 
           remains of the camp, horrified. 

           Nurik is dead, ripped apart by 50-cal bullets. 
           Osman lies on the ground, clothes soaked in blood. MacKiernan 
           checks his pulse. Osman is DEAD. 

           Frank runs to Irina’s yurt, but it’s a smoking wreck from 
           bomb shrapnel. Frank pulls open the flap and pales with 
           sadness, seeing...

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        No.

           ...Irina lying on her back, her beautiful face flecked with 
           blood, her dark eyes open and lifeless. Frank falls to his 
           knees and touches her face, distraught.

           Frank looks up and sees MacKiernan watching, solemn.

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Troops will arrive any second to 
                        sift through all of this, Frank. 
                            (beat)
                        Get your gear. We’re leaving.

           Frank nods, numb. MacKiernan ducks into the tattered remains 
           of his tent and grabs a MAP TUBE. He digs through the maps, 
           pulling ONE out, then tosses the rest. 

           MacKiernan moves to a CRATE filled with GOLD BARS. He loads 
           his backpack with all the gold bars it can fit.

           But there’s still one gold bar left. MacKiernan glances at a 
           box of GRENADES, an idea coming to him. 

           ON FRANK

           as he grabs a rifle and moves to the clearing where the 
           horses were, but all the horses are DEAD, killed by shrapnel.

           He heads back to MacKiernan, who hefts the heavy bag of gold 
           over his shoulder.

                                 FRANK
                        The horses are dead.

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Then we’re on foot. Let’s go.

           The rumbling of an ENGINE. 

           Frank and MacKiernan glance at each other, then quickly take 
           cover in the trees. 

           Once concealed, MacKiernan and Frank aim their RIFLES, ready.  
           Through the swirling smoke, a LARGE, OMINOUS SHAPE appears. 
           It’s a COMMUNIST ARMY TRUCK, which pulls to a stop in the 
           smoky camp. 

                                 MACKIERNAN (CONT’D)
                        We can’t be caught in a guerilla 
                        camp, Frank. It’ll be World War 3. 
                            (beat)
                        Anyone comes this way, shoot to 
                        kill.

           Frank peers through his thick glasses down the barrel of his 
           rifle, tense but ready.

           A MAN emerges from the truck, carrying something large.

           MacKiernan and Frank keep their rifles trained, until the man 
           moves through the smoke, and they realize...

           ...it’s Vasili, carrying the dead body of Leo. The truck is 
           the same one he was taken away in. 

                                 MACKIERNAN (CONT’D)
                            (stunned)
                        Vasili?

           Vasili is COVERED WITH BLOOD. He tosses MacKiernan’s 
           bloodstained BOWIE KNIFE at his feet. 

           Frank peers into the back of the truck, shocked at the sight 
           of SIX DEAD SOLDIERS inside. 

           Vasili killed them all. 

                                 FRANK
                        Holy Christ.

           Vasili takes in the devastation of the camp - the bodies, the 
           dead horses. Osman’s lifeless eyes stare at Vasili, as if 
           confirming what he already knows.  This is his fault. 

           Vasili falls to his knees and clutches Leo’s body close, 
           distraught. MacKiernan lays a hand on Vasili’s shoulder.

                                 MACKIERNAN
                            (in Russian)
                        We need to leave.

           MacKiernan begins walking out of the camp. Vasili follows, 
           carrying the body of Leo. Frank grabs his gear and follows.
           EXT. HIGH RIDGE - EVENING

           As the sun sets over the stunning Kara Gobi mountains, Vasili 
           smooths the dirt over the freshly-dug GRAVE of Leo. 

           MacKiernan and Frank watch as Vasili uses leather straps to 
           make a CROSS out of two pieces of wood. He wedges it into the 
           earth as a marker, then closes his eyes in silent prayer.

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Now do you understand why we’re 
                        doing this? Now that you’ve seen 
                        what these people are capable of?

           Frank looks at him in utter disbelief.

                                 FRANK
                        I can’t believe how delusional you 
                        are, Mac. You pulled Osman’s people 
                        into your chess game with the 
                        Russians, and they’re all dead. If 
                        you think I’ll help you do the same 
                        to Tibet, you’re out of your mind. 

           MacKiernan grabs Frank roughly.

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        You’re gonna do your goddamn job, 
                        Frank, or they all died for 
                        nothing. 

                                 FRANK
                        They did die for nothing! 

           MacKiernan SHOVES Frank to the ground and nods at Vasili, 
           still kneeling over Leo’s grave, eyes red with rage.

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        If he understood English, you’d be 
                        dead right now. 

                                 FRANK
                        If you understood that we don’t 
                        belong here, they’d all be alive.

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Tibet’s going to be slaughtered, 
                        Frank. You don’t even want to warn 
                        them?

                                 FRANK
                        You’re not doing this to warn them, 
                        you’re doing this to ARM them!
                                 MACKIERNAN
                        To give them a fighting chance! Who 
                        wouldn’t want that?

                                 FRANK
                        Buddhists!!

           MacKiernan clenches his fists, resisting the urge to beat the 
           shit out of Frank.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        What if the Dalai Lama says no, 
                        Mac? Will the CIA even care?
                            (MacKiernan is silent)
                        If he won’t fight our battles for 
                        us, you’ll find some Tibetans who 
                        will. More “freedom fighters” like 
                        Osman. And you’ll have that 
                        slaughter you’re so worried about 
                        because you’ll have caused it. 

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        We can’t just let the Soviets march 
                        across the globe, Frank. We have to 
                        make a stand. 

                                 FRANK
                        So let’s make a stand! US! Don’t 
                        make Tibetans do it for us!

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        That’s a nuclear war you’re talking 
                        about. Are you prepared for that? 
                        I’m not. My daughter’s not. Your 
                        family’s not. They will all BURN.
                            (Frank is silent)
                        It’s one or the other, Frank, a hot 
                        war or a cold one. It’s up to US. 
                        So what’s it gonna be? 

           Frank stares out over the forbidding tundra. Storm clouds 
           pulse with lightning in the distance.

                                 FRANK
                        It’s just the three of us now. 
                        Maybe it’s time to stop kidding 
                        ourselves that we’re even going to 
                        make it to Tibet.

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        If you want to lie down and die, 
                        Frank, you go right ahead. I’m 
                        completing my mission.
           MacKiernan walks over to comfort Vasili, leaving Frank alone 
           on the cliff top, conflicted.

           EXT. OSMAN’ CAMP - NIGHT

           Smoke swirls through the burning remains of Osman’s camp. 
           Communist soldiers move through the smoke, guns raised. 

           Marko is among them, checking corpses for MacKiernan, but 
           finding only Osman’s people.

           Spotting MacKiernan’s leather MAP TUBE, Marko picks it up and 
           flips through the maps, curious.

                                 DIMA (O.S.)
                        Marko.

           Marko sees Dima standing nearby, looking down at a 

           GOLD BAR 

           on the ground, shimmering in the firelight. The gold is 
           stamped with the seal of the US TREASURY. 

                                 DIMA (CONT’D)
                        MacKiernan was here.

                                 MARKO
                            (looks around)
                        There are three more horses than 
                        bodies. MacKiernan and two others 
                        are on foot. 

           Dima leans down to pick up the GOLD BAR...

                                 MARKO (CONT’D)
                        Leave it. 

           Dima reluctantly obeys and follows Marko out of the camp. 

                                 DIMA
                        Why should we leave gold?

           Behind them, a CHINESE SOLDIER picks up the gold bar. The 
           PLING!! of a GRENADE TRIGGER flying loose, and... 

           BOOM - The Soldier EXPLODES!! 

           Marko and Dima look back at the smoking crater, grim.
                                 MARKO
                        That’s why. 

                                                               FADE TO:

           EXT. KARA GOBI MOUNTAINS - DAWN

           The first fingers of dawn reach over the mountains.

           MacKiernan, Frank and Vasili kneel by the fire, looking over 
           the MAP of their route. 

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        We’ll head south along the border 
                        with Turkestan, staying in the 
                        hills for cover. Then over the 
                        plains to the Chaing Tang plateau. 
                        Bam, we’re in Tibet.

                                 FRANK
                        That’s a long way to walk. 

           MacKiernan thinks for a moment, then rises, smiling.

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Good thinking, Frank, let’s do it. 

           Frank watches him go, confused.

                                 FRANK
                        Do what?

           EXT. REMOTE FARM - MORNING

           MacKiernan, Frank and Vasili crouch in the trees, looking 
           down at an ISOLATED FARMHOUSE. HORSES are visible through the 
           slats of a BARN.

                                 FRANK
                        I’m not taking horses from people 
                        who have nothing.

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Fine. You can wait here.

           Frank frowns as MacKiernan and Vasili head toward the barn. 

           TIME CUT TO

           MacKiernan and Vasili quietly approach the barn. MacKiernan 
           tries the door, but it’s locked with a rusty PADLOCK. 
                                 MACKIERNAN (CONT’D)
                        Damn. 

           They back up and examine the barn. No other way in. 
           MacKiernan spots an AX and picks it up, feeling its weight.

                                 MACKIERNAN (CONT’D)
                        So much for stealth. 
                            (in Russian)
                        When I break the lock, grab the 
                        first three horses you see. Ready?

           Vasili nods. MacKiernan rears back with the ax and SWINGS! 
           The LOCK SHATTERS!

                                 MACKIERNAN (CONT’D)
                        Go!

           Vasili yanks the double-doors back, revealing...

                                 FRANK (O.S.)
                        Hey, guys.

           Frank, holding three horses and smiling. With him is a 
           SINKIANGESE WOMAN, who looks about 100 years old.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        This is Shen Mai, she just sold me 
                        some horses. 

           Shen Mai gives a toothless grin and holds up a GOLD BAR. 

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        I’m going to murder you, Frank. 

                                 FRANK
                            (to Vasili, mimics eating)
                        She made breakfast. Come on in.

           Vasili grunts hungrily and follows Shen Mai inside, but 
           MacKiernan just stares at Frank, furious.

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        You know how many goddamn horses we 
                        should get for that gold?

                                 FRANK
                        How many?

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        A HERD, Frank! A fucking herd of 
                        thoroughbred stallions!
                                 FRANK
                        Well, it bought us three nags and 
                        breakfast. 
                            (points)
                        And a lock.

           He smiles and heads inside.

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        This had better be a goddamn great 
                        breakfast. 

           EXT. TURKESTAN PLAINS - DAY

           Frank, MacKiernan and Vasili ride swiftly over foothills on 
           their new horses, as clouds race across the blue sky.

           TIME CUT

           It’s later. The weary riders traverse a wide field. 
           MacKiernan notices Frank’s eyes starting to close with 
           exhaustion.

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        You can sleep when you’re dead in 
                        Arlington, Frank. Wake up. 

           Frank rubs his eyes. 

                                 FRANK
                        Guys like us don’t get buried in 
                        Arlington, Mac. What would they 
                        even put on the tombstone? “Here 
                        lies ‘redacted’?”

           MacKiernan snorts a laugh.

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        “Redacted gave his life to save the 
                        good people of Need-to-Know Basis.”

           The two both crack up. After a moment...

                                 FRANK
                        What would happen if we die over 
                        here? What would Gail even get?

           MacKiernan’s smiles fades at the thought. 

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        A flag, a check, and no answers.
                                 FRANK
                        Does it bother you, the thought of 
                        dying for something no one can ever 
                        know about?

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        I’m not in this for parades, Frank. 

           Frank studies MacKiernan for a moment. For all of his 
           bravado, this guy really isn’t about ego. 

                                 VASILI (O.S.)
                        Volka.

           They both see Vasili nodding up toward the hills, and they 
           look as well.

           A large WOLF is watching them from the top of a rocky 
           outcropping. Mangy. Feral. Starving. 

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Let’s pick up the pace. 

           They ride off, as a SECOND WOLF joins the first, watching 
           them hungrily.

                                                               FADE TO:

           INT. RUSSIAN CONSULATE - BASEMENT - NIGHT

           In a dark basement, Marko stands over a badly-beaten Tuka, 
           who is slumped against a wall. One of Tuka’s hands is tied to 
           a pipe, the other is SKETCHING shakily on a piece of paper 
           (difficult with broken fingers). 

           Tuka slides the sketch toward Marko, who picks it up 
           gingerly, disgusted by the blood on it. 

           The sketch is of FRANK’S FACE. 

                                 MARKO
                            (in Mongolian)
                        This is the man with MacKiernan? 
                            (Tuka nods weakly)
                        You spent time with him in De’s 
                        camp. Why was he there?

                                 TUKA
                        I’ve told you, I don’t know...

                                 MARKO
                        Then I see no reason to keep you 
                        alive, Tuka.
           Marko slides a HANDGUN from his coat.

                                 TUKA
                        I don’t know who he was! He  
                        claimed to be some sort of scholar.

                                 DIMA (O.S.)
                        An anthropologist?

           Tuka and Marko see Dima standing in the doorway. 

                                 DIMA (CONT’D)
                            (to Marko, in Russian)
                        I spoke to Beijing. Only one 
                        American visa fits the description. 
                            (hands Marko a PHOTO)
                        Frank Bessac. An anthropologist.

           Marko holds the photo next to Tuka’s bloodstained sketch. 
           It’s a match. 

                                 MARKO
                        What would MacKiernan want with a 
                        scholar?

           A KNOCK on the door. Dima opens it, revealing a FEMALE AIDE 
           (who is careful not to look at Tuka). 

                                 AIDE
                        Sir, it’s General Kovalev.

                                 MARKO
                            (moves toward a WALL PHONE)
                        Put him through down here. 

                                 AIDE
                        No, sir. He’s at the gate.

           Marko STOPS COLD and meets eyes with Dima, concerned. Marko 
           heads for the door, SHOOTING TUKA DEAD as he passes. 

           The horrified Aide keeps her eyes averted as Marko brushes by 
           her.

           EXT. RUSSIAN CONSULATE - NIGHT

           Marko and Dima emerge from the Consulate’s front door, as...

           A BLACK CAR pulls into the driveway. A driver opens the rear 
           door, and out steps GENERAL YURI KOVALEV (60, wearing a 
           pristine Red Army uniform laden with medals). 
                                 MARKO
                            (in Russian)
                        General Kovalev, welcome. 

           Yuri gives Marko a look that could cut glass and walks past 
           without a word. Marko and Dima follow him inside. 

           INT. RUSSIAN CONSULATE - NIGHT

           Yuri studies the photo of MacKiernan, frowning.

                                 YURI
                        So, this is the spy who exposed our 
                        nuclear program. 
                            (looks at Marko)
                        Premier Stalin is extremely upset 
                        that you let this man slip through 
                        your fingers. 

           Marko says nothing. Yuri pours himself a glass of vodka.

                                 YURI (CONT’D)
                        You are my nephew and a good man, 
                        Marko, but this situation is 
                        clearly beyond the limited 
                        capabilities of the KGB.

                                 MARKO
                        There is still time...

                                 YURI
                        I’m relieving you.
                            (Marko is stunned)
                        Don’t be mad, Marko. When I need 
                        someone strangled in an alley, I 
                        know who to call. You’re dismissed.

                                 MARKO
                        As you wish, general. 
                            (turns to Dima)
                        Dima, please show the general what 
                        we know.

           Dima opens a locked file cabinet and pulls out a FOLDER. He 
           lays it on the table, and Yuri opens it. 

           Inside is a photo of a YOUNG VASILI in a Red Army uniform.

                                 YURI
                        What is this?
                                 MARKO
                        Vasili Zvansov, a fugitive who 
                        escaped our custody yesterday.

           Yuri looks at him, amused.

                                 YURI
                        You wear your failures like a badge 
                        of honor, Marko.

                                 MARKO
                        Vasili was once a sniper under your 
                        command, was he not?

           Yuri is silent. Where’s Marko going with this?

                                 MARKO (CONT’D)
                        Following the death of his wife, 
                        Vasili defected. But not before 
                        assassinating Premier Stalin’s own 
                        cousin, General Kirov, while he was 
                        on an unscheduled fishing trip. 
                            (beat)
                        It was quite the mystery how Vasili 
                        knew where to find him.

                                 YURI
                        He did us a favor. Kirov was 
                        incompetent.

                                 MARKO
                        Indeed. You have been a far more 
                        capable replacement. 

           Marko slides out SURVEILLANCE PHOTOS of YURI sitting in a car 
           in a dark parking lot, talking with a YOUNGER VASILI. 

                                 MARKO (CONT’D)
                        Which is why the KGB, with our... 
                        what was it?

                                 DIMA
                        “Limited capabilities.”

                                 MARKO
                        ...let you get away with it. 
                            (smiles)
                        For now.

           Yuri PALES as he stares at the photos. Marko glances at Dima.
                                 MARKO (CONT’D)
                        What do you suppose is the 
                        punishment for murdering a member 
                        of Stalin’s family?

                                 DIMA
                        I imagine it’s severe, sir.

           Yuri slowly sits, the color draining from his face. Marko 
           leans in, looking directly into Yuri’s eyes.

                                 MARKO
                        You’re going to give me everything 
                        I need to find and kill MacKiernan. 
                        Is that understood?

           Yuri nods slowly, shocked.

                                 MARKO (CONT’D)
                        I appreciate the visit, uncle.
                            (beat)
                        You’re dismissed.

           Yuri slowly rises and walks out of the room. Dima can barely 
           contain his smile at what he just witnessed. 

           Marko, however, is all business - he stares at MacKiernan’s 
           MAPS spread out on the table. 

                                 MARKO (CONT’D)
                        We’re overlooking something, Dima.

                                 DIMA
                        If the answer were on the maps, 
                        MacKiernan would not have left them 
                        behind.

           Marko GOES STILL. Dima’s comment has given him an idea. 

                                 MARKO
                        You’re right.

           He begins ARRANGING THE MAPS in correct geographic order, 
           forming a large SQUARE, showing all of western China, Russia, 
           Kazakhstan and Turkestan.

                                 MARKO (CONT’D)
                        He didn’t leave his maps behind...

           There’s ONE MAP MISSING from the square, like a lost puzzle 
           piece. The one MacKiernan must have taken with him. 

                                 MARKO (CONT’D)
                        He kept the one he needed.
           The missing map leads due south... 

                                 MARKO (CONT’D)
                        That’s why he needs a scholar, 
                        Dima.
                            (beat)
                        He’s going to Tibet.

                                                               FADE TO:

           EXT. MOUNTAIN PASS - DAWN

           It’s DAWN. Frank stirs awake by the smoldering remains of the 
           campfire. MacKiernan remains asleep. 

           Frank pulls on his glasses and spots Vasili standing watch on 
           a rock outcropping at the far end of a NARROW PATH WITH HIGH 
           ROCK WALLS on both sides.

           Frank walks the length of the narrow path to the end and 
           climbs up to Vasili. 

           The view is stunning in the golden light of dawn. Frank takes 
           a seat next to Vasili and looks out over the vast plain. 

                                 FRANK
                        I’ll keep watch. Why don’t you go 
                        get some sleep?

           Vasili doesn’t understand the words but gets the meaning. He 
           points out at the SUNRISE.

                                 VASILI
                        How to say?

                                 FRANK
                        Sunrise.

           Vasili nods, staring out at the stunning golden sunlight.

                                 VASILI
                        When you no see...

           He taps his temple - remember.

                                 FRANK
                        Thanks, Vasili. I will.

           As Vasili leaves, he hands Frank his rifle and points to...

           ...a nearby hilltop, where there are now FOUR WOLVES watching 
           them patiently, silhouetted against the sunrise.
                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Jesus.

           TIME CUT

           Frank reads “War and Peace”, occasionally casting a glance at 
           the wolves, who remain motionless, biding their time.

           A faint whup-whup-whup sound arises. Frank looks around, 
           curious.

           BACK AT THE CAMPSITE

           MacKiernan and Vasili stir, hearing the sound as well. 

           ON THE RIDGE

           Frank peers through the rifle scope and sees.... 

           ...a CHINESE MILITARY HELICOPTER flying low over the steppes 
           in their direction.

                                 MACKIERNAN (O.S.)
                        Frank, we’ve got company! Get back 
                        here now!

           Frank slings his rifle over his shoulder and VAULTS DOWN into 
           the NARROW PATH leading back to the camp. He then realizes...

                                 FRANK
                        What the hell?

           He landed in a pile of ANIMAL SHIT that wasn’t there before.  

           Frank slowly turns and pales, seeing... 

           ...a MASSIVE MOUNTAIN YAK blocking the narrow path, filling 
           the space between the rock walls on either side. Coarse fur. 
           Thick horns. Spittle drips from its mouth.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Oh... shit.

           AT THE CAMPSITE

           MacKiernan and Vasili lead the horses under cover and look 
           out at the approaching helicopter, concerned. 

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Frank, move your ass!

           IN THE NARROW PATH
           Frank stares at the yak, and the yak stares back. No way 
           around; the rock walls of the path go straight up. 

           Frank aims the rifle at the yak, conflicted. 

                                 FRANK
                        Move.
                            (the yak just stares)
                        MOVE.

           The yak steps toward him, and Frank steps back. 

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        I’ve got a problem, Mac!

           The sound of the helicopter grows louder. It’s getting near.

           AT THE ENTRANCE TO THE PATH

           MacKiernan runs to the entrance of the narrow path and stops 
           short, seeing the giant yak cornering Frank at the far end. 

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Jesus, Frank... shoot it!

                                 FRANK
                        I’m a bad shot!

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        It’s five goddamn feet away! Aim 
                        for the forehead and pull the 
                        trigger!

           The yak snorts and takes a step toward Frank, who edges back, 
           bumping up against the rock wall behind him. 

                                 MACKIERNAN (CONT’D)
                        You can do it, Frank. 

           Frank aims as best he can through his cracked glasses... 

           Frank FIRES. The yak’s head JERKS sideways. 

           Frank breathes a sigh of relief and waits for the yak to 
           fall, but...

           ...the yak slowly looks at him angrily, with a CHUNK OF ITS 
           HORN MISSING. 

           Frank PALES. At the far end, MacKiernan stares in disbelief.

                                 MACKIERNAN (CONT’D)
                        Not good.
           AT THE CAMPSITE

           Vasili scrambles under cover as the helicopter draws closer. 
           They’re almost out of time!

           IN THE NARROW PATH

           The yak LUNGES at Frank and HURLS HIM with its horns! Frank 
           is flung over the yak and lands hard on the far side. 

           Frank looks up from the dirt, realizing he’s now got a 
           straight shot to the far end of the path!

                                 MACKIERNAN (CONT’D)
                        Haul ass!

           The yak furiously turns and CHARGES Frank!

           Frank jumps to his feet and sprints toward the other end of 
           the path, where MacKiernan is crouched, aiming his rifle. 

                                 MACKIERNAN (CONT’D)
                        Run straight, Frank!

           MacKiernan begins FIRING RIGHT PAST FRANK at the yak.

                                 FRANK
                            (covering his head)
                        Jesus Christ, Mac!!

           Bullets whiz past Frank, missing him by inches. 

           The charging yak takes the bullets in its thick hide. THUNK-
           THUNK! Is it doing any damage? Who the fuck knows, but it’s 
           almost on Frank!

           Frank DIVES OVER MacKiernan, who holds his ground and KEEPS 
           SHOOTING! The charging yak finally CRASHES to the ground, 
           skidding to a dusty stop in front of MacKiernan, DEAD.

           MacKiernan and Frank duck under cover as...

           ...the HELICOPTER passes overhead. Communist soldiers are 
           perched on both landing skids, studying the landscape below. 

           Frank and MacKiernan watch the helicopter soar past, not 
           moving a muscle.

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Looks like Marko knows we’re headed 
                        south.

           The helicopter descends and LANDS on the grassy plains, down 
           the rocky slope from their position.
                                 FRANK
                        Did they see us?

           Two COMMUNIST SOLDIERS climb out, one lugging an M-60 MACHINE 
           GUN. The other starts hauling SANDBAGS from the helicopter. 
           The two begin erecting a PILLBOX NEST. 

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        They’re lookouts. 

           The helicopter departs, as the two soldiers keep building 
           their pillbox. 

                                 MACKIERNAN (CONT’D)
                        Can’t go around them, they can see 
                        twenty miles from there.

           Vasili makes a “throat slit” gesture.

                                 MACKIERNAN (CONT’D)
                        No, they’ll know we came this way. 
                        And it’s all open country after 
                        this. They’ll run us down.

           The three men stare down at the pillbox, thinking.

                                 FRANK
                        I might have an idea.

           Vasili and MacKiernan glance at him, curious.

           EXT. MACHINE GUN NEST - NIGHT

           Moonlight shines down on the two Communist soldiers as they 
           scan the vast tundra with binoculars. 

           Behind them, Vasili SILENTLY CLIMBS down the rock face like a 
           spider, bag slung on his back, eyes locked on the two 
           soldiers. He doesn’t make a sound, a skill born of years of 
           stealthy mountaineering. 

           Vasili drops to the ground. One of the soldiers turns and 
           shines a flashlight back, but there’s no sign of Vasili. 

           Vasili is pressed up against the sandbags, only inches away 
           from the soldiers.

           The Soldier clicks off the flashlight and resumes studying 
           the moonlit plains. 
           EXT. CLIFF - NIGHT

           MacKiernan and Frank peer down from the top of the 
           outcropping. 

                                 FRANK
                        Do you see Vasili?

           Suddenly, Vasili CLIMBS into view right in front of them, 
           startling both men.

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Is it done?

                                 VASILI
                            (smiles)
                        Dasvidania.

           EXT. MACHINE GUN NEST - NIGHT

           Stars move across the sky as hours pass.

           It’s now the middle of the night. The two Communist soldiers 
           smoke cigarettes and scan the moonlit plains.

           SOLDIER 1 sniffs the air, curious, then mutters something to 
           the other soldier.

           Soldier 1 leans out of the machine gun nest, sniffing again.

           He reaches down, and when he pulls his hand back... it’s 
           covered with BLOOD. 

                                 SOLDIER 1
                        Zhuyi li!

           They AIM their guns down over the sandbags, alert.

           Soldier 1 reaches down and pulls up a BLOODY HUNK OF YAK MEAT 
           (from the yak that MacKiernan killed).

           Soldier 2 clicks on the flashlight and their eyes go WIDE. 
           There’s yak blood and guts all around the machine gun nest!

           They then hear... DEEP, GUTTERAL GROWLING. 

           Soldier 2 shines the light out and goes pale....

           SIX WOLVES SURROUND THE PILLBOX, JAWS DRIPPING. 

                                 SOLDIER 2
                        Sheji!
           They OPEN FIRE with their rifles, but the WOLVES LEAP ONTO 
           THEM, SNARLING, ripping flesh apart!

           UP ON THE CLIFF ABOVE

           MacKiernan and Vasili watch the grisly scene, then glance at 
           Frank, impressed.

           EXT. PLAINS - NIGHT

           MacKiernan, Frank and Vasili gallop swiftly across the plains 
           under a sky full of stars.

                                                               FADE TO:

           EXT. RUSSIAN CONSULATE - DAY

           Marko eats breakfast on the patio of the Russian consulate. 
           Dima emerges from inside.

                                 DIMA
                        Our lookouts report no sightings of 
                        MacKiernan and Bessac. 

                                 MARKO
                        All have checked in?

                                 DIMA
                        All but one, which was attacked by 
                        animals. 

                                 MARKO
                        Where?

           Dima unfolds a map and points to a spot only 20 miles from 
           the Tibetan border. Marko’s eyes narrow.

                                 MARKO (CONT’D)
                        They’re going to cross the border 
                        here. 

                                 DIMA
                        Shall I arrange transport?

           Marko points into the distant sky. 

                                 MARKO
                        I already have. 

           A HELICOPTER is headed their way, but this is no ordinary 
           chopper...
           It’s a FIRST-GENERATION SIKORSKY MI-4 GUNSHIP. Remember the 
           giant, hornet-shaped attack helicopters the Soviets used in 
           Afghanistan in the ‘80s - the ones Rambo fought?

           This is the original; the one that started it all. 

           Air-to-surface missiles, twin 50-cal machine guns - this 
           thing is fucking NASTY.

                                 DIMA
                        What on earth is that?

                                 MARKO
                        The future, Dima. 

           Marko shields his eyes as the huge helicopter LANDS. 

           A DOZEN RED ARMY SPECIAL FORCES SOLDIERS climb off, armed to 
           the teeth. The SERGEANT salutes Marko smartly.

                                 SERGEANT
                        General Kovalev sends his regards. 

           Marko smiles coldly, as Dima stares at the helicopter in 
           disbelief. 

           EXT. CHAING TANG PLATEAU - DAY

           MacKiernan, Vasili and Frank stand on a vast, grassy field, 
           facing something we can’t see. 

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        There it is, Frank. The Tibetan 
                        border. 
                            (puts an arm around Frank)
                        I’m proud of you. I’m proud of US. 

           Frank simply stares ahead, head cocked to one side. 

                                 FRANK
                        Mac?

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Yeah?

                                 FRANK
                        Remember back when we first met, 
                        and you kept lying to me about 
                        where we were going?

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Good times. 
                                 FRANK
                        But then you finally leveled with 
                        me and told me the truth? 

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Honesty is the best policy. 

                                 FRANK
                        That would have been a great time 
                        to mention this. 

           Pan to reveal...

           A MASSIVE GRANITE CLIFF ahead of them, 200 feet STRAIGHT UP. 
           Wind whistles across the rock face. Hawks SCREECH near the 
           top, so high up they’re barely visible.

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        I assumed you knew. You’re the 
                        Tibet expert.

                                 FRANK
                        Their culture, Mac! How the hell 
                        are we supposed to get up this?

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        How do you normally get up a cliff?

                                 FRANK
                        I don’t!

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Look, down here is China, up there 
                        is Tibet. Simple as that.

           The cliff stretches to the horizon in both directions; no way 
           around. MacKiernan removes his horse’s rope bridle and rubs 
           the horse’s snout.

                                 MACKIERNAN (CONT’D)
                        Pal, you were worth all half-
                        million of taxpayer money Frank 
                        spent on you. 
                            (Frank rolls his eyes)
                        But now you’re free. Go eat grass 
                        and make little horses.

           MacKiernan smacks it on the ass, and the horse trots away. 
           Vasili and Frank do the same with their horses.

                                 MACKIERNAN (CONT’D)
                            (to Vasili, in Russian)
                        Got a route picked out yet?
           Vasili points, tracing a climbing route with his finger.

                                 FRANK
                        Mac, this is insane. I don’t know 
                        how to rock climb!

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Relax, I don’t either. 

                                 FRANK
                        That doesn’t make me feel better. 

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Fine, Frank, you win. We’ll wait 
                        here while you go get a PHD in rock-
                        climbing.

           Vasili ties the horse ropes together into ONE LONG ROPE, then 
           fastens one end around Frank’s waist.

           Vasili ties the middle of the rope around MacKiernan’s waist, 
           then fastens the other end to himself. 

                                 MACKIERNAN (CONT’D)
                        If you get a good foothold, rest on 
                        it. Vasili’s taking us the easiest 
                        route he can, aren’t you, Vasili?

           Vasili nods, staring up at the cliff.

                                 FRANK
                        He doesn’t even know what you just 
                        said!

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        That’s how confident he is.  

           Vasili begins climbing up the rock face. He’s a natural. 
           MacKiernan then follows. 

                                 FRANK
                        Christ...

           Frank takes a deep breath and begins climbing.

           TIME CUT TO

           The men are 100 feet off the ground, looking like tiny specks 
           against the massive cliff wall. It’s slow going, arduous and 
           exhausting. Every inch of progress is a hard-fought victory.

           TIME CUT TO
           The three men are now 20 feet from the top of the cliff, 
           draped in swirling mist. 

           Hearing something over the wind, Vasili looks back. The 
           tundra seems clear. Where’s the sound coming from?

           He glances west, seeing...

           ...a CHINESE MILITARY JEEP in the distance, driving along the 
           base of the cliff. Four communist soldiers are inside - one 
           stares up at the cliff wall with BINOCULARS as they drive.

           Vasili whistles to MacKiernan and points at the Jeep. 

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Damn it.
                            (peers upward)
                        We won’t make it to the top in 
                        time.

           Vasili points to a VERTICAL CREVASSE to their right. They can 
           hide there. 

                                 MACKIERNAN (CONT’D)
                        Frank, get to that gap, now.

           Frank carefully edges along the cliff face and maneuvers his 
           body into the crevasse, finding a tentative foothold. 

           Vasili does the same, but MacKiernan can’t find any holds 
           between him and the crevasse - just ONE JUTTING BOULDER 
           that’s out of reach of his fingers. 

           The Jeep is getting closer. He’ll be spotted any second. 

                                 FRANK
                        Mac, hurry.

           Taking a deep breath, MacKiernan JUMPS and grabs the 
           boulder... WHICH RIPS FREE of the wall! 

           Frank is nearly HIT by the 100 lb falling rock, then sees 
           MacKiernan skidding down the rock face!

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Vasili, hold on!!

           Vasili grips the cliff wall, but MacKiernan’s weight JERKS 
           VASILI FREE, and the two men PLUMMET PAST FRANK! 

           Thinking quickly, Frank WEDGES THE ROPE into a fissure in the 
           rock wall. The wedged rope goes TAUT, brutally STOPPING 
           Vasili and MacKiernan’s fall!
           They look up, stunned. Frank just saved their lives. 

           But the Jeep is almost beneath them - they’re gonna get 
           spotted!

           Mac and Vasili quickly swing their dangling bodies into the 
           crevasse below Frank. They did it - they’re hidden.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Mac... what about the rock?

           They look down, seeing the FALLING BOULDER hurtling down 
           toward the approaching jeep! 

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Oh crap.

           IN THE JEEP - BINOCULAR SOLDIER peers upwards at the wall and 
           PALES, seeing a boulder streaking down at him!

           He lunges out of the way as the rock SMASHES into the Jeep, 
           busting a HOLE right through the floor! 

           The driver slams on the brakes, and the four soldiers aim 
           their guns up at the cliff wall, scanning carefully.

           Is somebody up there?

           Frank, MacKiernan and Vasili remain motionless in the 
           crevasse, barely daring to breathe.

           Frank, gripping the rope tight, notices that the ROPE is 
           FRAYING where he wedged it into the fissure.

                                 FRANK
                            (whispers)
                        Mac...

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Quiet, Frank.

                                 FRANK
                        The rope is going.

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Don’t move.

           Frank looks at the fraying rope - shit, shit, shit....

           The soldiers study the wall above, seeing nothing. They climb 
           back into the jeep and fire up the engine.

           MacKiernan and Vasili watch the jeep drive off, but Frank’s 
           eyes remain locked on the fraying rope! 
                                 FRANK
                        Mac, the rope is gonna...!

           The rope SNAPS! Vasili immediately grabs hold of the wall and 
           snags MacKiernan by the hand, saving his life. But he doesn’t 
           have a hand free to grab...

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Frank!

           Frank plunges down the rock face past them, but at the last 
           minute, Frank manages to grab hold of the wall!

           In doing so, however... his GLASSES ARE JOSTLED FREE, 
           DANGLING from just one ear!

           Frank GOES STILL, but he has no hand free to grab the 
           glasses, which hang precariously from his ear. He tries to 
           BITE the other end of the glasses...

           ...but they FALL, spinning away in the wind. 

                                 FRANK
                        No!

           Frank looks up the rock face, seeing no handholds or 
           footholds, just a grey BLUR. 

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        What happened, Frank?

                                 FRANK
                        My glasses fell!

           MacKiernan and Vasili look at each other. This is bad. 

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        We’re not far from the top! Vasili 
                        and I will get up there and lower 
                        the rope, you just stay put!

           Vasili and MacKiernan scramble up the final twenty feet to 
           the top of the cliff and untie the rope around their waists. 

                                 MACKIERNAN (CONT’D)
                        We’re sending the rope down!

           They feed the rope down toward Frank, but it’s not long 
           enough. Shit.

                                 MACKIERNAN (CONT’D)
                        Frank, the rope’s about six feet 
                        above you. Can you see it?
                                 FRANK
                        I don’t see anything!

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        It’s there, I promise. You can do 
                        this. 

           Frank feels around with his hands, searching for a handhold. 
           He carefully pulls himself up, hyperventilating. 

                                 MACKIERNAN (CONT’D)
                        That’s good! Three more feet.

           Frank reaches up, feeling blindly for the rope, but finding 
           nothing. His arms tremble, exhausted. His grip is slipping. 
           This is it - he’s going to fall to his death.

                                 MACKIERNAN (CONT’D)
                        Move your hand to the lef...

           Frank SLIPS but makes a blind grab, SNAGGING THE ROPE!

                                 MACKIERNAN (CONT’D)
                        Hold on!

           MacKiernan and Vasili pull hard, dragging Frank the rest of 
           the way up the cliff. MacKiernan hauls him over the edge, and  
           Frank slumps to the ground, exhausted. 

           MacKiernan smiles proudly....

                                 MACKIERNAN (CONT’D)
                        Welcome to Tibet, Frank.

           The three men turn and stare at beautiful GRASSY HILLS ahead 
           of them. And in the distance... the HIMALAYAS.

           They made it. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. PLATEAU CAMPSITE - NIGHT

           MacKiernan sits by a crackling fire, whittling the CARVING of 
           Gail on the pony. It’s nearly finished.

           Frank glances over at the carving, unable to see it clearly 
           without his glasses.

                                 FRANK
                        I’ve got it. It’s a camel. 
                            (points)
                        Four legs, hump...
                                 MACKIERNAN
                        It’s not a camel, Frank.

           He keeps working on it, adding fine detail to Gail’s eyes and 
           hair. Frank pulls out “War and Peace” and squints to read.

                                 MACKIERNAN (CONT’D)
                        How’s the book?

                                 FRANK
                        Blurry.

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        For Christ’s sake, give it here.

           Frank hands the book over to MacKiernan, who begins to read.

                                 MACKIERNAN (CONT’D)
                        “It is not given to man to know 
                        what is right and what is wrong” 
                        urged the prince. “Men always did 
                        and always will err, and in nothing 
                        more than in what they consider 
                        right and wrong...”
                            (rolls his eyes)
                        Jesus, no wonder you like this 
                        crap.

           Frank smiles. MacKiernan looks out over the mountains, seeing 
           the first fingers of DAWN arising. 

                                 MACKIERNAN (CONT’D)
                        The sun’ll be up soon.
                            (points)
                        The map says there’s a river just 
                        over that ridge, which leads 
                        straight to Lhasa. We can be there 
                        within a day.

           Frank pokes at the fire for a moment. 

                                 FRANK
                        I’m not going to Lhasa, Mac.

           MacKiernan sits up, frowning.

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Don’t start, Frank. You’re gonna 
                        meet with the Dalai Lama and 
                        fulfill your mission.

                                 FRANK
                        It’s not my mission, it’s yours.
                                 MACKIERNAN
                        My mission is to make you do yours, 
                        and I intend to. We have to help 
                        these people!

                                 FRANK
                        Like we helped Osman? And Irina? 
                        And Leo? Hell, Vasili would be dead 
                        if he weren’t completely 
                        unkillable. 

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        So what, you just want to let Tibet 
                        get slaughtered?

                                 FRANK
                        If the communists DO invade Tibet, 
                        I’ll have to live with that. But I 
                        will not wreck everything Tibet 
                        stands for preemptively, under the 
                        pretense of saving it! 

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        You are in complete denial about 
                        the world you live in, Frank. 

                                 FRANK
                        Don’t you realize it’s gonna keep 
                        happening, Mac? The CIA will keep 
                        arming “freedom fighters” to do our 
                        dirty work until we’ve stuck our 
                        dick into so many hornets’ nests 
                        that it falls off!
                            (beat)
                        You wanna talk denial? How about 
                        thinking you can control people you 
                        know nothing about by giving them 
                        WEAPONS? This path will bite us in 
                        the ass someday. I hope you realize 
                        that before it’s too late.

           Frank puts “War and Peace” into his bag and rises to leave. 

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        You’re going to Lhasa if I have to 
                        drag you there. 

                                 FRANK
                        Goodbye, Mac.  

           Frank starts walking. MacKiernan jumps to his feet and GRABS 
           Frank. The two FALL TO THE GROUND, grappling with each other.  
           MacKiernan gets the upper hand and begins DRAGGING Frank back 
           to the fire...

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Ungrateful, blind asshole. Maybe 
                        next time read a book that teaches 
                        you how to figh...

           WHAM! Frank SMASHES MacKiernan across the face with “War and 
           Peace”, all 700 pages of it. MacKiernan goes down like a 
           meteor.

           Frank starts walking away again, but MacKiernan groggily 
           rises to his knees and pulls out his GUN. He cocks it and 
           aims at Frank. 

                                 FRANK
                        You gonna shoot me, Mac?

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        You gonna make me?

           Frank meets his eyes.

                                 FRANK
                        Looks that way.

           Frank starts to walk away. MacKiernan takes aim, but Vasili 
           raises a finger...

                                 VASILI
                            (in Russian, concerned)
                        In the arm, please. I’d rather not 
                        carry him.

           MacKiernan fingers the trigger, conflicted, as Frank keeps 
           walking away. Vasili frowns.

                                 VASILI (CONT’D)
                        Would you like for me to shoot him? 
                        I’m happy to.

           MacKiernan lowers the gun. He can’t do it.

           They watch as Frank walks up a grassy hill into the golden 
           light of the rising sun. 

           Frank stops at the top of the hill and turns, meeting eyes 
           with MacKiernan one last time. 

           He then disappears over the top of the hill. MacKiernan looks 
           down, frustrated. 

           To come all this way, only to fail.
                                 MACKIERNAN
                        What the hell do we do now?

           After a moment, though, Vasili taps him on the arm and 
           points. MacKiernan looks up.

           Frank is RUNNING back down the hill toward them!

                                 MACKIERNAN (CONT’D)
                            (grins)
                        You giant pussy, I knew you 
                        wouldn’t leave!

           But Frank’s face is WHITE WITH TERROR!

                                 FRANK
                        RUN!!!!

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        What..?

           THE SOVIET ATTACK HELICOPTER RISES INTO VIEW BEHIND FRANK 
           like a huge, angry hornet, with ARMED SOLDIERS clinging to 
           both landing rails! 

                                 MACKIERNAN (CONT’D)
                        Holy shit!

           Frank SPRINTS PAST, not slowing. MacKiernan and Vasili grab 
           their gear and haul ass after him! 

           IN THE HELICOPTER

           Marko and Dima peer down at the three running men. Marko 
           grins coldly. 

                                 MARKO
                            (to the pilot)
                        Kill them.

           The pilot presses a TRIGGER. The helicopter’s TWIN 50-CAL 
           CANNONS ERUPT WITH WHITE HOT FIRE!!

           BULLETS RIP UP THE GROUND all around MacKiernan, Frank and 
           Vasili as they sprint for their lives!

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Head for the river, go, go!!

           They’re sprinting toward the EDGE OF A RAVINE...

                                 FRANK
                        This looks like a cliff, Mac!!
                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Map says it’s a river!

           BULLETS RIP CLOSER as they sprint toward the edge! 

                                 MACKIERNAN (CONT’D)
                        Please be a river.

           The helicopter is almost on them as they BLINDLY LEAP, only 
           then realizing... it IS a cliff!

                                 FRANK
                        Fuuuu....!

           ...DOWN to a river, 50 feet below! They plunge down through 
           the air, legs churning...

           And SPLASH into the frigid water!!

           UNDERWATER

           MacKiernan, Vasili and Frank PLUNGE into the rushing river, 
           and are immediately swept downstream...

           ...except for MacKiernan, whose heavy backpack SNAGS on a 
           GNARLED TREE TRUNK at the bottom. 

           MacKiernan struggles to free himself from the bag, but he 
           can’t wriggle free! He’s TRAPPED UNDERWATER.

           Frank looks back and sees MacKiernan in trouble, but Frank’s 
           being pulled away in the rushing current!

                                                                CUT TO:

           RIVERBANK

           The gunship descends into the ravine. Dima and the Soviet 
           Soldiers disembark and fan out in different directions, 
           scanning the water for MacKiernan, Vasili and Frank.

           Marko remains in the chopper, and he gestures to the pilot. 
           Take us up. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           DOWN RIVER

           Vasili crawls out of the water onto the rocky riverbank.

           BULLETS PING off the rocks near Vasili. Two Soviet soldiers 
           are running toward his position. 

           Vasili ducks into a narrow, dark crevasse for cover. 
           But it’s a DEAD END. The two Soviet soldiers move toward the 
           entrance of the crevasse - they’ve TRAPPED Vasili.

                                                                CUT TO:

           FURTHER DOWNRIVER

           Frank surfaces, sputtering, and looks around. 

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Mac!!

           Frank sees Dima and another Soviet soldier headed his way. 

           Frank DIVES underwater and swims with the current, as BULLETS 
           STREAK through the water, leaving trails of bubbles.

                                                                CUT TO:

           UPRIVER/UNDERWATER

           MacKiernan keeps trying to free himself from the straps of 
           his bag, but he can’t. His lungs are about to burst!

                                                                CUT TO:

           CREVASSE

           The two Soviet soldiers move to either side of the crevasse 
           where Vasili hid. They both jam their machine guns inside and 
           UNLOAD A STORM OF BULLETS!! 

           When the smoke clears, and they look in, but NO VASILI. 

           A WHISTLE from above. Vasili has CLIMBED 20 feet up the 
           crevasse wall! He nods down at their feet, where they see...

           A GRENADE. Vasili shimmies out of sight, as...

           BOOM!! The soldiers are BLASTED BACKWARDS, one landing 
           upriver with a splash! The dead body drifts toward...

                                                                CUT TO:

           UNDERWATER

           ...MacKiernan, who is on the verge of drowning when he sees 
           the dead Soviet soldier drifting past him. 

           He yanks a MILITARY KNIFE from the soldier’s sheath, then 
           SLASHES the hooked strap of his backpack, freeing himself! 

           He swims upward with the bag until he reaches AIR!
           MacKiernan gasps for breath, then looks around. 

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Frank!

                                                                CUT TO:

           DOWN RIVER / UNDERWATER

           Frank still swims underwater with the current, avoiding the 
           bullets streaking through the water around him, when..

           ...TWO MEN CRASH DOWN INTO THE WATER ON TOP OF HIM. It’s Dima 
           and another SOVIET SOLDIER, who grab onto Frank as they 
           tumble through rapids! Dima restrains Frank, as the Soldier 
           pulls a KNIFE! 

           The Soldier is about to stab Frank, when they see...

           ...CHURNING FOAM ahead of them. 

           They’re about to go over a WATERFALL!

           Frank snakes a hand free and grabs onto a rock for dear life! 
           Dima grabs onto Frank’s foot, equally desperate! 

           The Soviet Soldier, however, PLUNGES over the waterfall and 
           falls forty feet, landing on jagged rocks below.

                                                                CUT TO:

           SKY

           The attack helicopter sweeps in a wide arc over the river. 
           Marko crouches in the doorway with a SNIPER RIFLE. 

           He sees MacKiernan crawl out of the river and duck into the 
           trees, chased by a SOVIET SOLDIER.

           Marko gestures to the pilot - Circle around. Head him off. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           WOODS

           MacKiernan races through the trees, still lugging his gold-
           laden bag, as BULLETS HIT TREES all around him. 

           He LEAPS off a 10-foot embankment, grabbing a TREE LIMB to 
           slow his fall. It BENDS, SWINGING MacKiernan down to the 
           ground, where he lands HARD on his back.
           He looks up to see the Soviet Soldier aiming down at him. The 
           Soldier smiles, amused by MacKiernan’s acrobatics.

                                 SOVIET SOLDIER
                            (mocking)
                        “Me Tarzan”...

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        ...you dead. 

           MacKiernan RELEASES the TREE LIMB, which WHIPS UP and STABS 
           THE SOLDIER through the throat with a spiny branch! 

           Hearing the helicopter, MacKiernan looks up and sees the 
           fearsome gunship coming his way. 

           50-cal bullets RIP UP THE GROUND all around him, as 
           MacKiernan RUNS FOR HIS LIFE. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           WATERFALL / FRANK

           Frank holds onto the rock desperately, as Dima grips his 
           foot! Frank’s fingers are slipping, though, and he and Dima 
           meet eyes as...

           ...his grip SLIPS! Frank and Dima PLUNGE over the waterfall!

           The two men plummet through the air and SPLASH into water, 
           narrowly missing the rocks that killed the first soldier. 

           Frank sputters to the surface, stunned to be alive! 

           Dima GRABS him from behind, but Frank THROWS HIS HEAD BACK, 
           smashing Dima’s nose!

           Frank scrambles to shore, but Dima pursues and TACKLES Frank, 
           wrestling him onto his back and pressing a knife to Frank’s 
           throat! 

           Checkmate. 

                                 DIMA
                            (in Russian)
                        How does it feel to come all this 
                        way, only to die?

           Frank has no idea what he’s saying. Dima switches to English. 

                                 DIMA (CONT’D)
                        You don’t speak Russian, Mr. 
                        Bessac? I took you to be an 
                        intellectual. 
           He raises the knife to STAB Frank, but...

           The unmistakable sound of a GUN COCKING. 

           Frank and Dima look over and see... 

           ...a TIBETAN FAMILY, cowering in a yak-skin yurt. 

           The TIBETAN FATHER has a rifle aimed at Dima and Frank.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           SKY

           The helicopter BLASTS AWAY at MacKiernan, who races through 
           the trees below. He’s headed toward the WATERFALL. 

           Marko raises the sniper rifle... and FIRES.

           MACKIERNAN IS HIT, and he tumbles brutally down a steep 
           slope, SLAMMING to the rock ledge at the top of the 
           waterfall, where he lays motionless. 

           Marko smiles and gestures to the pilot. Take us down.

                                                                CUT TO:

           WOODS

           Two Soviet Soldiers move carefully through the woods, machine 
           guns ready. 

           They find TWO OF THEIR OWN MEN lying dead on the ground, 
           flecked with blood. They sweep their guns around, alert. 

           A ROPE drops down from the trees above, SNAGGING one soldier 
           by the neck, as...

           ...Vasili jumps from the tree, using his weight to HOIST the 
           soldier up into the air, legs thrashing!

           The other soldier SPINS, but Vasili THROWS HIS KNIFE, which 
           sinks deep into the soldier’s chest. 

           Vasili vanishes into the woods like a ghost, leaving the 
           first soldier hanging.

                                                                CUT TO:

           BOTTOM OF WATERFALL

           Dima still has Frank pinned with the knife to his throat, as 
           the Tibetan Father aims a rifle at them. 
                                 TIBETAN FATHER
                            (”drop it”)
                        Borta!
                            (Dima stares coldly)
                        Borta!

           Frank meets the Tibetan Father’s eyes, speaking IN TIBETAN.

                                 FRANK
                        This man is a murderer. I saw him 
                        kill a boy the same age as your 
                        son. Please help me.

           Off Dima’s surprise, Frank looks up at him.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        You don’t speak Tibetan? I took you 
                        to be an intellectual. 

           Dima STABS down at Frank, but...

           The Tibetan Father FIRES, hitting Dima in the chest! Dima 
           slumps down onto Frank, dead. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           TOP OF WATERFALL / MACKIERNAN

           MacKiernan lies motionless on the rock ledge by the 
           waterfall. He stirs, disoriented, then feels around for a 
           bullet wound, but there’s NO BLOOD. 

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        What the hell?

           He reaches into his BAG and pulls out...

           A GOLD BAR, with Marko’s SNIPER BULLET lodged in it! 

           MacKiernan kisses the gold bar, grateful, then stuffs it back 
           in his bag, but...

           The HELICOPTER DESCENDS behind MacKiernan, its fearsome guns 
           aimed right at him. MacKiernan slumps - shit.

           Marko steps off the helicopter onto the ledge, rifle trained 
           on MacKiernan. 

                                 MARKO
                            (to pilot, in Russian)
                        Find the other one.

           The helicopter rises, leaving Marko and MacKiernan alone on 
           the ledge. Marko keeps the rifle aimed at him.
                                 MARKO (CONT’D)
                        I’ve been looking forward to this, 
                        Douglas. Diplomat by day, spy by 
                        night.

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        I spy during the day too. And it’s 
                        “Mac”. Only my ex-wife calls me 
                        Douglas.
                            (re: the bag)
                        Can I put this down? It’s insanely 
                        heavy.

           Marko smiles cooly. MacKiernan THUNKS the gold-laden bag onto 
           the ground and rubs his aching shoulders.

                                 MACKIERNAN (CONT’D)
                        Oh, that is so much better.
                            (beat)
                        It’s a shame, Marko, I was really 
                        hoping to be the one to kill you.

                                 MARKO
                        I’m afraid it was not meant to be. 

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        No, it wasn’t. Someone else 
                        deserves it way more.

                                 MARKO
                        And who might that be?

                                 MACKIERNAN
                            (nods past Marko)
                        Him.

           Marko SPINS, revealing VASILI, who PLUNGES A KNIFE into 
           Marko’s stomach! The rifle falls from Marko’s hands. 

           Marko looks at Vasili, stunned, color draining from his face.

           Vasili holds up LEO’S CHUNK OF COAL in his fingers and stuffs 
           it in Marko’s mouth...

           ...then KICKS MARKO BACKWARDS, HARD, sending Marko REELING 
           OFF THE CLIFF. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           BOTTOM OF WATERFALL

           Frank shoves Dima’s body off of him, then faces the Tibetan 
           Father, grateful. 
                                 FRANK
                            (in Tibetan)
                        Thank y...

           THUNK!!! Marko’s body LANDS right near Frank, who FLINCHES!

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Christ!

           He looks up, seeing MacKiernan and Vasili looking down at him 
           from the cliff above.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        How about a little warning next 
                        time?

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Frank, look out!!

                                 FRANK
                        Little late now... 

                                 MACKIERNAN
                            (points, serious)
                        No, Frank, LOOK!

           The Soviet attack-helicopter is speeding through the narrow 
           river pass toward Frank!!

           50-CAL BULLETS rip up the riverbank all around Frank and the 
           Tibetan Family!

           They dive behind rocks as hell rains down around them!

                                                                CUT TO:

           TOP OF CLIFF

           MacKiernan and Vasili see the fearsome helicopter racing 
           toward Frank along the river, below their position. 

           Vasili grabs Marko’s SNIPER RIFLE and begins FIRING down at 
           the approaching chopper.

                                                                CUT TO:

           HELICOPTER

           BULLETS strike the helicopter’s bulletproof glass by the 
           pilot’s head, cracking the glass, but not breaking it.  

           The pilot smiles coldly and accelerates the helicopter toward 
           the waterfall, where Frank is pinned down. 
           The pilot flips a MISSILE SWITCH... and FIRES! 

                                                                CUT TO:

           BOTTOM OF WATERFALL

           Frank and the Tibetans pale as a small tactical MISSILE 
           streaks toward them!

                                 FRANK
                            (in Tibetan)
                        Get down!

           The missile HITS nearby and EXPLODES, showering them with 
           rocky debris!!

                                                                CUT TO:

           TOP OF CLIFF

           MacKiernan and Vasili are stunned by helicopter’s firepower. 

           Vasili keeps FIRING down at the helicopter as it gets closer, 
           but he’s doing no damage! It’s about to pass beneath their 
           position!

           MacKiernan looks over at... his BACKPACK. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           HELICOPTER

           The pilot sees Frank and the Tibetans ahead in the rubble. 
           One more missile should do it. 

           He grips the missile trigger and begins to squeeze...

                                                                CUT TO:

           TOP OF CLIFF

           MacKiernan grabs the HEAVY BACKPACK FILLED WITH GOLD BARS...

           ...and HEAVES IT off the cliff! 

           The backpack arcs down through the air, as the helicopter 
           passes below them...

           ...and HITS THE HELICOPTER’S SPINNING ROTOR! The bag’s 
           contents EXPLODE in a blast of GOLD SHRAPNEL! 

           With a horrible wrenching of metal, the rotor blades FRACTURE 
           from the impact, sending shards of metal in every direction!
           The stunned pilot tries to maintain control of the 
           helicopter, but he can’t! He SCREAMS, as...

           ...the helicopter CRASHES onto the rocky riverbank and 
           EXPLODES in a massive fireball!

           As the chaos settles, Frank and the Tibetans climb out from 
           under the rocky debris and stare in stunned shock at the 
           burning helicopter, the smoke, and...

           ...THE GOLD RAINING FROM THE SKY, landing all around them, 
           shimmering in the sunlight like magic.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                            (in Tibetan)
                        Are you all right?

           The Tibetans nod, looking around at the gold littering the 
           riverbank. 

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                            (in Tibetan)
                        It’s all yours. Enjoy.

           The family looks at him, baffled. The kids run out and begin 
           picking up gold pieces.... 

                                 MACKIERNAN
                            (calls down)
                        Uh, Frank? Did you just give them 
                        all my gold?

                                 FRANK
                        I’m pretty sure you did, Mac. 

           MacKiernan frowns down at the Tibetans.

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        You’re welcome!

           MacKiernan turns to Vasili. 

                                 MACKIERNAN (CONT’D)
                        Can you believe him? I should’ve 
                        let you shoot hi...

           MacKiernan’s body JERKS SUDDENLY. Vasili looks at him, 
           confused. 

           Blood spreads outward across MacKiernan’s chest. 

           Down below, Frank spins around as the SHOT echoes through the 
           area. Where’d that come from?
           MacKiernan staggers backwards toward the edge of the cliff. 
           Vasili reaches for him, but MacKiernan FALLS from the edge...

           ...and plummets down through the air, crashing down into the 
           river with a splash!

                                 FRANK
                        Mac!!

           Frank races into the river and grabs MacKiernan. Blood is 
           FLOWING from a CHEST WOUND. 

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Oh God...

           He pulls MacKiernan to shore, cradling his head. 

           Vasili swiftly climbs down the rocky cliff face and jumps 
           down to their position. 

           He drops to a knee, aiming his rifle down river, where...

           ...TEN TIBETAN HORSEMEN gallop into view along the riverbank, 
           guns raised, their horses’ hooves kicking up spray. 

           MacKiernan, weak from blood loss, tries to speak.

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Who...?

                                 FRANK
                        It’s Tibetan border patrol. 
                            (examines Mac’s wound)
                        Stay with me, Mac. We’re gonna get 
                        you some help.

           Vasili COCKS the rifle and takes aim at the approaching 
           horsemen, but...

                                 MACKIERNAN
                            (weakly)
                        Vasili... nyet.

           Vasili looks at him in disbelief. MacKiernan reaches out and 
           lays a hand on the barrel of Vasili’s rifle, lowering it.

           The Tibetan horsemen ride up, aiming their guns and yelling 
           fiercely. One horseman SLAMS Vasili with the butt of his gun, 
           knocking him to the ground.

                                 FRANK
                            (holds up a hand)
                        Mitra! Ni bo American!
           The lead horsemen, TSERINDORJI, puts a gun to Frank’s head.

                                 TSERINDORJI
                        American?
                            (in broken English)
                        Who are you? Why are here?

           Decision time. Frank looks at the scared Tibetan family 
           cowering near the wreckage of the Soviet helicopter, then 
           meets eyes with MacKiernan.

                                 FRANK
                        My name is Frank Bessac. I seek an 
                        audience with His Holiness, the 
                        Dalai Lama, on behalf of the United 
                        States government.

           MacKiernan smiles slightly through his pain. Attaboy, Frank.

           The Tibetan Horsemen gather and talk amongst each other, 
           concerned. We just shot an American diplomat? 

                                 MACKIERNAN
                            (weakly)
                        I thought you don’t work for the 
                        CIA.

                                 FRANK
                        I don’t.

                                 MACKIERNAN
                        Do something for me, Frank. In my 
                        coat...

           Frank feels around in MacKiernan’s coat and pulls out... 

           ...the WOOD CARVING of the little girl on the pony. Frank 
           looks at it, finally realizing...

                                 FRANK
                        It’s Gail on a pony.
                            (MacKiernan nods, 
                              emotional)
                        I’ll make sure she gets it. 

           MacKiernan grips Frank’s hand, grateful. 

           The life fades from MacKiernan’s eyes, and he goes STILL. 

           Tserindorji solemnly steps forward and drops to one knee, 
           holding out a CURVED SWORD to Frank.  
                                 TSERINDORJI
                            (in Tibetan)
                        It was I who killed your friend.
                        Take the justice that is owed you. 

           Frank realizes Tserindorji is offering his own life to Frank. 

                                 FRANK
                        No.

           Tserindorji offers the sword to Vasili, who takes it and 
           stands over him, full of rage at the death of his friend.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Vasili, please.
                            (Vasili raises the sword)
                        What would Leo want you to do?

           The mention of Leo’s name gives Vasili pause.

           He stares down at Tserindorji... then slowly DROPS the sword 
           to the ground with a clatter. 

           Tserindorji, eyes downcast in shame, pulls a purple GESANG 
           FLOWER from the ground and holds it out for Vasili. 

           A simple token of appreciation for sparing his life. 

           Vasili takes the flower from him, as we...

                                                               FADE TO:

           EXT. LHASA - EVENING

           Late evening sun shines down on... 

           LHASA, the capital of Tibet, a city built right into the hard 
           rock of the Himalayas. Golden light reflects off the steeples 
           of hundreds of Buddhist temples.

           The center of Lhasa is dominated by...

           POTALA PALACE (residence of the Dalai Lama since the 1600s). 
           The palace’s white walls have an amber glow in the sunset.

           Frank, freshly bathed, stands on a balcony, meticulously 
           tying the sashes of a complicated Tibetan ROBE. 

           Vasili approaches, wearing a similar robe that he clearly 
           didn’t know how to put on. Frank chuckles. 

                                 FRANK
                        That’s a good look for you, Vasili. 
           Vasili frowns, aware that Frank is making fun of him. Frank 
           sees he’s holding his SADDLE BAG.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        I guess this is goodbye?

           Vasili nods, then pulls out a pair of antique bronze TIBETAN 
           PINCE-NEZ EYEGLASSES that look about 400 years old. 

                                 VASILI
                        I find... for you. To see.

                                 FRANK
                            (moved)
                        Spacibo, Vasili.

           Frank puts on the glasses. He looks BIZARRE. Vasili studies 
           him, approving.

                                 VASILI
                            (in Russian)
                        You look ridiculous. Like strange 
                        insect. This gives me joy.    

           Frank doesn’t understand. Vasili then CRACKS UP. 

                                 VASILI (CONT’D)
                            (reaches for the glasses)
                        No.. is better to no see....

                                 FRANK
                        Hell no, I’m keeping these.

           The two men share a laugh. 

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        You and me, Vasili?
                            (takes Vasili’s hand)
                        Friends.

                                 VASILI
                        Druzya.

                                 FRANK
                            (smiles)
                        Druzya.

           Vasili pulls him into a hug.

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Dasvidania, Vasili.

           Vasili nods... then CRACKS UP again at Frank’s glasses.
                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Okay, you can go now.

           Vasili turns and heads away, chuckling. Only then does Frank 
           realize how badly Vasili botched the job on his robe... 

           It’s OPEN in the back, showing Vasili’s BARE ASS. Frank 
           snorts a laugh, and Vasili glances back at him. What?

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                        Nothing. Have a safe trip. 

           Vasili leaves, passing a BUDDHIST MONK, who glances at 
           Vasili’s ass, confused. 

                                 FRANK (CONT’D)
                            (finger to his lips)
                        Shh..

           The Monk smiles, then bows to Frank. 

                                 MONK
                        His Holiness will see you now.

           Frank looks out once more over the incredible city of Lhasa, 
           taking it in, then follows the Monk through an ORNATE DOOR...

           ...into a vast chamber filled with stunning frescoes and 
           golden statues of Buddha. Frank looks around, amazed.

           On a raised dais, the DALAI LAMA (15 years old, shaved head, 
           simple orange and red robe) sits cross-legged on cushions in 
           quiet contemplation. Frank kneels respectfully.

                                 FRANK
                            (in Tibetan)
                        Your Holiness, I have come on 
                        behalf of a dear friend, who gave 
                        his life for my country. And for 
                        yours...

           The young Dalai Lama smiles at Frank; the kindly smile the 
           world has come to know so well in the decades since.

                                                              FADE OUT:

           OVER BLACK

           Two days later, Frank Bessac left Lhasa. Sewn into his 
           clothing was a letter from the Tibetan government requesting 
           covert aid from the CIA.
           [FADE TO - Communist troops move cautiously through a Tibetan 
           valley. All is quiet...] 

           Communist troops entered Tibet three months later and were 
           met with unexpected resistance by Tibetan soldiers.

           [GUNSHOTS ERUPT, as hundreds of Tibetan soldiers open fire on 
           the troops from hidden positions on all sides.]

           Tibet remained free for another nine years before succumbing 
           to a full-scale invasion. Amidst the chaos, CIA operatives 
           smuggled the Dalai Lama out of Tibet. He has lived in exile 
           to this day, a symbol of peace to millions worldwide.

           [FADE TO - Vasili kneels at LEO’S GRAVE. He unwraps a cloth, 
           revealing the GESANG FLOWER that Tserindorji gave him. Vasili 
           plants the flower in the soft dirt of the grave, then closes 
           his eyes in prayer.]

           Vasili Zvansov emigrated to the United States in 1967, 
           settling in Hawaii. He and Frank remained close friends for 
           the rest of their lives. 

           [FADE TO - Frank, fully blind, teaches anthropology to a 
           packed lecture hall full of college students. 

           Frank Bessac became a professor of Anthropology at the 
           University of Montana. He died in 2010, never once admitting 
           that his role in the Tibet expedition was in any way 
           connected to the CIA.

           [FADE TO - the unveiling of the Memorial Wall at CIA 
           Headquarters in Langley, where a SINGLE BLACK STAR is 
           inscribed. Frank stands holding the hand of GAIL MACKIERNAN 
           (12), who clutches the PONY CARVING her father made for her.] 

           Douglas MacKiernan was honored with an anonymous star on the 
           wall of CIA Headquarters. It was the first of its kind... 

           [FADE TO PRESENT, and we see the 110 OTHER STARS that have 
           joined MacKiernan’s over the years.]

           ...though many more were to follow.

                                                              FADE OUT:
