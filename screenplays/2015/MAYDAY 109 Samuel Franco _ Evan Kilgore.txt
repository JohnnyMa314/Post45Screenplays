               "The man that said the cream of a nation is lost in war can
               never be accused of making an overstatement of this very
               cruel fact."

           - Letter from Lt. Paul "Red" Fay, August, 1943

                        The following is based on actual events.
           EXT. OPEN OCEAN -- NIGHT

           Dark. FREEZING, CHURNING WATER - strewn with splintered WOOD,
           DEBRIS. FLAMES thundering from SHATTERED WRECKAGE, the surface
           of the water itself ON FIRE as -

           GASPING for BREATH - handsome, fair-haired JACK, 26 -
           SCRATCHED-UP, BLEEDING, Navy UNIFORM soaked and torn - SWIPES
           wildly at the WATER - shock, confusion all over his face.

           Something terrible has happened. Jack's eyes registering the -

           NIGHTMARISH SCENE

           - all around him. SCREAMS wrenching through the CHURNING
           DARKNESS of the OCEAN. Shattered glass, twisted metal -

           BLASTING across Jack from a secondary EXPLOSION somewhere
           out on the WATER. More SCREAMING -

                                 MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
                        HELP! SOMEONE HELP!

           A WRITHING SHAPE - hellishly ON FIRE, thrashing in the WATER.

           Jack - twisting in the water toward the SCREAMING, TORTURED
           VOICE - heaves himself forward, SWIMMING toward it when -

           - he is suddenly SLAMMED by a THUNDERING WAVE. A SHORN WOODEN
           BEAM smashing Jack -

           UNDERWATER

           - into a dark, roiling MURK of twisted metal, snarled papers,
           the remnants of what must have been a BOAT, blown to pieces.

           Jack swipes frantically at the CHAOS of the water - the WOODEN
           BEAM weighing him down - FORCING him DEEPER - his panicked
           EYES catching on the PALE FACE of a DEAD SEAMAN, adrift.

           Firelight flickering from the surface. MUFFLED SHOUTS
           filtering dimly from ABOVE.

           All of it playing over Jack - as, flailing, helpless, he
           SINKS inexorably into the MURKY DARK BELOW.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           INT. BULLPEN, WAR DEPARTMENT BLDG. -- DAY

           A CARD is jammed into the retainer of an Underwood. Clamped
           down. CLACK. CLACK-CLACKITY-CLACK-CLACK - hammering out TEXT -

           "THE NAVY DEPT. DEEPLY REGRETS TO INFORM YOU THAT YOUR SON..."

           - A NAVY ENSIGN - 26, back rigid, perfect posture, buzzed
           blond hair, TYPING like a machine.
           A pool of other ENSIGNS hammering at typewriters. Muggy summer
           air, soupy with cigarette smoke, lazily stirred by fans.

           The Ensign SNAPS the last key, finishes the TELEGRAM CARD.
           Drags it out of his Underwood, flips it into an OUTBOX PILED
           HIGH with other identical telegram CARDS. Reaches -

           - picks up a half-smoked CIGARETTE propped in the ASHTRAY on
           the edge of his desk. Takes a quick pull. Fast. Mechanical.
           A little reward at the end of each card.

           Already reaching for the NEXT CARD. Jams it into his
           Underwood. CLACK-CLACK-CLACK-CLACKITY-CLACK -

           "AUGUST 3 1943 THE NAVY DEPT. DEEPLY REGRETS TO INFORM YOU
           THAT YOUR SON..."

           STOPPING SHORT - the Ensign's eyes fix on the NAME he is
           about to type. Blinks. Stares at it.

           Swivels in his chair, raises a hand to flag down the
           SUPERVISING LIEUTENANT, 28, crisply patrolling the aisles -

                                 ENSIGN TYPIST
                        Lieutenant?

           INT. HALLWAY, WAR DEPARTMENT BLDG. -- DAY

           CLACKING down the polished tile floor - putty-colored walls,
           sallow overhead fluorescent - the Supervising Lieutenant -

           - veers toward an OFFICE DOOR. RAPS on it twice. Twists the
           knob, pushing in without waiting for an answer -

           INT. CAPTAIN'S OFFICE, WAR DEPARTMENT BLDG. -- CONTINUOUS

           Fluorescent lights, plain gray carpeting, a framed American
           flag. At a square DESK with a TELEPHONE, stacks of FOLDERS -

           - a YOUNG ENSIGN, 23, square-jawed, efficient - looks up as
           the Lieutenant steps in, nods to the CLOSED INNER DOOR -

                                 SUPERVSIING LIEUTENANT
                        He in there?

                                 YOUNG ENSIGN
                        He, uh - has the Major on the line.

                                 SUPERVSIING LIEUTENANT
                        I need him. For a house call. A KIA.

                                 YOUNG ENSIGN
                        He doesn't typically do that.

                                 SUPERVSIING LIEUTENANT
                        He's going to want to do this one.
           INT. '41 FORD SUPER DELUXE [DRIVING] -- AFTERNOON

           Hot. Windows cracked open. Sweating through his DRESS UNIFORM,
           PRIEST'S COLLAR - the NAVY CHAPLAIN, 52, soft-edged, glasses -

           - peers out at the passing white-washed MANSIONS, driveways,
           immaculate lawns. Pristine water of Lewis Bay. Glances at -

                                 CAPTAIN
                        Their driveway's longer than my whole
                        street.

           The CAPTAIN - 31, tired, sweaty - beside him. Hunches forward
           to squint over the shoulder of the Young Ensign driving -

           A WHITE-WASHED ESTATE - perched at the end of the road -
           fills the grubby windshield. Jutting decks and balconies.

           INT. DRAWING ROOM, HYANNIS PORT HOUSE -- AFTERNOON

           FINGERS dancing over the keys of a BABY GRAND PIANO - a regal,
           effortlessly ELEGANT WOMAN (53) plays, lost in the MUSIC.

           LAUGHTER from outside - CHILDREN DASHING past in the front
           yard, streaks of white shorts, polo shirts. The Woman glances
           over - FINGERS, MUSIC HALTING at the sight of -

           The BLACK '41 FORD SUPER DELUXE drawing up into the driveway.

           EXT. FRONT LAWN, HYANNIS PORT HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

           The Captain climbs out into the steamy August heat. Chaplain
           climbing out beside him, eyes falling on the -

           BOYS tossing a FOOTBALL on the grassy front lawn.

           The Captain grimaces - not relishing this job. Glances at
           the Chaplain - starts up toward the sweeping VERANDA.

           The OLDEST BOY - a lanky 17 - catches the FOOTBALL. Draws up
           short, eyes fixing on the Captain and the Chaplain.

           Mounting the stairs - the Captain slows. FRONT DOOR coming
           open. The Elegant Woman stepping out - dread on her face.

                                 CAPTAIN
                        Ma'am. Is your husband home?

           Her HUSBAND, a gruff OX OF A MAN, 55, round glasses - stumping
           out of his STUDY. Drawing up beside her -

                                 THE MAN
                        What is this about?

                                 CAPTAIN
                        Mr. Kennedy. I'm afraid it's your
                        son, sir. John.
                                 ELEGANT WOMAN [ROSE KENNEDY]
                        NO!

           The Man - JOSEPH KENNEDY, SR. - turns to CATCH ROSE KENNEDY
           as she crumples, COLLAPSES in GRIEF.

                                                           SMASH CUT TO:

           UNDERWATER

           Swirling blues, murky WATER - CHURNED as a PALE ARM SWIPES
           through it. Shoulders, hips, legs KICKING. A mop of brown
           hair around a lanky body as -

           JACK - a.k.a. JOHN F. KENNEDY - younger, 22, swim shorts -
           CLAWS at the water. Fierce. Winces, fights his way to the -

           INT. POOL, HARVARD INDOOR ATHLETIC CENTER -- AFTERNOON

           - SURFACE - into the fluorescent light. Jack - handsome,
           pale, skinny - WATER churning around him - COUGHS.

           Tiled walls echoing back a BUZZER as several OTHER SWIMMERS
           reach the ends of their LAPS in the Olympic-sized POOL.

                                 ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                        That's Kennedy in first for trials.

           SUPER: "Harvard University. Three Years Earlier. June, 1940."

           Jack - shivering, CHOKING, HAULS himself up onto the tiled
           edge. His whole body SHAKING. Something not right.

           Spotting him from the BLEACHERS, surging to his feet - LEM
           BILLINGS - 23, athletic, handsome -

                                 LEM BILLINGS
                        Jack?

           Jack - clutching his stomach turns - heaves, VOMITS UP a
           murk of chlorine and bile across the slippery pool tile.

                                 LEM BILLINGS (CONT'D)
                        Jesus - Jack!

           Jack curls around his CRAMPING STOMACH, shivering.

           Lem dashes to the edge of the wet tile. Heaving Jack up.
           Twists back to the gaping HARVARD SWIM TEAMMATES -

                                 LEM BILLINGS (CONT'D)
                        Call a doctor.

           INT. CORRIDOR, MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL -- LATER

           Crisp white walls, sea-green doors. Pushing past scuffling
           ORDERLIES, DOCTORS in lab coats, the DRONE of the P.A. -
           JOE KENNEDY, JR. - 24, tall, handsome, well-built - veers
           toward a DOORWAY - ducks his head in on -

           A ROOM - BED in the center, an old WOMAN in her 80s, papery
           skin, swathed in starched hospital bed sheets.

           Joe Jr. grimaces - pushes back out, nearly wheeling into -

                                 NURSE
                        Excuse me, can I help you?

           - a TIRED, overworked female NURSE, papery white UNIFORM.

                                 JOE JR.
                        I'm looking for Jack Kennedy.

           INT. ROOM 244, MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL -- AFTERNOON

           Joyless little box of a room. Plain white walls. Metal trays,
           medical equipment surrounding - Jack - sick, miserable -

           Sprawled under bleached hospital sheets. Almost as PALE as
           the bowl of TAPIOCA he's idly toying with.

           Lem Billings - slouched against the WINDOW SILL - glances
           over as - Joe Jr. ducks into the doorway. Drawing up short -

                                 JOE JR.
                        There you are. They had some shriveled
                        old prune in your usual room. This
                        one's like a closet.

                                 JACK
                        It's got a view of the women's floor,
                        though.

           Lem tosses a glance out the window, hadn't noticed. Joe Jr.
           smirks. Approaches the bed, regards his brother -

                                 JOE JR.
                        So what, you missed the tapioca?

                                 JACK
                        I missed that Nurse Elaine, is what
                        I missed.

                                 LEM BILLINGS
                        He's got a temperature of 101. I had
                        to drag him from the pool.

                                 JACK
                        Goddamn flu.

           Joe Jr. shakes his head - sympathetic, but used to this -
                                 JOE JR.
                            (to Lem)
                        Kid gets sick more than anyone else
                        I know.

           Jack, frustrated with his own body. Avoids Joe's eyes.

                                 JOE JR. (CONT'D)
                        Dad got Kick and Bobby all worked up
                        about seeing a Kennedy trounce those
                        Princeton pricks. Too bad. He'll be
                        disappointed.

           Jack looks sharply over. Meets Joe's eye. That hits a nerve.

                                 JACK
                        You tell Dad to have 'em there in
                        those bleachers.

                                 LEM BILLINGS
                        You can't swim tonight. You nearly
                        fainted out there.

           Jack ignores Lem. Still holding Joe's gaze. Eyes burning -

                                 JACK
                        Just tell him to be there.

           INT. CORRIDOR, MASSACHUSETTS GENERAL HOSPITAL -- EVENING

           Heels CLACKING as she shuffles papers on a metal clipboard,
           the tired, overworked NURSE ducks past a couple of orderlies -

           Draws up in the DOORWAY of Jack's room - the amber late-August
           SUN SETTING through the window -

                                 NURSE
                        Okay, Mr. Kennedy, let's -

           - stops short. Jack's bed - EMPTY.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. POOL, HARVARD INDOOR ATHLETIC CENTER -- EVENING

           A tumult of CHEERING as BARE FEET slap across the tile.
           Mounting the DIVING BOARD - Jack, in an old-fashioned red
           Harvard one-piece swimsuit -

           - pasty, sweating and shivering at the same time. Looks like
           death warmed over. Tosses a glance toward the -

           BLEACHERS - jammed with Harvard fans. Among them - THE KENNEDY
           CLAN, including Joe Jr., Joseph Kennedy, Sr. (52), stern.

           Jack turns his foggy, feverish eyes to the rippling water.
           Shuts them. Trying to focus as -
           THE BUZZER SOUNDS.

           Jack - eyes snapping open - LEAPS at the same time as Lem
           Billings, on the next diving board over -

           UNDERWATER

           - PLUNGING under, Jack claws at the water. Feet kicking in a
           flurry. Reaches the end of the lane -

           Flipping over, starting back a SPLIT-SECOND BEHIND Lem and
           the OTHER SWIMMERS through the chlorinated murk.

           INT. BLEACHERS, HARVARD INDOOR ATHLETIC CENTER -- CONTINUOUS

           On his feet in the stands - Joe Jr., surrounded by ELBOWING
           FANS, lanky BOBBY KENNEDY (14) tensely at his side -

           Glances down at Joseph Kennedy, regally seated. Watching the
           SWIMMERS in the water, hands folded in his lap.

           INT. POOL, HARVARD INDOOR ATHLETIC CENTER -- CONTINUOUS

           Lem Billings reaches the lip of the POOL, turning back for
           another lap. Tosses a worried glance over as -

           Jack THRASHES through the turnaround, COUGHING. A lungful of
           CHLORINE. Swallows it down. SWIMS for all he's goddamn worth.

           Pushing himself - pushing - pushing - Jack REACHES the OTHER
           SIDE. The BUZZER sounding a moment TOO LATE. Lem, another
           PRINCETON SWIMMER already clinging to the edge.

           Jack grasps the tile lip. Hauling himself halfway out of the
           water. Angry frustration in his CLUTCHED FISTS as he COUGHS.

           His determined EYES drag to the HARVARD SCOREBOARD. Trailing
           Princeton. Jack, jaw clamped -

           INT. 1940 CADILLAC 72 LIMOUSINE -- LATER / NIGHT

           - staring dolefully out of the back of the family limousine.
           Crammed into the leather back seat alongside Joe Jr., Bobby,
           KATHLEEN "KICK" KENNEDY (20) - Jack feels like shit.

           Up front, Joseph Kennedy brooding behind the wheel. Rose in
           the passenger seat, muffled Nat King Cole on the RADIO.

           Joe Jr. tosses a glance at Jack's trembling hands. Showered,
           wrapped in a Harvard letterman jacket - sick and freezing.

                                 JOE JR.
                        Coach Lamar said he's never seen
                        anyone place with a 101 fever.

                                 JACK
                        They still beat us.
                                 JOE JR.
                        Third's not bad.

                                 JACK
                        Third's not winning.

           Joe Jr. tosses a glance toward their father up front.

                                 JOE JR.
                        Dad?

                                 JOSEPH KENNEDY
                        Third's not winning.

           Joe Jr. sighs. Not surprised, but even so. Jack, headache,
           fever, grimaces, stares miserably out at the passing night.

           Joseph Kennedy regards him in the REARVIEW MIRROR -

                                 JOSEPH KENNEDY (CONT'D)
                        You go out there like that, you expect
                        to win? No. You didn't. You knew you
                        wouldn't. So why'd you go out there,
                        put a Kennedy in third place, drag
                        your whole team down?

                                 JACK
                        It seemed better than quitting.

                                 JOSEPH KENNEDY
                        Only thing worse than quitting is
                        losing.

                                 ROSE KENNEDY
                        Shush.

           Rose - cranks up the RADIO, no longer jazz. Now FUZZY VOICES -

                                 CBS RADIO ANCHOR (V.O.)
                        ...last night and heavy bombing
                        throughout the morning, we now confirm
                        Paris has surrendered to the German
                        invaders. The occupied capital...

           Jack, eyes suddenly glued to the RADIO. Joe Jr., the same.
           Between them, Bobby, the youngest, sensing the gravity of
           the sudden SILENCE in the car.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY, HYANNIS PORT HOUSE -- LATE NIGHT

           Wrapped in a BATHROBE, still sweaty, pasty, feeling like
           shit, Jack pads past clusters of hanging -

           FRAMED PHOTOGRAPHS - Joseph Kennedy stooping beside Franklin
           D. Roosevelt, the Kennedy clan in front of the Eiffel Tower.
           Drawn to muffled VOICES, dim light from the sitting room -

                                 CBS RADIO ANCHOR (V.O.)
                        ...French troops withdrew to avoid a
                        violent battle and total destruction
                        of the city. Shortly afterward, German
                        tanks rumbled down the Champs Elysees.

           INT. DRAWING ROOM, HYANNIS PORT HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

           Emerging from the mouth of the hallway into the wallpapered
           drawing room, Jack draws up short.

           Tensely seated beside the cabinet-sized wood Truetone RADIO -
           Kathleen, listening less to the BROADCAST than to -

           Joseph Kennedy and Joe Jr. - pacing the pastel carpet  -

                                 JOSEPH KENNEDY
                        I'm not losing a son to this senseless
                        war.

                                 JOE JR.
                        We're not even in this war.

                                 JOSEPH KENNEDY
                        And we're not going to be.

                                 JOE JR.
                        It'll look good on a ballot, and you
                        know it.

           Joseph Kennedy scowls - but in spite of himself, a tempting
           prospect. Jack, shivering, head in a fog -

                                 JACK
                        What's going on?

           The others turn. Kathleen, concerned -

                                 KATHLEEN
                        Joe's going to enlist.

                                 JOSEPH KENNEDY
                        That remains to be seen.

                                 JACK
                        If he's enlisting, I'm enlisting.

           Joseph Kennedy, a derisive glance at Jack, snorts, waves him
           away, not even considering it -

                                 JOSEPH KENNEDY
                        Go back to bed.

                                 JACK
                        I'm serious.
                                 JOSEPH KENNEDY
                        You're not a soldier, Jack. Besides,
                        you have to finish school.

                                 JACK
                        I don't care about school.

                                 JOSEPH KENNEDY
                        The answer is no.

           Jack, frustrated at being dismissed, is suddenly overtaken
           by a hacking COUGH that wracks his body. His father blanches -

                                 JOSEPH KENNEDY (CONT'D)
                        For Christ's sake, go to bed.

           INT. JACK'S BEDROOM, HYANNIS PORT HOUSE -- LATER

           Slatted window blinds drawn fast. A desk, scattered MODELS
           of SAILBOATS. A dresser, BOOKS in sloppy stacks on the floor.

           The SOFT MURMUR of the Philco RADIO on the bedstand. Jack -
           nose plugged up, feverish. Wrapped in sweaty sheets. Listening -

                                 CBS RADIO ANCHOR (V.O.)
                        ...British troops are retreating
                        across the Channel as Hitler's control
                        of France now seems absolute.

           Jack - aware the world is changing around him. Eyes falling -

           ON A FRAMED PHOTOGRAPH - Joe Jr., 20, in his Harvard Football
           uniform, a grinning champion. Their father beaming, arm around
           his shoulders. Jack - in back, small, pale, skinny. Forgotten.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. FITNESS ROOM, NAVY RECRUITMENT OFFICE -- MORNING

           Jack, jaw set, determination on his sweaty face, drops a
           PUSH-UP. ANOTHER. ANOTHER. Falters - CRUMPLES. Tapped out.

           Straining under the pale fluorescent of a tiny, windowless
           EXAM ROOM. Art-Deco "Man the Guns, Join the Navy" POSTER -

           - Jack HEAVES himself up onto a PULL-UP BAR. Lifts his meager
           weight off the ground. AGAIN. AGAIN. Shivering now. Still
           sick as a dog. Drenched in his own sweat. Aware of the -

           RECRUITER LIEUTENANT, 29, stiff, watching, with a clipboard.

           Jack GRUNTS. Cramping, feeling like shit. DROPS from the
           bar. Shivering and pale and furious with himself.
           INT. EXAM ROOM, NAVY RECRUITMENT OFFICE -- LATER

           Buzzing fluorescent. Seated on the edge of the EXAM TABLE -
           Jack, stripped to the waist. Skinny, ribcage nearly pushing
           through his underweight flanks. Sweating. RUSTLING PAPER -

           - as the NAVY DOCTOR - balding 52, glasses, white labcoat
           and tie - FLIPS A PAGE on the METAL CLIPBOARD. Eyeballs Jack -

                                 NAVY DOCTOR
                        You've always had this difficulty
                        with your back?

                                 JACK
                        I've learned to live with it.

                                 NAVY DOCTOR
                        Your file shows you had leukemia?

           Jack snuffles back his runny nose, sick as a dog -

                                 JACK
                        It wasn't leukemia. They thought it
                        was, but it was something else.

                                 NAVY DOCTOR
                        I see here treatments for
                        hyperthyroidism. Steroids, ulcers -

                                 JACK
                        So what.

                                 NAVY DOCTOR
                        You scored forty-four on your curls,
                        thirty-six on push-ups.

                                 JACK
                        I've got the flu. It's going away.

           The Navy Doctor peels off his glasses, studies Jack.

                                 NAVY DOCTOR
                        Why is it you want to join the Navy?

           Jack meets his eye, feeling this slipping out of his grasp -

                                 JACK
                        The wrong guys are winning over there.
                        I want to do something about it.

                                 NAVY DOCTOR
                        These aren't passing scores.

           INT. '37 FORD MODEL 74 SEDAN -- DAY

           Dropping angrily into the chewed-up passenger seat - Jack
           LUGS the dented old DOOR SHUT with a CLUNK. Fuming. Flushed.
           Behind the wheel - Lem Billings glances over. Jack,
           disheveled, sweaty. Furious. Lem, sympathetic -

                                 LEM BILLINGS
                        If it helps at all, they told me my
                        eyes were shit before they'd even
                        let me do a curl.

                                 JACK
                        It doesn't help.

           Lem nods. Didn't think it would. Still feels bad.

                                 LEM BILLINGS
                        How about we grab a drink. See if
                        Alice is around.

                                 JACK
                        I'm sick as a dog.

                                 LEM BILLINGS
                        Better to be sick and drunk than
                        sick and sober. Right?

           Lem grins, infectious. Starts the engine. Jack sighs.

           INT. PANAMA CLUB JAZZ BAR -- EVENING

           A bleary hubbub of CONVERSATIONS, clinking glasses, LAUGHTER.
           JAZZ MUSIC tumbling from an amateur but spirited BAND onstage.
           Saturday night. The place is hopping.

           Hunched at a dim back table, buzzed and still feeling like
           shit, Jack, eyes shadowed, watches the crowd. JOLTING as -

                                 ALICE (O.S.)
                        Hey. Dream boy.

           ALICE - 19, gorgeous, curly brown hair, ruby lips - FLICKS
           Jack's ear. Face flushed from the MARTINI she just drained.

                                 ALICE (CONT'D)
                        Did I come here with a date or am I
                        just drinking by myself?

           Jack forces a smile at her. Lifts his own FULL MARTINI, takes
           a sip. Winces as the vodka eats at his sore throat.

                                 JACK
                        Sorry, sweetheart. Hell of a day.

           Alice glances, sees where Jack is looking - at the bar, two
           well-built MARINES IN UNIFORM. A flock of admiring GIRLS.

                                 ALICE
                        You know, you don't need a uniform
                        to impress me.
           Jack winces - the pity stings worse than the failure. Alice
           sighs. Sensing this is a bad angle to take -

                                 ALICE (CONT'D)
                        I'm going to the powder room. When I
                        get back, you and I are dancing or
                        I'm dancing with Lem.

                                 JACK
                        Yeah, good luck with that.

           Alice smirks as - pushing out of the booth - Jack catches
           her hand, gives it a peck of a kiss. She stands. Ducks past -

           Lem Billings - hammered and going wild by himself on the
           dance floor. A few amused looks from other dancing COUPLES.

           Jack's eyes slip back to the bar, the Uniformed Marines.
           Draws a breath, pushes it out. Takes a drink. Winces.

           INT. FOYER, HYANNIS PORT HOUSE -- NIGHT

           Dark. With a CLACK, the front door swings open. Snuffling, a
           runny nose still, Jack steps in. Jams his keys in his pocket.

           Nudges the door shut. Squelching toward the stairs when -

                                 JOSEPH KENNEDY (O.S.)
                        I thought you were going to spend
                        the day in bed. Recuperating.

           Jack JUMPS. Turns to find - Joseph Kennedy in an easy chair
           by the bay window. A dim Tiffany lamp, newspaper in his lap.

                                 JACK
                        Alice wanted to grab a drink before
                        I head back to campus on Monday.

                                 JOSEPH KENNEDY
                        I'm not talking about Alice.

           Jack - shucking out of his jacket - pauses. Glances at his
           father as Joseph closes the crackling newspaper. Stands.

                                 JOSEPH KENNEDY (CONT'D)
                        You didn't think I would find out?
                        That a Kennedy would fail a physical?

                                 JACK
                        It's not like that -

                                 JOSEPH KENNEDY
                        It's a disgrace, is what it is. I
                        told you no, but you went out there,
                        you weren't ready, just like last
                        night.
                                 (MORE)
                                 JOSEPH KENNEDY (CONT'D)
                        And now you've tarnished our name -
                        you've embarrassed me - twice in as
                        many days.

           Jack, too tired and feeling too shitty to let it go -

                                 JACK
                        I am ready. I could out-sail that
                        prick doctor with half a boat and my
                        hands tied behind my back.

                                 JOSEPH KENNEDY
                        Obviously there's more to it than
                        that. Ask your brother. He passed
                        his this afternoon.

           Jack, stung, frustration boiling over -

                                 JACK
                        I could beat Joe on a boat any day
                        of the week.

                                 JOE JR. (O.S.)
                        Prove it.

           Jack and his father both turn - not having heard Joe Jr.
           reach the bottom of the stairs, sock-footed, slacks, t-shirt -

                                 JOE JR. (CONT'D)
                        Or does "any day of the week" mean
                        "any other day?"

           Jack turns back to their father, eyes flashing, hungry -

                                 JACK
                        I beat him out there, you get 'em to
                        give me another shot at a commission.

                                 JOSEPH KENNEDY
                            (scoffs)
                        That's not going to happen.

                                 JOE JR.
                        Don't worry, Dad. He won't beat me.

           Jack turns back to his brother. Fire burning in his eyes -

                                 JACK
                        Prove it.

           EXT. BAY, HYANNIS PORT -- THE NEXT DAY

           Rushing out over the sparkling water - radiant sun beating
           down from crisp, clear blue skies - the 26ft. gaff-rigged
           sloop SAILBOAT Victura - Jack at the tiller -
           - RACING ahead of a SECOND SAILBOAT, the Laureola - Joe Jr.
           squinting into the sun fifteen feet BEHIND HIM.

           EXT. VICTURA, JACK'S SAILBOAT -- CONTINUOUS

           Grasping the tiller - Jack, wind rushing at him. Finally,
           out here, more alive, feeding off the race, sickness waning.

           Jack SHUTS HIS EYES - "feeling" the ocean through the tiller.

           Ducks instinctively as he tacks the boat, the BOOM swinging
           over his head. Weaving to keep the MAINSAIL in the wind -

           A sly grin over his shoulder at Joe Jr. behind him.

           EXT. LAWN, HYANNIS PORT HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

           Barefoot, white shorts, striped tee-shirt, a ball of energy -
           TED KENNEDY - 8, blond-haired - dashes through the grass,
           riveted to the TWO BOATS on the WATER -

                                 TED
                        Jack-Jack-Jack-Jack!

           Drawing up beside lanky 14-year-old Bobby, hands in his
           pockets - squinting across the water. Bobby shakes his head -

                                 BOBBY
                        He'll never beat him. Joe always has
                        him at the turn.

           EXT. VICTURA, JACK'S SAILBOAT -- CONTINUOUS

           Jack - triumph swelling, beginning to feel like he has this -
           grabs at the RIGGING. Hanging off the tiller, bare feet
           braced. The boy is a natural, a strong sailor -

           - but as the Victura starts to arc around a bobbing BUOY -
           Joe Jr.'s SAILBOAT EDGES AHEAD, water spraying from the bow.

           Jack sees it - grits his teeth. Grabs for the JIB SHEET,
           struggling to stay in the LEAD.

           Joe Jr. grins, waves smugly at Jack as Joe's BOAT CUTS IN -
           DASHING AHEAD of Jack's boat as they ARC around the BUOY.

           EXT. DOCK, HYANNIS PORT HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

           Stooped on the dock, a newspaper tucked under his arm, idly
           watching the RACE - Joseph Kennedy shakes his head. Turns.

           Starts back up the dock toward the giant white Kennedy house.

           EXT. VICTURA, JACK'S SAILBOAT -- CONTINUOUS

           Jack - bounding across the water - desperate now, grasping
           at rigging lines - WHIPS the Victura to the left.
           Trying to outpace Joe Jr. but -

           Joe Jr. sees it - whips left, cutting him off. Jack CUTS
           right. Blasting into the wind, losing momentum.

           EXT. LAUREOLA, JOE JR.'S SAILBOAT -- CONTINUOUS

           Joe Jr. smoothly transitions from line to line. Looks back -

           - his smug smile slipping slightly as he glimpses Jack's
           FACE between the his sails - desperate, yearning. Heart
           breaking as he starts to LOSE.

           Joe Jr. looks forward. The shoreline, dock, the tiny shape
           of their FATHER - already starting up the grassy lawn.

           Understanding what this means to Jack, Joe Jr. reaches -
           grabs a line. Noses the Laureola slightly INTO THE WIND.

           A LURCH as it SLOWS.

           EXT. VICTURA, JACK'S SAILBOAT -- CONTINUOUS

           Jack - close behind Joe Jr. - reacts to Joe's SLOWING in a
           heartbeat. Grabs a line, BOOM WHIPPING by over his head and -

           VEERS to the LEFT - drawing up ALONGSIDE Joe Jr. Cutting
           through the water, starting to OVERTAKE him.

           EXT. LAWN, HYANNIS PORT HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

           Bobby - Ted tugging at his wrist, wanting to play - suddenly
           steps forward, hawk-eyes riveted to the BOATS -

                                 BOBBY
                        Whoa - whoa, whoa.

           Joseph Kennedy - ambling past, slows, turns back to watch as -

           EXT. VICTURA, JACK'S SAILBOAT -- CONTINUOUS

           Jack - can't believe it himself - SKIMS AHEAD of Joe Jr.
           Both of them BARRELING toward the DOCKS now. Glances back as -

           EXT. LAUREOLA, JOE JR.'S SAILBOAT -- CONTINUOUS

           - Joe Jr. lets a little more ROPE slip through his hands.
           Feigns frustration. Blue eyes warmly settling on Jack's boat
           as it cuts ahead. A silent gift to his brother.

           EXT. LAWN, HYANNIS PORT HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

           Jack's SAILBOAT buzzes by the dock. Clearly in FIRST PLACE. 
           Ted jumping up and down. Bobby - bright-eyed disbelief -

                                 BOBBY
                        He beat him. He actually beat him.
           EXT. VERANDA, HYANNIS PORT HOUSE -- SHORTLY LATER

           Hunched in a shaded wicker chair - Joseph Kennedy, stewing
           as Jack, Joe Jr. bound up the steps -

           Jack - aglow, energized, triumphant. Draws up at the top of
           the stairs. Defiant as Bobby and Ted scrabble up after him -

                                 JACK
                        How'd that look? Look like I "wasn't
                        ready?" 'Cause from where I'm standing
                        it looks like I just earned a uniform.

                                 JOSEPH KENNEDY
                        I never agreed to that.

                                 JACK
                        Come on, Dad. What you just saw out
                        there - was that winning or was that
                        losing?

           Joseph Kennedy sets his jaw, looks to Joe Jr. Joe Jr. gives
           a SHRUG - Jack's got a point. Joseph Kennedy stews -

                                 JOSEPH KENNEDY
                        I'll get them to toss your file. But
                        you still have to go back and pass
                        the physical.

           Jack, a triumphant smile spreading. Rising energy, strength -

                                           OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL MONTHS:

           INT. HARVARD HEMENWAY GYMNASIUM -- DAY

           Determination now fixed on Jack's face as he PUSHES UP a
           loaded-down BARBELL. Pumping out set after set.

           Clattering weights, rowing machines, other HARVARD ATHLETES
           training around him. Jack - straining. Pushing himself.

           EXT. HARVARD RUNNING TRACK -- ANOTHER DAY

           Jack - shorts, a sweat-soaked t-shirt, SHOES POUNDING on the
           TRACK under a crisp sunny day. Resolve driving him.

           RUNNING beside him - Lem Billings, winded, legs pumping.
           Still faster, but becoming harder to edge out Jack.

           INT. POOL, HARVARD INDOOR ATHLETIC CENTER -- ANOTHER DAY

           Thickening arms, increasingly muscular shoulders, clawing at
           the water - Jack SHOOTS down his lane. Lem Billings now
           falling behind him.
           Jack reaches the opposite end of the pool, hauls himself out
           of the chlorinated water. Hunches, dripping on the edge.

                                                   SEVERAL MONTHS LATER:

           INT. FITNESS ROOM, NAVY RECRUITMENT OFFICE -- DAY

           Those same THICKER ARMS now lifting Jack. His chin topping
           the BAR once, twice, three times, four - as he does CURLS
           for the same WATCHING Recruiter Lieutenant.

           Jack sweating - one - more - curl. DROPS from the bar. Rounds
           on the Lieutenant as he scribbles on his CLIPBOARD.

                                 JACK
                        Seventy-six?

                                 RECRUITER LIEUTENANT
                        I counted seventy-seven.

           Jack - burning, flickering, triumph in his eyes.

           INT. EXAM ROOM, NAVY RECRUITMENT OFFICE -- LATER

           The same Navy Doctor, clipboard in hand, arms crossed, looks
           Jack over, once more stripped to the waist on the EXAM TABLE.

           The Navy Doctor - a sharp enough tack and not fond of having
           strings pulled behind his back -

                                 NAVY DOCTOR
                        A remarkable improvement. And
                        interestingly enough, I can't seem
                        to locate your medical history.

                                 JACK
                        Well I'd like to think my performance
                        speaks for itself.

                                 NAVY DOCTOR
                        Indeed.

           The Navy Doctor sighs. Steps to the COUNTER along the wall
           of the room. Flips Jack's file back to the cover page, reaches -

           STAMPS it - "APPROVED" - clicks his pen, SIGNS IT.

           Jack, eyes on every tiny moment - beside himself with pride
           as the sour-faced Navy Doctor turns, hands Jack his file -

                                 NAVY DOCTOR (CONT'D)
                        Congratulations, Mr. Kennedy. Tell
                        me, where do you see yourself in the
                        Navy?
                                 JACK
                        Well my brother's gonna be flying
                        planes out there over Europe. But
                        I've always been more a man of the
                        sea, myself. Maybe captain a PT boat.

                                 NAVY DOCTOR
                        Yes. Well. Good luck to you wherever
                        you end up.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           The prow of a PT BOAT - the RATTLE OF GUNFIRE, howling ENGINES -

           INT. JACK'S OFFICE, NAVAL INTELLIGENCE -- AFTERNOON

           - blasting fuzzily from a clattering PROJECTOR. Bleary black-
           and-white NEWSREEL playing across a pull-down screen. The PT
           BOAT - a chiseled PLASTIC MODEL perched on -

           A desk overrun with PAPERWORK. Open manila files. An Underwood
           typewriter. Sun lancing in through the Venetian blinds across -

           SUPER: "Office of Naval Intelligence, Maryland. 1941."

           Jack - tan Navy Uniform of a LIEUTENANT JUNIOR GRADE, a bored
           deadness to his eyes. Hunched, on the PHONE -

                                 JACK
                            (into the phone)
                        Yes, those were both requisitioned.
                        Form R-32. I'm looking at the carbons
                        right now. Yeah, I'll hold.

           Jack's eyes drag back to the NEWSREEL - CORSAIR FIGHTER
           PLANES, A-20s pin-wheeling through the sky. Rakish PILOTS.

                                 LT. NASH (O.S.)
                        Kennedy.

           Jack looks up at the OPEN OFFICE DOOR -

           LT. NASH - red-haired, 24, a little pudgy. An opened CARDBOARD
           BOX under his arm. Smirks. Ducking in -

           - to THUMP the box on the corner of Jack's desk. Open
           cardboard flaps permitting a view of -

           STACKED BOOKS inside. All the same - plain white PROOFING
           GALLEY covers - "Why England Slept" by John F. Kennedy.

                                 LT. NASH (CONT'D)
                        What, were you going to make me wait
                        in line for an autograph?

           Jack, a slight smile, leans forward - lifts out one of the
           BOOKS. Thumbs it open, fans the pages. Freshly-printed.
                                 JACK
                            (into the phone)
                        Fine, but we need 'em by thirteen-
                        hundred. Okay. Thank you.

           Jack CLAPS the receiver back into its cradle. Lt. Nash's
           attention has now drifted to the bleary NEWSREEL -

                                 LT. NASH
                        That your brother's squadron?

                                 JACK
                            (nods)
                        They're going to do a feature on him
                        at Movietone.

                                 LT. NASH
                        Goddamn daredevils.

           Jack and Lt. Nash watch as a SOARING PLANE fills the SCREEN.
           A line of GRINNING PILOTS in dashing uniforms.

                                 JACK
                        He's tearing up the skies, I'm sitting
                        here behind a desk. What kind of a
                        campaign is that gonna make?

           Lt. Nash regards Jack, amused by the presumption -

                                 LT. NASH
                        Since when was there a campaign?

                                 JACK
                        I'm a Kennedy. There's been a campaign
                        since I was born.

           Lt. Nash smirks. Knows the Kennedys enough to know the truth
           in that. Glancing sharply over as -

           Through the OPEN DOORWAY - a uniformed ENSIGN DASHES PAST -
           shoes SLAPPING. VOICES. TWO MORE ENSIGNS RUSH by - urgent.

           Jack and Lt. Nash look at each other. Jack SHOVES BACK from
           his desk. Both surging toward the DOORWAY -

           INT. BULLPEN, NAVAL INTELLIGENCE -- CONTINUOUS

           A sea of desks, stacked paperwork, typewriters. Desk chairs
           all EMPTY. A DOZEN UNIFORMED ENSIGNS, typists, secretaries -

           - huddled around a cabinet-sized ZENITH RADIO, wood-sided,
           VOLUME TURNED UP. Jack and Lt. Nash draw up -

                                 FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT (V.O.)
                            (over the radio)
                        ...December 7th, 1941.
                                 (MORE)
                                 FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT (V.O.) (CONT'D)
                        A date which will live in infamy.
                        The United States of America was
                        suddenly and deliberately attacked
                        by naval and air forces of the Empire
                        of Japan...

           Piercing through the ANXIOUS MURMURING of the MEN - PHONES
           start RINGING throughout the bullpen. Jack's eyes shift to -

           A small desk-model PHILCO RADIO, unattended, tuned to CBS -

                                 CBS RADIO ANCHOR (V.O.)
                        Our prayers are with all of the men
                        in the services, on the land, in the
                        air, and out to sea. God bless you.

           Jack stares at the radio. Turns. Lt. Nash watching the other
           men, glances back. Jack weaving away through the desks.

           INT. MATTHESON'S OFFICE, NAVAL INTELLIGENCE -- AFTERNOON

           Fingers drilling an Underwood typewriter - hard-edged CAPT.
           MATTHESON, 36, lost in an ocean of paperwork, glances up as -

           - with a RAP on the frame of the open door - Jack steps in,
           halting Capt. Mattheson in the midst of the cable he is typing -

                                 CAPT. MATTHESON
                        What is it, Lieutenant.

           Mattheson, fingers hovering over the typewriter - annoyed.

                                 JACK
                        You've been listening to the news?

                                 CAPT. MATTHESON
                        What kind of a question is that.

                                 JACK
                        I'd like to get out there.

           Capt. Mattheson scowls, resumes TYPING his cable -

                                 CAPT. MATTHESON
                        Go back to your office, Lieutenant.

                                 JACK
                        With respect, sir, I'm ready for
                        this. I've trained for this.

                                 CAPT. MATTHESON
                        You're a Harvard man, Kennedy, you
                        want to tell me your strength isn't
                        Intelligence?
                                 JACK
                        I'm a sailor, sir. I belong at sea.

                                 CAPT. MATTHESON
                        The answer is no.

           Jack - heard those words too many times before. Hardens -

                                 JACK
                        I can't just sit behind a desk while
                        my country is invaded. My brother's
                        out there fighting these guys. I
                        should be out there, too.

                                 CAPT. MATTHESON
                        Your father wants you here.

                                 JACK
                        Since when do you report to the
                        Ambassador to Britain?

           Capt. Mattheson SLAMS the typewriter. Skewers Jack with a
           burning stare. Jack, realizing he may have overstepped -

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        ...Sir. Let me worry about my father.
                        Please. Let me get out there on a
                        boat.

                                 CAPT. MATTHESON
                        Go back to your office, Lieutenant.

           Jack, starting to turn away, frustration boiling over -

                                 JACK
                        He opposed this. From the start. Did
                        you know that? He thought we should've
                        given Hitler whatever he wanted. He
                        said as much. I want to do something
                        about this. I'm asking you to put me
                        where I can do something. Not where
                        he asked you to put me.

                                 CAPT. MATTHESON
                        Get out of my office, Lieutenant.

           Jack, furious, wheels away. CLACKS his way out of the office.
           Capt. Mattheson sits, eyes on the door where Jack stood.

           INT. JACK'S APARTMENT, BASE HOUSING -- NIGHT

           Bare brick walls under a white coat of paint. Plain furniture,
           a simple desk. On his side, wrapped in heavy winter blankets -

           Jack lies awake. Stewing. Little Zenith RADIO on the desk
           turned ON, softly murmuring.
           A SHUFFLE OF PAPER from the DOOR.

           Jack sits up. Squints. Dim light under the door washing over -

           AN ENVELOPE on the hardwood floor. Jack stares at it. Peels
           back the sheets and blankets. Rises. Crosses to the door.

           Stoops. Picks up the ENVELOPE. The Seal of the Office of
           Naval Intelligence. Jack TEARS it open. Pries out a
           typewritten LETTER. SIGNED, "Capt. W. Mattheson."

           Jack switches on the light. Squinting, eyes darting over the
           page. Reads. Rereads. A flicker of TRIUMPH in his eyes.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. PACKARD CUSTOM SUPER 180 -- AFTERNOON

           Muggy summer light through the Packard's crisp windshield.
           Warm air wafting in through the open windows across -

           - Jack, sunglasses, tan Navy uniform, sleeves rolled up.
           White cottages slip by outside. Glenn Miller on the RADIO.

           SUPER: "Six months later."

           STACKED CARDBOARD MOVING BOXES filling the Packard's back
           seat. Taped shut, jammed and bulging.

           Jack knobs down the volume on the radio. Steers the Packard
           into the mouth of the Kennedy driveway.

           A hint of trepidation as his eyes fall on the KENNEDY HOUSE.

           INT. FOYER, HYANNIS PORT HOUSE -- AFTERNOON

           With a soft squeal of hinges - Jack pushes into the foyer.
           Duffel bag slung over his shoulder, sweating in his uniform.

           Peeling off his sunglasses, his eyes fall on the table in
           the entry hall - stacked COPIES of HIS BOOK,

           "Why England Slept by John F. Kennedy" - now with its official
           cover, the BRITISH FLAG, a napping LION.

           Jack steps forward. Picks up a copy. Glances up at -

           MUFFLED VOICES - two SHAPES on the VERANDA through the lacy
           curtains. Jack sets the book down, ducks toward them.

           EXT. VERANDA, HYANNIS PORT HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

           Sprawled in white shorts, a polo shirt, Joe Jr. slouches on
           a wicker bench. Shakes his head as -

           Bobby - 15 now, Portsmouth Priory School sweatshirt, hands
           wrapped around a FOOTBALL - tries to model a spiral throw -
                                 JOE JR.
                        Toss it. Toss it here, that's not it
                        at all. Your hands are all wrong.

           Bobby grimaces, frustrated. Tosses the ball to Joe Jr. -

                                 JACK (O.S.)
                        Says the guy who didn't even letter
                        at Choate.

           Jack steps out onto the veranda. Joe Jr. smirks. Abruptly
           WINGS the football at Jack, who barely catches it -

                                 JOE JR.
                        Good reflexes, JV. Too bad we ran
                        out of space on Harvard Varsity.

                                 JACK
                        Aren't you s'posed to be off over
                        Europe? Or did you read the map wrong?

                                 JOE JR.
                        They gave me a couple days off, I
                        figured I'd get a load of this book
                        my brother's puttin' out.

           Jack smirks, tosses the FOOTBALL back to Bobby.

                                 JACK
                        Supposed to be a real nail-biter.

                                 JOE JR.
                        Glad you found something to keep
                        yourself busy with behind that desk.

           Jack steps to the rail. Ocean air. A smile he cannot repress -

                                 JACK
                        Yeah the desk was nice. I got tired
                        of it, though. So I got myself a
                        boat.

                                 JOE JR.
                        You did not.

           Jack grins. Joe stands, joins Jack at the rail, impressed -

                                 JACK
                        Just got my orders. Four months
                        training, then I get my command.

                                 JOE JR.
                            (to Bobby)
                        Lord help us, they've made the boy a
                        sailor.
           Joe Jr. gives Jack's shoulder a squeeze. Bobby, envious
           admiration - his two dashing officer brothers.

           Joe Jr. squints out at the sun across the water. Their two
           SAILBOATS tied up down at the dock -

                                 JOE JR. (CONT'D)
                        Guess it's gonna be a while before
                        either of us is home again then.

                                 JACK
                        Yeah, looks like.

           Joe Jr. glances back at Bobby - toying with the FOOTBALL -

                                 JOE JR.
                        How about I teach you and Bobby how
                        to throw that thing before we go.

                                 JACK
                        How about you try to score a single
                        touchdown.

           EXT. LAWN, HYANNIS PORT HOUSE -- EVENING

           Dashing across the grass through evening light - Jack SPRINGS,
           catches the FOOTBALL winged to him by a panting Bobby.

           Pivoting to DUCK Joe Jr. - Jack - sidesteps little Edward
           barreling at him. RUNS as Joe Jr. POUNDS after him.

           Jack twists back as Joe Jr. BEARS DOWN on him. Twists forward -
           getting ready to sling the football back to Bobby when -

           Joe Jr. TACKLES Jack. The brothers SLAM to the ground, Jack
           FUMBLING the football as it wheels away into the grass.

           Jack fights - tries to get free of Joe Jr. as little Edward
           GRABS up the FOOTBALL - elated to finally be holding it.

           Jack - wriggling, writhing under the LAUGHING Joe Jr. -

                                 JACK
                        Let go already.

                                 JOE JR.
                        Are those grass stains on your
                        uniform, Lieutenant Kennedy?

           Bobby scrambling after Edward, easily outpacing him - until
           Kathleen SWOOPS in - HOOKING Bobby around his waist, LAUGHING.

           Edward - cannot believe it as he CROSSES the TOUCHDOWN LINE.
           Flings his hands up in astonished VICTORY.

           Joe Jr. gleeful as he finally lets Jack up. Both panting.
           Joe Jr. ruffles Jack's hair -
                                 JOE JR. (CONT'D)
                        You got dirt in your hair, skipper.

           Jack swats him away, smirking in spite of himself. Kathleen,
           Bobby, Edward jeering at each other. A perfect moment -

           JARRED as with a ROAR - A SQUADRON of AMERICAN WILDCAT
           AIRPLANES cuts across the sky overhead, ENGINES DRONING.

           Joe Jr. watches them. Glances over, meets Jack's eye. Seems
           to feel it too. The fragileness of all of this.

           The looming shadow of the war.

           Jack's eyes falling to - the Cadillac limousine crawling to
           a halt in the driveway. Their FATHER. Joseph Kennedy's hard,
           bespectacled gaze fixing through the windshield on -

           Jack - who looks self-consciously down at his uniform.
           Awareness, dread on his face.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. DRAWING ROOM, HYANNIS PORT HOUSE -- EVENING

           A SLAMMING DOOR - JOLTS Kathleen, at the piano. She jumps,
           stops PLAYING as Joseph Kennedy STAMPS in. Wheels back on -

           - Jack - chastened, wind-blown, stumbling in after him.

                                 JOSEPH KENNEDY
                        I told you no then, I'm telling you
                        no now.

                                 JACK
                        It's done.

                                 JOSEPH KENNEDY
                        I'll have it undone.

                                 JACK
                        I already have my orders.

                                 JOSEPH KENNEDY
                        Who do you think you're talking to?

                                 JACK
                        You have to let me do this.

           Joseph Kennedy rounds on him, temper flaring. Eyes meeting
           Joe Jr.'s as he steps in after them, draws up short -

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        Just once believe in me the way you
                        believe in Joe.

           Joseph Kennedy SLAMS his fist to the top of the piano.
                                 JOSEPH KENNEDY
                        Those boats are wooden coffins. If
                        you go out there, you're going to
                        get yourself killed.

           Joseph Kennedy wheels away. WRENCHES open the DOOR to his
           study. Ducks through. SLAMS IT SHUT behind him.

           Jack stares after him. His words hanging in the air.

           INT. PACKARD CUSTOM SUPER 180 -- LATER THAT NIGHT

           Sprinkling rain. Jack - oxford shirt, jacket, broods behind
           the wheel. Steeling himself as - the passenger door OPENS.

           Alice, holding a newspaper over her head against the rain,
           climbs in -

                                 ALICE
                        No one predicted rain tonight. I had
                        to search my whole closet for this
                        jacket.

           Alice pulls the door shut. Turns in her seat. Looks Jack
           over. A smile tugging at her lips, warmth in her eyes -

                                 ALICE (CONT'D)
                        Let me look at you. Yep. Famous author
                        suits you just fine. C'mere, I've
                        missed that face of yours.

           Jack tries to force a smile. Alice leans, kisses him. Draws
           back, sensing something amiss -

                                 ALICE (CONT'D)
                        What.

                                 JACK
                        Let's get a drink. Then I need to
                        tell you something.

           EXT. PATIO, PANAMA CLUB JAZZ BAR -- LATER

           Cafe lights strung up across the weathered brick patio. Rain
           sprinkling the canvas awning tented over it. Music blasting
           from inside, warm, steamed-over windows.  No one else outside -

           - except Alice, tears now STREAKING her MAKEUP. Evening dress
           wrapped around her. Eyes burning at Jack -

                                 ALICE
                        You just decided this. You didn't
                        even think about me. About us.

                                 JACK
                        I can't sit in some office while our
                        guys out there are getting shot at.
                                 ALICE
                        You'd rather they shoot at you?

                                 JACK
                        They're gonna shoot at my brother,
                        they're gonna have to get through
                        me.

           Alice shakes her head bitterly, wipes at her eyes.

                                 ALICE
                        I can't do this. I can't be one of
                        those girls glued to the window
                        waiting for the day those two officers
                        come up my driveway with a chaplain.

                                 JACK
                        That's not gonna happen.

                                 ALICE
                        You can't promise that.

                                 JACK
                        I promise.

                                 ALICE
                            (a ragged breath)
                        This isn't going to work.

           Jack - sucker-punched by her words, stares at her, reeling -

                                 JACK
                        This isn't supposed to be the end of
                        us.

                                 ALICE
                        But it is. You made your decision.
                        Without me.

           Alice wheels away. Sidestepping patio tables. Pushes back
           through the DOOR inside, a blast of MUSIC, rabbling VOICES.

           Jack - left out in the cold on the patio. Alone.

           INT. FOYER, HYANNIS PORT HOUSE -- NIGHT

           Dark. The grunt of keys in the lock. The door swinging open,
           a dash of sprinkling rain as Jack pushes in. Shoes SQUELCHING.

           Nudges the door shut. Stands. Gaze fixed on the CLOSED DOOR
           of his father's study. A slit of light beneath it.

                                 ROSE KENNEDY (O.S.)
                        You know, I made your father promise
                        never to send you out there.

           Jack JUMPS. Rose, in an evening dress, descending the stairs.
                                 ROSE KENNEDY (CONT'D)
                        You were so small when you were born,
                        they told us there was a good chance
                        you weren't going to survive. They
                        had a minister give you your last
                        rites right there in the hospital.

           Rose approaches. Looks him up and down, straightens his jacket -

                                 ROSE KENNEDY (CONT'D)
                        I worry about you. To think of you
                        out there. Joe, too. It scares me to
                        death. When I look at you, you're
                        still just my little boys.

           She takes a step back. Looks him over again. Jack - not sure
           what to say. Not used to this kind of talk from his mother.

                                 ROSE KENNEDY (CONT'D)
                        I know I can't stop you. But be
                        careful out there.

                                 JACK
                        I will. I promise.

           INT. JACK'S BEDROOM, HYANNIS PORT HOUSE -- NIGHT

           Stepping into his room, Jack draws up short. His UNIFORM
           laid out across the bed. A FOOTBALL nestled beside it.

           Jack picks up the NOTE taped to the FOOTBALL. From Joe Jr. -
           "Try to work on maintaining possession of the ball."

           Jack, smirking, shakes his head. Smile slowly falling from
           his lips as his eyes shift back to the UNIFORM.

           All at once feeling the looming reality of it all. His life
           about to change forever. The quiet of the room -

                                             - A STARK CONTRAST TO THE -

           INT. DOUGLAS C-47 SKYTRAIN AIRPLANE -- DAY

           - THUNDERING engines. RATTLING metal hull. Jouncing, pitching
           through the air. Smashed along the curving fuselage on a
           hard bench -

           Jack, just turned 26, satchels CRAMMED around him, knee-to-
           knee with 28 NAVY SAILORS. Sweating in the unbearable heat
           of the aircraft. Papers spread all over his lap.

           As the AIRCRAFT SHUDDERS, Jack turns in his seat. Face pasty.
           Squints out the smeary WINDOW over his shoulder at the
           glittering ocean, lumps of islands through the clouds.

           SUPER: "Approaching Rendova, Solomon Islands. July, 1943."
           A JUNIOR LIEUTENANT - 25, ruddy-faced, jovial - smashed in
           beside him, jostled by Jack, glances over at him -

                                 JUNIOR LIEUTENANT
                        A little green around the gills?

                                 JACK
                        Not particularly fond of airplanes.

           The Junior Lieutenant nods at the PATROL TORPEDO (PT) BOAT
           SCHEMATICS laid out across Jack's lap -

                                 JUNIOR LIEUTENANT
                        I'd take 'em over those PTs any day.
                        Goddamn death traps.

                                 JACK
                        You've been on one?

                                 JUNIOR LIEUTENANT
                        Was the Crew Chief on the 101. One
                        of the old Elcos. Side planks kept
                        cracking, forward chine guards ripped
                        away. The bottom framing underbows
                        would break if you looked at 'em
                        funny and the steering locked up
                        every hour on the hour.

           Jack glances back to the SCHEMATICS in his lap - ELCO 77'
           MOTOR TORPEDO BOAT. The Junior Lieutenant shakes his head -

                                 JUNIOR LIEUTENANT (CONT'D)
                        Those things are floating coffins. I
                        was lucky to get off with my life.

           Jack, digesting as the PLANE PITCHES, starts a shuddering
           descent. His eye catching -

           OUT THE WINDOW - the RAMSHACKLE NAVY BASE through the clouds,
           a scattering of tin-roofed shacks among the palm trees. BLACK
           SMOKE GUSHING from the DOCKS. DEBRIS scattering the water.

           The Junior Lieutenant twists to stare at the WRECKAGE -

                                 JUNIOR LIEUTENANT (CONT'D)
                        Jesus Christ.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. WILLYS JEEP [DRIVING] -- DAY

           Mud spattering up into the open-top WILLYS JEEP. A SECOND-
           CLASS PETTY OFFICER, 19 - downshifting behind the wheel as -

           Jack - freshly-arrived in the PASSENGER SEAT - twists to
           gape through the passing PALM TREES, rutted mud roads at the -
           BOMBED-OUT, GUTTED SHELLS of PT-117 and PT-164 - still
           belching black smoke, HALF-SUNK in the harbor.

           Jack - sweaty, tired, now ashen-faced.

                                 CMDR. BYRON WHITE (PRE-LAP)
                        Last night at approximately oh-one-
                        thirty hours, 18 Japanese bombers
                        struck our harbor in a surprise attack
                        that completely destroyed the PT-117
                        and PT-164.

           INT. BRIEFING ROOM, RENDOVA NAVY BASE -- AFTERNOON

           Dim lights strung up on dangling wires. Plywood walls crammed
           with hanging jackets, coats, a rattling stand fan. Cramming
           the room - YOUNG OFFICERS in cramped, one-piece chairs -

           Binders in their laps, scattered papers. The MEN CHATTERING
           to each other - a chaotic hubbub. Jack - among them, flipping
           nervously through his pages. Trying to see -

                                 CMDR. BYRON WHITE
                        Our intelligence indicates they are
                        preparing an imminent second assault
                        by sea, consisting of five Fubuku-
                        class Japanese destroyers.

           On a whirring OVERHEAD PROJECTOR - the bleary image of a
           looming JAPANESE DESTROYER - washing over CMDR. BYRON WHITE -
           26, glasses, friendly but no-nonsense manner -

                                 CMDR. BYRON WHITE (CONT'D)
                        They have a range of 5,000 nautical
                        miles, a top speed of 38 knots, and
                        they are armed to the goddamn teeth
                        with 127mm, 25mm, and 13mm naval and
                        AT/AA guns. That's in addition to at
                        least 9 torpedoes and 36 depth
                        charges. They can easily outrun,
                        outgun, and outmaneuver your PT boats.

           Among the crowd of MURMURING MEN - ENSIGN THOM, also 26,
           firm-faced, been around the block - glances over at the SNORT
           of a SNIDE ENSIGN -

                                 SNIDE ENSIGN
                        So what are we then, ducks at an
                        arcade?

                                 CMDR. BYRON WHITE
                        Our advantage is our intelligence.

                                 SNIDE ENSIGN'S BUDDY
                            (to the Snide Ensign)
                        Guess you're fucked then, Snyder.
           White ignores them. A CLACK from the SLIDE PROJECTOR as he
           punches the corded button to switch SLIDES to a MAP -

                                 CMDR. BYRON WHITE
                        This is the Blackett Strait. This is
                        the route we know they will be
                        traveling through both to reach us
                        and to resupply their Munda Base on
                        New Georgia Island tomorrow night.
                        Fifteen PT boats will deploy to
                        intercept these destroyers and buy
                        us time to launch a full-scale assault
                        at Munda. Your egress will be back
                        through Ferguson Passage.

           The Snide Ensign shakes his head - goddamn suicide mission.

                                 CMDR. BYRON WHITE (CONT'D)
                        Make no mistake: if we do not succeed,
                        there is a high likelihood we could
                        lose the Solomon Islands altogether,
                        leaving the door wide open for another
                        Pearl Harbor on the American mainland.

           A NERVOUS QUIET settles across the room. That got their
           attention. White flips through the pages on his clipboard -

                                 CMDR. BYRON WHITE (CONT'D)
                        Where's Lieutenant Kennedy?

           Jack, eyes on the projected map - snaps to attention -

                                 JACK
                        Here, sir.

           A few of the OTHER MEN look - recognizing the Kennedy name. 

                                 CMDR. BYRON WHITE
                        We have you skippering PT-166.

                                 JACK
                        Yes, sir.

                                 CMDR. BYRON WHITE
                        Now you're on the 109. Ensign Thom's
                        boat. He'll be your XO.

           Ensign Thom abruptly looks up - news to him.

                                 JACK
                        Sir. May I ask - why not the 166?

                                 CMDR. BYRON WHITE
                        It sank.

           The RUSTLING PAPERWORK, resuming CHATTER of the MEN - CEASES
           again. Quiet across the room.
           White, immune to it, business as usual, already flipping his
           clipboard shut -

                                 ENS. THOM
                        Sir. What about the crew?

                                 CMDR. BYRON WHITE
                        You'll integrate the crews. The 109
                        dropped a few men who couldn't make
                        it on the transport. Check your
                        manifests. That's it, people - report
                        to your stations. Dismissed.

           White CLAPS his binder shut. RUSTLING, MUTTERING, uneasy
           CHATTER already filling in as - Thom gazes through the other
           MEN getting to their feet. Locks eyes with -

           Jack - equally thrown. The man who just stole his command -
           looking nervous, young, and inexperienced. Thom bristles.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. WILLYS JEEP [DRIVING] -- AFTERNOON

           In the PASSENGER SEAT, Jack grips the metal frame of the
           THRASHING OPEN-TOPPED JEEP. Behind the wheel -

           The Second-Class Petty Officer downshifts, swerves to avoid
           a POTHOLE in the shitty MUD ROAD as it spills out of the
           dense PALM TREES and TROPICAL VEGETATION into -

           - DIRT-AND-GRAVEL. Rambling cluster of corrugated-metal SHACKS
           and HANGARS overhung by nets, foliage, makeshift CAMOUFLAGE.

           WOODEN PIERS jutting out into the murky green cove. P.T.
           BOATS roped to the leaning WOOD PILINGS, paint chipped.

           The whole dock looks more like a bush MARINE GRAVEYARD.

           Jack's eyes settle on the PROW of a PT BOAT up ahead -
           stenciled lettering - "PT-109." 

           ANOTHER JEEP nosed up at the dock. Already standing on the
           DECK of the boat - Ensign Thom's eyes lock onto Jack.

           An OLDER OFFICER - MOTOR MACHINIST MCMAHON - 37, grizzled,
           weathered, flecks of gray in his hair, five o'clock shadow -

           - conferring with Thom. Turns, casts baleful eyes on Jack as
           his JEEP judders up to a halt in the mud beside Thom's.

           Jack, self-conscious, grips the Jeep's frame, CLIMBS OUT.
           Stopping Joe Jr.'s FOOTBALL from rolling out with him.
           EXT. PIER, RENDOVA NAVAL DOCKS -- CONTINUOUS

           Polished SHOES SQUELCHING into the MUD, Jack draws up on the
           half-rotted wooden PIER to the GANGPLANK of PT-109 -

           - Thom and McMahon staring down over the rusted rail at him -

                                 JACK
                        Afternoon, gentlemen. Permission to
                        come aboard?

           INT. ENGINE ROOM, PT-109 -- MOMENTS LATER

           CHUGGING, CHURNING ENGINES at idle. Weeping DIESEL FUEL,
           OIL. Rickety, shuddering as young MOTOR MECHANIC ZINSER -
           25, boyish - struggles to tighten a joint with a WRENCH -

                                 MM. MCMAHON (O.S.)
                        Zinser. For God's sake...

           Zinser glances over his shoulder as - McMahon pushes past -
           Jack - just ducking into the doorway, his SHOES SPLASHING
           into two inches of murky brine and DIESEL -

                                 MM. MCMAHON (CONT'D)
                        You take her over sixty, we're all
                        going to be swimming in engine oil.

           McMahon GRABS the WRENCH out of Zinser's hands. Hurriedly
           ratcheting down a valve, a second one. The engines WHINING.

                                 JACK
                        What are these tanks doing over here?

           Jack - ducking his head through the narrow doorway - cramped
           CREW QUARTERS, bunks - nods at a PAIR OF GIANT FUEL TANKS -

                                 MM. MCMAHON
                        Had to get 'em closer to the engines.
                        The lines weren't holding any
                        pressure.

                                 JACK
                        They shouldn't be so close to the
                        bunks.

           McMahon snorts - WHACKS the SHUDDERING ENGINES with his
           wrench. A CLANG that makes Zinser jump -

                                 MM. MCMAHON
                        You'll get used to the smell.

           INT. CREW QUARTERS, PT-109 -- CONTINUOUS

           Elbows brushing the cramped bunks on either side - one of
           them held up by a tied rope, wooden beams splitting -
           Jack - shimmies his way through duffel bags, life jackets
           jamming the claustrophobic space. Ensign Thom behind him -

                                 ENS. THOM
                        Captain's cabin's this way, sir.

           Jack nearly hits his head on the chewed-up wooden hull -

           INT. CAPTAIN'S CABIN, PT-109 -- CONTINUOUS

           - as he ducks his head into the CRAMPED cabin. Tiny bed jammed
           like a bathtub under the curving hull. A half-sized desk. An
           INCH OF WATER on the FLOOR.

           Stacked papers on the desk, a bundle of clothes, an old cookie
           tin jammed with PHOTOS, PENS - Thom's things.

                                 JACK
                        What's with all the water everywhere?

           Thom - squeezing past him - SHOES SPLASHING as he reaches to
           gather up his things, moving out for Jack to move in -

                                 ENS. THOM
                        She leaks.

                                 JACK
                        She's not supposed to leak.

                                 ENS. THOM
                        No, sir. But she does.

           INT. RADIO ROOM, PT-109 -- MOMENTS LATER

           Ducking through CRAMPED, JUMBLED INSTRUMENTS - dials,
           switches, lights, tangled wires - Jack, paging through
           SCHEMATICS - casts around as Thom draws up behind him -

           Jack's eyes catch on an Elco INSTRUMENT PANEL - duct-taped
           together, spilling wires. Turning at a CLANK from -

           EXT. BRIDGE COMMAND DECK, PT-109 -- CONTINUOUS

           GUNNER'S MATE CHARLES HARRIS - 20, skinny, boyish, sandy-
           haired, sleeves rolled up - on his knees beneath one of the
           twin .50 CALIBER BROWNING MACHINE GUN emplacements -

           - ratcheting back the LOWER AMMUNITION GUIDE that has just
           fallen off as - Jack ducks out onto the OPEN-AIR bridge deck.
           Regards Harris, squints at the rumpled SCHEMATICS -

                                 JACK
                        These emplacements aren't even bolted
                        down.

                                 GM. HARRIS
                        Sorry, sir, didn't see that.
           Jack grabs up a WRENCH, TIGHTENS the bolts himself as Thom
           draws up behind him - losing patience -

                                 JACK
                        Nothing on this boat is up to spec.

                                 ENS. THOM
                        With respect, sir, we don't have
                        time or equipment to match the specs.

                                 JACK
                        We ship out at oh-seven-hundred
                        tomorrow, and we're not ready. This
                        is important.

           Thom - bristling, bites his tongue. Locks gazes with McMahon
           just emerging from the Boridge. McMahon rolls his eyes -

                                 ENS. THOM
                        Aye, sir.

           INT. MESS HALL, RENDOVA NAVY BASE -- NIGHT

           A BABBLE of VOICES - CLACKING plates, CLATTERING silverware -
           dim BULBS strung up across the curving, corrugated metal
           ceiling spilling weak light over - THREE DOZEN MEN -

           - elbow to elbow at long tables. Plates smeared with instant
           mashed potatoes, canned Spam. Chattering, laughing.

           Wedged into the corner - Jack, beans and potatoes untouched,
           leafs through a stuffed MANILA FOLDER - maps, diagrams.

           Glances up through the sweaty heat, the DIN of CONVERSATIONS -
           catching the eye of - Thom, hunched together with McMahon,
           Zinser, a couple of other ENSIGNS - laughing like old friends.

           An OLDER LONER at the opposite end. Jack watches him for a
           moment. Turns his attention back to the manila folder.

           A CLATTER as someone DROPS a PLATE. The Snide Ensign from
           the briefing laughing.

           Jack grimaces, grabs up his files. Pushing to his feet.

           INT. JACK'S ROOM, RENDOVA NAVY BARRACKS -- LATE NIGHT

           A cramped corner of the rickety barracks cordoned off with
           strung-up sheets. Dim desk lamp. Jack hunches awake at the
           desk - FILE flipped open, diagrams of JAPANESE DESTROYERS.

           Joe Jr.'s FOOTBALL wedged on the desk like a companion.

           Jack peels back another PAGE. Sleepless eyes landing on the
           OPERATIONAL WEATHER REPORT - "SEVERE STORM WARNING" - a series
           of smeary mimeographed MAPS.
           Glances up as - from the WINDOW, a PEAL OF THUNDER RUMBLES
           outside. Jack - eyes haunted, nervous - trepidation mounting.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. WILLYS JEEP [DRIVING] -- MORNING

           TORRENTING RAIN hammers the canvas soft-top. Windshield wipers
           slashing as fast as they can as -

           Jack - fresh starched uniform already spattered with mud,
           grabs the gearshift. Thrashing through a MUDDY POTHOLE.

           BRAKES, shudders to a HALT. Through the smeary windshield -
           the docks - WAVES CRASHING against the PT-109.

           WHITECAPS roiling under a MURKY GRAY SKY.

           INT. CREW QUARTERS, PT-109 -- MORNING

           Deck PITCHING - GROANING. Rain drumming on the hull. Jack,
           rumpled, bedraggled, stumbles against the hanging bunks -

           Catches himself as the DECK TILTS again, struck by another
           wave. Jack, a miserable, soggy SNEEZE - peers down the HALLWAY -

           THROUGH the OPEN HATCHWAY to the Engine Room - Zinser, McMahon
           HAMMERING at the ENGINES. A CLATTER as Zinser drops a WRENCH.

           Jack stumbles to the doorway to HIS CABIN - floor still
           drowning in an INCH OF WATER. The BACK WALL above the bunk -

           - now PAPERED OVER with British flags, sleeping lions - DUST
           JACKETS from HIS BOOK, "Why England Slept." 

           Glancing down the hall from the Engine Room - McMahon SNORTS -

                                 MM. MCMAHON
                        A little bedtime reading for you,
                        skipper.

                                 MM. ZINSER
                        Hear it puts you right to sleep.

           They both CRACK UP. Jack grimaces, hauls his SOPPING DUFFEL
           BAG onto the bed. Spilling Joe Jr.'s FOOTBALL. Jack narrowly
           SAVES it from tumbling onto the floor.

           INT. RADIO ROOM, PT-109 -- MOMENTS LATER

           Heaving himself up the narrow LADDER from below-deck - Jack
           nearly RUNS INTO ENS. GEORGE "BARNEY" ROSS - 34, salty, five
           o'clock shadow - half a generation older than Jack - the
           OLDER LONER from the Mess Hall the night before.

           - Ross - head jammed up beneath the loose, duct-taped Elco
           instrument panel, splicing wires, glances up at -
           Jack - as he draws up short, reads Ross's name tag -

                                 JACK
                        Ensign Ross. Lieutenant Kennedy.

                                 ENS. ROSS
                        I know who you are. Bet this'll all
                        sound real heroic in your next book.

           Ross jams his head back under the panel. Tightens a vacuum
           tube that SPARKS in his face. Winces, glowers out -

           THROUGH THE DOOR to the Command Deck as a SKINNY ENSIGN dashes
           by, barefoot, LEAPS - SPLASHES into the water LAUGHING -

                                 ENS. ROSS (CONT'D)
                        Jesus Christ, are we at war or grammar
                        school?

           EXT. BRIDGE COMMAND DECK, PT-109 -- CONTINUOUS

           Flinching in a blast of WIND, sprinkling raindrops - Jack
           ducks out, squints down at -

           TORPEDOMAN ANDREW KIRKSEY - 18, ashen-faced, leaning out
           over the main deck rail. Trying to snare a MOORING ROPE that -

                                 TM. KIRKSEY
                        Give it. Hand it up.

           - skinny GUNNER HAROLD MARNEY - 19, a boyish jackass,
           shirtless, in the WATER - is using to toy with Kirksey -

                                 GM. MARNEY
                        Lean a little farther, Kirksey -
                        just a little farther out.

           Jack - annoyed, rounds on Ens. Thom as he emerges onto the
           Command Deck with a BUCKET of RUSTY WATER and DIESEL -

                                 JACK
                        Ensign Thom. Get that boy out of the
                        water. Assemble the crew on deck.

           EXT. MAIN DECK, PT-109 -- MOMENTS LATER

           Snickering, shivering - Marney, shirt clinging to his soaked
           shoulders, squares up alongside Kirksey, hair dripping as -

           Jack flinches at a blast of WIND. Steps down the LINE OF
           MEN, his CREW. Thom at his back -

                                 JACK
                        Good morning, gentlemen. Welcome
                        aboard the 109. As many of you know,
                        this is my first active-duty command.
                                 (MORE)
                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        I suspect the same is true of some
                        of you.

           Jack's eyes raking across young Kirksey, still gripping the
           RAIL behind him with white knuckles.

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        I'll admit the boat isn't quite what
                        I expected.

                                 MM. MCMAHON
                            (under his breath)
                        Not enough leather and lacquer for
                        you, sir?

           Beside him in the sprinkling rain - Zinser gives a SNORT.
           Ross sneers. Scorn in the gaze he casts upon Jack.

                                 ENS. THOM
                        Lock it down, McMahon

           Jack, trying to ignore it, sensing he is falling flat - begins
           to stumble through a speech rehearsed in his head -

                                 JACK
                        There are times when a man does not
                        choose his circumstances, but his
                        circumstances choose him. And he...
                        He must rise to the occasion and
                        become someone different.

           A few MEN SNICKER. Jack turns back. All of them watching him -
           drenched, freezing, tired - barely hiding their smirks.

           Flustered, a little ruffled, Jack grimaces - abruptly wheels
           away. Heading for the BRIDGE, passing Ensign Thom -

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        To hell with it. Have 'em start the
                        engines.

           Thom draws up at the end of the line, caught off-guard -

                                 ENS. THOM
                        Sir?

                                 JACK
                        Start the engines. We push off at oh-
                        seven-hundred. Sharp.

           As Jack climbs up to the Bridge, Thom rounds on the men.
           Zinser sneering after their new skipper -

                                 MM. ZINSER
                        He gonna give a speech every time we
                        start the engines?
                                 MM. MCMAHON
                        Maybe the plan is to talk the Japs
                        to death.

           The OTHER MEN SNICKER. Thom, troubled, apprehensive - this
           untried Harvard boy at their helm.

           EXT. BRIDGE COMMAND DECK, PT-109 -- MOMENTS LATER

           Climbing up onto the Bridge Deck, shoes squelching, uniform
           already clinging to him - Jack, frustrated with himself.
           SLAMS the BULKHEAD with his FIST. JUMPS as -

                                 ENS. ROSS (O.S.)
                        Word to the wise, Lieutenant.

           - Ross - salt-and-pepper hair coated in dewy raindrops, leans
           in over the threshold to the Main Deck -

                                 ENS. ROSS (CONT'D)
                        You want their respect, maybe don't
                        lead off with how you've never done
                        this before in your life.

           Jack turns away, frustration deepening. Knows he just fucked
           up. A JOLT as the ENGINES GRIND TO LIFE below.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. PACIFIC OCEAN -- AFTERNOON

           Thrashed by roiling waves against a deepening gray sky - the
           PT-109 - tips, PITCHES. Cutting through the open ocean. The
           mounting STORM filling the HORIZON ahead of them.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. BRIDGE COMMAND DECK, PT-109 -- LATER / NIGHT

           Rain sprinkling the smeary windshield. Wrapped in a PARKA,
           gripping the WHEEL - Jack blanches as the ship crests a wave,
           DROPS sharply. Jack squints out against the misery of RAIN.

           THROUGH THE OPEN RADIO ROOM DOORWAY AT HIS KNEES -

           Hunched at the cramped NAVIGATIONAL DESK - maps crowding the
           surface - Ens. Thom - RADIO HEADPHONE pressed to one EAR -

                                 ENS. THOM
                        Radar report from PT-157: Division 1
                        has possible enemy contact, 30km
                        S/SE. Unconfirmed.

           ON THE BRIDGE DECK -

           Jack, alarmed, glances at Ensign Ross as he lifts BINOCULARS
           to his eyes. Peers out through the rain-streaked WINDSHIELD.
           INT. ENGINE ROOM, PT-109 -- SAME TIME

           ENGINES ROARING, a deafening grind of churning machinery,
           grubby gauges, shuddering pipes. The WHOLE SHIP LURCHES -
           struck by another wave -

           Zinser - PITCHES, stumbling. FALLS INTO McMahon, working to
           pump saltwater out of the gurgling pressure oil strainer -

                                 MM. ZINSER
                        Jesus. Skipper's gonna roll us before
                        we ever see a Jap.

           Staggering through the doorway to the Crew Quarters - young
           Marney flashes Zinser a goofy grin -

                                 GM. MARNEY
                        What's the matter, Zinser, you afraid
                        of a little swim?

           Zinser scowls, hauling himself back to his feet -

                                 MM. ZINSER
                        You should be. See the handsome fellow
                        above McMahon's bunk?

           INT. CREW QUARTERS, PT-109 -- CONTINUOUS

           Braced in the doorway, Marney - smirking - tosses a glance
           toward the stacked CREW BUNKS - jammed with duffel bags,
           equipment lashed down with ropes, nets. Above McMahon's BUNK -

           - the HORRIFIC, SHARP, jutting TOOTHY SKELETON of a BARRACUDA.
           Through the doorway, Zinser catches Marney's eye -

                                 MM. ZINSER
                        Water's swarming with 'em in the
                        Strait.

           Marney lets out a boyish laugh -

                                 GM. MARNEY
                        Bullshit.

                                 MM. ZINSER
                        Ask McMahon.

           INT. ENGINE ROOM, PT-109 -- CONTINUOUS

           Struggling to tighten a valve, McMahon, tree-trunk arms
           straining, jaw clenched, IGNORES them. Zinser, glancing to
           him, shrugs it off - swings back to Marney in the DOORWAY -

                                 MM. ZINSER
                        They like to come up from below, nip
                        your balls right off.
                                 GM. MARNEY
                        Bullshit.

           A CRACK - as McMahon's PIPE SNAPS LOOSE. SPEWING DIESEL in a
           GUSHING PETROLEUM FOUNTAIN, coating his arms, legs -

                                 MM. MCMAHON
                        Shit - SHIT. Zinser, get over here!

           EXT. BRIDGE COMMAND DECK, PT-109 -- SAME TIME

           A LURCH, the BOAT SHUDDERING - as Jack GRIPS the WHEEL. Throws
           an urgent glance over at Ens. Ross - as he catches himself,
           drags the BINOCULARS away from his eyes -

                                 JACK
                        What the hell was that?

           A CLANGING BELL from down BELOW. The DECK SHUDDERS again -

                                 ENS. ROSS
                        Lost an engine, feels like.

           Jack - alarmed. Ross calmly meets his gaze -

                                 ENS. ROSS (CONT'D)
                        Happens on these boats. All the time.

           Jack looks forward. A THUNDERING WAVE RUSHING at them. Jack
           spins the WHEEL instinctively -

           - maneuvering the PROW into the WAVE just as it HITS. WATER
           GUSHING over the DECK. The WHOLE SHIP SHAKING.

           IN THE RADIO ROOM -

           Straining to HEAR through the RADIO HEADPHONE clamped to his
           EAR - Thom looks up sharply -

                                 ENS. THOM
                        Enemy contact confirmed, PT-157, PT-
                        101, Blackett Strait, torpedoes in
                        the water. 25km and closing.

           INT. GALLEY, PT-109 -- SAME TIME

           Whisking in a steel bowl - cramped counters jammed with cans,
           a simmering pot on the tiny stove - COOK EDGAR MAUER, 28,
           stocky, salty - unfazed by the PITCHING DECK, chewing GUM -

                                 COOK MAUER
                        They bombed the shit out of us on
                        the Niagra last year, and Ross - his
                        boat, the 166, they got taken out by
                        our own B-25s.
                            (licks the whisk)
                        Mmm. Just like my girl makes it.
           - oblivious to the FEAR of trembling, terrified young
           Torpedoman Kirksey - gripping the doorway. JUMPS at -

           A CRACKLE from the SHIPBOARD P.A. -

                                 ENS. THOM (P.A.)
                        Battle stations. All crew to battle
                        stations. We are on high alert.

           Mauer, lifting a steaming skillet off the stove, locks eyes
           with Kirksey - rigid, unmoving in the doorway.

                                 COOK MAUER
                        That'd be you, kid.

           INT. ENGINE ROOM, PT-109 -- SAME TIME

           DIESEL petroleum now GUSHING from two PIPES as Zinser,
           McMahon, SOAKED in it, FIGHT to stanch the FLOW.

           A LURCH as a SECOND ENGINE GIVES OUT. Chunks of METAL SHRAPNEL
           CLANGING inside. McMahon grimaces -

                                 MM. MCMAHON
                        Zinser.

           - gestures to a FRESH RUPTURE in the THIRD ENGINE'S FUEL
           LINE. SPITTING more HOT DIESEL, a brown geyser of it.

           EXT. BRIDGE COMMAND DECK, PT-109 -- SAME TIME

           The LURCH SHUDDERING up through the WHEEL as Jack GRIPS IT.
           Ross, binoculars jammed to his eyes, braces himself -

                                 ENS. ROSS
                        Lost a second one.
                            (lowers the binoculars)
                        This rate we're not even gonna make
                        it to the battlefield.

           Jack - maybe not a bad thing - squints forward. The OCEAN
           dark, murky.

           IN THE RADIO ROOM -

           Thom scrabbles through maps, charts. The DECK PITCHING. RADIO
           HEADPHONE pressed to his EAR -

                                 ENS. THOM
                        PT-101 has expended all torpedoes
                        and is returning to base. No hits.

           ON THE BRIDGE DECK -

           Jack, his focus on the STORM - shuts his eyes - FEELING the
           OCEAN THROUGH THE WHEEL - just like he did back at home -
                                 JACK
                        Cut Engine Number Three and reduce
                        Four to half power.

           Ross glances over. Thom looks sharply up, alarmed -

                                 ENS. THOM
                        Sir - we'd be dead in the water.

                                 JACK
                        We're gonna burn 'em all out if we
                        keep up like this.

           Jack squints through the smeary windshield -

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        The eye of the storm is right over
                        the next swell.

                                 ENS. ROSS
                        I'm not seeing that.

                                 JACK
                            (re: the wheel)
                        I know what she's telling me.

           A WHINE from the ENGINES, the BOAT SHAKING -

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        Give the order, Ensign.

           Thom gulps, grabs up the RADIO -

           INT. ENGINE ROOM, PT-109 -- SAME TIME

           MURKY WATER BELCHING from the FLOODED salt water pump - as
           Zinser struggles to STANCH the FLOW on ENGINE NUMBER THREE -

                                 ENS. THOM (P.A.)
                        Engine room, cut Engine Three, take
                        Four to half power.

           Zinser whips his head back, looking, alarmed to McMahon -
           WORKING fast, URGENTLY wrapping a RUPTURED FUEL LINE in TAPE -

                                 MM. ZINSER
                        We cut Three, she's gonna stop
                        irrigating out.

           McMahon grimaces, keeps wrapping the fuel line -

                                 MM. MCMAHON
                        You heard the order, Zinser.

                                 MM. ZINSER
                        It's a goddamn idiot order!
           EXT. FORWARD DECK, PT-109 -- NIGHT / SAME TIME

           DRENCHED as a WAVE douses him - Gunner Harris, gripping the
           .37MM forward turret, shields his face. Through the bleary,
           inky darkness -

           A GLIMMER of LIGHT - somewhere up ahead. Harris wipes at his
           eyes. The LIGHT GONE as the deck PITCHES, slows. Harris turns
           to SHOUT back toward the Bridge -

                                 GM. HARRIS
                        POSSIBLE CONTACT. DEAD AHEAD.

           EXT. BRIDGE COMMAND DECK, PT-109 -- SAME TIME

           Jack - latched to the wheel as the boat SHUDDERS, slows. The
           engine WHINE dying. One last swell of the ocean JARRING them -

                                 JACK
                        Hold on!

           IN THE RADIO ROOM -

           Thom's maps TUMBLE to the floor. A CLATTER of compasses,
           pencils. It feels like the whole boat is going to tip over.

           Then - the deck PITHCES back. SLAMMING DOWN. Thom grunts.
           SLAMMED against his desk. Ross gripping the hull as -

           The boat LEVELS OUT. Rain dissipating. A sudden CALM sweeping
           over the whole OCEAN. The eye of the storm.

           ON THE BRIDGE DECK -

           Sweating, rigid - Jack finally eases his grip on the wheel.
           Pushes out a ragged breath. A defiant glance over at Ross.

           EXT. MAIN DECK, PT-109 -- NIGHT / SAME TIME

           DRENCHED to the bone - young Torpedoman Kirksey, gripping
           the TORPEDO CONTROLS. Petrified in the sudden stillness as -

                                 GM. HARRIS (O.S.)
                        POSSIBLE CONTACT AHEAD.

           Kirksey - JOLTS - not sure where to aim, what to do.

           EXT. BRIDGE COMMAND DECK, PT-109 -- SAME TIME

           Ross presses the BINOCULARS to his eyes. Jack watching him -

                                 ENS. ROSS
                        I don't see anything.

           Jack pivots back to Thom, RADIO SQUAWKING in his EAR -
                                 ENS. THOM
                        The 157 has the radar unit but they
                        ran dry. They're returning to port.
                        We're blind out here.

                                 JACK
                        Who the hell are they all firing at?

           INT. GALLEY, PT-109 -- SAME TIME

           Mauer, chewing gum, clacks out a stack of bowls, plates on
           the narrow counter. Turns to the simmering pot -

           Reaches - CLANGS a BELL above the stove -

                                 COOK MAUER
                        Soup's up, boys! We've made it through
                        the worst of it.

           EXT. FORWARD DECK, PT-109 -- NIGHT / SAME TIME

           Harris - tense in the abrupt quiet, jams trembling hands
           into his pockets. Wrestles out a water-logged package of
           MARLBOROS, a SOGGY MATCHBOOK.

           Grimaces, pries at A SOAKED MATCH. It comes apart. Harris
           sighs, crumples both packages into a ball. Turning to CHUCK
           them OFF THE SIDE OF THE BOAT - when he FREEZES -

           RUSHING OUT OF THE DARKNESS - BARRELING AT THEM AT 40 KNOTS -

                          - THE LOOMING PROW OF A JAPANESE DESTROYER BOAT.

           Harris - MOUTH falling OPEN. DROPS the CIGARETTES -

                                 GM. HARRIS
                        SHIP! SHIP AT TWO O'CLOCK!

           EXT. BRIDGE COMMAND DECK, PT-109 -- SAME TIME

           Jack - JUMPS. SCRAMBLES to GRAB the WHEEL. Ross WHIPPING the
           BINOCULARS to his EYES.

                                 ENS. ROSS
                        Oh Jesus.

           EXT. MAIN DECK, PT-109 -- SAME TIME

           LEAPING to his feet, young Kirksey GAPES up at THE DESTROYER -
           right on top of them.

           Harris - FRANTIC - JAMS .37MM SHELLS into the GUN - racing
           to WHIP the BARREL toward the DESTROYER as -

                                 TM. KIRKSEY (O.S.)
                        JUMP SHIP! JUMP SHIP!
           EXT. BRIDGE COMMAND DECK, PT-109 -- SAME TIME

           Jack - GRAPPLING with the WHEEL, YANKS IT as it STICKS. LOCKED
           UP. Ross DROPS the BINOCULARS from his eyes, looking to -

           Jack - PULLING AT the UNRESPONSIVE WHEEL with ALL OF HIS
           STRENGTH - every OUNCE OF ENERGY -

                                 ENS. ROSS
                        This is it.

           INT. GALLEY, PT-109 -- SAME TIME

           - as the HULL of the Japanese Destroyer SLICES STRAIGHT
           THROUGH the PT-109 in a CHAOS of splintered wood.

           FLINGING young Marney, tumbling like a rag doll in the
           EXPLOSIVE shattering of buckled hull.

           CUTTING THROUGH the Galley - pots, pans, hot soup SEARING
           over Cook Mauer as he is BLASTED backward. A FLASH RIPS
           THROUGH -

           THE CREW QUARTERS

           - as the giant FUEL TANKS RUPTURE and EXPLODE. Flames licking
           the bunks. In -

           THE ENGINE ROOM

           - FIRE BLASTS through the doorway - INSTANTLY IGNITING the
           DIESEL. McMahon, Zinser TORCHED - SCREAMING.

           EXT. BRIDGE COMMAND DECK, PT-109 -- SAME TIME

           DECK JARRING, LURCHING - RIPPING Jack off the WHEEL. Jack
           TUMBLES -

           IN THROUGH THE RADIO ROOM DOOR -

           SLAMS against Ensign Thom's DESK - SLAMMING his BACK. CRUSHING
           the AIR out of him.

           Papers, pens, pencils, compasses CLATTERING - SHATTERED GLASS
           RAINING down across Jack from the BROKEN WINDOWS.

                                                      OUT ON THE WATER:

           GASPING - PANICKING - FIGHTING in the TUMULTUOUS BLACK WATER -
           Harris - FACE speckled in SPLINTERS - COUGHING up SEA-WATER -

           FLAMES playing over his face from THE 109 - SHORN INTO TWO
           HALVES - Harris PAWS his way THROUGH DEBRIS -
           - GRASPS onto an ORANGE LIFE JACKET. PALE SHOULDERS, a SOPPING
           UNIFORM, the messy brown hair of -

                        Kirksey. KIRKSEY.

           - young Kirksey. Harris yanks at him, turning him over - his
           pale face, MILKY LIFELESS EYES - raking across Harris -

           A PLYWOOD BEAM JUTTING THROUGH Kirksey - DEAD.

           Harris HEAVES, chokes back a RUSH of VOMIT - another WAVE
           SPLASHING OVER HIM - DUNKING him UNDER.

           INT. RADIO ROOM, PT-109 -- SAME TIME

           HALF-DAZED - Jack WINCES at SHARP PAIN as he tries to haul
           himself upright on the TILTED DECK. Gazes around - a FOG of
           HORROR and CHAOS. Flickering FLAMES. SCREAMING outside.

           OUT ON the BRIDGE DECK, Ross - MOANING, moving feebly. Jack -
           STUNNED - shakes himself at another SCREAM from OUTSIDE.

           Hauls himself - WINCING at the PAIN - to his FEET. Heaves
           his way up the TILTED DECK. Crunching through BROKEN GLASS.

           Stepping out through the DOORWAY to the BRIDGE -

           EXT. BRIDGE COMMAND DECK, PT-109 -- CONTINUOUS

           - Jack braces himself against the DOOR FRAME - squints across
           the SMASHED DECK - across the PITCH BLACK WATER at -

           FLAMES ROARING - a PUDDLE OF FIRE - BLINDINGLY BRIGHT from

           MORE SCREAMING from the FIERCE, ROARING GLARE of FIRE.

           Jack RIPS at the BUTTONS of his OFFICER'S SHIRT. TEARS them
           open. Drops it on the deck and - RUNNING - LEAPS -

                                                        INTO THE OCEAN:

           - PLUNGING into the FREEZING WATER. CHURNING all around Jack.
           PITCH BLACK - BROKEN by the SEARING, BLINDING FLAMES up ahead. 

           SPLASHING into the WATER - Jack SWIMS TOWARD the BURNING AFT
           SECTION of the PT-109. PLUNGING -

           UNDERWATER

           Swirling blackness, murky darkness lit by the FIRE as it
           streams through the WATER up ahead.
           Jack - SWIPES, CLAWS - SWIMS DESPERATELY - LEGS KICKING -
           one SHOE TUMBLING OFF - spinning away.

           EERIE SCREAMS warbling through the water. THROUGH THE MURK -
           the FRANTIC KICKING SHAPE of A MAN - HALF UNDERWATER. Jack -

           SURFACES

           - FACE INSTANTLY SEARED - by ROARING FLAMES - a HELLISH SCENE -
           the SURFACE OF THE OCEAN ON FIRE from the PUDDLE of SPILLED
           DIESEL GUSHING OUT of the AFT SECTION of the PT-109 -

           Washing over McMahon - WRITHING, ON FIRE in the MIDDLE of
           the FLAMES. SCREAMING as his FLESH BUBBLES and BURNS.

                                 MM. ZINSER (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        HELP HIM! SOMEONE HELP HIM.

           CLINGING to the SPLINTERED EDGE of the GAPING, SHEARED HULL
           of the ENGINE ROOM DECK - Zinser - face BLACKENED.

           Jack GULPS in a BREATH of AIR - plunges -

           UNDERWATER

           - into the ROILING MURK. SWIMS into the drifting SHRAPNEL,
           DEBRIS CHURNED by the STILL-TURNING ENGINE PROPELLERS -

           Jack - CLAWING TOWARD McMahon, GRABS his BELT - YANKS. McMahon
           PANICS - KICKS JACK IN THE FACE -

           Jack - SPEWING BUBBLES - A PLUME of BLOOD from his NOSE -
           GRABS McMahon HARDER - YANKS HIM down UNDERWATER - as McMahon
           WRITHES, STRUGGLES -

           FLAMES DOUSED - as he SUBMERGES. His frantic eyes finding
           Jack's - calm, forceful, an IRON GRIP on McMahon's BELT -

           Jack SWIMS, SWIMS - KICKING - PULLING McMahon AWAY from the
           SURFACE POOL of DIESEL. McMahon - CHOKING - losing
           consciousness as Jack HAULS HIM UP, BURSTING through THE -

           SURFACE

           GASPING - SPLUTTERING - Jack - KICKING to TREAD WATER as
           Zinser dimly SHOUTS at him. Jack wraps his arms around McMahon -
           SQUEEZING the WATER up out of his LUNGS.

           McMahon COUGHS - HEAVES up SEAWATER - burnt, disoriented.
           Slips OUT of Jack's GRASP - SINKING.

                                 JACK
                        SWIM, HENRY.

                                 MM. MCMAHON
                        I - CAN'T -
           McMahon GOES UNDER. Jack CATCHES him - DRAGGED -

           UNDERWATER

           - hands fumbling with HIS OWN BELT - Jack - manages to unhook
           it, wriggle it off while KICKING to keep McMahon ABOVE the
           SURFACE. PUSHING BACK UP THROUGH to the -

           SURFACE

           - himself, Jack - loops the BELT around McMahon's RIGHT ARM.
           Glances back through the ROARING FLAMES as -

           STEAM GUSHES UP - out of the AFT PORTION of the PT-109 -
           SEAWATER RUSHING IN - HITTING the BURNING ENGINES -

                                 JACK
                        Zinser, get the hell out of there!

                                 MM. ZINSER
                        I can't see a goddamn thing!

           The DECK STARTING TO SINK beneath him - Zinser - POISED on
           the RAGGED, TILTED EDGE - SLIPS - SLAMS hard - starts to -

           SLIDE - down toward the raging FLAMES and STEAM - CATCHES
           the EDGE of the DECK - GRIPS IT - HAULS HIMSELF UP -

                                 JACK
                        JUMP, ZINSER. NOW!

           Zinser squints through the FLAMES - glances over his SHOULDER
           at the SINKING BOAT. Tenses - SPRINGS -

           SPLASHING into the WATER - FLAMES licking at his LEGS. Zinser
           YELPS - plunges his LEGS UNDERWATER. Jack catches him -

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        SWIM.

           A SECONDARY BLAST from the AFT PORTION of the PT-109 as -
           Jack JAMS the BELT into HIS MOUTH - CLAMPING DOWN -

           - SWIMS forward in STRONG, HEAVING STROKES - TUGGING McMahon
           BEHIND HIM. Zinser - KICKING, SPLASHING - SWIMS after them.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. GALLEY, PT-109 [FORWARD SECTION] -- SAME TIME

           BLOOD SHEETING from the side of his HEAD - Cook Mauer - JOLTS
           AWAKE as FREEZING SEAWATER gushes ACROSS him.

           PANIC flashing in his eyes, Mauer strains to sit up - CAUGHT,
           TANGLED in a JUMBLE of NETTING and DEBRIS. Gaze falling on -
                                 COOK MAUER
                        Marney.

           - young Marney, HUNKERED in the WRECKAGE of the BUNKS, hugging
           himself. All earlier swagger gone. PARALYZED with TERROR.

           Mauer - WATER RISING to his CHEST, STREAMING IN to FILL the
           TILTING - SINKING - Crew Quarters.

                                 COOK MAUER (CONT'D)
                        MARNEY. I'm stuck. You have to -

           Mauer - CHOKES as the WATER laps up into his MOUTH. Tips his
           head back, GASPING, COUGHING -

                                 COOK MAUER (CONT'D)
                        GET OVER HERE, MARNEY.

           Marney - JOLTED - SHOVES to his FEET. SLIDING on the slipery
           DECK. Trembling, STUMBLES his way toward -

           Mauer - head tipped back, WATER SURGING above his SHOULDERS.
           Marney SPLASHES into it, WINCING at the COLD -

                                 COOK MAUER (CONT'D)
                        THE NET. I'M TANGLED IN THE NET.

           Marney reaches, FUMBLING UNDERWATER. Trying to UNTANGLE Mauer
           as the WATER SLOPS over Mauer's FACE -

           RUSHING in FAST now - RISING over Marney's skinny SHOULDERS.

                                 COOK MAUER (CONT'D)
                        USE A KNIFE.

           Marney stares at him. TURNS - a RACK of KITCHEN KNIVES on
           the galley counter about to be SWALLOWED by the WATER.

           Marney LUNGES, GRABS a SERRATED KNIFE. WHEELS BACK, SPLASHING
           into the water. Mauer, SPLUTTERING - HEAD PLUNGING -

           UNDERWATER

           Mauer's WILD EYES ROVING across the murk of broken dishes,
           pots, pans, papers, clothes. Marney's HANDS - SAWING sloppily
           at the NETTING with the KNIFE -

           Hazy UNCONSCIOUSNESS starting to OVERTAKE Cook Mauer.

           ABOVE THE SURFACE

           Marney, frantic, terrified - WATER BUBBLING up to his CHIN -
           SAWS THROUGH the NET. HAULS Mauer UP -

           Mauer, UNCONSCIOUS - LOLLING forward in the WATER as it RISES -
           FILLING the Crew Cabin. Marney twists back -
           THE DOORWAY HATCH - escape - eight feet away.

                                 GM. MARNEY
                        Mauer. MAUER, WAKE UP.

           Mauer - still OUT COLD. Marney, shivering, terrified - HEAVES
           Mauer with him. SHOVING him through the RISING WATER toward
           the HATCH when -

           UNDERWATER

           - a SNARLED TENDRIL of NETTING catches Marney's ANKLE. COILING
           around it, SNARING him.

           ABOVE THE SURFACE

           Marney - TRIPS - SPLASHES into the WATER as - Mauer -
           STIRRING, half-conscious - GOES UNDER again.

           Marney - trying to WRESTLE FREE - sees Mauer. Marney LUNGES
           forward - JOLTED, REINED BACK by the NETTING. PUSHES Mauer
           up through the RISING WATER -

           THROUGH the DOORWAY HATCH - into the HALLWAY. SAFE. WATER
           gushing up OVER Marney's HEAD - plunging him -

           UNDERWATER

           Marney, FRANTIC, can't REACH the KNIFE - LEGS still ENTANGLED -
           WORSE than EVER in the NETTING -

           The WATER starting to SLOP UP, OUT of the Crew Quarters -
           into the HALL.

           A resolve, understanding washes over Marney. He PUSHES OFF
           the deck, underwater. SHOVES the HATCH of the DOORWAY -

           TO THE HALL

           - SHUT with a CLANG. JOLTING Mauer awake. On the other side
           of the hatch, still trapped in the FLOODED Crew Quarters -
           Marney WHEELS the LOCK SHUT.

           Mauer, COUGHING, scrabbles to his feet. Grasping at the DOOR -
           trying to WHEEL it OPEN -

                                 COOK MAUER
                        Marney. MARNEY - NO.

           Through the hazy WINDOW - Marney BRACES the DOOR SHUT. Sealing
           off the compartment. Stopping the FLOOD with his LIFE.

           Mauer, fumbling, trying to open the door - LOCKS EYES with
           Marney through the GLASS as a PEACE WASHES OVER HIM. Going
           inert, gaze turning glassy - lost - DEAD.

           Mauer CLAPS a DRIPPING HAND to his OWN MOUTH.
           INT. RADIO ROOM, PT-109 -- SAME TIME

           WATER starting to SLOP IN from the Command Deck. Ensign Thom,
           hands TREMBLING, clutching the RADIO TRANSCEIVER -

                                 ENS. THOM
                            (into the radio)
                        MAYDAY, MAYDAY - this is PT-109 -

           SPARKS spitting from the SMASHED MACHINERY. Thom flinches.
           At the COMMAND DECK DOORWAY - Ross - BINOCULARS to his EYES -

                                 ENS. ROSS
                        I got lights but they're all moving
                        away from us.

           EXT. OCEAN/PT-109 [FORWARD SECTION] -- SAME TIME

           GAGGING - GASPING for breath - SALTWATER HALF-DROWNING him -
           jaws clamped down on the BELT wrapped around McMahon -

           - Jack takes a FRIGID WAVE to the FACE. GOES UNDER. BURSTS
           BACK above the surface - HACKING, COUGHING. Gropes feebly
           for the TILTED, SPLINTERED DECK of the PT-109's PROW.

           His HAND GRIPS the RAIL - SLIPS - LOSES IT. Jack PLUNGES -

           UNDERWATER

           - WEIGHED down by the drag of McMahon's SINGED BODY. Jack,
           SWIPING, HEAVING at the water - PUSHES HIMSELF back -

           ABOVE THE SURFACE

           LUNGES - GRIPS the bent HANDRAIL again. Knuckles white, barely
           holding on. Jack PULLS UP with ALL HIS STRENGTH.

           Zinser - GASPING, FLAILING behind him - his own LEGS BURNT,
           feeble in the churning water. McMahon UNCONSCIOUS.

           Jack's FINGERS STARTING TO SLIP - about to FALL BACK when -

           A HAND GRABS his WRIST. Cook Mauer, smeared in his OWN BLOOD,
           SOAKED through, grits his teeth - HAULS Jack and McMahon,
           bound to him by the BELT -

           - ONTO THE MAIN DECK OF THE PT-109.

           Jack - HEAVING McMahon up behind him - hoarse, breathless,
           spluttering. Half-choking on seawater -

                                 JACK
                        ZINSER - Get Zinser up here!

           Mauer, already reaching back, HAULS Zinser up behind him.
           Jack DROPS to his KNEES, checking McMahon's BREATHING. HAMMERS
           his CHEST until -
           - McMahon - COUGHING - SPEWS up SEAWATER. Alive.

           Mauer eyes raking across Zinser's BURNED LEGS, SCORCHED FLESH.
           Zinser, also COUGHING, GASPING for breath.

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        Who do we have? Who's here?

                                 COOK MAUER
                        We lost the kid. We lost Marney.

           Stumbling from the SMASHED PORT SIDE of the deck - Harris -
           soaked, SHIVERING, ashen-faced -

                                 GM. HARRIS
                        Kirksey too.

           Jack stares at Harris - numb horror setting in. Those boys,
           barely older than his brother, Bobby. Turns, takes in -

           - the RAVAGED SHIP, his command. The HELLISH FIRE now
           CONSUMING the AFT SECTION. Oil slicks smearing the water -
           FLAMES licking at the BLACK NIGHT.

           The OTHER MEN - BLOODY, drenched - TERRIFIED. Jack pushes to
           his feet. Stumbling toward the Command Deck.

           INT. RADIO ROOM, PT-109 -- CONTINUOUS

           Ensign Thom, growing FRANTIC, SLAMS the RADIO with his fist -

                                 ENS. THOM
                            (into the radio)
                        This is the 109 - This is PT-109...
                        Where the hell is everyone?!

           Ross peels the BINOCULARS from his eyes, turning as Jack
           staggers into the doorway. Taking in Ross, Thom.

                                 ENS. ROSS
                        Captain.

                                 JACK
                        What are we looking at?

                                 ENS. THOM
                        No one's coming for us! No one's
                        coming for us!

           Thom, PANICKING, cannot comprehend it. Jack meets Ross's
           eyes. Turns, taking in the -

           - RADIO, SMASHED equipment. SHATTERED windows. TILTING deck.
           The whole FORWARD SECTION of the boat SHUDDERING.

                                 JACK
                        We're sinking.
           Glances back to Ross. Ross, a CURT NOD. They are sinking.

           EXT. MAIN DECK, PT-109 -- CONTINUOUS

           Gripping the door frame, Jack stumbles back out onto the
           splintered, slippery deck. Shielding his eyes through a fresh
           speckling of RAINDROPS to squint at the -

           INKY BLACKNESS - churning WAVES surrounding the RAVAGED 109.
           Mauer, McMahon, Zinser, Harris, a FEW OTHER OFFICERS CLINGING
           to the TILTING DECK like a life raft.

           Water SLOPPING UP over the deck. SPLASHING against the HALF-
           CONSCIOUS McMahon. Ross draws up beside Jack -

                                 JACK
                        Japs come back, we'll have to be
                        ready to fight.

                                 GM. HARRIS
                        Fight with what?

                                 ENS. ROSS
                        We have to abandon ship.

           Jack looks sharply over to Ross -

                                 JACK
                        We're not giving up.

                                 ENS. ROSS
                        We're going down. There's not gonna
                        be anything to give up on.

           Jack looks to McMahon, the others. WATER now CONSUMING HALF
           the FORWARD DECK. SPLASHING at their ankles.

                                 ENS. ROSS (CONT'D)
                        We stay, you're gonna drown us all.

           Zinser, Harris, Mauer all LOOKING TO Jack now. Jack, rocked
           to the core by his words. Disbelief, defeat gnawing. Accedes -

                                 JACK
                        Everyone gather what equipment you
                        can carry. Prepare to abandon ship.

                                 MM. ZINSER
                        Abandon her for what? There's nothing
                        out there.

                                 COOK MAUER
                        Someone'll come for us. Someone'll
                        come. We should stay here.

           Ross presses the BINOCULARS to his eyes, then meets Jack's
           gaze. The grim truth on his face. BLACKNESS all around them -
                                 JACK
                        No one's coming for us.

           SHUDDERING RIPPING through the DECK. WATER SURGING over the
           EDGES. STARTING to FLOOD -

                                 GM. HARRIS
                        She's starting to turn!

                                 JACK
                        You want to stay onboard, you can go
                        down with her!

           INT. RADIO ROOM, PT-109 -- SAME TIME

           SPARKS spitting from the INSTRUMENTS. Ensign Thom, still
           FRANTICALLY trying to REWIRE the RADIO, fingers trembling.

           STAGGERING into the doorway, the DARK of the NIGHT at his
           back, Jack catches himself against the bulkhead -

                                 JACK
                        Gather the maps, whatever you can
                        carry.

                                 ENS. THOM
                        I've almost got the radio -

           The DECK PITCHES. Jack's FEET SLIDING on the slippery wood -

                                 JACK
                        Get out of here!

           His EYES falling on the YAWNING BLACKNESS of the DOORWAY
           down to the CREW QUARTERS. The other men SHOUTING outside.

           INT. CORRIDOR, PT-109 -- SAME TIME

           PITCH BLACKNESS. Breathing shallowly, scared for his life,
           Jack SPLASHES through the TWO FEET of RISING WATER. The
           stressed wooden hull GROANING all around him.

           Jack SLIPS - CATCHES himself. Wood beams CRACKING -

                                 JACK
                        Anyone down here?

           Jack throws a glance over his shoulder. Rain sprinkling down
           from the Bridge, Command Deck above.

           Ahead - only DARKNESS. A ripped MATTRESS - a JUMBLE of
           magazines, clothes, splintered wood slopping in the WATER.

           At the END of the HALL - the HATCH that Marney SEALED. MURKY
           WATER filling the WINDOW. Jack squints. Advancing when -

           WITH a CRACK - THE HATCH suddenly RUPTURES - BLASTING OPEN.
           TRAPPED WATER GUSHING OUT - SWEEPING Jack's LEGS out from
           under him. Jack HITS the deck HARD. PLUNGING UNDERWATER.

           The RUSHING TIDE SMASHING him AGAINST the BULKHEAD. Jack -
           clamors, GASPING. Grasps the LADDER to the Bridge. WATER -

           INT. RADIO ROOM, PT-109 -- CONTINUOUS

           - SURGING UP into the Radio Room, SWEEPING ACROSS Thom, who
           scrabbles, GRABBING UP the MAPS, RADIO.

           Jack, PUSHED by the WATER, GRABS Thom. YANKS him, DASHING
           for the DOORWAY to the Command Deck.

           EXT. BRIDGE COMMAND DECK, PT-109 -- CONTINUOUS

           Jack and Thom BURST from the Radio Room as WATER RUSHES UP.
           SLOPPING across the deck from ALL SIDES. The OTHER MEN -
           SHOUTING - JUMPING SHIP -

           Jack rounds on a terrified Thom, who GRIPS the HANDRAIL -

                                 JACK
                        Thom. This is it. Let go!

           Thom stares at Jack with TERRIFIED EYES -

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        LET GO!

           Thom LETS GO. Jack HEAVES him OVERBOARD - JUMPING TOGETHER -

           UNDERWATER

           Murky roiling darkness. Through the shards of splintered
           wood, glass, debris - Jack and Thom PLUNGE into the WATER -

           Jack lets go of Thom. Kicking, swiping at the freezing ocean.
           Fighting his way toward the surface - Jack goes still for a
           moment eyes falling across -

           A flurry of SOAKED PAPERS swirling by - the BOOK JACKETS
           from his OWN BOOK. Joe Jr.'s FOOTBALL spiraling away as -

           The WRECKED HULL of the PT-109 SLIDES UNDERWATER. Almost
           peaceful in its surrender. The last FLICKERING LIGHTS from
           the Bridge WINKING OUT, becoming -

           A dark ghost, melting into the infinite BLACK of the OCEAN.

           BURSTING ABOVE THE SURFACE -

           Jack, GASPING. Back in the CHURNING TUMULT of the OCEAN. The
           OTHER MEN'S VOICES hoarsely SHOUTING over the GUSHING waves -

                                 COOK MAUER (O.S.)
                        ...STILL GET BACK ABOARD THE AFT -
                                 MM. ZINSER (O.S.)
                        NO, SHE'S ON FIRE.

                                 COOK MAUER (O.S.)
                        THEY'LL LOOK FOR US - THEY'LL COME -

           Fighting to stay above water, Jack squints across at the
           FLAMES ROARING from the AFT SECTION of THE PT-109.

           Jack, turning - the OPEN OCEAN all around them. THE INFINITE
           BLACKNESS of the NIGHT SKY overhead.

                                 ENS. ROSS (O.S.)
                        SKIPPER.

           Ross, huffing, FIGHTING to stay ABOVE the SURFACE -

                                 ENS. ROSS (CONT'D)
                        WE CAN'T STAY OUT HERE.

           Jack, another WAVE BREAKING OVER him, COUGHS, spluttering -

                                 JACK
                        THERE WAS AN ISLAND ON THE CHARTS.
                        EAST OF HERE. ABOUT TWO MILES.

                                 ENS. ROSS
                        MCMAHON CAN'T SWIM.

           Jack SQUINTS toward Zinser, Harris, KICKING and THRASHING to
           support the HALF-CONSCIOUS McMahon.

                                 JACK
                        I'LL PULL HIM.

           Zinser, exhausted, haggard - HALF-DROWNED himself -

                                 MM. ZINSER
                        YOU CAN'T PULL HIM TWO MILES.

           Jack meets Ross's gaze, the EYES of the CREW on HIM. FIGHTING
           the STORMY OCEAN - their hopelessness rising -

                                 JACK
                        WE'RE NOT GIVING UP. WE'RE GONNA
                        MAKE IT.

           FIGHTING his way through the CRASHING WAVES over to the
           OTHERS, Jack GRASPS the same leather BELT still lashed around
           McMahon. Jams it BETWEEN his TEETH -

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        SWIM.

           - KICKING against the CURRENT, a HERCULEAN EFFORT - Jack
           SWIMS into the churning WAVES, PULLING McMahon.
           Harris, Zinser - exchanging glances. Cook Mauer still staring
           after the AFT SECTION of the PT-109 as it GOES DOWN.

           Thom looks to Ross. Jack already SPLASHING AWAY from THEM -

                                 ENS. ROSS
                        YOU HEARD THE CAPTAIN. SWIM.

           Ross PLUNGES FORWARD, splashing after Jack. THE OTHERS have
           NO CHOICE but to FOLLOW.

           EXT. OPEN OCEAN -- NIGHT

           HEAVING his way through the DARK - Jack, SEAWATER CHURNING
           through his CLAMPED TEETH -

           - COUGHS - STRUGGLES - FIGHTS against the SWELLING and
           CRASHING black ocean WATER. SWALLOWED by another WAVE -

           UNDERWATER

           Jack KICKS, FIGHTS to stay AFLOAT. GULPS DOWN SEAWATER by
           accident, McMahon's DEAD WEIGHT DRAGGING behind him.

           Inky blackness on all sides, murky shadows, undulating shapes.

           BREACHING THE SURFACE

           - WHEEZING, CHOKING, Jack FIGHTS forward, HEART HAMMERING in
           his EARS.

                                                             FROM AFAR -

           Jack, McMahon, Ross, Thom, Harris, Zinser, the OTHER MEN -
           tiny black SPECKS in an INFINITE black ocean.

           WAVES sweeping over them. Whitecaps FOAMING in the DARK.

                                                   PULLING FARTHER BACK -

           The SMOLDERING DEBRIS of the PT-109 scattering the SURFACE
           of the OCEAN. Jack and the OTHER MEN look even tinier as
           fresh HAMMERING RAINDROPS begin to fall.

           No sign of ANYTHING near them. Anywhere.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. OPEN OCEAN -- LATER / NIGHT

           Rain pelting Ensign Thom's FACE as he GASPS, STRUGGLES through
           the water, WAVES slopping over his HEAD.

           Zinser, WEIGHED DOWN by a SATCHEL full of CLANKING equipment,
           scours the BLACKNESS, the sheeting RAIN. Infinite.
                                 COOK MAUER (O.S.)
                        WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT?

           PITCHING in the WATER, Ross turns back, SQUINTING through
           the drilling RAIN -

                                 COOK MAUER (CONT'D)
                        SOMETHING TOUCHED ME. SOMETHING IN
                        THE WATER - There's SOMETHING -

                                 ENS. THOM
                        SHARKS. THERE ARE SHARKS!

           HORROR, PANIC in Harris's eyes as he FIGHTS to PUSH HIMSELF
           up out of the WATER, strains to see through -

           - the FROTHING, rain-churned black of the WATER. IMPOSSIBLE
           to make out ANYTHING.

           The SHOUTS of the OTHER MEN reaching Jack. His swimming
           FALTERS. Alarm flickering in his eyes as he GRABS the leather
           BELT from between his TEETH - twisting back, VOICE hoarse -

                                 JACK
                        KEEP SWIMMING.

                                 COOK MAUER
                        THE SHARKS ARE GONNA GET US.

                                 JACK
                        KEEP SWIMMING -

           Jack suddenly SLAMS against -

           UNDERWATER

           - hulking, jagged, razor-SHARP REEFS. TRIPPING him up. Jack
           FALLS HARD, instantly STRIPPING the FLESH from his SHINS.
           SLAMMING his CHEST. His OTHER SHOE TUMBLING AWAY.

           EXT. OPEN OCEAN / REEF -- CONTINUOUS

           PAIN CLENCHING his FACE as Jack is DRAGGED by the CURRENT.
           RAKING him across the REEF -

           Jack LETS GO of McMahon - who TUMBLES against the reef,
           SLAMMING awake. Coughing, spluttering.

                                 JACK
                        IT'S A REEF. WE'VE HIT A REEF.

           Jack, FIGHTING to push to his feet. WAVES SLAMMING him back
           to his KNEES. SCOURING off more FLESH. Jack SQUINTS ahead -

           A rough, jumbled SHADOW now BARELY visible against the SKY -
                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        WE MADE IT. WE'RE AT THE ISLAND.

           STUMBLING, Jack GROPES in the frothing foam, HAULS McMahon
           up. Dragging him, on his FEET now up into -

           EXT. MARSHY BEACH, SMALL ISLAND -- CONTINUOUS

           - soft, sandy MUCK. Jack's body GIVES OUT, collapses HARD
           into the MURK. BREATH SMASHED out of him. Jack turns back -

           Ross, HAULING himself out of the FROTHING WAVES. Mauer,
           Harris, Zinser, the OTHER MEN behind him.

                                 JACK
                        WHERE'S THOM?

           His hoarse VOICE consumed in the THUNDERING WAVES. Rain
           SHEETING across Jack as he DASHES back into the WATER.

           EXT. OPEN OCEAN / REEF -- NIGHT

           The WAVES YANKING at him, Jack SWIMS against his own
           exhaustion. GRUNTS as he HITS the RAZOR-SHARP REEF again.

                                 JACK
                        THOM. THOM!

           - Jack SLAMS into Thom - GROPING AROUND in the DARK -
           SPLASHING frantically -

                                 ENS. THOM
                        THE RADIO. I LOST THE RADIO.

                                 JACK
                        IT'S GONE.

                                 ENS. THOM
                        IT'S THE ONLY WAY THEY'LL FIND US.

                                 JACK
                        Thom. It's gone.

           Thom meets Jack's eyes, frenzied. A WAVE CRASHING across
           him, sending him STUMBLING. Jack CATCHES him. HEAVES him
           toward SHORE.

           EXT. MARSHY BEACH, SMALL ISLAND -- NIGHT

           SCREAMING - McMahon, head pitched back, sprawled in the sandy
           muck, WRITHES as Ross and Zinser try to PEEL his SINGED SHIRT
           away from his BAKED FLESH -

                                 MM. ZINSER
                        Jesus, it's melted right onto him!
                                 ENS. ROSS
                        Hold him! For Christ's sake -

           McMahon ROARS in AGONY as Ross tries to re-wrap a SOAKED
           BLANKET around his SHOULDERS. Grimacing -

                                 ENS. ROSS (CONT'D)
                        We need to get him onto dry land.

           Harris, the OTHER MEN SHIVERING, HUNKERED in the BLACKNESS
           of the MARSH - twisting to scan the DARKNESS -

                                 GM. HARRIS
                        There isn't any dry goddamn land.

           A half-dozen clustered PALM TREES jutting out of the SANDY
           MUCK. Soggy REEDS spreading off into the DARK.

           The "ISLAND" is not much more than a MARSHY SAND BAR.

           Gasping, panting, utterly SPENT, Jack HAULS himself and Thom
           out of the WAVES. Coughing up SEAWATER. Hunches over -
           shivering, miserable. Takes in -

           The SCATTERED MEN, strewn debris. RAIN pelting across them.
           The empty blackness of the marshy beach. Palm trees THRASHING
           in the STORM. This is all that remains of his command.

           Teeth CHATTERING, WHEEZING - Thom draws up beside Jack.
           McMahon SCREAMING through the DARKNESS.

                                 ENS. THOM
                        What do we do now?

           The OTHER MEN, soaked, weary YOUNG FACES smeared with oil,
           ash, BLOOD, caked with sand, LOOKING to him - and Jack has
           no answer. Does not know.

           Jack turns, squints out at the roiling blackness of the OCEAN.
           Harris, knee-deep in the MARSH, also turning at -

           An ENGINE DRONE from SOMEWHERE off in the DARK. Cook Mauer
           shoves to his feet beside Harris. Squinting.

                                 COOK MAUER
                        A boat?

           Harris, scouring the darkness, glimpses a FLICKER of LIGHT
           through the rain, in the CLOUDS. Points to it -

                                 GM. HARRIS
                        Planes.

                                 COOK MAUER
                        They're looking for us!
           Jack sees them. Watches the COLUMN of LIGHTS in the SKY.
           Moving RIGIDLY. Coming TOWARD the ISLAND in a line.

                                 JACK
                        Those are Japs. Zeroes.

           Jack wheels back. Meets Ross's eye as he looks sharply up
           from the moaning, writhing McMahon.

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        We've gotta get off this beach.

           EXT. SWAMPY PALM GROVE, SMALL ISLAND -- NIGHT

           Thrashing through half-flooded reeds, Jack, Ross, Harris,
           HAULING McMahon between them.

           Zinser HOBBLING after them on his burnt legs. Thom, Mauer
           swatting at low palm tree fronds. STUMBLING to a HALT as -

           ROARING ENGINES - FILL the SKY OVERHEAD. Jack tips his head
           back, staring up through the sparse palm trees as -

           TWO, THREE, FOUR JAPANESE "ZERO" FIGHTER PLANES - THUNDER BY -

           Panting, soaked through his filthy clothes, Jack tracks the
           PLANES off through the tips of the reeds -

           BARRELING into the NIGHT - ENGINES RECEDING.

           Jack looks back down at McMahon - WRITHING, COUGHING. Ross,
           Harris lowering him to the soggy, muddy GROUND. Rain hammers
           the brown puddles all around them. Everyone SOAKED.

                                 MM. ZINSER
                        The hell kind of an island is this?

           Jack, desolate, wipes at his brow. Twists back to the others
           as McMahon HACKS, COUGHS, unable to stop -

                                 JACK
                        Someone get him some water.

           Thom turns to Zinser. Zinser, panting, shivering, soaked
           DUFFEL BAG slung over his shoulder - shakes his head.

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        Who has the water?

           Zinser turns to Cook Mauer, back among the OTHER MEN.

                                 COOK MAUER
                        We don't have any.

           Ross, Harris, the OTHERS all LOOKING UP now -
                                 JACK
                        No one brought any water?!  

                                 COOK MAUER
                        There wasn't any time. The compartment
                        flooded. I was trying to save Marney.

                                 MM. ZINSER
                        Yeah? How did that work out?

           Mauer WHIRLS - EYES FLASHING. Letting his own ragged DUFFEL
           BAG SLIP. SPLASHING into the MUD to LUNGE at Zinser -

                                 JACK
                        Lay off. God damn it -

           Jack GRABS Mauer, SEIZING his SHOULDER. WRENCHES him back.
           Mauer spins, FIST cocked. On the BRINK of HITTING Jack.

           Jack STARES him in the eye, unflinching. Mauer, a flicker of
           emotion - Marney, the ship, everything. Backs down.

           McMahon, HEAVING, HACKING - finally SETTLES. Slumps into the
           misery of wet mud and spattering rain.

           Jack lets go of Mauer. Turns back, soaked, exhausted. Trying
           to think. The first moment to catch his breath -

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        Who has the maps?

           ACROSS A CLUMP OF SLIPPERY ROCKS -

           Ross spreads out a WAD of SOGGY MAPS. Half-disintegrating in
           the rain. Smeared with mud.

           Jack tries to wipe them clean. The colors, lines, demarcations
           bleeding together. Flicking flecks of mud from his EYES -

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        Okay. Here's where we were when we
                        were hit - Right?

           Jack turns back to Thom, standing brittle, glassy-eyed.

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        Right, Ensign? Thom.

           Thom shakes himself, snaps out of it. Squints at the maps.
           The OTHERS huddling in the rain behind him. Thom nods -

                                 ENS. THOM
                        That's about right. Yes. I think.

           Jack traces his FINGER across the MAP to a scattering of
           TINY ISLANDS, even SMALLER SPECKS -
                                 JACK
                        One of these must be where we are...
                            (tracing past them)
                        ...and this here is Ferguson Passage.
                        The egress route the other PTs will
                        be taking back to Rendova.

           Jack, a flicker of excitement, hope -

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        So all we gotta do is swim out there
                        and flag one of 'em down.

                                 COOK MAUER
                        'Hell with that. I've swum enough
                        for a goddamn year.

                                 ENS. ROSS
                        Check yourself, Seaman.

           Mauer locks eyes with Ross, SPITS into the rainy mud. Harris
           timidly rises from McMahon's side, sprawled in the muck -

                                 GM. HARRIS
                        What about McMahon? We can't move
                        him again. Not right now.

           Jack looks back at him, down at McMahon - half-conscious,
           wrapped in soggy blankets, shivering. Knows he's right.

           Turns back, eyes returning to the sodden maps -

                                 JACK
                        I'll go myself then.

                                 ENS. THOM
                        You can't make that. It's another
                        two miles. At least.

                                 JACK
                        Someone's got to.

                                 MM. ZINSER
                        So you're just gonna leave us?

           Jack rounds on Zinser, the OTHER MEN - all of their eyes on
           him. Weariness dragging, yet -

                                 JACK
                        We're not giving up. We give up,
                        we've lost. We're gonna get home. I
                        swear to you. All of us.

           EXT. MARSHY BEACH, SMALL ISLAND -- NIGHT

           SLOSHING back out into the murky BOG of the beach, Jack draws
           up in the foaming WAVES.
           The cold black expanse of the OCEAN CHURNING, spreading off
           to ETERNITY.

           Jack, SHIVERING ALREADY, a flicker of momentary dread - steels
           himself, unzipping his pants, stripping down to his SHORTS.

           Ross SLOSHES up beside him. Squints out through the driving
           RAIN at the OCEAN. Jack bundling his clothes.

                                 ENS. ROSS
                        Boys're saying fifty-fifty you're
                        not ever coming back.

                                 JACK
                        They want to live out their lives on
                        a sandbar?

                                 ENS. ROSS
                        They want to know who's in charge.

                                 JACK
                        Tell 'em I said you are.

           Ross catches Jack - hands him a battered WATERPROOF
           FLASHLIGHT. An M1911 .45 CALIBER PISTOL on a LANYARD.

                                 ENS. ROSS
                        To signal our boys. Or take out a
                        few of theirs.

           Jack eyes them soberly. Takes them, looping the LANYARD and
           the PISTOL around his NECK. CLICKS ON the FLASHLIGHT -

           The LIGHT SPUTTERS, FLICKERS. Jack SNAPS it OFF, looks from
           Ross through the rain to the OTHER MEN among the foliage.

                                 JACK
                        I do find a boat, I'll flash it twice.
                        Password will be "Roger," answer
                        "Wilco."

                                 ENS. ROSS
                        You know where to find us.

           Jack turns, the crashing WAVES ahead of him. Bloody bare
           FEET slapping the SAND as he SLOGS back out into the OCEAN.

           EXT. OCEAN, SMALL ISLAND -- MOMENTS LATER

           HEART POUNDING in his EARS - Jack SWIMS against the CHURNING
           WAVES. Exhaustion beginning to drag at his swimming strokes.

           Behind him, THE ISLAND - a dim, faint shape in the blackness -
           SLIPS AWAY into the NIGHT.

           HOURS PASSING AS JACK SWIMS INTO THE OPEN OCEAN -
           Jack SWIMMING, rhythmic, methodical - FIXES his EYES on the
           rolling WAVES ahead. Limitless. His arms, legs, beginning to
           turn rubbery with fatigue.

           His strokes SLOWING as a WAVE sweeps over him. Jack reemerges,
           struggles to regain his stride. Fighting forward when -

           A GLINT -

           - up ahead WINKS. DIPS behind another WAVE. Jack, sluggish,
           weary, half-conscious, WIPES at his EYES. Squinting -

           ANOTHER FLASH -

           - up ahead, near the SAME PLACE. Jack FIXES on it. MUSTERS
           his ENERGY, SWIMS HARDER. Tries to make out -

           THE LIGHT -

           As it FLICKERS FARTHER - seeming to RECEDE. Jack HEAVES
           himself forward, SWIMMING as hard as he can.

           BLACK WAVES - ROILING AROUND HIM -

           Jack FALTERS. Another WAVE SWALLOWING HIM, CRASHING on as he
           REEMERGES, COUGHING. Squints blearily toward -

           THE LIGHT - A GLIMMER across CURLING WAVES.

           Not a boat. Just a reflection of the MOON - now burning,
           cold and pale through the clouds.

           Jack STOPS SWIMMING. Spent. Ocean churning around him. He
           swats feebly at the waves as they SLAP at his FACE.

           Kicking sluggishly, a strain to stay above the surface. Jack
           CLICKS the FLASHLIGHT ON. SHINES it in a slow circle.

           ENDLESS, FEATURELESS BLACKNESS -

           - all around him. The ISLAND GONE. The LIGHT GONE. Only
           sweeping and swirling ocean waves.

           Breaths coming in ragged gasps, Jack, struggling in the
           FREEZING WATER, SHUTS HIS EYES. Letting the ocean carry him.

                                                           FLASHING TO:

           Crammed in the Harvard Athletic Pool bleachers - Bobby jammed
           in beside Joseph Kennedy. Joe Jr. on his feet, hands cupping
           his mouth, shouting, cheering Jack on.

           His father's fixed gaze through his glasses, eyes judging.

                                                          SNAPPING BACK:

           PLUNGED UNDERWATER -
           Jack, PITCHED, THRASHED by the WAVES - momentarily at peace.
           DEFEAT starting to GLAZE OVER HIM -

                                                            FLASHING TO:

           Joe Jr.'s grinning face as he tousles the dirt from Jack's
           hair. Jack looking up at his father's Cadillac as it noses
           into the driveway. Joseph Kennedy's disapproving gaze. 

                                                          SNAPPING BACK:

           A flicker of determination re-igniting in his eyes, Jack
           HEAVES another SWIPE at the WATER. ANOTHER. KICKING, HAULING -

           TO THE SURFACE -

           Jack, spluttering, strains to catch his breath, stay afloat.

           Twists in a circle. The darkness all around him. Accepting:

           Wherever they are, there are no boats out here.

           TURNING BACK in the direction he came, Jack, fighting
           exhaustion, HAULS himself forward. Kicking at the water.

           The tide coursing against him as he starts the SWIM BACK.

           THE BEGINNING OF DAWN OVER THE OCEAN -- LATER

           DELIRIOUS with EXHAUSTION, Jack swims feebly. Rhythmic,
           mechanical. DASHED AROUND by the roiling ocean TIDE.

           His BLEARY EYES fix hazily on the dim SILHOUETTE of the
           ISLAND. Far off still, a DARK LUMP against the MURK of the
           PRE-DAWN SKY. The faintest dim glow of the sun to the East.

           Jack DUNKS UNDER, comes up COUGHING. His gaze, hazy,
           dreamlike, catching a GLINT off the WAVE ahead of him.

           Jack swings blearily BACK. SQUINTS through the early dawn at -

           A CLUSTER OF LIGHTS

           - a MILE OFF behind him. Jack STOPS SWIMMING. Carried by the
           OCEAN CURRENT. Stares. Squeezes his eyes shut, opens them.
           The CLUSTERED LIGHTS still there:

           A BOAT.

           Jack, DUNKED by another WAVE. Treading WATER as he fumbles
           with the FLASHLIGHT. Hands trembling, DELIRIOUS with
           EXHAUSTION - Jack - CLICKS it ON - OFF - ON - OFF - SIGNALING.

           Fighting against another WAVE - struggling to stay afloat,
           he SQUINTS. The CLUSTERED LIGHTS SHIMMERING. NO RETURN SIGNAL.
           Jack wipes at his eyes. Trying to make out the BOAT'S
           SILHOUETTE against the pre-dawn SKY. The FAINT OUTLINE of
           RIGGING. Smoke stacks. Far TOO LARGE to be a PT BOAT.

                                 JACK
                        Shit - SHIT!

           Jack HEAVES back, twisting toward the ISLAND. A frantic GLANCE
           over his shoulder. The APPROACHING SHIMMERING LIGHTS - a
           JAPANESE DESTROYER BOAT - CLOSING IN as -

           Jack PLUNGES THROUGH the NEXT WAVE - KICKING, SWIMMING
           frantically with EVERY OUNCE of ENERGY he has left.

           EXT. OPEN OCEAN / REEF -- DAWN

           SPLASHING through the foamy breakers, Jack THROWS another
           glance over his shoulder - the DESTROYER'S LIGHTS MUCH CLOSER.

           Jack SLAMS UP against the REEF, SWIPING him OFF his FEET.
           TUMBLING to his KNEES Jack DROPS the FLASHLIGHT with a SPLASH.

           The TIDE DRAGGING him ACROSS the jagged REEF.

           Frantically struggling to PUSH to his FEET, getting as SLICED
           UP as his RAGGED, TORN SHIRT, Jack, HACKS up SEAWATER -

                                 JACK
                        ROGER. ROGER!

           ON THE MARSHY BEACH -

           - staggering into the sandy muck, stinging at his RIPPED-UP
           FEET, Jack scours the dark. Whips back toward the WATER -

           The JAPANESE DESTROYER INCOMING. Jack SLOSHES forward -

                                 JACK
                        ROGER.

                                 ENS. ROSS (O.S.)
                        WILCO. Lieutenant?

           Jack, relieved, no time for the exhaustion threatening to
           drag him down as - Ross SPLASHES out of the MARSHY REEDS.

           CATCHES the dripping, bleeding Jack, about to collapse. Eyes
           raking to the LIGHTS only A FEW HUNDRED METERS OUT -

                                 ENS. ROSS (CONT'D)
                        I thought you were gonna signal.

                                 JACK
                        Those aren't us. Those're Japs. They
                        saw my light.
                                 ENS. ROSS
                        Jesus Christ.

                                 JACK
                        We've gotta get out of here!

           EXT. SWAMPY PALM GROVE, SMALL ISLAND -- MOMENTS LATER

           SCRAMBLING through the reeds, Jack, drenched - Ross PANTING,
           STUMBLING at his HEELS -

           - BURSTING into the muddy, trampled-down CLEARING. McMahon
           again UNCONSCIOUS, wrapped in BLANKETS. A few of the OTHER
           MEN shivering, TRYING to SLEEP among the MUDDY PALMS.

                                 JACK
                        EVERYONE UP. WE'VE GOT TO MOVE.

           DEEPER AMONG THE REEDS -

           BOOTS SPLASHING through mud - Jack HERDS the SLOSHING MEN
           from behind. Jack HAULING McMahon by the shoulders, Ross
           HEAVING McMahon's FEET.

           SEARCHLIGHTS - CUT THROUGH the forested reeds.

           Jack - eyes frantically RAKING across the palm trees -

                                 ENS. ROSS
                        Skipper! Over there.

           Jack spins back. Ross, chest heaving, GESTURES toward an
           OVERHANG of CLUMPED REEDS around a FALLEN PALM TREE - a
           MAKESHIFT CAVE.

           Jack twists forward - calling after the OTHERS -

                                 JACK
                        BOYS. BACK HERE.

           BENEATH THE CLUMPED, REEDY OVERHANG -

           Rain sprinkling through the reeds. Dim dawn light falling
           across soaked, fallen palm branches. ANXIOUS BREATHING -

           FILLING the SPACE. Hunkering in TWO INCHES of MUDDY WATER,
           the MEN STRAIN to LISTEN for Japanese troops.

           A GROAN from McMahon CUTTING through the QUIET.

           Jack, crouched at the mouth of the OVERHANG, .45 PISTOL DRAWN,
           JERKS at the SOUND. Ross, Zinser fumble to SILENCE McMahon.
           Mauer, trembling, on edge -
                                 COOK MAUER
                            (panicked whisper)
                        Shut him up. They find us, they'll
                        flay us alive.

           Jack turns back, listening to the RAIN drumming through the
           reeds. QUIET outside - broken by a SPLASH. A CRACKLE.

           SOMETHING MOVING through the REEDS.

           Jack - frozen. Holding his breath. Fear alive in his EYES.
           Knuckles white around the PISTOL. Another CRACKLE outside -

           - and then A SHUDDER through the TALL GRASS as a BIRD FLAPS
           away, CAWING.

           Jack JOLTS - STARTLED. PISTOL TREMBLING. Slowly lowers it. A
           shaky breath. Glances back at ANOTHER MOAN from McMahon.
           Hunched in the dark, Harris blanches at the NOISE -

                                 GM. HARRIS
                            (whispering)
                        Got anything to keep him quiet?

                                 MM. ZINSER
                            (whispering)
                        We just left behind everything we
                        had.

           Jack looks from them to Ensign Thom - crouched, trembling in
           the dark. Numb, glassy-eyed -

                                 ENS. THOM
                        We're fucked. We're fucked.

                                 JACK
                            (whispering)
                        Hey. We're okay here. We're okay.

           Thom flicks a glance to Jack. Still shaking his head. Hands
           clasped tight between his knees. Not quite all there -

                                 ENS. THOM
                        I was supposed to call my daughter
                        today. It's her birthday.

           Jack slides down, sits in the MUD back against the fallen
           palm tree. The utter EXHAUSTION of the night settling in.

                                 ENS. ROSS
                        Lieutenant.

                                 JACK
                        Jack.
                                 ENS. ROSS
                        Jack. You see any of our boys looking
                        for us while you were out there?

           Jack drags weary eyes to Ross. Shakes his head.

                                 JACK
                        No. There was no one out there at
                        all. They must've run into those
                        Japs, went back another way.

           Ross - nothing really to say to that. The OTHER MEN exchange
           grim glances. Jack tips his head back against the palm trunk.

           Zinser looks to Harris. To McMahon, wrapped in bloody blankets -

                                 MM. ZINSER
                        So what do we do?

           Jack, too tired to answer. Shuts his eyes.

                                 ENS. ROSS
                            (to Zinser)
                        Take a breath, Gerry.

           STILL HIDING BENEATH THE CLUMPED REEDS, HOURS LATER -

           PLANES THUNDERING BY overhead - JARRING Jack awake. Eyes
           snapping open, he LURCHES forward.

           Meets the alarmed gaze of Ross, Thom - the OTHER MEN hunkered
           in the mud and murk. The ENGINE NOISE HOWLING BY outside.

           Jack bucks away from the fallen palm trunk - wincing - his
           shirt speckled in smears of dried blood, feet sliced up.
           Jack stumbles his way into the mud OUTSIDE.

           EXT. SWAMPY PALM GROVE, SMALL ISLAND -- EVENING

           Squinting up through the sparse palm trees, Jack shields his
           eyes against amber shafts of the SETTING SUN as the string
           of JAPANESE ZEROES SHOOTS AWAY in the SKY.

           Ross, Harris, the OTHERS picking their way behind Jack.
           Drawing up short at the trampled edges of their previous
           campsite among the reeds. NO SIGN of their EQUIPMENT.

                                 COOK MAUER
                        Where's all our goddamn gear?

           Jack, circling back, meets Ross's grim gaze -

                                 ENS. ROSS
                        Either it washed away or someone
                        found it. Japs found it, you better
                        believe they'll be back.
                                 JACK
                        We can't stay here anyway. It's a
                        goddamn marsh and there's nothing to
                        eat or drink.
                            (turning to Thom)
                        There was another island on the map -
                        about a mile south of here?

                                 MM. ZINSER
                        We move McMahon again, we might lose
                        him.

           Jack throws a glance to Zinser, Harris, their haggard faces,
           desperate, exhausted. Jack wipes at his own tired eyes -

                                 JACK
                        So what do you suggest?

           The other men exchange glances. Unaccustomed to being asked.
           Ross blanches - not a good move.

                                 GM. HARRIS
                        I say we stay here. Chance it with
                        the Japs 'til someone finds us.

                                 COOK MAUER
                        No one's looking for us here. We
                        should've stayed back with the 109.

                                 MM. ZINSER
                        We made it to dry land, I say to
                        hell with going anywhere else.

                                 COOK MAUER
                        You call this dry land?

                                 ENS. THOM
                        There's nothing to eat here. We're
                        going to starve ourselves.

           THE OTHER MEN erupt into ARGUING. Jack, head pounding, steamy
           afternoon humidity soaking him, SWATS at a MOSQUITO -

                                 JACK
                        All right, enough. ENOUGH.

           The MEN go QUIET. Angry, exhausted. Skeptical eyes on Jack -

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        We're going to the other island.

           Cook Mauer SPITS into the MUD at Jack's feet -

                                 COOK MAUER
                        To hell with that. I'm staying here.
           Jack, aware of the OTHER MEN'S EYES on him - been through
           too goddamn much to take it from Mauer -

                                 JACK
                        You stay here and the Japs don't get
                        you, I'll have a court martial waiting
                        for you back at home. I am your
                        captain. We're leaving. All of us.
                        That's an order.

           As Jack stamps past him through the mud, SPLASHING into the
           shoulder-high reeds. Ross gazes after him.

           EXT. MARSHY BEACH, SMALL ISLAND -- EVENING

           Waves CRASHING across the ROCKS and razor-sharp REEFS as -
           Jack SLOSHES out - squints across the churning OCEAN. Sky
           already slate-gray, TWILIGHT.

           Trying to work up the energy for another swim, Jack turns as
           Ross SPLASHES up through the MURK beside him, draws up,
           wincing - presses a hand to his chest.

                                 ENS. ROSS
                        'Nother storm on the way.

                                 JACK
                        Yeah, looks like it.

           Ross gazes out at the WHITECAPS, WAVES, hand on his CHEST -

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        What.

                                 ENS. ROSS
                        That's a strong current out there.
                        Boys are starving. No one's slept.
                        Might not all make it.

                                 JACK
                        The longer we wait, the more danger
                        we're in.

                                 ENS. ROSS
                        Might be risking more lives.

           Jack, stung, the loss of Marney and Kirksey, the pressure of
           it all, beginning to weigh on him -

                                 JACK
                        I'm doing my best here.

                                 ENS. ROSS
                        Yeah. I can see that.

           Jack scowls, temper flaring -
                                 JACK
                        Something you want to say me, Ensign?

                                 ENS. ROSS
                        Just reminding the Lieutenant to
                        consider all angles of the situation.

                                 JACK
                        We're going. That's the order.

                                 ENS. ROSS
                        Yes, sir.

           Ross cuts a terse salute. Peels away as the OTHER MEN come
           wearily SLOSHING out of the reeds, Harris and Zinser carrying
           McMahon between them.

           Jack watches Ross splash back to rejoin them. Grimly preparing
           themselves for another swim. Jack turns back toward the water.

           EXT. OPEN OCEAN -- NIGHT

           Waves TORRENTING around - Jack as he KICKS, PLUNGES through
           another rolling SWELL of WATER. Numb with EXHAUSTION now.

           Another wave SWEEPING OVER him. Jack, SPLUTTERING, helping
           to drag McMahon - looks back at the OTHER MEN - strung out -

                                 JACK
                        STAY CLOSE.

           Behind him, Harris blanches through a BLAST of wind-swept
           FOAM. Takes A MOUTHFUL of WATER that leaves him CHOKING.

           Beyond them - the Small Island MELTING AWAY into the inky
           darkness of the NIGHT.

           IN THE BLACKNESS -

           Ross - HACKING, GASPING - straining to keep up. Heart pounding
           in his chest. Among the oldest of the crew. The OTHER MEN
           splashing LUMPS in the WATER ahead of him.

           Glances back at - Cook Mauer, also falling behind - when
           Mauer suddenly SCREAMS - PIERCING through the NIGHT -

           Choppy WAVES suddenly SWALLOW Mauer -

                                 ENS. ROSS
                        MAUER. MAUER!

           UP AHEAD -

           Ross's SHOUT nearly DROWNED OUT by the thundering WAVES.
           Jack twists back, squinting through the darkness -
           Straining to make out ANYTHING beyond Harris, Thom - the dim
           SHAPES of the OTHER MEN.

           Jack circles BACK, SPLASHING past Harris, HEAVING his way
           through the water as he -

           PLUNGES UNDER -

           - into the DIM MURKY DARKNESS below. Through the swirling
           clouds of kicked-up sand and silt, the SHAPE of Ross -
           FIGHTING his way toward -

           A dark CLOUD of BLOOD in the WATER around the WRITHING SHAPE
           of Mauer - BLEEDING, in PAIN.

           Jack, FLUTTER-KICKING as fast as he can TOWARD him.

           Ross CATCHES Mauer. Starts to DRAG downward with him into
           the foggy plume of BLOOD.

           Jack draws up alongside Ross. HOOKS him under the ARM. Ross
           JOLTS, looks up. Meets Jack's eye. The TWO of them SWIMMING
           TOGETHER - KICKING as hard as they can to HAUL Mauer -

           ABOVE THE SURFACE.

           Gasping, SPLUTTERING - Ross works to tread water. Supports
           Mauer as he SCREAMS, CHOKING - SLIPS - SLIDES BACK -

           UNDERWATER -

           - DRAGGING Jack down with him. Jack - BREATH SQUEEZED out of
           him - THRASHES - SHOVES at Mauer. BLOOD GUSHING from Mauer's
           LEG. Jack works to PUSH him ABOVE when he GLIMPSES -

           A SHAPE - NOSING THROUGH THE MURK TOWARD THEM.

           Jack - eyes going wide. The cause of Mauer's WOUND - a shadowy
           BARRACUDA - SLIPPING OUT of VIEW - as Jack HEAVES HIMSELF -

           ABOVE THE SURFACE

           - HACKING and COUGHING. Jack twists. Straining to make out
           the DARK SILHOUETTE of a LARGER ISLAND now looming ahead.
           Turns to Ross, wheezing, struggling to HAUL Mauer -

                                 JACK
                        SWIM.

                                 ENS. ROSS
                        I'M..FUCKING..SWIMMING.

                                 JACK
                        FASTER. THERE'S BARRACUDA DOWN THERE.

           ALARM registering with Ross. Jack PLUNGES forward, HAULING
           Mauer. Ross HEAVES after him. Mauer half-conscious, COUGHING -
                                 COOK MAUER
                        DON'T FUCKING LET GO OF ME.

           Jack grits his teeth, JERKS as -

           UNDERWATER -

           - the BARRACUDA noses up against Jack's SPINE. TOOTHY, hard-
           pointed nose JABBING him. The BARRACUDA SLAPS its scaly flesh
           along Jack's torn-up LEGS. SMELLING Mauer's BLOOD.

           ABOVE THE SURFACE -

           Rain now hammering Jack in the face as he FRANTICALLY KICKS,
           thrashes, STRUGGLES to get AWAY from the BARRACUDA.

           Cook Mauer, still SCREAMING - JERKS - YELPS LOUDER.

           UNDERWATER -

           The BARRACUDA - SNAPS at Mauer's trailing FEET. A fresh PLUME
           of BLOOD BURSTING into the murky dark water.

           Jack SLAMS against a ROCK. The edges of SHORE TRIPPING him
           as he FALLS HEAVILY to his KNEES.

           ABOVE THE SURFACE -

           Jack HEAVES himself back to his FEET. Able to TOUCH bottom.
           Waves crashing around him, the BEACH of the LARGER ISLAND -

                                 JACK
                        GET HIM UP. GET HIM OUT OF THE WATER.

           ON THE BEACH -

           Zinser, Thom circle back. Squinting through the blackness,
           the tumbling foamy breakers as -

           Jack and Ross HAUL Mauer OUT of the WATER. TRIPPING, FUMBLING -
           BLOOD sheeting down Mauer's LEFT CALF.

           A SPLASH - right BEHIND Jack as the BARRACUDA BREACHES -
           SNAPPING at them before CLAPPING back DOWN into the WATER.

           Harris DASHES OUT through the sand. STUMBLING into the SHARP
           ROCKS to GRAB Mauer. Helping Jack and Ross HAUL him up -

           EXT. BEACH, LARGER ISLAND -- CONTINUOUS

           - onto ACTUAL LAND. Rain pelting down around them. Mauer
           MOANING between them - Jack, Ross, and Harris DRAG him up
           through the sand, panting and gasping for breath. Thom GAPES -

                                 ENS. THOM
                        He's bleeding. He's covered in blood.
                        Where's the blood coming from?
           Stumbling, DROPPING to the sand - Jack HEFTS Mauer's MAULED
           LEG. The FLESH raggedly TORN.

                                 MM. ZINSER
                        Jesus.

                                 JACK
                            (gasping)
                        Get him...up..out of the rain..Get
                        him under shelter...

                                 COOK MAUER
                        Tell my - wife...You've gotta tell
                        my wife -

                                 ENS. ROSS
                        Keep his leg up.

           Ross, Harris HEFTING Mauer out of Jack's ARMS. Ross gasping,
           wheezing, clutching his chest - grits his teeth through it.

           Jack stumbles forward, catches himself. Stares blearily after
           them as they HAUL Mauer toward the PALM TREES, THICK JUNGLE
           beyond. Spent, barely able to move -

           Jack forces himself back to HIS FEET. Legs like rubber as he
           STAGGERS after them.

           EXT. JUNGLE, LARGER ISLAND -- NIGHT

           THUNDER rumbling through the sky, rain hammering down through
           the broad PALM LEAVES and darkness. Hunkered in the mud,
           SHIVERING - Ross unbuckles his own BELT -

           Working fast, urgently to WRAP it around Mauer's thigh.
           CINCHING it down hard as BLOOD GUSHES from his WOUND. Mauer
           YELPS at the PAIN. Ross grimaces, looks up -

                                 ENS. ROSS
                        Someone get me some water.

           Jack, watching, guilty - meets his eye, nods. Peels back,
           casting around among the wide PALM LEAVES. GRABS one, curling
           it like a FUNNEL to gather the sluicing RAINWATER.

           Jack TEARS it off, STUMBLES over to Ross, who directs him to
           POUR it across the WOUND. Mauer SCREAMS.

                                 ENS. ROSS (CONT'D)
                        More. Get him more.

                                 GM. HARRIS
                        Here - I've got some.

           Harris jostles past Jack, cupping a curled PALM LEAF. Sloshing
           rainwater over to Ross and the writhing Mauer.
           Jack takes a stumbling step back, boots SLIPPING in the mud
           and rain. Gaze fixed on Mauer's PAINED FACE. The BLOOD soaking
           through the LEGS of HIS PANTS.

           Jack watches helplessly. Rain sheeting down around him.

           EXT. BEACH, LARGER ISLAND -- LATER

           HUFFING, PANTING - sweat mixing with rain to soak his already-
           filthy, blood-stained shirt - Jack STRIPS the BARK from a
           felled PALM TRUNK. Heaving from the effort, tosses it aside.

           Plunges down to snag another STRIP. Half-delirious with
           exhaustion, working himself ragged as he HAULS the TRUNK
           over beside a SECOND FELLED PALM TREE, not yet stripped.

           Ross draws up among the slippery, wet PALM GLADES. Stands,
           watches Jack work. SWISHING his way through the vegetation -

           - passing Jack, Ross ducks into the sprinkling rain. Squats
           over a clear TIDE POOL among the slick rocks and sand. Hands
           smeared, sticky with Mauer's BLOOD.

           Ross fumbles with the CATCH on his scratched-up WRISTWATCH.
           Tugs it free, jams it into his filthy pants pocket. Leans,
           plunges his hands UNDERWATER. WASHING the BLOOD.

           Jack - panting, filthy - watches Ross. Ross, without looking
           back or meeting his gaze, keeps WASHING his hands -

                                 ENS. ROSS
                        Harris and Zinser found a few trees
                        with coconuts.

                                 JACK
                        Not hungry.

                                 ENS. ROSS
                        You should eat something.

           Jack DRAGS a SPINDLE of BARK and LEAVES he has wound together
           into a makeshift ROPE around the TWO palm tree TRUNKS. LASHING
           them TOGETHER.

           Ross lifts his hands from the water. Flapping saltwater
           droplets off of them. Eyes Jack's work -

           The rope not quite meeting, too SHORT. Jack, frustrated,
           lets it come apart. Hands, whole body SHAKING.

                                 ENS. ROSS (CONT'D)
                        You're starving and you're dehydrated.

                                 JACK
                        The leaves with the water all have
                        birdshit on 'em.
           Ross rises, the TIDEPOOL at his feet now MURKY with BLOOD.
           Ross drags his WRISTWATCH back out, re-fastening it -

           The HANDS of the CLOCK now STOPPED, glass fogged over. Ross
           shakes it, trying to restart it. Gives up.

                                 ENS. ROSS
                            (re: the watch)
                        My father's. Brought it back from
                        the trenches in Ypres in 1915.
                        Supposed to be good luck.

           Ross gives a bitter SNORT. Eyes Jack's felled LOGS again.
           Jack sees where he is looking -

                                 JACK
                        Figure with McMahon, now Mauer, our
                        best bet outta here's a raft.

                                 ENS. ROSS
                        You'll never get anywhere in the
                        open ocean on that.

           Jack sighs, looks down at his work - ramshackle stripped
           wood and makeshift twine. Half-falling apart on its own.

                                 JACK
                        How is he?

                                 ENS. ROSS
                        He's not good. He lost a lot of blood,
                        and he's still losing more.
                        Infection's inevitable. I'd give him
                        a day or two, week at most.

           Jack - exhaustion, defeat weighing on his shoulders. Regards
           the hopeless scattering of stripped bark -

           DAWN beginning to tint the sky a deep, pale blue. Falling
           softly across the PALM FRONDS - SMEARED with BIRD SHIT.

                                 JACK
                        I should've listened to you.

           Jack flicks a glance at Ross - contrite -

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        We should've waited.

           Ross does not answer at first. Still fiddling with the CATCH
           on his father's WATCH. Glances out toward the OCEAN -

                                 ENS. ROSS
                        You know, I didn't like you much at
                        first.

           Jack, taken aback by his bluntness -
                                 ENS. ROSS (CONT'D)
                        Rich Harvard boy, son of an
                        Ambassador, pulled every string you
                        had to just to play dress-up in a
                        skipper's uniform.

           Jack, no answer. Accepts it, not disagreeing.

                                 ENS. ROSS (CONT'D)
                        The man you were supposed to replace
                        on the 166..before we lost it - he
                        was a good man. We grew up together.

                                 JACK
                        I'm sorry.

                                 ENS. ROSS
                        I've been bombed and shot at since
                        you were in diapers. But I ain't
                        seen nothin' like that ship, came
                        outta nowhere and sliced us in two.
                        Nobody coulda salvaged that.

           Ross finally turns, meets Jack's eye -

                                 ENS. ROSS (CONT'D)
                        You did a brave thing, saving McMahon.
                        He'd've burned alive back there.
                        Mauer, he was gonna drown. 'Cept you
                        were there. You saw the Japs were
                        comin', and you got us outta there,
                        and it was the right call.

                                 JACK
                        He still might not make it.

                                 ENS. ROSS
                        But he and ten other guys are glad
                        as hell they're here and not in some
                        Jap prison. You bought us a chance.

                                 JACK
                        A chance at what?

           Crashing through the underbrush, filthy, mud-spattered,
           panting hard - Harris fights his way out of the VEGETATION -

                                 GM. HARRIS
                        Sir. There's a light.

           Jack meets Ross's gaze. A spark in his eyes. Peels away to
           follow Harris.
           EXT. ROCKY OUTCROPPING, LARGER ISLAND -- DAWN

           Panting, breathing hard, a speckling of morning dew across
           his mud-smeared face - Harris draws up through the VEGETATION,
           opening out atop SLICK ROCKS. Turns back as -

                                 GM. HARRIS
                        Thought I was imagining it at first.

           Jack, Ross squelching out at his heels, drawing up alongside
           Harris. Waves CRASHING across the ROCKS beneath them -

           Across the WATER, far off amid the tender dawn MIST-

           A FAINT, GLIMMERING LIGHT.

                                 JACK
                            (to Ross)
                        You still got those binoculars?

           Ross, still trying to catch his breath, pats down his soaked,
           filthy SHIRT. Fumbles the BINOCULARS out, lashed to a strap
           around his neck. Hands them to Jack.

           Jack lifts them to his eyes - peers -

           THROUGH THE BINOCULARS - a foggy haze, the lenses scratched-
           up, speckled with saltwater. The LIGHT - distant, smeary.

           Jack wipes at the LENSES with his grimy SHIRT. Tries again -

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        These are worse than nothing at all.

           Ross takes them back, tries them himself. Jack hunches forward
           onto the ROCKS, squinting. Impossible to see anything.

                                 GM. HARRIS
                        Could be our boys looking for us.

                                 ENS. ROSS
                        Could be more Japs, too.

           Jack, frustrated, gazes down to the JAGGED ROCKS, crashing
           foamy WAVES below. Weary resignation at the inevitable -

                                 JACK
                        Someone's gonna have to go over there.

           EXT. SOUTHERN BEACH, LARGER ISLAND -- DAWN

           Ripped-up feet slushing through the sand - Jack SPLASHES to
           a halt among the foamy breakers. Peering out across the WAVES
           at the SHIMMERING LIGHT. Twists back as -

           Ross SLOSHES out beside him. Up to their KNEES in the OCEAN
           FROTH. Ross, already unbuttoning his shirt.
                                 JACK
                        You should stay with the others.

                                 ENS. ROSS
                        You should stay with the others.

           Jack SNORTS, not even a possibility. Rolls his shoulders -
           trying to limber up WEARY ARMS, LEGS for another swim -

                                 ENS. ROSS (CONT'D)
                        What's the matter, two hours on dry
                        land and you get stir-crazy?

                                 JACK
                        Felt like I was starting to get outta
                        shape.

           Ross SNORTS back at him. Two EXHAUSTED brothers facing another
           long, cold swim. Ross winces at a twinge of pain in his chest -

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        You should stay. We don't know what's
                        out there.

                                 ENS. ROSS
                        Japs pick you up, you're gonna need
                        another hand. I'm coming.

           Jack gives Ross a nod. Appreciates it. Both glancing back as -
           Harris tramps out of the FOLIAGE. Thom beside him -

                                 ENS. THOM
                        When Harris told me what you're doing,
                        I thought he was out of his mind.

                                 JACK
                        We're not having this discussion.

                                 ENS. THOM
                        Of course we're not.

           Jack looks from Thom to the OTHER MEN at the fringe of the
           JUNGLE. Ragged, exhausted, their hope, energy all but gone -

                                 JACK
                        It's a goddamn miracle we've made it
                        this far, is that right?
                            (squaring his shoulders)
                        I wasn't supposed to live past the
                        age of two. Then it was ten. Then
                        fifteen. I wasn't supposed to be
                        able to pass a basic physical, but I
                        decided I was going to and so I did.

           The MEN paying attention now, something different in Jack -
                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        No miracle is gonna save us. It's
                        our choice whether or not we make it
                        home. I don't know about you boys,
                        but I'm already sick and tired of
                        bird shit and coconuts.

           Ross, tossing his shirt onto the beach. Jack turning to him -

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        You ready to do this?

                                 ENS. ROSS
                        I don't know, you done talking yet?

           Jack, a wry smirk, perhaps he deserved that - turns to Thom -

                                 JACK
                        It's your command 'til we get back.

                                 ENS. THOM
                        Yeah, when will that be?

                                 JACK
                        The next time you see a boat flyin'
                        the stars and stripes.

           Jack SPLASHES into the tumbling WAVES. Ross, summoning what
           strength he has left, DIVES after him.

           Harris tramps to the edge of the WATER. Stares after them.
           Thom, the OTHER MEN drawing up at his side to watch.

           THE SHIMMERING LIGHT - looking impossibly FAR OFF.

           EXT. OCEAN, LARGER ISLAND -- DAWN

           Plunging through the WATER - Jack, WAVES slopping over his
           head, COUGHING - tosses a GLANCE over his shoulder at -

           Ross, thrashing through the churning waves behind him.
           Exhaustion dragging on him as Ross looks back -

           The OTHER MEN on the BEACH, the whole crew like GHOSTS,
           disappearing away into the morning mist.

           Perhaps the last Ross and Jack will ever see of them.

           IN THE OPEN OCEAN -

           Plunging through the dim, early-morning dawn - Jack, roiled
           by a wave, CLAWS his way to the top of another OCEAN SWELL -

           - his bleary eyes fixed on the LIGHT up AHEAD - now a VISIBLE
           SHADOW of an ISLAND beyond it, the SHAPE of a SMALL BOAT.

           Jack TUMBLES down the next wave. Twists back. Scans the WATER -
                                 JACK
                        ROSS?

           Waves CHURNING, whitecaps spitting ocean foam. The vast,
           pale blue VACANT SKY overhead.

           Jack, slows - SLAPPED by a wave as he SCOURS the EMPTY OCEAN -

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        ROSS!

           UNDERWATER -

           CURLED forward, CLUTCHING his CHEST - Ross, face contorted
           in AGONY, COUGHS. Bubbles escaping in a burst from his nose,
           mouth. Dragging downward in the MURKY WATER as he -

           TWISTS, THRASHES in the THROES of a HEART ATTACK.

           ABOVE THE SURFACE -

           Jack, SWIMMING BACK the way HE CAME. Glances over his shoulder
           at the LIGHT. Frantic now, draws in a deep breath, PLUNGES -

           UNDERWATER

           - scouring the MURKY BLUE DARKNESS - Jack, eyes burning from
           the salt, silt, grit. Fixes on -

           Ross's TWISTING, heaving shadowy shape SINKING deeper. Ross,
           going limp, DROPPING like a STONE -

           Before he is GRABBED by Jack - who HAULS Ross UPWARD. BURSTING -

           ABOVE THE SURFACE

           - Jack, HACKING, COUGHING up seawater, SWIMMING as hard as
           he can to DRAG Ross up with him -

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        ROSS. CAN YOU HEAR ME?

           Ross - PALE as a sheet, DRAGGING at Jack. Jack twists back,
           catching a WAVE in the FACE. PLOWING through it, squinting -

           AHEAD - the shape of the SMALL BOAT, flickering LIGHT behind
           it, the shadow of the NARROW ISLAND.

           Jack, WEIGHED DOWN by Ross, his ENERGY EBBING. The impossible
           distance still to swim. The thrashing, roiling ocean.

           Seeing everything through a weary, hazy fog - Jack - for a
           moment glimpses the white columns, balconies of the KENNEDY
           HOUSE flickering into view -

           Dashed away by the WAVES - flickering back - the far-off
           shapes of Joe Jr., Bobby, Edward horsing around on the grass.
           Dashed away again by the OCEAN as it SLOPS over Jack. Jack
           feebly fights the churning current - feebly swims toward the
           island, the wavering vision of the HOUSE.

           HAULING Ross behind him. Slipping in and out of foggy-half-
           consciousness. The ocean seemingly eternal on all sides.
           Almost peaceful in its own ebb and flow.

           Rubbery limbs barely responding now - Jack -

           RUNS AGROUND

           - STUMBLING. SLAMMING into ROCKS. Ross CRASHES into him from
           behind. Jack GROWLS in PAIN - SLICING his FOOT OPEN on a
           SHARP ROCK that DIGS in DEEP. CUTTING to the BONE.

           Shuddering from the pain, exhaustion, exertion -

           Jack HAULS himself to his FEET. STUMBLES in AGONY. FALLS.
           One hand still latched to Ross's arm. Jack HEAVES both of
           them onto the slippery ROCKS.

           Another heaving STEP. Another. LIMPING. Foamy WAVES CHURNING
           around them. Jack, GASPING - DRAGS Ross -

           EXT. BEACH, NARROW ISLAND -- CONTINUOUS

           - into the SAND. Falls to his KNEES, hunching over Ross.
           Jack's FOOT GUSHING BLOOD. Ignoring it, his attention on -

           Ross, face DEATHLY PALE. Weak. WHEEZING BREATH gasping through
           his lips. Jack rasping for breath himself -

                                 JACK
                        Breathe. Breathe.

           Jack PLANTS his hands on Ross's CHEST - COMPRESSES. Another
           compression as Ross VOMITS up SEAWATER. Gasping. Choking -

           His bleary eyes straining to focus on Jack.

           Jack turns back, eyes raking across the tumbling, foamy WAVES,
           ROCKS. The hulking shape of -

           The SMALL BOAT - TILTED ON ITS SIDE - RUN AGROUND -

           On the JUTTING ROCKS a few HUNDRED FEET down the beach. NO
           SIGN of the LIGHT from before.

           Jack, SHIVERING, straining to catch his BREATH, turns back
           to Ross - sprawled in the sand, WHITE as a SHEET.

           Jack pushes to his feet. Stifles a CRY at the INTENSE PAIN
           from the RAGGED GOUGE in his RIGHT FOOT. Ross grunts, WHEEZING -

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        I'm gonna be right back. I promise.
           Jack swings back toward the HULK of the BOAT.

           EXT. SHIPWRECKED TUGBOAT -- MOMENTS LATER

           Groaning as foamy WAVES crash up around its AFT - the rusted,
           smashed HULL - a TUGBOAT - SHUDDERS against the ROCKS.

           Jack stares up at it. Eyes tracing the faded JAPANESE
           CHARACTERS painted along the prow. HOLES worn through.

           INT. SHIPWRECKED TUGBOAT, BRIDGE -- MOMENTS LATER

           DAWN LIGHT shafting in through the foggy windows, glass
           speckled in salty air. Cracked. A few panes smashed out.

           Bare feet catching on flecks of jagged rust - smearing BLOOD
           from his GOUGED FOOT - Jack - WINCES. Stumbles, slipping his
           way inside as the HULL GROANS around him.

           Jack's eyes trace across the RUSTED-OUT INSTRUMENTS. Cracked
           gauges, faded switches. A mildewed BUNK melting away.

           Jack soaks it in. Beginning to sag with despair.

           Whatever this boat was - it hasn't been seaworthy in years.

           Through the forward WINDOWS - Jack's eyes catch on the
           smoldering REMNANTS of a CAMPFIRE on the BEACH.

           EXT. BEACH CAMPFIRE, NARROW ISLAND -- DAWN

           Sputtering in the misting DRIZZLE - the CHARRED CAMPFIRE -
           scattered with ash. A few strips of bark flecked with RICE,
           singed BANANA LEAVES.

           Jack crouches over them, rises. Eyes following a scattering
           of FOOTPRINTS toward -

           A rusted-out CARGO CONTAINER among the overhanging VEGETATION.

           INT. CARGO CONTAINER, BEACH -- MOMENTS LATER

           Rain drumming on the metal ceiling as Jack ducks into the
           OPEN MOUTH of the container, HOBBLING on his GOUGED FOOT -

           Draws up short, breathing raggedly. Eyes adjusting to the
           blackness inside. Two METAL DRUMS stacked atop each other, a
           chewed-up old WOODEN CRATE.

           Jack glances back out at the crashing WAVES, rain spattering
           the white-capped ocean. Takes a faltering step INSIDE.

           Draws up to the METAL DRUMS - faded JAPANESE CHARACTERS down
           the sides. SPIGOTS jutting from the fronts.

           Jack cups one hand. Twists the SPIGOT. A spatter of WATER
           spitting out, rusty BROWN.
           Jack blanches, brings his CUPPED HAND to his mouth - sniffs.
           TASTES it.

           Drops to his KNEES, SLURPS, pushing his head into the STREAM
           to drink directly from the spigot. Parched with thirst.

           Jack COUGHS, pushes to his feet. WATER still SPATTERING from
           the METAL DRUM. Casts around, eyes falling on the -

           OPEN WOODEN CRATE -

           A lump suddenly in his throat. Nearly brought to TEARS by
           the stacked cellophane-packaged RICE CRACKERS, CANDIES.

           The first actual food and water he has seen in days.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. BEACH, NARROW ISLAND -- MOMENTS LATER

           Hobbling through the sand and rain, HAULING a slopping metal
           CANTEEN, arms filled with CRACKERS, CANDIES -

           - Jack, haggard, exhausted, falls to his scraped-up KNEES
           beside Ross - sprawled, pale and COMPLETELY STILL. Jack leans
           in over him. SLAPS at Ross's CHEEKS -

                                 JACK
                        Ross. Ross.

           Ross, eyes murky, stares blearily up at Jack as Jack hefts
           the metal CANTEEN of WATER SLOPS it onto Ross's LIPS.

           Streaming down his chin, his sand-caked cheeks. Ross COUGHS,
           feebly GULPS, parched. GRUNTS, weakly trying to lift an arm -

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        Just drink. Don't try to move.

                                 ENS. ROSS
                            (gasping hoarsely)
                        Boat...

           Jack tosses a glance over his shoulder - the RUINED TUGBOAT
           smashed aground among the rocks.

                                 JACK
                        It was nothing - just an old Jap
                        tugboat.

                                 ENS. ROSS
                        No...

                                 JACK
                        Don't try to talk.
           Ross, frustrated, reaches, feebly GRABS Jack's arm. POINTS
           with a shaky finger - the OTHER DIRECTION down the beach -

                                 ENS. ROSS
                        Boat.

           Jack follows his gaze through the mist, the frothing WAVES -

           OUT ON THE WATER - the shape of a SMALL CANOE dips out of
           sight, down the back end of another swelling WAVE.

                                 ENS. ROSS (CONT'D)
                        Think they...saw you..Might be going
                        to...warn the Japs...

           Jack stares. Brief victory - food, water - turning hollow.

           DOWN THE BEACH -

           BLOODY FEET THUDDING through the sand - Jack, huffing,
           limping, SPLASHES into the edge of the WATER. Winces as the
           saltwater touches the OPEN GOUGE in his FOOT.

           Drawing up short among the foaming breakers - HEAVING for
           breath -

           Jack stares out across the roiling OCEAN. The CANOE already
           just a BOBBING SPECK far off on the silvery-gray WATER.

           A CLUNK - from among the ROCKS behind him. Jack twists back -
           shielding his face from the spattering, salty spray of the
           ocean. Driven up into a trough among the SAND -

           - A SECOND CANOE.

           UP THE BEACH:

           Ross WINCES, feebly resisting as Jack strains to HAUL him
           up. Wraps his arms under Ross's. HEAVES. Too HEAVY.

                                 ENS. ROSS (CONT'D)
                        Stop -

           Jack HEAVES again. Smaller than Ross, too hungry, weak,
           exhausted. Jack STUMBLES BACK. Ross SLAMMING back down.

                                 ENS. ROSS (CONT'D)
                        Go.

                                 JACK
                        I'm not leaving you here.

                                 ENS. ROSS
                        You have to. I can't..make it.
                                 JACK
                        It's just you and me. It's just you
                        and me now. We're not giving up.

                                 ENS. ROSS
                        You're not. You have to..leave me.

                                 JACK
                        No.

                                 ENS. ROSS
                        Jack.

           Ross catches Jack by the arm as Jack tries to HEAVE him up
           again. Trembling from the exertion -

                                 ENS. ROSS (CONT'D)
                        You have to go. Stop them from..
                        finding the others..

           Jack meets Ross's watery eyes. Anguished. The whole situation
           slipping out of his control. Jack glances over his shoulder -

           The silver-gray of the OCEAN tumbling away. No sign of the
           CANOE anymore. They're GETTING AWAY.

           Jack turns back to Ross. For maybe the first time in his
           young life understanding loss, sacrifice, a part of duty.

                                 JACK
                        I'm coming back for you. I'm not
                        gonna leave you here. I swear.

           Ross, too WEAK to answer, LETS GO of Jack's arm. Slumping
           back into the sand. His breathing ragged. Shallow.

           Jack, torn, anguished. FORCES himself to his FEET. Chest
           heaving. One last look down at Ross - and then he PEELS AWAY.

           DOWN THE BEACH -

           WOOD GRINDING on ROCK - as Jack HAULS the SECOND CANOE down
           from its trough in the sand. Dragging it to the WATER.

           A SPLASH as the prow noses into the SURF. Jack HEAVES it out
           deeper into the WATER -

           HAULS himself up over the side, tumbling into the narrow,
           hollowed-out WOOD CANOE. Briny water slopping around him.

           Jack twists back, squints up the beach. The ragged, collapsed
           shape of Ross a bundle of pale flesh and filthy clothing.

           Jack turns back. GRABS up the WOODEN OARS laid out in the
           bottom of the BOAT. Jams them into the WATER.
           ROWS forward - ROWS - the CANOE SMASHING through an incoming
           wave as Jack HAULS himself, one ROW at a time OUT TO SEA.

           ON THE BEACH -

           Pale, trembling, spent - Ross squints after Jack with foggy
           eyes. The tiny shape of Jack's canoe DIPPING OFF into a WAVE.

           Ross SLUMPS BACK. Glassy eyes turning upward to the pale
           expanse of the morning sky. Gray-white and infinite.

           EXT. CANOE, ON THE OPEN OCEAN -- MORNING

           Jack, HEART POUNDING in his chest, his WHOLE BODY SHAKING
           from days without food, only a mouthful of water -

           - squints toward the horizon, scouring the OCEAN for the
           OTHER CANOE. Jack blanches as -

           A WAVE STRIKES the CANOE from the side. Almost CAPSIZING IT.
           Jack LEANS HARD - straining to stay upright. Does not see -

           A SECOND WAVE - until it CRASHES ACROSS the canoe from the
           left. The GUSHING FORCE of it SMASHING ONE OF The OARS out
           of Jack's HANDS.

           Jack - SLAMMED in the FACE, CHEST by the FORCE of the WAVE -
           HITS the inside of the CANOE'S HULL HARD.

           COUGHING up SEAWATER, Jack fumbles, HEAVES himself up. Gropes
           around, eyes clouded with salt. Finds ONE OAR.

           THE OTHER OAR - a GLIMPSE of WOOD among the WATER - 10ft.
           out from the CANOE - SLOPPED AWAY by the OCEAN.

           UP AHEAD - over the NEXT FEW SWELLS - a GLIMPSE of the OTHER
           CANOE. Not as far off as it appeared.

           Jack GRABS up the SECOND OAR. PLUNGES it into the WATER.

           LEFT side - RIGHT side - ALTERNATING - Jack HEAVES the CANOE
           bodily FORWARD -

           A PUNISHING PHYSICAL STRAIN.

           Lungs burning, a ragged machine of a man, Jack stares as -

           - the STERN of the OTHER CANOE - rises before him. The SHAPES
           of TWO SOAKED MEN ABOARD it, bare dark backs. ROWING.

           Jack - ROWING HARDER - suddenly OVERTAKEN by a WAVE from
           BEHIND that SHOOTS his CANOE toward the OTHER CANOE -

           SMASHING

           - INTO the STERN of the OTHER CANOE - a SPLINTER of BUCKLING
           WOOD. Jack - INSTANTLY PITCHED FORWARD -
           Stomach SLAMMING against the SIDE of his CANOE as it SMASHES
           to PIECES. UPENDING - PLUNGING Jack -

           UNDERWATER

           HIS MOUTH OPEN in a SILENT SURPRISED SHOUT - Jack - INHALES
           SEAWATER. Rushing into him - CHOKING HIM - DROWNING HIM -

           As the force of the IMPACT PLUNGES him DEEPER - Jack,
           suspended in a swirl of pale blue-green salt and silt -

           - SINKS. His whole body going still. Falling peacefully.
           Lips feebly trying to move. Lungs filling with water.

           Paralyzed, no longer any energy left to swim for the surface -
           Jack gazes glassily upward.

           The dreamy, swirling MORNING SKY washing hazily overhead.

           A certain peace crests gently over Jack. Understanding. This
           is it. All the fighting, straining, suffering. Now peace.

                        This is how it ends for John F. Kennedy.

                                      REFLECTED BACK IN HIS FADING EYES -

           SILENT. The living room at Hyannis Port. Jack, 5 years old,
           starched flannel pajamas, laughing, pink in the face. Joe
           Jr., 8, joining him in pinning down -

           - their father, Joseph Kennedy, on the couch. Wrestling with
           them. Laughing as they force him down. A rare moment of real
           warmth in his eyes as Jack meets them.

                                            JACK STARING, UTTERLY STILL -

           At the helm of his sailboat, The Laureola. Joe Jr., leaning
           over the rail, twists back, tips his head toward -

           Shore - the Kennedy house - Joseph, Rose, Bobby, little
           Edward, Kick - the whole Kennedy clan lined up on the grassy
           lawn. Waiting for them.

                                           JACK - ADRIFT - LIFELESS NOW -

           - SUDDENLY JOLTS - a SPLASH beside him in the water. The
           brown shape of a MAN - rugged arms GRABBING him.

           Jack - more dead than alive - feeble, limp as the MAN hooks
           an ARM AROUND him - SWIMS - DRAGGING Jack UPWARD.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. SECOND CANOE, ON THE OPEN OCEAN -- MORNING

           Hazy, DELIRIOUS - Jack - drags awake - in the bottom of the
           SECOND CANOE. Briny BILGE WATER washing over him -
           Jack heaves. Tries to sit up. The MAN ROWING at the AFT of
           the CANOE SHOVES him back DOWN.

           Jack squints blearily up at him -

           GASA - MELANESIAN NATIVE - dark-skinned, 20, body built of
           sinew and muscle. JABBERS SOMETHING in a LANGUAGE Jack does
           NOT RECOGNIZE.

           Jack, in a haze, tries to SIT UP again. Gasa SHOVES him back
           down again, SPLASHING into the BILGE.

           ERONI - 26, the MELANESIAN NATIVE, rowing at the BOW of the
           CANOE - throws a glance over his shoulder - cold, unreadable.

           Grimy SEAWATER washing over him, Jack - ragged, half-conscious -
           PITCHES with the CANOE. Tries one last time to SIT UP.

           Gasa - PINS him DOWN with a bare foot. HOLDING him in place.
           Jack, exhausted, relents. No more struggle left in him.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. BEACH / JUNGLE -- MORNING

           JARRED AWAKE - Jack finds himself BEING CARRIED by Gasa and
           Eroni. The CANOE nosed into the SAND. Jack twists -

           - bleary eyes dragging across rocks, overhanging PALM TREES.
           A familiar rocky outcropping.

           The two NATIVES CALLING OUT something toward the JUNGLE as
           they carry Jack. Shade from the PALM TREES falling across
           him. Jack, JOLTED as he is set down in mud -

           A scattering of PALM FRONDS almost like a cradle. Smeared in
           BIRD SHIT. Jack, eyes unfocusing, then focusing on them.

           The FUZZY, FAR-OFF FISHBOWL VOICE of -

                                 ENS. THOM (O.S.)
                        Lieutenant - Lieutenant!

           Thom - suddenly LEANING IN over the DELIRIOUS Jack. Jack,
           not certain if this is real - stares foggily up at him.

           Harris, Zinser, several of the OTHER MEN CROWDING up around
           Jack. Gasa pressing a BATSKIN GOURD to his lips. WATER
           SPILLING into Jack's mouth.

           Jack twists in the mud. Coughs, sitting forward. Straining
           to SPEAK. His THROAT still PARCHED, hoarse.

           The NATIVES JABBERING to each other. GESTURING. Jack squints
           at them. Eyes dragging to their CANOE.
                                 ENS. THOM (CONT'D)
                        Who are they? What happened to Ross?

           Gasa makes a GRAB for a COCONUT in Harris's arms. Harris
           WRENCHES it away. SWIPES at Gasa - who SNARLS at him.

           From the prow of the CANOE - Eroni GRABS UP an M1 THOMPSON
           SUBMACHINE GUN - SHOUTING as he POINTS it at Harris.

           Harris - caught off-guard, RAISES his HANDS. DROPS the COCONUT
           into the sand. Jack heaves himself up, COUGHING -

                                 JACK
                        Stop. STOP.

           Harris, Zinser, Thom - the OTHERS - TENSE - as Eroni SWEEPS
           the BARREL of the M1 MACHINE GUN from ONE to the OTHER of
           them. Jack, gasping for breath -

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        That's an...American gun.
                            (to the NATIVES)
                        Friendly - American.

           Recognizing the word, Eroni RIVETS WILD EYES on Jack. Gasa,
           beside him, reaches out. Gestures for Eroni to hold his fire -

                                 GASA
                        American?

                                 JACK
                        American. Kennedy. Lieutenant John
                        Kennedy. PT-109.

           No recognition from the NATIVES. Thom, Harris, Zinser - still
           not sure who to trust.

           Gasa LUNGES forward - STARTLING Harris, Thom. Scoops up the
           COCONUT. Turns to Jack. Produces a crudely-fashioned KNIFE.

           Harris STUMBLES - GRABBING for it. Jack WAVES him off as
           Gasa OFFERS the KNIFE out to Jack with the COCONUT -

           Jack regards it. Looks at Gasa - waiting, expectant. Gasa
           GESTURES. Makes a small SCRATCH in the COCONUT with the KNIFE.

                                 GASA
                        For American.

           Jack swallows. Nods, getting it. Takes the COCONUT and the
           KNIFE from him. Cradling them - uses the KNIFE to ETCH OUT a
           WORD into the SKIN of the COCONUT - "commander..."

           Keeps ETCHING as the OTHER MEN WATCH - "native knows posit /
           he can pilot / 11 alive need small boat / Kennedy"
           Jack glances up to the NATIVES - their RIVETED to what he is
           writing  -

                                 JACK
                        Where are we? Where? This island?

           Jack gestures to the ground, then the TREES around them -

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        Island?

                                 GASA
                        Island? Nauru.

                                 JACK
                        Nauru.

           Gasa NODS. Jack glances at his MEN, who shrug. No idea where
           they are. Jack ETCHES it out on the COCONUT - "Nauru"

           With a heaving strain, Jack struggles to push to his FEET.
           BUCKLING from the PAIN of his ragged, GOUGED FOOT.

           Eroni LOWERS his M1 MACHINE GUN. Reaches into the CANOE.
           Drags out an OAR. Plants it to the sand demonstrating - a
           WALKING STICK - then LIFTS IT - OFFERING IT to Jack.

           Jack, genuinely touched - nods in gratitude. Takes it. WINCES
           as he PLANTS it in the SAND and HAULS to his FEET.

           Jack hands the COCONUT across to Gasa, who NODS - SAYS
           SOMETHING to Eroni. Both of them TURNING back to the CANOE -

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        Wait -

           Jack hobbles after them, GESTURES toward the OTHER ISLAND -

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        Ross - American - American still on
                        that island. He's sick.

           Gasa and Eroni exchange a glance. Not understanding.

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        I have to go back for Ross.

           Using the OAR as a CRUTCH, Jack starts to CLIMB INTO the
           CANOE with them. They shake their heads, pushing him back.

           Jack again points toward the OTHER ISLAND -

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        American. Over there. I have to go
                        back.
           Gasa and Eroni shake their heads. SPLASHING out into the
           churning WAVES as they HAUL the CANOE with them.

           Jack, frustration mounting - powerless to stop them - swings
           back toward the beach. Eyes falling on FALLEN PALM FRONDS
           scattering the sand at the edge of the jungle.

           EXT. BEACH, LARGER ISLAND -- MORNING

           Planting the OAR like a cane into the sand - Jack HAULS a
           third  STRIPPED TREE TRUNK - lining it up alongside the other
           two SMALL TRUNKS already stripped from before.

           Sweating through his filthy shirt as he drags the MAKESHIFT
           ROPE around them - binding the TRUNKS together into a RAFT.

                                 ENS. THOM (O.S.)
                        I'll go.

           Jack, already lashing a second rope around the opposite end
           of the RAFT, turns back. Thom, Harris, Zinser drawing up
           behind him among the palms -

           Jack shakes his head, panting - too exhausted for this fight.
           Ties off the second rope, yanking it tight. Keeps working.

                                 JACK
                        You don't know where he is.

                                 ENS. THOM
                        I'll come with you then.

           Jack scowls, tests the raft with his feet. Watching the trunks
           BUCKLE dangerously under his weight -

                                 JACK
                        It's barely gonna hold me. Let alone
                        me and Ross.

           Jack strips another spindle of BARK, winding it into a third
           ROPE. His cut-up hands bleeding, stinging as he works fast.

                                 ENS. THOM
                        None of us blames you for this, sir.

           Jack draws up short, meeting Thom's eye - the eyes of Harris,
           Zinser - respectful, sincere. Truth in what Thom is saying -

                                 ENS. THOM (CONT'D)
                        There's not a man on this crew,
                        could've done better than you have.

                                 JACK
                        We're not home yet.
           HEFTING the RAFT with all the strength he has left - Jack
           heaves it forward, limping as he DRAGS it into the sand,
           toward the crashing waves, churning OCEAN beyond.

           EXT. RAFT, OCEAN -- MORNING

           Wind sweeping spray across Jack as he JAMS the OAR into the
           water, ROWING, fighting the WAVES -

           - that CRASH against the tiny RAFT. Ropes straining,
           threatening to rip apart as the RAFT noses into a WAVE.

           Water THUNDERING across Jack. Jack, slipping, SLAMS to the
           deck of the raft. Lunges, GRABS the OAR before it can tumble
           away. Clings to the slick, wet, uneven wood -

           - as he CLAWS his way back to the center of the raft. ROWING
           for all he is worth.

           EXT. BEACH, NARROW ISLAND -- MORNING

           Shuddering as the raft SLAMS up against the ROCKS - Jack
           STUMBLES. Plants the OAR in the sand, HAULING himself off of
           the raft as its plants JOSTLE. Threatening to come apart.

           Jack HEAVES it up behind him as hungry waves SURGE, foaming,
           in around it, lapping at the RAFT - trying to PULL it out to
           SEA. Jack fights them, heaves it up across the ROCKS.

           Limping forward, using the oar as a crutch, Jack shades his
           face from the morning sun. Squints -

           UP and DOWN the beach - the grounded TUGBOAT. TROUGHS in the
           sand from where Ross lay, but - no sign of Ross.

                                 JACK
                        ROSS.

           Jack hobbles his way up to the scarred PATCH of sand where
           Ross LAY before. Follows the faint TROUGHS with his eyes
           toward the thick ferns, PALM TREES overhanging the BEACH.

           EXT. JUNGLE, NARROW ISLAND -- MORNING

           Gasping for breath, Jack comes to a halt among the banana
           plant leaves, overhanging VINES. Cups his hands to SHOUT -

                                 JACK
                        ROSS.

           A CRACKLE from among a dense thicket of WAIST-HIGH GRASS.
           Jack turns, tramps toward it, stumbling -

           Draws up short again. Listening. His own rasping, shallow
           breathing. The crashing waves through the trees, a bird
           chirping somewhere. Jack turns, scouring the JUNGLE when -
           A HAND SEIZES his arm. Jack JOLTS. WHIRLS. Ross - hunkering
           among the grass, still pale, weak, sweaty.

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        Ross - thank God...

           Ross PULLS Jack DOWN into the smeared mud and grass.

                                 ENS. ROSS
                        Japs.

                                 JACK
                        Shh. Don't try to talk. I'm gonna
                        get you out of here.

                                 ENS. ROSS
                        ...Japs.

                                 JACK
                        They weren't Japs. They were natives.
                        They've gone for help, they're gonna
                        get us out of here. Can you move?

           Ross, frustration swelling, PAIN still sorely gripping his
           CHEST, SQUEEZES Jack's arm - RASPING -

                                 ENS. ROSS
                        JAPS. HERE.

           VOICES from the BEACH - STOP Jack short. Ross, eyes burning.
           Jack releases him, turns back -

           Tramping through the mud and grass - swiping VINES out of
           the way to PEER OUT -

           ON THE BEACH -

           - where TWO JAPANESE NAVY SAILORS - 20s, olive-green khaki
           fatigues, hard helmets, Browning 1910 Nambu Arisaka PISTOLS
           DRAWN. Inspecting the RAFT. Peering around the beach -

           Toward the TROUGH of FOOTPRINTS leading straight to Jack.

           HUNCHED AMONG THE VINES -

           Jack draws back, alarmed -

                                 JACK
                        Shit.

           Jack turns, hobbling his way back to - Ross, knuckles planted
           in the mud, trying to PUSH himself to his feet. Ross clutches
           his chest, STUMBLES.

           Jack hooks Ross under his arms, HAULING him up. His dead
           WEIGHT almost pulling Jack down with him -
                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        Ross - we've gotta get out of here.

                                 ENS. ROSS
                        Go...I'll only..drag you down..

                                 JACK
                        You're not quitting on me.

           Jack HAULS Ross up, clamping Ross's arms over Jack's
           shoulders. HEAVING him partially onto Jack's back -

           - which BUCKLES. Jack in excruciating PAIN. Grits his teeth,
           forcing back a gurgle in his throat as he HAULS Ross forward.

           SHOUTS. CRASHING foliage, the JAPANESE MEN in pursuit as -

           Jack - HEAVES Ross forward. Panting, an all-out BLIND STAGGER
           with what energy he has left.

           THROUGH THE JUNGLE -

           Vines, branches WHIPPING at Jack - scratching his arms, face,
           legs. His torn-up feet SLIPPING through mud, splashing through
           a murky puddle. From BEHIND, the -

           POP of a GUNSHOT - as Jack DIVES right, HAULING Ross. SHOUTING
           in JAPANESE behind him. The crashing of boots through foliage.
           BURSTING onto the -

           BEACH

           - Jack stumbles, FALLS hard - SLAMMING to the ground. Ross
           tumbles off of him. Jack whirls, SCOOPING up a JAGGED ROCK -

           Jack SLINGS IT at the JAPANESE SOLDIER - as he BURSTS out of
           the jungle. The ROCK CRACKING against the SOLDIER'S FOREHEAD.

           The SOLDIER lets out a SURPRISED GRUNT, stumbling. His GUN
           tumbling to the SAND.

           More SHOUTS - crashing FOOTSTEPS from the JUNGLE.

           Jack GRABS UP the GUN. Wheels, STUMBLES FORWARD, kicking
           through the sand. Grabs Ross, DRAGGING him toward the -

           RAFT

           - jammed up among the ROCKS. Jack hobbles to it, YANKING
           Ross with him. Hauls Ross up ONTO the RAFT as -

           Behind him - the SECOND JAPANESE SOLDIER BURSTS OUT. The
           FIRST SOLDIER scrambling to his feet. A POP as the SECOND
           SOLDIER SHOOTS at Jack.

           Jack BLINDLY SHOOTS back - scrambling ABOARD the RAFT -
           KICKING at the SHARP ROCKS to SHOVE it into the -
           FROTHING WATER.

           The JAPANESE SOLDIERS TEAR ACROSS the sand, RACING toward
           the water's edge as - Jack GRABS up the OAR, HEAVES -

           PLUNGING the RAFT into the tumbling WAVES.

           The SECOND SOLDIER - on the BEACH - plants his feet - SHOOTS.

           BULLET NICKING the RAFT - SPITTING splinters of WOOD - as
           Jack ducks - SHIELDING Ross's body with his own. ROWING
           feverishly with the single OAR.

           The FIRST SOLDIER dives into the WATER, SPLASHING after them.

           Ross GRABS up the stolen PISTOL - AIMS at the SOLDIER when -

           A WAVE - SWEEPS OVER the RAFT.

           SWIPING the PISTOL out of Ross's HANDS as it SMASHES Ross
           against Jack.

           The force of the wave BUCKLES the RAFT. A rope SNAPS. ONE of
           the THREE tied-together palm trunks RIPPING AWAY.

           Jack ROWS as hard as he can. Ross CLINGING to one handful of
           his shirt to stay aboard. Jack looks back as -

           The FIRST SOLDIER turns BACK toward SHORE. Jack, momentary
           flicker of relief turning to ANXIETY as he sees -

           THE SECOND SOLDIER - on the BEACH - already dragging a ROWBOAT
           of their own toward the WATER.

           Jack swings forward - ROWS FURIOUSLY.

           Ross - pale, half-unconscious - freezing ocean WATER washing
           over him, barely clinging to the raft, to life.

           Jack looks back, now -

           OUT TO SEA

           The JAPANESE ROWBOAT - plunging through the WAVES. Veering
           OFF to follow the curving COAST. Jack keeps ROWING - a fresh
           flicker of triumph, relief, gasping for breath -

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        I think..we might've lost 'em..

           Ross strains to fix his bleary eyes on the JAPANESE RAFT -
           the ISLAND. Coming into VIEW around the EDGE of the COAST -

           A Fubuku-class JAPANESE DESTROYER

           - the same class of HULKING SHIP that BLEW APART the PT-109.
           BRISTLING with GUNS.
           The ROWBOAT - PADDLING as fast as it can toward the DESTROYER.

           Jack looks back - sees it. Swings forward - channeling fear
           and adrenaline into sheer DETERMINATION.

           CROSSING THE WATER -

           Clinging to the slippery RAFT - Ross strains to HOLD the
           PLANKS together, gasping and wheezing as -

           Jack PADDLES hard with the OAR. Foamy spray splashing his
           face. FIGHTING the ocean CURRENT as it SLOPS up across the
           RAFT. HAMMERING Jack and Ross.

           Twisting BACK - Jack's eyes fall on the -

           JAPANESE DESTROYER

           - CUTTING through the WAVES - a DIRECT COURSE for them. Jack
           turns forward, LURCHES as -

           THE RAFT SLAMS

           - against a CLUMP of ROCKS. The Larger Island DEAD AHEAD.
           WOOD SPLINTERING - the TWO remaining palm trunk BEAMS
           SPLITTING APART.

           Jack is THROWN - tumbles forward, SLAMMED in the FACE by the
           first palm TRUNK. FLUNG OVERBOARD as Ross is THROWN off of
           the second palm TRUNK. The RAFT SMASHING to PIECES.

           UNDERWATER

           Jack - GASPING, WRITHING - taken by surprise by the sudden
           CRASH - FIGHTS to CLAW his way back to -

           THE SURFACE

           Hacking, coughing  - Jack - BATTLES to stay ABOVE the WATER.
           Casts around. LUNGES - GRABS Ross as the roiling WAVES slop
           over his head.

           Jack - GRIPPING Ross by the collar of his shirt - HEAVES
           both of them forward - a desperate crawling SWIM. Twists
           back, staring through the churning WAVES at -

           THE JAPANESE DESTROYER -

           - BEARING DOWN on them. WAVES splitting around its MASSIVE
           HULL. JAPANESE SOLDIERS on the decks, BRISTLING MACHINE GUNS.

           No way in heaven or hell they are going to make it. This is
           finally it for Jack Kennedy and George Henry Ross.

           The Larger Island still several HUNDRED FEET ahead - the
           DESTROYER thundering TOWARD them when -
           A HOWLING KLAXON -

           - cuts through the air. The JAPANESE SOLDIERS on the
           DESTROYER'S deck SCRAMBLING as -

           Off the PORT BOW - BARRELING toward the JAPANESE DESTROYER -

           A Fairmile B-CLASS SCOUT BOAT - half the size of the Japanese
           destroyer but BRISTLING with GUNS -

           NEW ZEALAND FLAG flapping from the mast -

           - thunders toward the JAPANESE BOAT as it WHOOPS a second
           warning with its SIREN.

           Behind it - a SECOND New Zealand SCOUT BOAT coming to bear
           on the JAPANESE DESTROYER -

           - still RACING TOWARD Jack and Ross, loose in the water -

           A PATTER of GUNFIRE from the NEW ZEALANDERS - WARNING SHOTS
           FLICKERING into the air -

           Jack, FIGHTING to stay above the surface of the water, latched
           onto Ross, stares as -

           THE JAPANESE DESTROYER - abruptly VEERS hard to STARBOARD -
           nosing AWAY from Jack and Ross.

           The TWO NEW ZEALANDERS CLOSING IN - the FIRST breaking off -
           FOLLOWING the JAPANESE DESTROYER -

           As the SECOND New Zealand SCOUT - holding back, turns to
           PORT, cutting toward Jack and Ross.

           Jack - exhaustion, disbelief, relief taking over - stares
           numbly, allowing the WATER to carry him, Ross beside him.

           The INCOMING New Zealand SCOUT - ML-406 - BOW beginning to
           spatter Jack with spray. ENGINES CUTTING DOWN.

           THE ML-406 SCOUT -

           WASHES CLOSER. Jack, Ross bobbing in its kicked-up waves.
           TWO MEN duck out onto the deck of the ML-406. Scrambling for
           a coil of ROPE. TOSSING it -

           - to SPLASH into the water beside Jack. Jack reaches, GRASPS
           it. HAULS himself and Ross abreast of the chipped-up HULL.

           Jack loops the ROPE beneath Ross's arms, ties it off -

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        PULL HIM UP.

           The MEN on DECK - HEAVE Ross - dripping, bleary - up out of
           the water.
           Jack - for a moment left alone in the water, half-unconscious,
           panting and exhausted - shakes himself as -

           The ROPE SPLASHES back into the WATER beside him. Jack regards
           it. An act of sheer willpower to GRAB IT.

           Planting his FEET on the side of the HULL as he HEAVES his
           haggard body OUT of the WATER.

           Using the salvaged OAR - offering it up for the MEN on deck
           to GRAB, HAUL him up aboard.

           EXT. DECK, ML-406 SCOUT -- DAY

           Spattering droplets, tumbling onto the rusty metal DECK,
           Jack, SCRATCHED-UP, BLOODY - turns delirious eyes up on -

                                 LT. WINCOTE (O.S.)
                        How do you do. Leftenant Wincote,
                        Royal New Zealand Navy.

           LT. WINCOTE - affable, 26, New Zealander, brown-haired,
           dapper, tan uniform spotless, impeccable. Offers Jack a hand -

                                 LT. WINCOTE (CONT'D)
                        Won't you come in and have a cup of
                        tea?

           Jack eyes the outstretched hand - the crisp, CLEAN UNIFORM.
           The warm, well-lit BRIDGE beyond. A lump in his throat as he -

           Takes Wincote's hand. Climbs shakily to his FEET.

           INT. BRIDGE, ML-406 SCOUT -- DAY

           Steam curling from a dented metal teacup - Jack, wrapped in
           a blanket, mud-incrusted, traumatized. Eyes on -

           - Ross, through the OPEN HATCHWAY as he is tended to on DECK
           by TWO NEW ZEALAND SEAMEN. Not listening to -

                                 LT. WINCOTE (O.S.)
                        Two natives had the message with
                        them. Yes - he's right here now...

           Wincote - suddenly standing over Jack, carved COCONUT in
           hand, offering him a RADIO RECEIVER on a cord -

                                 LT. WINCOTE (CONT'D)
                        Lieutenant Kennedy. Your commander
                        wants to speak with you.

           Numbly, Jack takes the RADIO from Wincote -

                                 CMDR. BYRON WHITE (RADIO)
                        Jack? Is that you?
           The familiarity of the voice, the sound of a radio all
           catching up with Jack. A lump in his throat -

                                 JACK
                            (into the radio)
                        Commander?

                                 CMDR. BYRON WHITE (RADIO)
                        Christ almighty, I'm talking to a
                        ghost. Jack Kennedy. You sound pretty
                        good for a guy officially declared
                        killed in action three days ago.

           Jack, numb. Crusted in mud, blood. Might as well be dead -

                                 CMDR. BYRON WHITE (RADIO) (CONT'D)
                        What's say we send someone out there,
                        pick you up. How does that sound?

                                 JACK
                        That sounds good, sir. That sounds
                        real good.

           Exhaustion finally sweeping over him. Jack lets the RADIO
           drop. Wincote grabs it back as -

           Jack SLUMPS back in his chair. Finally a glimmer of hope, an
           end in sight. Too tired to fully grasp it.

           Jack's weary eyes falling upon TWO of WINCOTE'S SAILORS as
           they HAUL Ross up between them.

           INT. CREW QUARTERS, ML-406 SCOUT -- DAY

           Engines thrumming to LIFE through the metal walls. The low
           ceilings, cramped bunks not much larger than the PT-109's.

           Jack, towel wrapped around his filthy shoulders - hunkers in
           the HATCHWAY - watching the TWO SAILORS lift Ross into one
           of the BUNKS. Clearing away tangled clothes, magazines.

                                 JACK
                        How is he?

           The YOUNGER MIDSHIPMAN lifts Ross's FEET into the BUNK. The
           older PETTY OFFICER turning back -

                                 NZ. PETTY OFFICER
                        Needs a little rest, is all.

           Jack turns as Wincote draws up behind him. The hull thrumming
           beneath them now, in MOTION -

                                 LT. WINCOTE
                        We'll drop the two of you back at
                        Rendova. They're sending two Yank
                        PTs to pick up your boys.
                                 JACK
                        I can't leave my men out there.

                                 LT. WINCOTE
                        They'll be picked up tonight.

                                 JACK
                        They're my crew. I'm not leaving
                        'em.

           Wincote sighs - respects Jack's honor, but this is a pain in
           the ass he does not need.

                                 LT. WINCOTE
                        We're already underway. And we're
                        needed urgently at New Georgia. The
                        fighting's getting pretty bad over
                        there.

           Jack looks from Wincote to Ross - his tattered clothes,
           ragged, sliced-up legs and feet. Grimaces -

                                 JACK
                        How close will our course take us to
                        those PTs, then?

           EXT. DECK, ML-406 SCOUT -- DAY

           Spray spattering Jack's face as he leans out over the rail.
           The afternoon sun already beginning to fall. Wincote's SAILORS -

           - lowering an INFLATABLE RAFT into the churning FROTH behind
           the ML-406. Tethered by ropes.

           Jack draws back as Wincote, braving the thundering WIND,
           staggers up behind him, gripping the handrails.

                                 LT. WINCOTE
                        PT-157 estimates they won't be here
                        until 22:30 tonight.

           Jack glances back to the INFLATABLE RAFT - rocking and
           splashing through the churning waves.

                                 LT. WINCOTE (CONT'D)
                        I don't suppose there's any talking
                        you out of this...?

           Jack stoops to scoop up the wooden OAR the NATIVES gave him -

                                 JACK
                        'Was getting tired of being warm and
                        dry anyway.

           Wincote, a slight smirk. SALUTES Jack. Jack salutes him back.
           Then, less formally, Wincote offers a HANDSHAKE.
                                 LT. WINCOTE
                        I'll have one of my men accompany
                        you with a radio and some food. Good
                        luck, Lieutenant.

                                 JACK
                        And to you, Lieutenant.

           Jack peels away, turning back toward the inflatable raft -
           the OCEAN beyond it.

           EXT. INFLATABLE RAFT -- MOMENTS LATER

           With a SPLASH - Jack - plunges the RAFT out into the frothy,
           foaming WAKE of the ML-406. A YOUNG NEW ZEALAND ENSIGN
           steadying the raft against the surf with the OARS lashed to
           its side. Jack looks back at -

           The STERN of the ML-406 - TWO of WINCOTE'S SAILORS watching
           Jack and the Ensign as they cut AWAY. A parting WAVE. Jack
           turns forward toward the broad, OPEN OCEAN ahead.

                                                                 CUT TO:

           EXT. INFLATABLE RAFT -- LATER / NIGHT

           Dark. Sloshing waves spattering over the edges of the
           INFLATABLE RAFT as - Jack PITCHES, works to steady the tiny
           boat in the churning OCEAN BLACKNESS.

           The New Zealand ENSIGN straining to keep the RADIO onboard.

           Stars clustering the NIGHT SKY overhead. A cold wind sweeping
           SPRAY across Jack. Borrowed clothes already SOAKED through.

           Scanning the roiling black of the WAVES - Jack sees NOTHING.
           Empty darkness. An almost zenlike CALM settling over him.

           If this is it, this is it.

           He sits back. About to shut his eyes when, FAR OFF -

           A FLICKER OF A LIGHT APPEARS -

           - cresting a wave - disappearing - winking back. Jack stares
           at it. Watches. Not sure if it is real.

           The LIGHT ENDURES - gradually APPROACHING. The distant DRONE
           of a MOTOR cutting through the thundering WAVES.

           Jack GRABS up a pair of BINOCULARS from the New Zealand
           Ensign. Presses them to his eyes. Squinting -

           THROUGH THE BINOCULARS - the bleary SHAPE of the approaching
           BOAT. Narrow hull, stenciled LETTERING - "PT-157." Fluttering
           from its aft - an AMERICAN FLAG.
           Jack - lowering the BINOCULARS - a flicker of the first real
           SMILE on his lips in days. Turning to the Ensign -

                                 JACK
                        That's them! Hand me the gun.

           The Ensign fumbles among the BILGE WATER - hands Jack a M1911
           .45 CALIBER PISTOL. Raising it over his head Jack FIRES off
           THREE SHOTS into the NIGHT. Signaling the PT-157.

           RHYTHMIC FLASHING from the prow of PT-157 - signaling back.
           Contact made. Jack slumps back in the raft as -

           THE PT-157

           - rumbles its way up in a sloshing berm of foam. Almost
           CAPSIZING Jack's INFLATABLE RAFT with its wake.

           Already climbing down from the Command Deck, steadying himself
           against the PITCHING HULL - LT. WILLIAM "BUD" LIEBENOW - 28,
           tall, fit, slightly amused -

                                 LT. LIEBENOW
                            (re: the raft)
                        That all that's left of the 109?

                                 JACK
                        Where the hell have you been?

           Liebenow tosses Jack a mooring ROPE, which Jack uses to HAUL
           the raft FLUSH - GRINDING UP against the PT-157.

           Liebenow, directing a FLASHLIGHT down on Jack, the Ensign,
           as he ties up the RAFT - getting his first look at Jack's
           RAGGED, EMACIATED body. Liebenow's slight SMIRK falling -

                                 LT. LIEBENOW
                        What happened to you out there?

           Jack GRABS a HOLD of the HANDRAILS - the splintery wooden PT
           BOAT HULL biting into him as he SCRABBLES his way up, ABOARD.

                                 JACK
                        Permission to come aboard.

                                 LT. LIEBENOW
                        Granted. We have some food for you.

           Jack pushes to his feet as the New Zealand Ensign climbs
           aboard behind him. Using the OAR as a crutch. Still limping.
           Draws up to Liebenow, a weary salute -

                                 JACK
                        All due respect, Lieutenant, I'd
                        like to get to my crew.
           Liebenow, blanching in the glare of the DECK LIGHTS, squints
           at Jack - appraising him. A curt nod, still holding his gaze -

                                 LT. LIEBENOW
                            (calling out)
                        ROBINSON.

           ENSIGN TED ROBINSON - 24, tall, gaunt, sleepless, tired, but
           alert - comes to attention aboard the Command Deck.

                                 LT. LIEBENOW (CONT'D)
                        Fire up the engines.

                                 ENS. ROBINSON
                        Aye, sir.

           Jack, an exhausted nod to Liebelow - turns toward the OCEAN.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. FORWARD DECK, PT-157 -- NIGHT

           Wind blasting his face - Jack, spattered by kicked-up ocean
           droplets, hands latched to the rail at the PROW of the BOAT -

           The black OCEAN churning away ahead, foaming with WHITECAPS.
           Beyond the roiling waves, rearing up against the dark night
           sky, the dim SILHOUETTE of the LARGER ISLAND.

           EXT. BRIDGE COMMAND DECK, PT-157 -- SAME TIME

           Engine ROARING through the plywood bulkheads as - Liebenow
           holds the WHEEL steady. Squints at the haggard figure of
           Jack at the PROW of the deck.

           Hunched at the cramped navigational desk in the RADIO ROOM -
           Robinson, plotting their course with grease pencils - the
           ARCHIPELAGO of ISLANDS dead ahead when -

           The HULL JOLTS. The DECK SHUDDERS, JARRING HARD to STARBOARD -

           THROWING Robinson out of his CHAIR. The BOAT SHAKING -

           EXT. FORWARD DECK, PT-157 -- CONTINUOUS

           Jack - DASHED off his FEET, CLAMPS onto the HANDRAIL.
           Clambering UPRIGHT as WATER WASHES OVER the deck. GUSHING
           across Jack - who can't fucking believe it - not again.

           INT. BRIDGE, PT-157 -- CONTINUOUS

           Liebenow SWINGING the WHEEL, JAMS the ENGINE THROTTLE all
           the way in REVERSE. The DECK GRINDING beneath him as -

           Jack HAULS himself in, stumbling, SLAMMING into the WALL -
                                 JACK
                        What the hell's going on?!

           Robinson - FIGHTING to HAUL himself back into the chair bolted
           to the navigational desk - grabbing up maps, instruments -

                                 ENS. ROBINSON
                        We've hit the reefs. We're too close!

           EXT. MAIN DECK, PT-157 -- CONTINUOUS

           Peeling away, Jack squints out across the frothing ocean.
           The REEFS and ROCKS among the BREAKERS.

           ON THE BEACH - the SHAPES of MEN emerging from the jungle. A
           few limping. Jack strains to make out - Thom, Harris -

           EXT. BRIDGE COMMAND DECK, PT-157 -- CONTINUOUS

           Turning back as the deck PITCHES, Jack BRACES himself to
           stay on his feet. Liebenow FIGHTING with the WHEEL -

                                 JACK
                        We have to get closer!

                                 ENS. ROBINSON
                        We get any closer, we're going to
                        run her aground.

                                 JACK
                        Two of my men can't swim.

           Liebenow, still grappling with the WHEEL -

                                 LT. LIEBENOW
                        What do you want me to do, shipwreck
                        us?

           Jack grits his teeth - peeling away -

                                 JACK
                        The raft.

                                 LT. LIEBENOW
                        Jack - God damn it, wait -

           EXT. MAIN DECK, PT-157 -- NIGHT

           SLIPPING and SLIDING across the SOAKED deck, Jack GRABS up
           the ROPE that lashes the INFLATABLE RAFT down as -

           Liebenow stumbles out of the Bridge, clamors after him -

                                 LT. LIEBENOW
                        Let Robinson go.
                                 JACK
                        These are my boys.

                                 LT. LIEBENOW
                        You can barely walk. You're going to
                        get yourself killed.

           Jack - HEAVING the RAFT up onto the RAILS, dragging it toward
           the stern of the PT-157, a ragged glance back at Liebenow -

                                 LT. LIEBENOW (CONT'D)
                        You came through for them. We're
                        here.

                                 JACK
                        Not until we're home.

           With a monumental strain, Jack HEAVES the RAFT over the edge.
           SPLASHING down into the WATER.

           Jack climbs up, over the RAIL, his soggy, bandaged FEET
           SLIPPING on the wet wood as he LEAPS down to the RAFT.

           EXT. INFLATABLE RAFT -- NIGHT

           DIGGING at the OCEAN with the OARS - Jack SMASHES his way
           through a crashing WAVE. The RAFT DRAGGING over JUTTING ROCKS -

           DASHING Jack, almost throwing him over. Jack FIGHTS his way
           upright, pitching with the WAVES.

                                 GM. HARRIS (O.S.)
                        KENNEDY.

           Squinting through the spattering FROTH - Jack blanches, swipes
           away another SPRAY of SEAWATER - sees -

           Harris - WAIST-DEEP already - slogging his way out through
           the waves. The BEACH, Zinser, Thom behind him. Waving,
           CHEERING - their VOICES almost LOST in the thundering WAVES.

           Harris SPLASHES, SWIMS OUT - latches onto the RAFT. COUGHING
           up SEAWATER. All at once LAUGHING -

           - as he HEAVES the RAFT forward with him - touching GROUND -
           hauling it up after him onto -

           THE BEACH

           Thom - Zinser rushing forward. Scrambling, out of breath, to
           help HAUL Jack and the RAFT UP out of the FROTHING SURF -

                                 ENS. THOM
                        Jack Kennedy, you crazy son-of-a-
                        bitch, you came back.
           The RAFT GRINDS into the SAND as - Jack, utterly exhausted,
           allows Harris and Zinser to heave him OUT of the RAFT -

                                 JACK
                        How are...Mauer and..McMahon?

                                 MM. ZINSER
                        They're fine - they're just under
                        the trees.

                                 ENS. THOM
                        How's Ross?

                                 JACK
                        On his way back to Rendova.

           Jack staggers after the MEN. Leading them toward the trees,
           the JUNGLE - McMahon and Mauer -

                                 JACK (CONT'D)
                        What do you say, boys, you ready to
                        go home?

           Thom, Harris, Zinser - unable to contain BROAD SMILES -

                                 GM. HARRIS
                        Try and stop us.

           EXT. JUNGLE, LARGER ISLAND -- NIGHT

           Wrapped in fetid filthy BLANKETS - his SINGED SKIN starting
           to stink - McMahon - stirs, JOSTLED - eyes dragging up on -

           Jack - Harris, Thom - as they HEAVE him up between them.
           McMahon COUGHS - squinting. Unsure if he is hallucinating.

           They HOBBLE through the FOLIAGE with him, the OTHER MEN
           carrying Mauer. EMERGING through the vegetation onto -

           THE BEACH -

           McMahon, bleary eyes falling on the RAFT as Jack, Harris,
           Thom HAUL him toward it. HEAVING him up -

           Over the LIP of the RAFT - slipping and sliding on the sick,
           grimy RUBBER. SPLASHING into the SEAWATER BILGE at the bottom.

           Jack reaches to GRAB Cook Mauer - his LEG still WRAPPED in
           filthy, BLOODY CLOTH, as he nearly slips into the WATER.

           Jack, the OTHER MEN, HEAVE Mauer into the RAFT beside McMahon.

           Jack STUMBLES - CATCHES himself against the BOBBING RAFT.
           His strength now truly starting to fail him.

           Dimly aware of the OTHER MEN - LAUGHING, SHOUTING to each
           other as Harris CLAMBERS INTO the RAFT. Grabbing up the OARS -
           Jack - HAULED to his feet by Thom - STUMBLING after the OTHER
           MEN as they begin PUSHING the RAFT back into the WATER.

           The churning OCEAN, the MEN'S VOICES becoming a hazy,
           delirious SMEAR for Jack.

           EXT. INFLATABLE RAFT -- CONTINUOUS

           Lolling back, weak, half-unconscious - McMahon's bleary gaze
           falls on - the PT-157 - dead ahead in the water. AMERICAN
           FLAG rippling from its stern.

           At the sight of the FLAG - the BOAT - SALVATION - McMahon's
           FACE PINCHES - his EYES STINGING, a lump in his throat.

           Never believed until now that they would make it home alive.

           EXT. OCEAN / INFLATABLE RAFT -- CONTINUOUS

           Jack - the MEN, his CREW, his BROTHERHOOD - all working
           TOGETHER to guide the raft HOME.

           EXT. MAIN DECK, PT-157 -- NIGHT

           Seawater SPATTERING across the deck as - Harris, McMahon,
           and Mauer - still in the RAFT, are HOISTED, PUSHED up over
           the rail, onto the PT-157 by -

           Zinser, Thom - the OTHER MEN. Finally - Jack, ragged, spent,
           pale as a ghost, HEAVES himself up over the rail.

           As Robinson, Lt. Liebenow, THEIR CREW rush in to HELP Harris
           and the OTHERS, lifting McMahon out of the RAFT -

           Jack TUMBLES to the deck. Bleary, hazy eyes half-focused on
           HIS MEN as they UNLOAD McMahon, Mauer.

           No longer HEARING their FUZZY VOICES - Jack Kennedy -
           completely spent - at last lets go. EYES going GLASSY.

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.

           INT. FOYER, CHELSEA NAVAL HOSPITAL, MASSACHUSETTS -- DAY

           BURSTING through polished wooden double-doors - Joseph Kennedy -
           blasts past a young UNIFORMED NAVY ENSIGN - who shoots up
           from his desk, scattered with neat stacks of paperwork.

           His stamping FOOTSTEPS CLAPPING down the short, narrow hall -
           toward the WIDE WHITE DOOR to the CENTRAL PATIENT ROOM.

           TWO CRISPLY UNIFORMED NAVY NURSES turn, STARTLED, as Joseph
           BARRELS toward them and the DOOR beyond -

                                 NAVY NURSE
                        Excuse me, sir, you can't be in here.
                                 JOSEPH KENNEDY
                        Where is he? You have him in there?

                                 NAVY NURSE 2
                        Where's who?

                                 JOSEPH KENNEDY
                        John Kennedy, the hero. My son.

           INT. PATIENT ROOM, CHELSEA NAVAL HOSPITAL -- DAY

           Swathed in white SHEETS and BANDAGES - one leg strung up in
           traction, surrounded by medical trays, instruments -

           Jack - pale as a ghost - sunlight streaming in around him
           from the WINDOW over his bed - stirs. Draws a long, tired
           breath. Bleary eyes opening on -

                                 JOSEPH KENNEDY
                        Jesus Christ. You look like a cadaver.

           - his father, standing at the foot of his bed. Stiff,
           uncomfortable. Not sure where to land his eyes.

           Jack, throat parched, weak - struggles to speak -

                                 JACK
                        Ross... McMahon, the..others?

                                 JOSEPH KENNEDY
                        Yes. All recovering. They're giving
                        you the Navy and Marine Corps Medal.
                        And the Purple Heart of course. I'm
                        having the Globe come in to cover it
                        this afternoon. You'll be up for it.

           A command, more than a question. Yet in it - something Jack
           has seldom heard from his father before: pride.

           Joseph Kennedy, also not accustomed to it, fiddles with his
           HAT. Burningly aware all at once of Jack's eyes on him.

                                 JACK
                        Where's Joe?

                                 JOSEPH KENNEDY
                        Joe heard what a hero his little
                        brother had become and he re-enlisted
                        on the spot. They've sent him to
                        East Suffolk.

           Jack digests that, not sure how to take it. Partly proud,
           partly bittersweet. Joseph clears his throat, uncomfortable -

                                 JOSEPH KENNEDY (CONT'D)
                        Anyhow. The medal ceremony will be
                        at two. I'll leave you to rest.
           Turning away, Joseph hesitates again - glances back at his
           son - ensconced in a chrysalis of sheets and bandages -

                                 JOSEPH KENNEDY (CONT'D)
                        You did a good thing out there. As a
                        Kennedy. You did us proud.

           Joseph lingers a moment longer - then turns away. His CLAPPING
           footsteps receding. Jack stares after him. Eyes stinging.

           INT. FOYER, CHELSEA NAVAL HOSPITAL -- LATER

           Peering through the window in the large white DOOR, standing
           rigid, hands clasped - Rose Kennedy watches as -

           Joseph Kennedy arranges TWO PHOTOGRAPHERS, a YOUNG JOURNALIST
           in a beige suit around Jack's BED. A gray-haired ADMIRAL in
           a DRESS UNIFORM leaning in to PIN a MEDAL on Jack -

           - as the PHOTOGRAPHER'S FLASHBULB POPS. Jack puts on a wan
           smile for the CAMERA - not interested in the pomp and
           circumstance that so delights his father.

           Rose, watching, dabs at her eyes. Happy to have her son home.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. DINING ROOM, HYANNIS PORT HOUSE -- EVENING

           CLATTERING plates and clanking silverware filling the warm
           room. Windows steamed over. Young Edward giggling, dashing
           around the dining room table as -

           Bobby, 18 now, nearly trips on him - laying out plates,
           napkins, glasses for dinner. Simmering pots in the kitchen.
           The TINKLE of Kathleen's PIANO from the drawing room.

           SUPER: "One month later."

           Leaning against the door - Jack, a BRACE around his NECK,
           BANDAGES wrapped around his legs, arms - watches his FAMILY.

           Something different in his gaze. Bobby and Edward are still
           boys, Jack now a man.

           Turning, still using the OAR the NATIVES gave him as a CRUTCH,
           Jack quietly opens the VERANDA DOOR. Stepping out -

           EXT. VERANDA, HYANNIS PORT HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS

           - into the warm late-summer breeze. Jack, limping, hobbles
           to the same wicker bench where once Joe slouched.

           Lowers himself into it, wincing at the pain from his back.
           Gazes back in -
           THROUGH THE STEAMED WINDOWS - for a moment, young Kirksey
           and Marney sit at the table - boyish faces aglow, laughing
           with Bobby - three teenagers horsing around. Then -

           Bobby steps past the WINDOW with an armful of plates - as he
           passes the table - Kirksey and Marney no longer there.

           Jack swallows back the lump in his throat. Looks AWAY. Eyes
           falling on a FOOTBALL in the bench beside him - Bobby's.

           His gaze drifts outward - the orange SUNSET shimmering over
           the bay. His SAILBOAT, the Victura, Joe's, the Laureola,
           moored beside it.

           OUTWARD - like a mirror to the the perfectly-flat OCEAN, a
           radiant sky - and the future - spreading away to infinity.

           Reflected back in Jack's eyes - the orange fire, aglow. No
           longer really "Jack" at all, he has become John F. Kennedy.

                                                           CUT TO BLACK.

           POSTSCRIPT: One year and ten days after the disaster aboard
           the PT-109, John F. Kennedy's older brother, Joseph Kennedy
           Jr., was killed in action while flying a top-secret air
           mission for the United States Navy over Sufolk, England. He
           was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross. 

           POSTSCRIPT: Of the 13 members of the crew of the PT-109, 11
           survived nearly impossible odds, largely due to the heroic
           acts of Lieutenant John F. Kennedy. The survivors remained
           close friends for the rest of their lives.

           POSTSCRIPT: Kennedy would return to the water to command the
           PT-59, which took part in the heroic rescue of more than
           forty US Marines who had been trapped during a raid on
           Choiseul Island.

           POSTSCRIPT: During the thirty-six months that John F. Kennedy
           served as President of the United States, the carved coconut
           that saved his life never left his desk in the Oval Office.

           POSTSCRIPT: His experiences aboard the PT-109 reshaped a
           physically slight Harvard graduate into a hero, a leader,
           and an iconic American President who would change the world.
            The Crew of PT-109 prior to their fateful mission.   
                  John F. Kennedy is on the far right. 

          The Coconut Inscribed by 
              John F. Kennedy.  

                                               President Kennedy  
                                           in the Oval Office with a 
                                               model of PT-109.
