           BIRD’S EYE VIEW

           A black vein of road.

           Weaving through the autumnal flesh of the Montana 
           countryside.

           Moving along this vein is a solitary WHITE BLOOD CELL.

           We PUSH IN SLOWLY and eventually see it’s a SHERIFF’S CAR.

           A ROADSIDE SIGN

                                   NOW LEAVING GREAT FALLS

           As the CAR ROARS by.

           GREASY SPOON DINER

           The Sheriff’s car is parked in the unsealed parking lot out 
           front.

           A sign tells us the name of the place:  SNAKE BITE DINER.

                                 STAN (V.O.)
                        Way I see it: a dog bites you, you 
                        put him down.

           A COFFEE MAKER

           Dribbling into a pot.

           A woman’s hand reaches into frame and picks it up.  Coffee 
           sloshes over the edge.

           We follow the pot as it moves through an unusual mix of 
           patrons--

           GRIZZLED RANCHERS.  OFF-DUTY AIR FORCE PERSONNEL.  HUNGOVER 
           TEENS.

                                 STAN (V.O.)
                        Far as I know, there ain’t never 
                        been a killer that got killed that 
                        killed again.

           The coffee is poured into a cup.

           A large hairy hand enters the frame and picks it up.

                                 STAN (V.O.)
                        Thanks, Emma.
           PULL BACK TO REVEAL the owner of the hand:

           SERGEANT STAN GITTANY (50s).  Smiling at the waitress.  He 
           wears a tan Cascade County Sheriff Department uniform.

           Everything about Stan is thick: his eyebrows, his neck, his 
           accent, his wit.

           He plows his fork through a plate of eggs and flashes a look 
           at the Sheriff’s car through the rain spattered window.

                                 STAN
                        You don’t agree?

           REVERSE ON DEPUTY JOSIE DEUMANN (early 30s).  Sitting 
           opposite.  Same uniform.  Staring at Stan’s eggs.

           Doesn’t smile much.  Not much gives her cause to.

           She leans in.  Whispers:

                                 JOSIE
                        I don’t think we should be here.  I 
                        told ya we shouldn’t have stopped.

                                 STAN
                        Hey, I ain’t driving four hours on 
                        an empty stomach.

                                 JOSIE
                        You coulda got drive-thru...

                                 STAN
                        I didn’t feel like drive-thru.  I 
                        felt like the best omelette in 
                        Cascade County.

           He takes a big slurp of coffee and wraps his wet lips around 
           another forkful of eggs.

           Josie rocks back in the booth, defeated.  Stan waggles his 
           fork at her.

                                 STAN
                        You haven’t answered my question.

                                 JOSIE
                        What question’s that?

                                 STAN
                        The death penalty?  You for it or 
                        against it?

                                 JOSIE
                        Don’t know.  Don’t have an opinion.

                                 STAN
                        Everyone’s got an opinion.
                                 JOSIE
                        Well, I don’t.

                                 STAN
                        You don’t think about it?

           Josie shakes her head, looks over her shoulder.  Paranoid.

                                 STAN
                        Know what I think?  I think deep 
                        down you’re against it.  You’re 
                        soft on these things.  What with 
                        your daddy and then your brother--

           A flash of anger in Josie’s eyes warns him off this tack.

                                 STAN
                        What I’m sayin’ is you don’t 
                        understand what it’s like from a 
                        victim perspective.

                                 JOSIE
                        I don’t want to talk about this.

                                 STAN
                        Why not?  Ain’t a more plumb time 
                        than this.

           He indicates the car parked outside.

                                 STAN
                        There’s a man sitting in that car 
                        out there that’s gonna die less 
                        than a week from now.  And we’re 
                        the ones taking him to where 
                        they’re gonna do it.  And you can’t 
                        even muster an opinion on that?

           Josie gazes out at the tinted windows of the car.  Turns back 
           to Stan.

                                 JOSIE
                        No.

           She stands.

                                 JOSIE
                        I gotta go see a man about a dog.

           She heads for a door by the counter marked “Bathroom”.  

           Stan watches her go.  Downs the dregs of his coffee and 
           reaches for his hat.  Drops some money on the table.

           Waves to the waitress behind the counter as he pushes through 
           the front door.

           ANGLE ON the money Stan left behind and MATCH CUT TO:
           A DOLLAR BILL

           Lying on the closed lid of a toilet.

           WIDER as Josie’s places a blue Adderall pill on George 
           Washington’s portrait.

           Folds the bill lengthways.  Takes a lighter from her pocket.  
           Crushes the pill into powder.

           PRE-LAP: Heavy rain.  A whip-crack of thunder shakes our 
           bones as we CUT TO:

           CAR TIRES

           Tearing through the waterlogged roadway.  Spewing a wake of 
           opaque spray across the charcoal pavement.

           BRRRRRRR.  They run up on the rumble strip.

           INSIDE THE SHERIFF'S CAR

           A cocoon.  Fogged windows.  Purring engine.  Thick rain 
           pounds the windscreen.  Wipers drone back-forth back-forth.

           ANGLE ON STAN at the wheel.  Squinting.  Struggling to see 
           through the downpour lashing window.

           Josie looks over at him.  We might not know it if we hadn’t 
           seen it, but she’s a little high and wide-eyed.

                                 JOSIE
                        You okay?

           Stan returns a short, sharp nod.

           BERNIE HOULE (40s) -- the condemned -- sits in the backseat 
           behind a steel cage.  

           Chippewa Indian.  Greying, patchy beard.  Skin a waxy pallor.  
           Like coffee with a little too much cream in it.

           Hands cuffed in front, he rocks gently with the movements of 
           the car.  Staring straight ahead.

           Josie turns to Bernie.

                                 JOSIE
                        You hungry?

           He doesn’t answer.  She reaches into her pocket and pushes a 
           candy bar through a gap in the mesh.

           Bernie hesitates then takes the candy with a nod of thanks.

           STAN watches the interaction with revulsion.
                                 STAN
                        Shouldn’t feed the animals, Deputy.

           Josie rolls her eyes.  Bernie leans forward, chewing.

                                 BERNIE
                        Don’t appreciate that, sir.

           Stan looks in the rearview.

                                 STAN
                        Yeah?  What’s that?

                                 BERNIE
                        Calling me an animal.

           Stan hoots with laughter.  Slapping the steering wheel.

                                 STAN
                        Don’t appreciate it?!
                              (to Josie)
                        You hear that, Deputy?  The 
                        murderer wants to give me some 
                        lessons on civility.

           His eyes flash back to the rearview.

                                 STAN
                        You’re in a cage, ain’t you?  Only 
                        thing I know that lives in a cage 
                        is an animal.  You name me one 
                        decent person that lives in a cage 
                        and I’ll apologize.

           Pause.

                                 BERNIE
                        What about you?

                                 STAN
                        What about me?

                                 JOSIE
                        Sergeant, I don’t--

                                 STAN
                        No, no.  I want to hear what he has 
                        to say.

           Pause.

                                 STAN
                        So come on.  Let’s hear it, Houle.

                                 BERNIE
                        Well... you been with the force, 
                        what?  Near on thirty years?  
                                 (MORE)
                                 BERNIE (CONT'D)
                        Only advanced to Sergeant?  That’s 
                        gotta feel a little... restrictive.

           Stan smiles a bitter grin, obviously stung.

                                 STAN
                        You don’t know what the hell you’re 
                        talkin’ about.

                                 BERNIE
                        Then maybe you can set me straight 
                        on something.  I heard that Sheriff 
                        Docherty started out as a rookie 
                        under you and ended up your boss in 
                        less than five years.

           Stan twists in his seat.

                                 STAN
                        That’s a god damn lie.  It took him 
                        ten.  And that only happened cos 
                        his daddy was Sheriff back in the 
                        day.  If I had the family 
                        connections he hadda I would’ve 
                        been made Sheriff a long time ago.

           The car veers a little.  ON JOSIE, looking concerned.

                                 JOSIE
                        Sergeant, you best watch the road.

           Stan rights the car and waves away her comment.

                                 STAN
                        I am, I am.

                                 BERNIE
                        Maybe that’s true.  But now you’re 
                        fast pushin’ in on sixty, got a 
                        couple of kids to put through 
                        college, still paying off a mortgage 
                        I bet and staring down the barrel of 
                        a retirement you can’t afford--

           Stan spins in his seat again.  Locking eyes with Houle.

                                 STAN
                        Listen here, you god damn piece of--

           The car drifts again.  BRRRRRRR.  We hear the wheels crossing 
           the rumble strip.

                                 JOSIE
                        Sergeant!

           Stan turns back in time to see a blur of red ahead and...

           Josie reaches out and grabs hold of the wheel and...
           Stan tries to wrench the wheel back but--

           THUMP-CRACK!  The windscreen splinters into a spiderweb 
           explosion of glass and blood.

           Josie screams, covering her face as...

           STAN’S FOOT jams down on the brake and...

           THE SHERIFF’S CAR

           Skids along the shoulder.  Spinning like a second hand.

           Finally coming to rest angled to the road.  Brakes steaming.

           The lightbar across the roof has broken off.  Hanging by 
           frayed wires.  Replaced by a mohawk smear of blood.

           INSIDE THE SHERIFF'S CAR

           Josie breathes heavily.  Hands still pressed across her eyes.

           Stan frantically scans the rearview.

                                 STAN
                        What the hell was that?   Was that 
                        a deer?

           BERNIE’S POV:  Out the back window.  A CRUMPLED FIGURE lies 
           on the shoulder of the road.  200 feet behind them.

                                 BERNIE
                        I... I don’t think so...

           ANGLE ON STAN.  Fury rising.  He glares at Josie.  Yells:

                                 STAN
                        Why’d you grab the god damn wheel?!

           Josie shakes her head.  No answer.  He grabs his hat off the 
           dashboard.

                                 STAN
                        C’mon.

           He steps out into the rain.  Slamming the door behind him.

           Josie watches him go.  Meets Bernie’s gaze in the backseat.  
           Quickly averts her eyes and climbs out of the car.

           THE ROADSIDE

           The rain continues to pour down.
           Josie trots after Stan, zipping up her khaki jacket.  Hair 
           matted across her forehead.

                                 JOSIE
                        Sergeant!

           He doesn’t stop.  Trudging glassy-eyed towards the inert form 
           ahead.  Dread increasing with each step.

           He stops.  Looks down at...

           A MAN’S BODY.  Face down.  Covered in dirt abrasions and 
           smears of blood.

           Red goose-down puffer jacket.  Hood covering his head.  Legs 
           bent and twisted like a withered oak.

           Josie catches up.  Freezes.  Face twisted with horror.

                                 JOSIE
                        Oh, God...

           Stan presses the back of his hand to his mouth.  Kneels down 
           and prods the man’s shoulder.  No reaction.

                                 STAN
                        Hey, mister..?

           He reaches for the man’s hood.  Pulls it back, revealing...

           The bottom half of the man’s face is completely gone.

           Chin to nose looks like a tomato that’s been run across a 
           cheese grater.

           The dead man’s crystal blue eyes are wide with terror.

           Stan drops the hood back.  Lurches off-balance to his feet.  
           Backs off a couple of steps.

           Josie breathes hard with panic.  On the verge of throwing up.

           As they stand there we pull up to the rain-filled sky and 
           take in the entire scene:

           THE BODY.  Josie and Stan standing over it.

           THE BLACK PAVEMENT ROAD.

           TREES ARRAYED ALONG THE EDGE OF THE ROAD.  Like an army 
           awaiting the order to charge.

           LONG ARCING SKID MARKS.  Curving off the highway, across the 
           shoulder of the road and finally leading us to...

           THE SHERIFF’S CAR.  The rain pounding down on it.  Already 
           washing away the blood from the roof.
           INSIDE THE SHERIFF'S CAR

           Bernie watches Stan and Josie standing stock still in the 
           distance.  A trickle of bloody water runs down back window.

           His eyes mechanically scan the interior of the Sheriff's car.  
           Wheels turning as we CUT BACK TO:

           THE ROADSIDE

           Josie is the first to break the silence.

                                 JOSIE
                        Sergeant...

           Stan shakes his head.  Eyes locked on the corpse.

                                 STAN
                              (defeated)
                        Why’d you grab the wheel?

                                 JOSIE
                        I... I don’t know.  Sergeant, we 
                        need... we need to call this in.

           Stan looks at her for the first time.

                                 STAN
                        You crazy..?

                                 JOSIE
                        It was an accident.  We can explain--

                                 STAN
                        Yeah?  And what about him?

           He jerks his head toward the Sheriff's car.

                                 JOSIE
                        What about him?

                                 STAN
                        He’ll be chirping like a bird as 
                        soon as he gets to Deer Lodge.

                                 JOSIE
                        About what?

                                 STAN
                        You don’t get it, do ya?  I wasn’t 
                        watching the road.  Jesus, I was 
                        half off it when I hit him!
                              (points at the skid marks)
                        A first-year rookie could look at 
                        this scene and know exactly how it 
                        went down.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 STAN (CONT'D)
                        With him as a witness this is 
                        vehicular homicide.  We’ll get two 
                        years minimum for this.

           Josie thinks for a moment.

                                 JOSIE
                        He mightn’t say nothing.

                                 STAN
                              (laughing bitterly)
                        Like hell he won’t.  That sick 
                        bastard’d love nothing more than to 
                        see us swing for this.  Two last 
                        victims for his ledger.  Hell, 
                        they’ll probably keep him alive 
                        another couple of years just for 
                        the trial.

           Josie looks away from Stan and back to the body...

                                 STAN
                        Jesus Christ, Josie.  I’ve been on 
                        the force thirty-five years.  Half 
                        those guys up in the county jail I 
                        put there myself!  Two years?  May 
                        as well be a death sentence!  And 
                        for what?  A mistake?  Somethin’ we 
                        didn’t mean to do?

                                 JOSIE
                        So what do we do?

           Stan thinks.  He looks back at the Sheriff's car in the 
           distance.  The body at his feet.  The dark woods by the road.

                                 STAN
                        We need to hide this.

                                 JOSIE
                        Are you outta your mind?

                                 STAN
                        You grabbed the wheel, Josie.  You 
                        know you did.  I mighta missed him.

           Josie turns and faces him front on.

                                 JOSIE
                        You saying this is my fault?  You 
                        weren’t watching the road!

                                 STAN
                        I’m saying that you wanna call this 
                        in, then you should know that my 
                        version of events might not exactly 
                        line up with yours.
           Josie narrows her eyes.

                                 JOSIE
                        What the hell’re you talking about?

           Stan moves towards her menacingly.  She turns on her side as 
           he snatches at her jacket pocket and pulls out...

           THE BOTTLE OF ADDERALL.  He thrusts it in her face.

                                 STAN
                        Didn’t say nothing cos I knew how 
                        much you needed this job.  But 
                        transporting a prisoner while high?  
                        Wouldn’t look too good in a court 
                        of law.

           Ashamed, Josie snatches the pill bottle back.

                                 JOSIE
                        You’re one cold-blooded son of a 
                        bitch.

                                 STAN
                        It’s not about cold blood.  This is 
                        self-defense.  I won’t lose my 
                        pension and have June out on the 
                        street because of some accident.  I 
                        got a family to protect.  So do 
                        you, for that--

           He stops.  Looking back towards the Sheriff's car with 
           horror.  Josie turns and sees...

           THE GLARE OF APPROACHING HEADLIGHTS.

           Two miles down the road.  The lights dip down over the crest 
           and we see they belong to a LOGGING TRUCK.

                                 STAN
                        Fuck...

           Stan springs into action.  Grabbing the dead man by the 
           shoulders of the jacket.

           He lifts him and drags him a couple of feet.  Then drops him 
           down.  Too heavy.

                                 STAN
                        Josie!

           Josie’s eyes oscillate between the BODY and the advancing 
           TRUCK, gaining ground by the second.

                                 STAN
                        Josie!  Help me!
           Josie doesn’t move.  Stan drags the body a couple more feet.  
           Slips on the wet ground.  Falls onto his backside.

           Suddenly, Josie is next to him.  She grabs the man’s legs.

                                 JOSIE
                        C’mon...

           Stan flashes her a look of gratitude.  He climbs to his feet 
           and again grabs hold of the dead man’s jacket.

           The two of them hobble back towards the Sheriff's car.

           INSIDE THE SHERIFF'S CAR

           Bernie watches them approach.

           Stan lifts the trunk of the car, obscuring his view.

           The car dips as a weight is deposited in the back.

           Stan slams the trunk closed again.  Shoots a glare of hatred 
           at Bernie.

           Bernie turns back and looks through the front windscreen.  
           RACK FOCUS on the headlights, now less than a mile away.

           LOGGING TRUCK (WINDSCREEN POV)

           The DRIVER slows as he approaches the scene.  Josie and Stan 
           are partially obscured by the angled Sheriff's car.

           THE LOGGING TRUCK

           Slows to a crawl.  Flashing its headlights.

           Stan waves back.  He turns to Josie, who stares into space, 
           one hand still resting on the trunk.

                                 STAN
                        Josie...

           She doesn’t answer.  Guilt and paranoia washing over her.

                                 STAN
                        Josie.

           She looks up this time.

                                 STAN
                        Let me do the talking.
           INSIDE THE LOGGING TRUCK

           The Driver rolls down his window as he pulls up alongside the 
           damaged Sheriff's car.

                                 DRIVER
                        Y’all alright?

           Stan approaches.

                                 STAN
                        Yeah, no problem.  Just hit a god 
                        damn blacktail.  Musta limped off.

           The Driver scans the damage and lets out a low whistle.

                                 DRIVER
                        Shit.  Clipped one of ‘em myself 
                        only a week ago.  One of the 
                        benefits of drivin’ a bigger outfit.

           Stan answers with a half-hearted chuckle.

                                 DRIVER
                        You need me to radio it in?

                                 STAN
                        No!  I mean... nah, we’re alright.

           The Driver can’t help but notice Stan’s jumpiness.

           He looks over at Josie, noticing her vacant expression.

                                 DRIVER
                        She alright?

                                 STAN
                        Hmm?  Her?  Yeah, she just ain’t no 
                        good with blood.

                                 DRIVER
                              (laughing)
                        Seems that’d be a pretty essential 
                        prequalification for an officer of 
                        the law.

                                 STAN
                        Well, she’s kinda new.  Only on her 
                        second year.
                              (yelling, to Josie)
                        You’re alright, ain’t you, Deputy?

           Josie takes a moment to register the question.

                                 JOSIE
                        Sorry?
                                 STAN
                        Just a little shook up, huh?

                                 JOSIE
                        Uh, yeah, I’m fine... fine.

           Suddenly, there’s a large THUMP from inside the Sheriff's 
           car.  Blood drains from Josie’s face.

           THUMP.  Her eyes move to the trunk, wide with panic.  THUMP.  
           She steps back, horrified.  THUMP.  But then realizes...

           It’s not the source of the noise...

           INSIDE THE SHERIFF'S CAR

           Bernie leans back and kicks at the door again.

                                 BERNIE
                        Help!  Help me!  Jesus Christ, 
                        they’re crazy!

                                                                 BACK TO:

           THE DRIVER

           Dips his head and stares at Bernie.  Screaming and spitting 
           and crazy-eyed.  Breath misting the glass.  Voice muffled.

                                 DRIVER
                        Shit, you got a fella in there?

                                 STAN
                        Ahh, yeah...

           The Driver frowns at Bernie, bewildered.

                                 DRIVER
                        Jesus Christ... say, ain’t that the 
                        dude who killed them Toohey folks?

           Stan nods.

                                 STAN
                        Got that right.  Taking him to Deer 
                        Lodge to meet his maker.

           Repulsed, the Driver watches Bernie kick and scream.

                                 DRIVER
                        Question is, will his maker want to 
                        meet him?

           Stan moves into his eyeline.  Shoots him an embarrassed grin.
                                 STAN
                        We best saddle up before he tears 
                        up our rig.  Thanks for stopping.

                                 DRIVER
                        No problem.  Nice speakin' atcha .

           He puts the truck into gear.  Raises his hand in a wave.

           Stan waves back.  Josie doesn’t.

           We stay with the truck a while as it moves along.  The Driver 
           looks out the window at...

           The faded streak of blood along the roadside.  Almost washed 
           away by the heavy rain...

           He shakes his head and increases his speed.

           INSIDE THE SHERIFF'S CAR

           As Stan and Josie climb in and slam the doors shut.

           A moment of silence.  Each lost in their thoughts.

                                 BERNIE
                        Are you people outta your god damn 
                        minds?

                                 STAN
                        Shut your mouth!  This’d never have 
                        happened if you’da quit needlin’ 
                        me.

           Stan turns to Josie.

                                 STAN
                        We need to get rid of the body.

           Josie speaks mechanically.  Gazing at the empty road ahead.

                                 JOSIE
                        We should never have moved him.

                                 STAN
                        Well we did.  And now we’re in this 
                        whether you like it or not.

           Josie turns to Stan.

                                 JOSIE
                        We can still put him back.

           Stan firmly shakes his head.
                                 STAN
                        They’ll comb the car for evidence.
                              (re: Bernie)
                        They’ll speak to this son of a 
                        bitch.  They’ll know.

                                 BERNIE
                        I won’t say nothing.  I swear.

           Stan turns to him with a sneer.

                                 STAN
                        Excuse me if I don’t exactly feel 
                        comfortable trusting my life to the 
                        word of a killer.

           He turns back to Josie.

                                 STAN
                        All that’s changed now is we’ve got 
                        an obstruction charge added onto 
                        the shitpile.

           He tries to gauge her reaction.  Leans forward.  Places a 
           hand on her shoulder.  She flinches slightly.

                                 STAN
                        We can fix this, Josie.

                                 JOSIE
                        How?

           Stan hesitates.

                                 STAN
                        Your brother still got that place 
                        up off Route 89?

                                 JOSIE
                        No!  Hell no!  We’re not getting 
                        him mixed up in this.

                                 STAN
                        We got no choice.  No one’ll see us 
                        if we take the backroad out along 
                        Deep ‘Crik.  We need to hide the 
                        body.  Clean up the car.  Then we 
                        radio it in.  Then it’ll all be over.

                                 JOSIE
                        What about him?

           Stan looks at Bernie.

                                 STAN
                        We can hide him too.  Say he 
                        escaped in the confusion.
                                 JOSIE
                        Then what?

           A long pause.  Stan looks grim.

                                 BERNIE
                        Listen, I don’t know what you--

           Stan juts a fingers at him.

                                 STAN
                        I won’t tell you again!

           He turns back to Josie.

                                 STAN
                        We decide on that later.  For now, 
                        getting rid of this dead fella is 
                        our first and only priority.

           Josie considers this.  Trapped.  She reaches into her pocket.  
           Pulls out the bottle of Adderall.  No point in hiding it now.

           Taps two pills into her palm and swallows them dry.  Then 
           turns to Stan and nods once.  Barely perceptible.

           Stan breathes a sigh of relief and starts the engine.

                                 STAN
                        We’ll get through this alright, 
                        Josie.  You’ll see.

           THE BACK BUMPER OF THE SHERIFF'S CAR

           As it drives off with a spurt of exhaust smoke.

           PRE-LAP: 60’s GARAGE PUNK (The Ruins - “The End”) blasts out.

           WE PAN DOWN TO THE GREY-BLACK PAVEMENT AND SEE...

           A CIRCULAR PATCH OF RUBY RED BLOOD.  Battered by thick 
           droplets of rain.  The music continues as we MATCH CUT TO:

           GREY METAL

           A fine mist of red paint spatters onto it with a HISS.

           PULL BACK TO REVEAL WE ARE IN AN...

           AUTO REPAIR SHOP.  Once a barn.  Room for two cars at best.  
           Chaotic piles of secondhand tools and rusted car parts.

           A MECHANIC wearing a respirator and coveralls spraypaints a 
           PICK-UP TRUCK, nodding along to the beat of the music.
           We hear the scarcely audible sound of someone bashing on the 
           garage door.

           The Mechanic stops.  Listens.  Puts down the spray gun.  
           Flicks off the old radio behind him.

           This time the knocking is heard more clearly.

           The Mechanic lifts the respirator revealing a handsome face 
           marred somewhat by an unruly beard.

           This is Josie’s brother, KYLE DEUMANN (late 20s).  He heads 
           for the garage door.  Pulls it up...

           Josie stands outside.

                                 KYLE
                        Josie?

                                 JOSIE
                        Been banging for five minutes!

                                 KYLE
                        Had the radio on.

           Kyle’s voice wades through the thick mud of a drug-addled 
           adolescence.

           Josie pushes him aside and waves the Sheriff's car in.

           Kyle inspects the damage as it rolls in.

                                 KYLE
                        Holy Jesus!  What happened?

           Josie flashes him a look and pulls down the garage door.

           Stan emerges from the car.  Closes the door behind him.

                                 STAN
                        Kyle, how you doin’?

           Kyle sees the worry etched on both their faces.

           HANDS COVERED IN DRY RED PAINT

           Roll a cigarette.

           WIDER REVEALS...

           KYLE’S AUTO REPAIR SHOP.  Isolated.  Surrounded by a maze of 
           disemboweled car chassis.  One dirt road in and out.

           Hand painted sign over the door: “Deumann Auto Repair”

           Kyle sits on a pile of firewood.  He runs his tongue along 
           the edge of the rolling paper and lights his cigarette.
           Josie stands nearby.  Studying his face.  Gauging his 
           reaction.

                                 JOSIE
                        We should never have come here.  I 
                        shoulda never have put you in this 
                        position.

                                 KYLE
                        You’re my sister.  You need help.  
                        That’s the only position I’m in.

           A SPONGE WIPES AWAY BLOOD

           Stan wears Kyle’s coveralls.  He washes down trunk of the 
           Sheriff's car with bucket of soapy water.

           Kyle and Josie enter through the garage door.  Pulls it 
           closed behind them.

           The BODY lies on the ground, covered by an oil-stained sheet.

                                 STAN
                        Think I got it clean.  Mostly.  
                        It’ll still test positive if they 
                        run a luminol test, but it would 
                        anyway if it were a deer.

           Kyle locks eyes with Bernie through the window of the car.

                                 KYLE
                        So what’s the plan?

           Josie checks her watch.

                                 JOSIE
                        They’re expecting us in Deer Lodge 
                        in two hours.

                                 STAN
                        Alright... we say we hit a deer.  
                        We pulled up.  The back door wasn’t 
                        secure.  He got it open and made a 
                        run for it.

                                 JOSIE
                        What about the truck driver?

                                 STAN
                        He’ll back up our story.  He saw 
                        how crazy he was actin’.  Then we 
                        say after Houle made a run for it 
                        we chased him down -- no time to 
                        radio it in -- we chased him down 
                        through the forest a while and then 
                        we... we shot him.
           Josie shoots a glance at Bernie in the backseat, who can 
           sense they are talking about them.  She shakes her head.

                                 JOSIE
                        No... I can’t do it.

                                 STAN
                        I’ll do it.

                                 JOSIE
                        It’s not right.

                                 STAN
                        He’s gonna die anyway.  What’s the 
                        difference how it happens?

           Kyle steps forward.

                                 KYLE
                        This is my shop, I think I got some 
                        say in this.

                                 STAN
                        So what you want to do?

                                 KYLE
                        Firstly, we ain’t shooting nobody.  
                        Not yet.  We just need a little 
                        time.  See what they know about 
                        this dead fella.  He coulda been 
                        some Unabomber-type, livin’ wild.  
                        Maybe nobody’ll be lookin’ for him.

                                 STAN
                              (re: Bernie)
                        That still don’t fix our problem 
                        with him.

                                 KYLE
                        Maybe there’s something we can 
                        do... I don’t know... some way we 
                        can get him to keep quiet.  Promise 
                        him something.

                                 STAN
                        He’s supposed to be executed in a 
                        week!  He’s got nothing to lose.

                                 KYLE
                        Still, ain’t no reason to rush into 
                        anything half-cocked.  We gotta 
                        kill him, I’d rather do it later 
                        than sooner.

           Stan and Josie think about it.

                                 JOSIE
                        He’s right.
           Stan concedes reluctantly with a nod.

                                 KYLE
                        So where we gonna keep him?

                                 STAN
                        We can’t keep him here?

                                 KYLE
                        This place ain’t exactly habitable.

           Stan gets an idea, reaches into his pocket.  Pulls out a set 
           of keys.  Unhooks one.

                                 STAN
                        Got a cabin outside Browning.  
                        Shouldn’t take you more than forty 
                        minutes to get there.

                                 KYLE
                              (taking the key)
                        That’ll work.

           Stan nods.  They all exchange glum looks.  No turning back.

           ROWS OF TREES

           We speed by them.  They form and break rank, revealing the 
           distant horizon.

           PULL BACK.  We are...

           INSIDE THE SHERIFF'S CAR.  Josie grinds her hands together, 
           trying to wipe away the sweat.

                                 STAN
                        Five minutes out.  You wanna call 
                        it in?

           Josie nods.  Reaches for the radio.  Lifts the handset to her 
           mouth.  Takes a deep breath.

                                 STAN
                        Josie.  Wait.

           She stops and looks over at him.

                                 STAN
                        We should say that you were the one 
                        that left the door unsecured.

                                 JOSIE
                        Me?  Why me?

                                 STAN
                        They’ll never believe a veteran is 
                        gonna make a mistake like that.
                                 (MORE)
                                 STAN (CONT'D)
                              (then, apologetically)
                        They’ll just put it down to 
                        inexperience.

           Josie glares at him, trying to control her anger.

                                 JOSIE
                        You should watch the road, 
                        Sergeant.

           PRE-LAP: The thunderous ROAR of a helicopter as we CUT TO:

           THE CLOUD-FILLED SKY

           As a chopper carves across it.  Panning down to...

           THE ROADSIDE

           The same location where Stan and Josie hit the man.

           Dozens of police personnel in high-visibility slickers swarm 
           the surrounding forest.

           SHERIFF TOM DOCHERTY (early 30s) scans the scene through 
           narrowed eyes.

           Short-cropped hair.  Goatee, grey round the edges.  He speaks 
           carefully as though on a satellite delay.

           He takes it all in.  Absorbs it:

           The skid marks.  The damaged Sheriff's car.  Shattered 
           windscreen.  Back door open wide.  The vast expanse of 
           wilderness beyond.

           Like he’s watching the whole thing play out before his eyes.

           He turns to Stan and Josie.  Waits.

                                 STAN
                        I was the senior officer here, Tom.  
                        No matter who did or didn’t do 
                        what, I take full responsibility 
                        for what happened.

           Docherty turns back to the forest.  Looks up to the darkening 
           sky.  Almost dusk.

                                 DOCHERTY
                        Well, he can’t get too far.  Colder 
                        than a welldigger’s ass out there.  
                        Let’s just hope he doesn’t die 
                        before we get to him.

           Stan’s relief is palpable.  He recomposes himself as Docherty 
           turns back to them.
                                 DOCHERTY
                        Josie... can I have a word?

           He motions for her to follow.

           Stan and Josie exchange a look.  She trails the Sheriff down 
           the road a dozen yards or so.  He waits a good while to speak.

                                 DOCHERTY
                        You remember when we met back when 
                        we was curtain crawlers?  First day 
                        of elementary?

           Josie shakes her head.

                                 DOCHERTY
                        You told me that the paper from 
                        your notebook was edible.  Made a’ 
                        cornmeal you said.

           Josie smiles at the memory.

                                 JOSIE
                        You ate two whole pages before you 
                        worked it out.

           Docherty laughs, shaking his head.

                                 DOCHERTY
                        Nah, nah.  Knew from the first that 
                        you were lying to me.  Just trying 
                        to impress you, I guess.  Kids can 
                        be dumb that way.

           Josie reddens a little.  Docherty suddenly becomes serious.

                                 DOCHERTY
                        But I ain’t a kid no more.

           The smile drops from Josie’s face.

                                 DOCHERTY
                        You’re lying to me, Josie.

                                 JOSIE
                        I, uh...

           He moves forward.  Nose inches from hers.

                                 DOCHERTY
                        You’re lying, ain’t you?

           She’s trapped.  She hangs her head.  A wisp of hair falls 
           into her face.

                                 DOCHERTY
                        It was Stan that left that door 
                        unsecured, wasn’t it?
           She pushes the hair off her forehead.  Relieved.

                                 JOSIE
                        Uh... yeah.  You’re right.  It was.

           Docherty looks back towards Stan, who fidgets with paranoia.  
           Pretending to avert his eyes.

                                 DOCHERTY
                        That man is the fuck-up of all fuck-
                        ups in the history of fuck-ups.
                              (turns back to Josie)
                        I’d take your badges but Lord knows 
                        I’ll probably need every man and 
                        woman I got out there lookin’ the 
                        coming days.  For now you best go 
                        home.  I’ll deal with both of you in 
                        due course.  You’re dismissed.

           Josie wavers.  Turns away.

                                 DOCHERTY
                        Josie.

           She stops.

                                 DOCHERTY
                        I stuck my neck out to get you this 
                        job.  Despite your... family 
                        history.  Don’t feed me no paper.

           Josie nods, trying hard not to burst into tears.  She heads 
           back past Stan, face flushed.

                                 STAN
                        What’d he say?

           She shakes her head and walks right by him and WE CUT TO:

           BERNIE’S HANDS

           Cuffed behind his back.

           PULL BACK as Kyle escorts him up the steps of...

           STAN’S LOG CABIN

           Hand built by one man (not Stan) a long, long time ago.

           The half-painted PICK-UP we saw in the auto repair shop 
           parked nearby.  Tarp covering the bed.

           THE FACE OF A GRANDFATHER CLOCK

           As it chimes six.  We hear a door unlock.  WIDEN TO REVEAL...
           A ONE ROOM CABIN.  Houle enters first.  Kyle follows.  They 
           both survey the interior...

           Dusty flotsam jettisoned from Stan’s house over the decades:

           Grandfather clock, a little too loud.

           Dining table, a little too large.

           Burnt orange couch, burnt a little too orange.

           Several hunting trophies (antlers only) adorn the walls.

           Kyle leads Bernie past the black and charred fireplace to a 
           cast iron cooking stove in the corner.

           He reaches into his pocket and pulls out the handcuff key.  
           Bernie looks at Kyle over his shoulder.

                                 BERNIE
                        This ain’t right and you know it.

           Kyle pauses.  Unsure how to respond.

                                 KYLE
                        I don’t think we should talk.

           Kyle takes hold of the cuffs to unlock them and suddenly...

           BERNIE SWINGS HIS HEAD BACK.  Butting Kyle in the nose.  He 
           staggers backwards, groaning.  Clutching at it.

           Bernie runs for the door.  Hands still cuffed, he has to turn 
           around to reach the handle.

           Kyle recovers.  Gets to his feet as Bernie slips out the door.

           CABIN FRONT PORCH

           Bernie grabs hold of the door handle.  Swings it closed.

           Kyle grabs the handle on the other side.  A tug of war.  
           Bernie leans forward.  Holding the door closed.

                                 KYLE (O.S.)
                        Let go!  You got nowhere to run, 
                        you damn fool!

           Bernie’s eyes frantically comb the landscape around the 
           cabin.  Nothing but ponderosa pines and the mountains beyond.  

           His grip slackens slightly and...

           Kyle jerks the door free from his hands with a yank.

           Bernie stumbles forward and lets out a yell of shock as he 
           trips off the edge of the porch.
           With no way to arrest his fall he lands heavily, face first 
           in the mud.  He lays still.  Legs sprawled up the steps.

           Kyle stares from the doorway.  Face contorted with shock.

           PRE-LAP: A HARANGUE OF VOICES assault our ears.

           A PAIR OF MUDDY BOOTS

           Part a jostling sea of patent leather and designer pumps.

           WIDER.  The boots belong to Docherty and he’s wading through 
           a baying pack of journalists on the steps of the courthouse.

                                 JOURNALIST #1
                        Is it true Bernie Houle has escaped?

                                 JOURNALIST #2
                        Have the family of the victims been 
                        notified?

           Docherty waves away their questions, pushing aside their 
           microphones.

           CASCADE COUNTY COURTHOUSE

           Docherty makes his way along the marbled hall.  Ignoring the 
           sideways glances from the courthouse staff.

                                 PRIDDIS (O.S.)
                        Docherty!  Sheriff Docherty!

           Docherty glances over his shoulder and sees...

           SCOTT PRIDDIS (late 30s) -- BERNIE HOULE’S LAWYER -- 
           approaching.  Stubborn, dogged and just about the worst thing 
           you can be in Montana: Californian.

           Docherty continues walking.  Priddis two steps behind.

                                 PRIDDIS
                        What the fuck is going on, Sheriff?

                                 DOCHERTY
                        You’ll know when I know.

                                 PRIDDIS
                        You think this is going to stop my 
                        client’s appeal process you’re very 
                        much mistaken.  Bernie Houle still 
                        has rights, whether you like it or 
                        not.

                                 DOCHERTY
                        Knock yourself out.
                              (turning back)
                                 (MORE)
                                 DOCHERTY (CONT'D)
                        And feel free to take that advice 
                        literally.

           Docherty pushes through a door, leaving Priddis behind.

           AN OFFICE TELEPHONE

           Red lights blinking all over.  People on hold.

                                 SECRETARY (V.O.)
                        One moment, please.

           A SECRETARY replaces the receiver in the cradle and stands as 
           Docherty enters, mumbling:

                                 DOCHERTY
                        God damn bunny huggers.

           He points to the side office.

                                 DOCHERTY
                        She in there?

           The Secretary nods.

                                 SECRETARY
                        Governor’s office has been calling.

                                 DOCHERTY
                        Tell him I’m meeting with the 
                        victims’ family.

           Without stopping he moves into...

           DOCHERTY’S OFFICE

           Half-filled bookshelf.  Locked gun cabinet.  Desk and chairs.

           LIZA TOOHEY (27) and her partner JOSH BEWICK (29) sit 
           waiting.  Staring at the rain through the window beyond.

           Liza is rake thin and heavily pregnant.  Whatever glow this 
           imbued her with has been replaced by a burning fury.

           Josh wears glasses and his best suit.  Knee bouncing.

           Liza notices Docherty enter and attempts to rise.  Hand 
           pressed across her swollen belly.

                                 DOCHERTY
                        Stay there, Liza, stay there.

           Docherty gently places a hand on her shoulder.  Knows her 
           determination.
           She looks up into the Sheriff’s eyes.  Softens a little when 
           she sees his dejection.

                                 LIZA
                        You remember Josh?  My fiance?

           Docherty nods.  Shakes Josh’s hand.

                                 DOCHERTY
                        I seen you at the district court?

                                 JOSH
                        I’m a clerk down there.

           Liza isn’t interested in any more small talk.

                                 LIZA
                        How the hell could you let 
                        something like this happen, Tom?

           Docherty leans on his desk.  Addressing only Liza.

                                 DOCHERTY
                        We were advised that a large 
                        contingent of protestors down in 
                        Deer Lodge were gonna attempt to 
                        block the transfer.  I made the 
                        call that a smaller team would be 
                        less conspicuous.

                                 JOSH
                        Well, clearly that was inadequate.

           Josh withers under Docherty’s glare.  Docherty turns to Liza.

                                 DOCHERTY
                        I’ve spoken to the commander out at 
                        the air force base and he’s agreed 
                        to assign a hundred and fifty of 
                        his people to the search team.

                                 LIZA
                        What if he dies out there?

                                 DOCHERTY
                        Well, is that--?

           Docherty stops himself.  Ashamed.  Liza knows exactly what he 
           was going to say.

                                 LIZA
                        You know how long I’ve been 
                        waiting, Sheriff?  I was six years 
                        old when that man was sentenced.  
                        Twenty-one years.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 LIZA (CONT'D)
                        Twenty-one years of appeals and 
                        processes and evidence hearings and 
                        petitions and administrative 
                        bullshit.  I want this over.

           Docherty absorbs this.

                                 DOCHERTY
                        We’ll find him.  You have my word.

           BERNIE HOULE’S FACE

           Bloody, bruised, dirty.  Eyes closed.

           PULL BACK.  Bernie is handcuffed to the stove in the cabin.

           JOSIE, STAN AND KYLE loom over him.  Stan holds two bags of 
           groceries.

                                 JOSIE
                        Jesus Christ, what’d you do to him?

                                 KYLE
                        I told you, it wasn’t my fault.  He 
                        tried to run.

                                 STAN
                        He asleep?

                                 KYLE
                        He’s been coming in and out of it a 
                        while.

                                 JOSIE
                        You think he needs medical 
                        attention?

                                 STAN
                        From who?

                                 JOSIE
                        What about June?

                                 STAN
                        I’m not getting her mixed up in this.

           Stan carries the groceries over to the table.

                                 STAN
                        This should do you for a couple of 
                        days.

           Kyle turns around.

                                 KYLE
                        Do me?  Whatta you mean?
                                 STAN
                              (”ain’t it obvious?”)
                        You gotta stay with him.

                                 KYLE
                        Hell no I don’t.  I did what I said 
                        I’d do, but my part in this is over.

                                 STAN
                        Neither of us can afford to drop 
                        off the radar right now.  It’ll 
                        look suspicious.  Josie, tell him.

           Josie looks at Kyle, doubt in her eyes.

                                 STAN
                        You both need to look at the 
                        situation we’re faced with here.  
                        We need to play it smart.
                              (to Kyle)
                        You’re the one that can least 
                        afford for all this to come undone.  
                        You’re on a third strike felony 
                        conviction.  You can’t spare a few 
                        days?  What about 25 years in the 
                        state lockup?

           Kyle chews his lip.  Knows he is right but:

                                 KYLE
                        I can’t spend the rest of my life 
                        babysitting this fella.

                                 STAN
                        Well, there we agree.  So... we 
                        gotta figure out what the end game 
                        is here.  What we’re aiming at.  
                        What I’m sayin’ is...

           Stan grinds his palms together.

                                 STAN
                        What if we do it ourselves?

                                 JOSIE
                        Do what ourselves?

                                 STAN
                        What if we do it?  Just like they 
                        were gonna do down in Deer Lodge.  
                        Same day.  Same time.  Same method.

                                 JOSIE
                        I’m not gonna kill him.

                                 STAN
                        I’m not talking about killing him.  
                        I’m talking about executing him.
           Josie shakes her head, baffled.

                                 JOSIE
                        It’s the same thing!

                                 STAN
                        No it ain’t!  He’s guilty.  That’s 
                        his sentence.  Hell, I went to 
                        school with the fella that’s 
                        supposed to do it and he’s thick as 
                        borrow pit gumbo.  If we do it 
                        proper -- you know, by the book -- 
                        where’s the difference between us 
                        doin’ it and him doin’ it?

                                 JOSIE
                        The difference is that we weren’t 
                        gonna be the ones that did it!

           She immediately realizes how cowardly this sounds.  Tries a 
           different tack:

                                 JOSIE
                        What about the family?  Of the 
                        people he killed?  Don’t they 
                        deserve to know?

                                 STAN
                        Let’s say this guy had killed 
                        someone with no family?  Would they 
                        up and say “Well, there’s no cause 
                        to punish him if there ain’t no 
                        blood relatives around to witness 
                        it?”  Justice ain’t about 
                        vengeance.  It’s about punishment.

           Josie turns away with frustration.  Stan steps forward.  
           Tries a conciliatory tone.

                                 STAN
                        Look, maybe we can... I don’t 
                        know... send the family a letter a 
                        couple of years down the track when 
                        we’re free and clear.  Let them 
                        know what we did.  Give ‘em some 
                        peace of mind.  Hell, I’ll even 
                        take credit for it as long as June 
                        and the kids are taken care of.

           Josie remains unconvinced.  She looks at Kyle for support.  
           None forthcoming.

                                 KYLE
                        We need to do something, Josie.

           And, just like that, Josie is outvoted.
           STOREFRONTS - NIGHT

           We move along them at speed.  Apart from the Cascade Food 
           Bank most of them are boarded up or closing down.

           PULL BACK to reveal Liza and Josh in their car.  The latter 
           at the wheel.

           Liza watches her hometown slowly dying outside her window.

                                 LIZA
                              (without turning)
                        S'pose you're happy, huh?

                                 JOSH
                        Sorry?

                                 LIZA
                        This's what you wanted right?

           Josh cottons on.

                                 JOSH
                        I'm not going to talk to you when 
                        you're like this.

           Liza turns to him.

                                 LIZA
                        “Woulda been better if he’d got 
                        life without parole”.  Ain't that 
                        what you said?

                                 JOSH
                        That was three years ago!

                                 LIZA
                        Doesn't matter when it was.  That's 
                        what you said.

                                 JOSH
                        All I meant was that I wish you had 
                        some closure.  All these appeals and 
                        the waiting and now this.  Twenty 
                        years of stress and uncertainty.  At 
                        least life would've meant life.  Full 
                        stop.  Period.  The end.  At least 
                        maybe then you woulda been able to 
                        move on.

           Liza laughs bitterly.

                                 LIZA
                        Move on?  Move on?  Is that what 
                        you said?
                                 JOSH
                        I know you're upset but that's no 
                        reason to take it out on me.

                                 LIZA
                        You don't know what the hell you're 
                        talking about.

           Long pause.  He can't let it go.

                                 JOSH
                        All I know is that in the five 
                        years I've worked at the courthouse 
                        there's been two exonerations on 
                        murder cases after the fact.

                                 LIZA
                        So what're you saying?  You think 
                        this motherfucker is innocent?

                                 JOSH
                        No!  Of course not!  This... this’s 
                        all been a little difficult for me...

                                 LIZA
                        Difficult?  Well it ain't been no 
                        picnic for me either.

           Josh closes his eyes.  A deep breath.  Reaches out.  Rests 
           his hand on her belly.  She lets him do it.

                                 JOSH
                        I'm sorry, Liza.  All I want is for 
                        you to be happy.  If this is what 
                        it takes then I'm with you a 
                        hundred percent of the way.

           CLOSE ON A NOTEPAD

           Covered in indecipherable scrawl.  Crude diagrams.

                                 STAN
                        Uh-huh... then you flush the line 
                        with saline?  So the witnesses 
                        don’t see him until all the IV 
                        lines are hooked up?

           ON STAN.  Talking on the phone in his modest one-story home.  
           A prominent crucifix adorns the wall above his head.

                                 STAN
                        I don’t know.  After everything 
                        that’s happened I guess I just 
                        wanted to satisfy my own curiosity.

           REVERSE ON THE FRONT DOOR as Stan’s wife JUNE (50) steps 
           through it.  She wears a nurse uniform.
           Glimmers of a former Miss Montana sparkle beneath her weary 
           surface.  Like coins at the bottom of a fountain.

           Stan turns away and murmurs into the phone.

                                 STAN
                        I better go, June’s just come in.
                              (pause)
                        Yeah, appreciate it.  Nice speakin' 
                        atcha.

           He hangs up.  June stands over him, face etched with worry.

                                 JUNE
                        Father Bryant called me and told me 
                        what happened.  I was trying to 
                        reach you all afternoon.

                                 STAN
                        I’m okay, I’m okay.  Was helpin’ 
                        with the search.  They’ll find him.

                                 JUNE
                              (re: the phone call)
                        Who was that?

                                 STAN
                        Uh, that was just Josie.

                                 JUNE
                        You had dinner yet?

                                 STAN
                        Not yet.

           June moves into the next room.  Flicks on the light.  We see 
           part of the kitchen but stay with Stan.

                                 JUNE (O.S.)
                        I tell you I was worried sick.  
                        What’ll we tell the people at 
                        church?  Should we ask them to 
                        pray, you think?  For things to 
                        come out alright?

           Stan is distracted by the scribble on the notepad.

                                 STAN
                        I dunno.  Maybe.  Say, you ever 
                        heard of somethin’ called... pent-
                        oh-bar-bit-al?

           June reappears in the doorway.

                                 JUNE
                        Pentobarbital?  Sure.  We use it on 
                        coma patients.  Why you askin’?
                                 STAN
                        Someone told me that’s what they’re 
                        gonna use on that Houle fella.  
                        Ain’t that a little funny?  They’re 
                        gonna use medicine to do it.

           June shrugs.  Heads back into the kitchen.

           HOLD ON STAN.  Listening to his wife preparing dinner.

           PRE-LAP:  The sound of a plate SMASHING and we CUT TO:

           A LINOLEUM FLOOR

           As another dish is shattered into a million pieces on it.

                                 JOSIE (O.S.)
                        Ma?

           Josie enters the KITCHEN.  Her AUNT MAGGIE stands in the 
           opposite doorway watching on impassively.

           Between them Josie’s mom PAULA (65) snatches piles of 
           tableware from the cupboards.

                                 JOSIE
                        What the hell’s goin on?

           Aunt Maggie shrugs.

                                 AUNT MAGGIE
                        I can’t stop her.

                                 JOSIE
                        Well you sure as hell could try.

           Josie moves forward and touches her mother’s arm.

                                 JOSIE
                        Mom, what’s going on?

                                 PAULA
                        That bitch next door keeps swappin’ 
                        out my dishes for fakes.

           She holds up a plate inches from Josie’s nose.

                                 PAULA
                        Look at this: it’s got seven fleur-
                        de-lis and my dishes always, always 
                        had eight.

           She hurls it onto the ground where it shatters.  Josie jumps 
           back to avoid the shrapnel.

           Paula grabs another plate but Josie grabs hold of her wrist.
                                 JOSIE
                        Mom.  Those are grandma’s.

                                 PAULA
                        They’re fake, I’m telling you.
                              (points out the window)
                        She’s been sneakin’ in here, trying 
                        to mess with me.

                                 JOSIE
                        I know.  I know.  You’re right, 
                        okay?  I’ll get your dishes back.  
                        I’ll go over there first thing 
                        tomorrow.

           Paula hesitates.  Josie takes the plate from her mom’s hand.

                                 JOSIE
                        Why don’t you go lie down for a 
                        little bit?

           She guides her mother towards the door.

                                 PAULA
                        Alright... but I want the locks 
                        changed.

                                 JOSIE
                        I’ll call a locksmith right now.

           Paula nods, satisfied.  Josie watches her disappear down the 
           hall.  Turns to her aunt.  Sarcastically:

                                 JOSIE
                        Thanks for your help.

           Josie grabs a broom from the corner and starts sweeping up 
           the broken fragments.

                                 AUNT MAGGIE
                        She needs proper care.

                                 JOSIE
                        You offering to pay for it?

                                 AUNT MAGGIE
                        Honey, if I had money to spare you 
                        think I’d be living in Great Falls?  
                        This town is for people who can’t 
                        afford to die in Florida.  If 
                        you’da saved that money you got 
                        from selling your musical equipment 
                        instead of blowin’ it all on Kyle--

                                 JOSIE
                        He needed that money for his 
                        business.
                                 AUNT MAGGIE
                        Puh-lease.  The only business 
                        Kyle’s interested in is the meth-
                        smokin’ business.

                                 JOSIE
                              (bitterly)
                        Well, I’m real sorry for imposin’ 
                        on your busy schedule.

                                 AUNT MAGGIE
                        Hey, you ain’t the only one with a 
                        life, missy.  I didn’t exactly 
                        envisage spending my twilight years 
                        wiping my sister’s rear end.

                                 JOSIE
                        Well then I guess delusion runs in 
                        the family cos I could see it all 
                        coming down the turnpike the day 
                        dad died.

                                 AUNT MAGGIE
                        Bully for you.

           Maggie snatches her bag from the counter and heads out.

                                 JOSIE
                        You comin’ tomorrow?

                                 AUNT MAGGIE (O.S.)
                        I’ll think about it.

                                 JOSIE
                        I got work.

           No answer.

                                 JOSIE
                        Aunt Maggie?

           The front door shuts.

           Josie snatches a plate from the pile and smashes it.

           A SPADE

           Digs through hard, icy dirt.

           PULL BACK.  Kyle digs in the rectangle of light coming from 
           the rear window of the cabin.

           Hole about four foot deep.  Pile of firewood adjacent.
           A HUMAN SHAPED FORM

           Wrapped in a tarp.  Dragged along the ground.

           Kyle rolls it into the hole.  Begins to backfill it.

                                                                TIME CUT:

           KYLE moves the firewood across to cover the hole.  Piece by 
           piece.

                                                                TIME CUT:

           The grave is well concealed by the firewood.

           Kyle inspects his handiwork.  Wipes his brow.

           He hears a groan from inside the cabin.

           THE CABIN DOOR OPENS

           Kyle enters.  Groggy, Bernie watches him.  Clocks his muddy 
           shirt.  His dirt-smeared hands.

           Kyle averts his eyes and moves across the room.

           Grabs a lukewarm beer from a grocery bag.  Cracks it open.  
           Takes a big swig.  Rifles through the bag some more.

                                 KYLE
                        You hungry?

           Bernie is but won’t admit it.  Kyle pulls out a tin.  Reads 
           the label.

                                 KYLE
                        Stewed steak casserole.

           He shows Bernie.  Walks over to the cupboard.

           Takes out a pot and a spoon.  Pulls the ring on the tin.  
           Tips out the contents.

                                 BERNIE
                        What’re you gonna do to me?

           Kyle hesitates.  Moves towards Bernie.

                                 KYLE
                        Nothing you didn’t already have 
                        coming.

           Kyle puts the pot on the stove.  Opens the grill on front.  
           The embers glow inside.

           He opens the flue.  The embers start to blaze.
           Stirs the casserole as it heats.  Watches Bernie.  His 
           bruises.  The dry blood under his nose.

                                 KYLE
                        Sorry you got hurt.

           Bernie looks up at him.

                                 KYLE
                        You shouldn’ta run.

           Bernie looks away again.

           Kyle digs into his pocket.  Pulls out a deck of cards.  Holds 
           them up.

                                 KYLE
                        You know how to play poker?

           Bernie looks up again.  Holds his gaze as we CUT TO:

           A GLASS

           Five fingers of auburn liquid sloshes into it.

           Sheriff Docherty -- out of uniform -- caps the bottle of 
           whiskey.  We’re in his kitchen.  It’s not modern.

           He moves across to a small portable CD player.  Hits play.

           The sound of a female country singer fills the room.  Slow 
           and melancholic.

           The recording isn’t perfect but her talent is undeniable.

           Docherty picks a cracked CD jewel case off the counter and 
           sits down at the table.  Takes a gulp of whiskey.

           CLOSE ON the CD COVER.  A Kinko’s job.  Cut crooked.  Faded 
           paper:

           A photo of Josie.  Ten years younger.  Sitting on a rundown 
           fence.  Laughing at something just out of frame.

           Docherty stares at the picture.  Half-smiling.  Listening to 
           Josie sing.

           CLOSE ON his hand.  Resting on his knee.  The hand moves.  Up 
           his jeans.  Towards his crotch.

           He rubs himself.  Real slow.  Unzips his fly but...

           A deep BUZZ stops him.

           His hand moves across to his pocket.  Pulls out a phone.  
           Screen lit up.  Incoming call.  He answers.
                                 DOCHERTY
                        This’s the Sheriff.

                                 VOICE (V.O.)
                        Sheriff, it’s Cormier.  We, ah, we 
                        found something...

           Docherty zips himself up.

           A MAN’S HAND

           Moves across white sheets.  It stops.  Feels the cold.

           WIDEN TO REVEAL JOSH.  Alone in bed.  Liza gone.  He sits up.

           JOSH’S FEET

           Move down the staircase in the dark house.

                                 JOSH
                        Liza?

           He continues into the...

           LIVING ROOM

           Very dark.  Josh stands in the doorway.  Sees a form in the 
           darkness ahead.  Reaches out and flicks on the light.

           A WOMAN SCREAMS AND...

           BANG!  A SHOT rings out.  Slamming into the wall next to 
           Josh’s head.  He stumbles sideways, shielding his face.

           REVERSE ON LIZA.  Sitting in an armchair facing the door.  
           Smoking rifle in her arms.

           She puts the rifle down and races forward.

                                 LIZA
                        Jesus, Josh.  I’m so sorry.

           ON JOSH.  Stunned.  Trying to wipe grit from his eye.

                                 JOSH
                        What the hell is wrong with you!?

                                 LIZA
                        I thought heard a noise downstairs.  
                        I must’ve fallen asleep.  You gave me 
                        a fright and... the gun went off.

                                 JOSH
                        The gun went off?  You almost blew 
                        my fucking head off!
           He moves over to the rifle and snatches it up.  Expertly 
           ejects the spent casing and makes the gun safe.

                                 LIZA
                        Josh, I’m sorry.  Josh?

           Josh doesn’t answer.  Heads for the back of the house.

                                 LIZA
                        What if he comes for us?

           The question stops him in his tracks.  He turns around.

                                 JOSH
                        No one’s coming, Liza.  This has gotta 
                        stop.

           He’s gone before she can respond.

           HEADLIGHTS DANCE ACROSS PINES

           An isolated backroad.  Docherty at the wheel.

           POLICE FLASHERS strobe blue and red through the trees up 
           ahead.

                                 CORMIER (PRE-LAP)
                        Spoke to that truck driver who 
                        called in...

           CRIME SCENE

           Docherty and SERGEANT CORMIER duck under the yellow tape.

                                 CORMIER
                        Apparently Houle was causing one 
                        hell of a ruckus.  Kicking at the 
                        doors.  Screamin’.  Actin’ crazy.

           Docherty nods.  His eyes fixed on something ahead:

           A CHEVROLET TRUCK.  Distinctive lime green.  Lit up by 
           temporary floodlights.

           Forensics comb the interior for evidence.

                                 CORMIER
                        Owner is Charlie Cameron out of 
                        Helena.  Three-day hunting trip.  
                        Supposed to come home yesterday 
                        afternoon.  His wife reported him 
                        missing a couple of hours ago.

           Docherty runs his eye over the truck.
                                 DOCHERTY
                        Anything missing?

                                 CORMIER
                        All his camping equipment for 
                        starters.  Gun too.

           Docherty winces.

                                 CORMIER
                        He mighta been held up by the rain.

           Docherty shakes his head.

                                 CORMIER
                        You think Houle got to him?

           Docherty doesn’t answer...

           A PAIR OF CARDS

           Bullets.

                                 KYLE (O.S.)
                        God damn it.

           KYLE and BERNIE sit at the table in the cabin playing poker.

           The latter uncuffed.  The former, five beers deep, mucks his 
           hand with disgust.

                                 KYLE
                        How’re you getting so many aces?

           Bernie shrugs and rakes in his “chips”; pieces of paper torn 
           from the grocery bag.

                                 KYLE
                        How much I owe you now?

                                 BERNIE
                        Make it out to be... hundred twenty 
                        or thereabouts.

                                 KYLE
                        Jesus!  Need to go back to the bank.

           Kyle starts tearing some more pieces from the tattered 
           grocery bag.

                                 KYLE
                        Don’t see what you’re planning on 
                        doing with the money anyway.
                                 BERNIE
                        Bad idea to play against a man with 
                        nothing to lose.  Dead men don’t 
                        bluff.

           Kyle pauses, thoughtful.  Starts dealing out another hand.

                                 KYLE
                        That bother you?  Dying?

           Bernie considers the question as he checks his cards.

                                 BERNIE
                        When I look at it from the outside 
                        then I know I probably deserve it.  
                        I just wish they did it back then.

           Kyle lays out the flop.

                                 KYLE
                        How do you mean?

           Both men examine their cards.

                                 BERNIE
                        Once found this magazine in the 
                        prison library.  Article in it said 
                        that all the cells in our body 
                        replace themselves every seven 
                        years.  Bet ten.

                                 KYLE
                        Call.

           Kyle deals the turn.

                                 KYLE
                        That true?

                                 BERNIE
                        Dunno.  If it is... well, then that 
                        means this hand...
                              (raises his right hand)
                        This hand ain’t the same one that 
                        held the knife that killed those 
                        people.  Raise twenty-five.

                                 KYLE
                        Call.

           Kyle sets down the river card.

                                 BERNIE
                        Who knows?  Maybe it’s a load of 
                        bullshit.  I know one thing 
                        though...
                              (taps his temple)
                                 (MORE)
                                 BERNIE (CONT'D)
                        This ain’t the same mind that 
                        thought to do it.  That’s the only 
                        shame in it.  They give you time to 
                        change and then they kill you.
                              (beat)
                        I’m all in.

           Kyle thinks a long time.

                                 KYLE
                        I fold.

           Bernie shows his cards.  2-7 off-suit.  The worst hand in 
           poker.

                                 KYLE
                        Thought you said dead men don’t 
                        bluff.

                                 BERNIE
                        I ain’t dead yet.

           A CLOCK RADIO

           Flicks to 7 A.M.  The sound of a NEWS ANNOUNCER comes on mid-
           sentence.

                                 NEWS ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                        --expanding the search area for 
                        escaped death row inmate Bernie 
                        Houle in the largest manhunt in 
                        Montana state history, with 
                        authorities across the state on 
                        high alert--

           A hand enters frame.  Flicks off the radio.

           WIDER.  We’re in Josie’s BEDROOM.  She gets out of bed.  Pads 
           over to the window and opens the curtains.

           BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT spills into the room.  Fresh snow covers 
           the ground.  The world remade anew.

           JOSIE’S LIVING ROOM

           Josie enters and sees...

           Paula down on her hands and knees.  Carefully running a wide-
           tooth comb through the fringes of the Persian rug.

                                 JOSIE
                        Morning, Ma.

           Paula looks up.  Happy to see her daughter.  No sign of the 
           distress of the previous night.
                                 PAULA
                        Hi, sweetie!

           She bends back down and combs some more.  Tongue clamped 
           between her lips with concentration.

                                 JOSIE
                        Snowed last night.

                                 PAULA
                              (not looking up)
                        Did it?

           Josie watches her mother a while.  Something about the sight 
           upsets her.

           She moves forward.  Drops to her knees in front of Paula.  
           Takes her mother into her arms in a tight embrace.

           Confused, Paula hugs her back half-heartedly.

                                 PAULA
                        Josie, you’ve gone and mussed up 
                        the tassels.

           OUTSIDE JOSIE’S HOUSE

           Dressed in her uniform, Josie emerges.

           She steps over to to the edge of the porch, reaches up and 
           plucks an icicle from the eaves.

           She crunches down on it like a carrot.  Chewing as she 
           watches the neighborhood wake up.

           A couple of laughing teens drive past “hooky bobbing” -- one 
           of them hangs off the bumper and slides along the icy road.

           STAN’S CABIN

           Kyle and Bernie sit opposite each other eating a breakfast of 
           of leftover stew in silence.

           Kyle seems sulky and hungover.  Bernie watches him wolf down 
           his food, which seems to bother Kyle even more.

                                 BERNIE
                        Can I ask you a question?

           Kyle slams down his spoon.  Face twisted with bitterness.

                                 KYLE
                        Let’s get something straight first: 
                        I’m not your friend, alright?

           Bernie nods, taken aback.
                                 BERNIE
                        That’s fine.  Don’t need a friend.

                                 KYLE
                        Alright then...

           Kyle goes back to eating but curiosity eventually gets the 
           better of him:

                                 KYLE
                        So what’s your question?

           Bernie hesitates.

                                 BERNIE
                        You... you ever been in prison?

           Kyle’s reaction is answer enough.

                                 BERNIE
                        You eat quick.  And you protect 
                        your food.

           Kyle looks down.  His free arm forms a barricade around his 
           bowl.  He moves his arm away, self-conscious.

           Looks up at Bernie.  Anger melting slowly away.

                                 KYLE
                        Six years.  Down in Missoula.  
                        Stole rental cars under false IDs. 
                        Broke ‘em down for parts.  I 
                        needed... I had no choice...

           Kyle trails off.  Bernie leans forward.

                                 BERNIE
                        You can talk to me, Kyle.  I been 
                        there myself...

           Kyle looks back up.  Sees pity in Bernie’s eyes and...

           LEAPS TO HIS FEET.  Bucking his chair half across the room.

           He rounds the table and snatches Bernie by the collar.

                                 KYLE
                        Get up!  On your feet.

           Kyle fishes the handcuffs from his pocket and drags Bernie 
           over to the stove.  Sits him down and cuffs him to it.  

           Grabs a handful of Bernie’s hair and leans down:

                                 KYLE
                        I’m not like you, you hear?  You’re 
                        a god damn murderer.  I never hurt 
                        nobody.
           He thumps Bernie’s head back against the wall and stalks out 
           of the cabin.  SLAMMING the door behind him.

           DOCHERTY’S OFFICE

           The Sheriff sits behind his desk.

                                 DOCHERTY
                        The press are howling for blood and 
                        I can’t exactly blame ‘em.  This is 
                        a biblical-size caddywompus.

           JOSIE AND STAN sit opposite.

                                 DOCHERTY
                        Sergeant, I know it was you that 
                        failed to secure that car door.

                                 STAN
                        What?

                                 DOCHERTY
                        There’s no use denying it.  Josie 
                        told me herself.

           Stan flashes a look of anger at Josie.

                                 DOCHERTY
                        Given your seniority and the fact 
                        that you didn’t own up to your 
                        error I’m putting you on indefinite 
                        suspension pending the outcome of 
                        the Houle search.

                                 STAN
                        Tom, this ain’t fair.  It was a 
                        mistake.  It could’ve happened to 
                        anyone.

                                 DOCHERTY
                        But it happened to you.  I should 
                        warn you, when the dust settles you 
                        may find yourself without a job.  
                        I’m giving you a chance to get your 
                        affairs in order in the interim.

                                 STAN
                        What about my pension?

                                 DOCHERTY
                        That’s not my concern nor purview.

           Stan jumps to his feet.

                                 STAN
                        This is a god damn witchhunt.  I’m 
                        bein’ made a scapegoat here.
                                 DOCHERTY
                        You’re dismissed, Sergeant.  Be 
                        sure to leave your gear at the 
                        quartermaster’s office.

           Stan storms out.  Josie starts to rise but--

                                 DOCHERTY
                        Josie, wait a moment.  I want to 
                        talk to you.

           Josie sits back down.  Docherty stands.  Rounds the desk.

                                 DOCHERTY
                        You know this coulda all been a lot 
                        worse for you.

                                 JOSIE
                        I know.  I appreciate it, Tom.

           Docherty moves behind Josie.

                                 DOCHERTY
                        Do you?

                                 JOSIE
                        Of course.

           Docherty places a hand on her shoulder.

                                 DOCHERTY
                        How you gonna show it?

           Josie turns around in her seat.

                                 JOSIE
                        Pardon?

                                 DOCHERTY
                        Your appreciation.  How you gonna 
                        show it?

           Josie gets to her feet.  Puts the chair between them.

                                 JOSIE
                        Listen... ah, Tom... with Momma 
                        sick and all I’m not really ready 
                        to start up anything new...

           Docherty grinds his teeth.  Barely able to contain his fury.

                                 DOCHERTY
                        You know what, Josie--?

           Before he can finish he is interrupted by the sound of raised 
           voices in the adjacent office.
           The office door swings open and Priddis (Bernie’s lawyer) 
           storms in waving a piece of paper.  Docherty’s Secretary 
           follows a few steps behind.

                                 SECRETARY
                        I told you he’s in a meeting.

           The defense attorney slaps the piece of paper on Sheriff’s 
           desk.  Docherty looks down at it.

                                 DOCHERTY
                        What is it?

                                 PRIDDIS
                        Stay order.  Bernie Houle’s 
                        execution has been suspended.

           Josie tries to mask her stunned reaction.

                                 PRIDDIS
                        I want this circulated to every one 
                        of your trigger-happy deputies.  
                        Hunting season is over.

                                 DOCHERTY
                        We have no intention of killing 
                        Bernie Houle, Mr. Priddis.  Our only 
                        intention is to find him and turn 
                        him over to prison authorities.

                                 PRIDDIS
                        You can’t tell me those boys you 
                        got tramping around out there in 
                        the snow wouldn’t love an excuse to 
                        cut out the middle man?

                                 DOCHERTY
                        No one wants to see Houle dead more 
                        than me.  But I’m a man of the law 
                        and I intend to go about it right.
                              (to Josie and Priddis)
                        You both know where the door is.

           HOSPITAL CORRIDOR

           Stan walks along.  In one hand he holds a bouquet of two 
           dozen roses, wrapped in cellophane.

           In the other swings a maroon sports bag marked “GREAT FALLS 
           SKEET CLUB”.

           He approaches the reception counter where June searches 
           through the patient files.

           Stan winks at the RECEPTIONIST, holding a finger to his lips.  
           She smiles, nods.  He knocks on the counter.
                                 STAN
                        Excuse me, madam.  Got an arrest 
                        warrant here for June Gittany.

           June turns around, shocked.  Sees Stan.  Starts to laugh.

                                 STAN
                        Charge is being the most beautiful 
                        woman in the county.

           The Receptionist swoons.  June approaches him.

                                 JUNE
                        Stan?  What on god's green earth 
                        are you doing here?

                                 STAN
                        I’ve come to take you out to lunch.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                              (re: the flowers)
                        They’re beautiful!

           June, slightly baffled.

                                 JUNE
                        Honey, my break isn’t for another 
                        half an hour.

                                 STAN
                              (checks his watch)
                        Oh, really?  Darn it.  Musta got my 
                        times mixed up.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                              (to June)
                        I’m sure if you ask Sue she’ll let 
                        you off early.

                                 JUNE
                        Not if you seen the mood she’s in.

                                 STAN
                        Tell you what.  I’ll go for a little 
                        wander and come back in half an hour.

                                 JUNE
                        You sure?

                                 STAN
                        No problem.

           He blows June a kiss and strolls back down the hall.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        He’s one hell of a man.
                                 JUNE
                              (thoughtful)
                        Yes he is.

           A POCKET KNIFE PROBES A LOCK

           Stan has the roses jammed under the crook of his arm.  Petals 
           rain onto the floor.

           He forces the lock open.  Enters a closet.  Closes the door 
           marked AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY behind him.

           INSIDE THE CLOSET

           Medicine cabinets filled with supplies.  Stan scans the 
           shelves.  Moving along them methodically.

           Snatching up hypodermic needles, empty IV bags.  Shoving them 
           into his bag.

           HOSPITAL CORRIDOR

           June checks the rooms as she passes.  Checks her watch.

           INSIDE THE CLOSET

           Stan lifts and drops various vials from a neatly arranged 
           plastic tray.  Searching frantically.

           Lifts one out.  Stops.  Holds it in front of his face.

           WE SEE THE LABEL:  Pentobarbital.

           CLOSE ON ROSE PETALS ON THE FLOOR

           Outside the medical closet.  June’s shoes appear in frame.

           PAN UP to her confused face.  She reaches forward and opens 
           the door...

           Stan stands in front of the shelves.  Back to us.

                                 JUNE
                        Stan?  What’re you doing?

           ANGLE ON STAN.  Frozen.  Still holding the vial in front of 
           his chest, which June can’t see from her position.

           Can’t put it back.  Can’t shove it into his pocket.

           He lets the vial drop from his fingers and it lands inside 
           the bouquet of flowers.
           Stan turns around.  Shoots his wife an embarrassed grin.

                                 STAN
                        What am I doing?  I’ve gone and got 
                        myself lost that’s what I’m doing.

           June approaches him.

                                 JUNE
                        I spoke to Sue.  She decided to let 
                        me go early after all.

           She leans over the bouquet and kisses him.

                                 JUNE
                        You’re the sweetest thing.  What’s 
                        gotten into you?

           She takes the flowers.  He releases them reluctantly.

           HOSPITAL CORRIDOR

           As they exit the closet.  June heads right.

                                 STAN
                              (points left)
                        June, it’s this way.

                                 JUNE
                        Just gonna put these in some water.

                                 STAN
                        No!  Ah, don’t you want them at 
                        home?

                                 JUNE
                        I wanna show them off to the girls.

                                 STAN
                        Jesus Christ... honey, ah, it’s 
                        hard for me to admit this but...

           Stan rubs the back of his neck.

                                 JUNE
                        What is it?

                                 STAN
                        I kinda like flowers too, you know?  
                        It’d be nice to have some around 
                        the house.

           June lets out a surprised laugh.  She approaches her husband 
           and wraps her arm around him.
                                 JUNE
                        Well, you’re just a big old softie 
                        today, aren’t you?

           Stan nods, smiling awkwardly.

                                 JUNE
                        C’mon, then.  I’m starving.

           She takes his arm and they walk out.  Stan watching the 
           bouquet out of the corner of his eye.

           A HAND KNOCKS ON A DOOR

           After a moment the door opens revealing Josh.

                                 JOSH
                        Sheriff?

           REVERSE ON DOCHERTY.  Grim-faced.

                                 DOCHERTY
                        Hi, Josh.  Liza around?

                                 JOSH
                        She’s asleep upstairs.

           Josh notices that Docherty is squinting at something over his 
           shoulder.  He turns around.  It’s the bullethole in the wall.

                                 JOSH
                        Oh... I was cleaning my rifle the 
                        other day.  Didn’t realize it was 
                        loaded...

                                 DOCHERTY
                        That’s the kinda error that gets 
                        folks killed.

           Josh nods sheepishly.  Doesn’t have the energy to argue.

                                 JOSH
                        You want me to get her?

                                 DOCHERTY
                        Actually... it’s you I wanted to 
                        talk to.  I suspended the senior 
                        officer responsible for Houle’s 
                        escape.

                                 JOSH
                        Well... I guess that’s good news.  
                        You think I should tell her?

                                 DOCHERTY
                        That’s up to you.  You’re her 
                        fiance.
           Josh nods.

                                 DOCHERTY
                        There’s something else... you may 
                        wanna keep her away from the 
                        television for a little while...

           SIP ‘N DIP LOUNGE

           WE PAN AROUND the iconic Great Falls Tiki bar.

           Through a window behind the bar we can see women dressed as 
           mermaids swimming underwater in an indoor pool.

           By the bar, PIANO PAT (an institution in her own right) plays 
           “Sweet Caroline” on her keyboard.  Some patrons sing along.

           We find June and Stan in a booth nearby.  Heads bowed in 
           prayer.  Stan’s eye lingers on the bouquet by June’s elbow...

           THE VIAL OF PENTOBARBITAL still nestled amongst the rose 
           stalks.  Partially visible through the cellophane.

                                 JUNE
                        Lord, make us truly thankful for 
                        this food, so fresh and plentiful, 
                        and all of the other blessings in 
                        our life.  We just humble ourselves 
                        before you, Lord, and ask for your 
                        guidance and love.  I ask this in 
                        Jesus Christ's name, Amen. 

           June hungrily attacks a shrimp primavera.

           A teenage WAITRESS, barely visible through a thick layer of 
           foundation, approaches.

                                 WAITRESS
                        How’s everything going over here?

                                 JUNE
                        Grand, just grand.  I’m really 
                        being spoiled today.  My husband 
                        picked me up from work.  Bought me 
                        flowers, took me out to lunch.

                                 WAITRESS
                        Well, ain’t that sweet!

           She picks up the roses.

                                 WAITRESS
                        How’s about I put these in some 
                        water for ya?

           Stan snatches them back.
                                 STAN
                        No!

           June and the Waitress look bewildered.

                                 STAN
                        Uh, I mean.  Would you mind getting 
                        us some garlic bread first?

                                 WAITRESS
                        S-sure.  No problem.

           She heads back to the kitchen.

                                 JUNE
                        Stan, what’s going on?  You’re 
                        acting real owly today.

                                 STAN
                        Honey, I have to tell you something.  
                        Your hair... it’s a mess.

           June touches her hair.

                                 JUNE
                        It is?

                                 STAN
                        Now, you know that sort of stuff 
                        doesn’t bother me but I know you’d 
                        be upset if I didn’t say anything...

           June checks her reflection in the back of her spoon.

                                 JUNE
                        Looks okay to me.

                                 STAN
                        All the same... maybe you should 
                        take a look in a proper mirror.

           June sighs.  Drops her napkin on the table.

                                 JUNE
                        I’ll be right back.

           Stan waits until June is out of sight then snatches the roses.  
           Turns them upside down.  Tries to shake the vial loose.

           No good.  It’s stuck.  He reaches into the bouquet.  Sticks 
           himself on a thorn.

           The Waitress returns.  Stan elbow deep in the roses.

                                 WAITRESS
                              (“Here’s your fucking 
                               garlic bread, asshole”)
                        Here’s your garlic bread, sir.
           She drops it on the table with a look of loathing and leaves.

           Stan finally manages to extract the vial.  Shoves it into his 
           pocket just as June returns.

                                 JUNE
                        Honey, I don’t know what the hell 
                        you’re talking about.  My hair was 
                        just fine.

           Stan scratches his thinning hair.

                                 STAN
                        Huh.  Guess I don’t know fashion.

                                 JUNE
                        Hun, your hand is bleeding.

                                 STAN
                        It is?  Well, look at that.  
                        Must’ve caught myself on the 
                        cutlery.

           He stands up.

                                 STAN
                        Just gonna go clean myself up.  
                        I’ll be right back.

           He leaves.  June prods a fork at her shrimp primavera.  
           Utterly perplexed.  Appetite gone.

           RESTAURANT BATHROOM

           Stan runs water over his hand.  Sweating and sick from stress.

           Bloody water spirals around the basin.  We push in until our 
           view is consumed by the black void of the sink then FADE UP 
           ON...

           A LITTLE GIRL’S BEDROOM

           Shot from above like a dollhouse.  Young GIRL (6) asleep in 
           the bed.

           Suddenly, we hear a woman’s CRY.  Cut short by a gurgle.

           The GIRL stirs.  Sits up.

           GIRL’S POV:  Her bedroom door.  Slightly ajar.  Pale white 
           light outside.
           THE HALLWAY

           The Girl’s bare feet shuffle out of her bedroom.  Her breath 
           fogs in the cold air.

           She looks right:  THE FRONT DOOR.  Wide open.  Moonlight 
           streams in.  Reflected from the snow beyond.

           She looks left:  A FIGURE IN BLACK stands at the other end of 
           the hall.  Watching her.

           The breath catches in her throat.  A long beat.

           The Figure moves forward.  WE SEE THE GLINT OF A KNIFE.

           The Figure stops.  Towering over the child, who shivers in 
           the cold.  Knife inches from her throat.

           GIRL’S POV:  We see the figure’s face for the first time--

           BERNIE HOULE.  Much younger.  Staring ahead at the open door.  
           Expression blank.  Vacant.

           He transfers the knife to his other hand.

           Continues down the hallway.

           Closes the front door behind him.  Leaving...

           DARKNESS

           CLICK.  THE GIRL stands in a sliver of yellow light streaming 
           from the doorway of an en suite bathroom.

           Inside the bathroom we can see the partially obscured body of 
           a MAN in navy blue boxers.  Blood pooling on the floor.

           The Girl reaches into the bathroom and turns off the light.

           DARKNESS, THEN...

           CLICK.  A bedside lamps turns on.  The Girl climbs into bed.  
           Crawls across the white sheets.

           The BACK OF A WOMAN comes into frame.  Curled on her side.

           The little girl spoons the woman.  Resting her mouth on the 
           nape of her neck.

           She reaches down and pulls up the sheets which we see for the 
           first time are covered with blood.

           PUSH IN ON THE GIRL’S HAND.  Gripping the bloody sheets...

           The hand morphs.  Ages.  But the blood remains.
                                 JOSH (O.S.)
                        Liza?  Liza, wake up.

           WIDER shows Liza in bed.  Blood soaking the sheets near her 
           belly.  She stirs.  Feels the wetness.

           Sits up, confused.  Turns to Josh, who stands over her.  wide-
           eyed and terrified.

                                 DOCHERTY (PRE-LAP)
                        The stay’ll be dismissed.  Just a 
                        matter of time.  

           MONTANA STATE PRISON

           SHERIFF DOCHERTY and the WARDEN traipse across the gravel 
           exercise yard.  Guard towers and razor wire loom over them.

                                 DOCHERTY
                        Just want to make sure everything 
                        is ready once we catch this son of 
                        a bitch.

                                 WARDEN
                        We’ll be ready.  Gotta say, this 
                        whole business hasn’t made my job 
                        any easier.  Number of protesters 
                        we’re dealing with is doubling by 
                        the day.  They’re talking about 
                        bussing in folks from interstate if 
                        he’s recaptured.

                                 DOCHERTY
                        All the more reason to get things 
                        over with quickly once we get him.

           A SINGLE-WIDE TRAILER comes into frame.  Dirty corrugated 
           siding.  They climb the rickety steps leading to the door.

           Believe it or not, this is Montana’s execution chamber.

           INSIDE THE DEATH CHAMBER

           We take it all in:

           Montana State flag pinned to the fake wood panelling.  

           An inclined gurney at the head of the room.

           A dozen folding chairs make up the witness area.

           There is no glass between the witness area and the gurney, 
           only a three-foot-high barrier, like the bar in a courtroom.
           Our overwhelming feeling should be: this is tacky, this is 
           cheap, this is amateurish, and, most of all, this is no 
           better place to die than Stan’s cabin.

           Docherty and the Warden enter.  A GUARD mops the linoleum 
           tiles near the gurney.

                                 DOCHERTY
                        Missed a spot.

           The Guard turns, annoyed.  Smile cracks on his face.

                                 GUARD
                        Well I’ll be...

           He drops the mop and moves forward to shake Docherty’s hand.

                                 GUARD
                        How’re you doing Sheriff?

                                 DOCHERTY
                        Had better days.
                              (to the Warden)
                        Rick used to be one of my deputies--

                                 RICK [GUARD]
                        Until I saw the light.

           Docherty chuckles.

                                 RICK
                        Say... you mind if I have a quick 
                        word with you, Sheriff?

           Docherty looks at the Warden, who nods.

                                 WARDEN
                        Rick can show you around.  I’ll 
                        meet you back at the office.

           The Warden leaves.  Rick moves closer to Docherty.  Murmurs:

                                 RICK
                        Wanted to ask you how Stan’s doin’?

                                 DOCHERTY
                        Stan?  Well as can be expected, I 
                        suppose.

                                 RICK
                        He seems real broken up about all 
                        this.  Called me up the other 
                        night.  Asked me all sorts of 
                        questions about the execution.  How 
                        we’re gonna do it.  What drugs 
                        we’re gonna use.  How long it’d 
                        take him to die.
                                 DOCHERTY
                        That right?

                                 RICK
                        In my experience, a man starts 
                        asking questions like that you get 
                        to worryin’...

                                 DOCHERTY
                        How’s that?

           Rick leans in.  Whispers:

                                 RICK
                        Since I started working here 
                        there’s been two suicides.

           Docherty frowns.

                                 DOCHERTY
                        You think Stan is...

                                 RICK
                        Dunno.  Maybe.  Maybe not.  Lot 
                        easier to face death when you know 
                        what it looks like, if you know 
                        what I mean.

           On Docherty, pondering this.

                                 DOCHERTY
                        I’ll keep an eye on him.

           HOSPITAL CORRIDOR

           Josh paces back and forth.  Sick with worry.

           June emerges from a nearby set of swinging doors.

                                 JUNE
                        Mr. Toohey?

                                 JOSH
                              (unhappy smile)
                        It’s Bewick, actually.  We aren’t 
                        married yet.

                                 JUNE
                        We’ve run an ultrasound and she’s 
                        suffered a placental abruption.  
                        The baby’s oxygen levels are a 
                        little low so the doctor’s decided 
                        the best course of action is to 
                        undertake an immediate c-section.

                                 JOSH
                        Whatever you need to do.
           Josh presses his hand to his brow.  Lets out a soft moan.

           June reaches out.  Touches his shoulder.

                                 JUNE
                        She’s going to be okay.

           Josh shakes his head.  His thoughts suddenly gush out:

                                 JOSH
                        This is all my fault.  She’s been 
                        under so much stress lately... I’ve 
                        done nothing but made it all worse.  
                        The man who killed her parents 
                        escapes prison and all I can think 
                        of is myself.

           June’s heart drops.

                                 JOSH
                        Sheriff came round last night to 
                        tell me the officer that let him 
                        get away was suspended and I 
                        thought she’d take it as good news 
                        but she just flew off the handle--

           Josh finally notices June’s dismayed expression.

                                 JOSH
                        I’m sorry.  I shouldn’t even be 
                        talking about this.  My mouth goes 
                        on autopilot sometimes.

                                 JUNE
                        No... it’s okay.  Sometimes it’s 
                        good to let this stuff out.  I had 
                        no idea she was... she was under so 
                        much strain.

           Josh rubs his burning eyes.

                                 JUNE
                        You must be tired.  I’ll see if I 
                        can find you an empty bed so’s you 
                        can lie down an hour or two.

           Josh nods.  June leaves.  Face contorted with guilt.

           JOSIE’S CAR

           Josie presses her phone to her ear.  Tapping a rolled-up 
           dollar bill on her knee.

                                 JOSIE
                              (into the phone)
                        Stan, it’s me.  We need to talk.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 JOSIE (CONT'D)
                        Something important’s come up.  
                        Call me back.

           Josie ends the call.  Wipes away remnants of blue dust from 
           the center console.

           JOSIE’S HOUSE

           Josie enters.  Stands in the entrance hall.

                                 JOSIE
                        Hello?

           PULL BACK: The house has been completely trashed.

           Josie’s feet move through the debris:

           Torn photos.  Smashed tableware.  Upended furniture.  The 
           fringes on the rug have been completely cut off.

           PAULA sleeps on the couch.  Clutching a gaudy 1988 Calgary 
           Winter Olympics pillow to her chest.

           Josie examines her mother’s serene face, then reaches down 
           and takes the pillow.  Her mother wakes.

                                 PAULA
                        Oh, there you are.  What time is it?

                                 JOSIE
                        What’d you do?

                                 PAULA
                        What?

                                 JOSIE
                        What’d you do to the house?

                                 PAULA
                        I don’t know what the hell you’re 
                        talking about.

                                 JOSIE
                        You don’t?

                                 PAULA
                        I’m gant.  You gonna make dinner or 
                        should I?

                                 JOSIE
                              (flatly)
                        You haven’t made dinner for four 
                        years.  You’ve forgotten how.

           Paula tuts, exasperated.
                                 PAULA
                        If you’re gonna act like this you 
                        can just leave me alone.

                                 JOSIE
                        I can’t, Ma.  Don’t you see?  
                        That’s the problem.  I can’t leave 
                        you alone.

                                 PAULA
                        Josie, you’re being ridiculous.  
                        You need to grow up and take some 
                        responsibility for your own 
                        problems and stop blaming 
                        everything on me.

           Josie looks down at the pillow in her hands.  Then her 
           mother’s face.  

           Weak.  Defiant.  An infuriating combination.

           JOSIE JAMS THE PILLOW DOWN OVER HER MOTHER’S FACE.

           Eyes blank with disbelief and exhilaration.

           She suffocates her mother, who claws at at her arms.  Drawing 
           blood.

           Is this a dream?  This can’t be real...

           Josie looks down at the thin, bony fingers wrapped around her 
           bloody wrists and...

                                 JOSIE
                        Die!  Just die already!

           Presses down harder.  Neck pulsing with effort.  Her mother’s 
           body bucks and spasms.

           Oh God, it’s real.  This is really happening...

           Letting out a sudden moan of horror, Josie rips the pillow 
           away.  Throws it aside.

           She runs from the room as Paula sits up, red-faced.  Coughing 
           and spluttering.  Her hair tangled chaos.

                                 PAULA
                        You god damn bitch!  Are you 
                        fucking crazy?  Get back here!

           Josie runs down the hall and into the...

           BATHROOM

           Slams the door behind her.  Locking it.  Her mother still 
           yells out after her.
           Josie races for the medicine cabinet.  Rips it open.  Pulls 
           out her pills.  Dumps them into the toilet.

           Flushes them away.  Watching them swirl down the drain in a 
           blue whirlpool.

           Suddenly, there is total silence.  Josie breathes heavily.  
           Adrenalin dissipating.  Then...

           HER CELL PHONE RINGS.  She answers.  Listens...

                                 STAN (V.O.)
                        Josie?  I got the stuff.  
                        Everything’s ready...

           She opens her mouth.  Can’t speak.

                                 STAN (V.O.)
                        Josie?  Can you hear me?

                                 JOSIE
                        I... I been trying to call you... 
                        we need to--

                                 STAN
                        Not over the phone.  You know where 
                        to meet me?

                                 JOSIE
                              (a beat)
                        Yeah.

                                 STAN
                        Seven o’clock.

           Josie listens to him hang up.  Exits the bathroom into the...

           HALLWAY

           Paula shuffles towards her.  Face placid.  Hair still messy.

                                 PAULA
                        Sweetie, you gonna make dinner or 
                        should I?

           Josie stares at her mother.  She clearly has no memory of 
           what just happened between them and it’s horrifying.

                                 JOSIE
                        I’ll make you something, Ma.

           She takes her mother by her arm.  Leads her into the kitchen.

           THE MAROON SKEET CLUB SPORTS BAG

           Sitting on a bed.  Stuffed with medical equipment.
           A pair of hands reach into frame and zip it up.

           HALLWAY

           Stan carries the sports bag towards the front door.  It opens 
           before he reaches it.

           June steps inside.  Sees Stan.  He stops.  Caught.

                                 STAN
                        Thought you had a double shift?

                                 JUNE
                        I wasn’t feeling good.

                                 STAN
                        Oh?  That’s too bad.

           June turns around and closes the door behind her.  Presses 
           her back to it.

                                 JUNE
                        They brought that Toohey girl in to 
                        the hospital today.  I couldn’t 
                        face her... I couldn’t help but 
                        feel... guilty.

                                 STAN
                        You’ve got nothing to feel guilty 
                        about.

           June clocks the bag in Stan’s hand.

                                 JUNE
                        You going out?

                                 STAN
                        Yeah... just got called in.

           Stan reaches past her for the door handle.  She doesn’t move.

                                 JUNE
                        Why?  Ain’t you suspended?

           Stan stops.  Raises his eyes to meet his wife’s.  Unable to 
           muster a denial.

                                 JUNE
                        You haven’t bought me flowers for 
                        twenty-five years, then you show up 
                        at my work with a buck ninety eight 
                        bunch of roses.
                              (beat)
                        What going on, Stan?
                                 STAN
                        I’ve... had a lot of stuff on my 
                        mind lately.  Needed some time to 
                        think.  With all this stuff that’s 
                        happened, it’s got me thinking... 
                        how lucky I am to have you.  How 
                        good our life is together.

                                 JUNE
                        Is that right?

                                 STAN
                        It’s the God’s honest truth.

                                 JUNE
                        Then tell me what’s in the bag.

                                 STAN
                        Nothing.  I told you.  Work stuff.

                                 JUNE
                        Show me.

                                 STAN
                        I ain’t got time for this.

           He grabs the door handle.  June reaches forward and takes 
           hold of the bag strap.

           Stan pulls his wife’s hand free.  She slaps him across the 
           cheek.  He presses his hand to it, wincing in pain.

                                 STAN
                        June, you’re acting crazy.

                                 JUNE
                        What were you doing in that closet 
                        today, Stan?  Were you getting 
                        something for Josie?  You told me 
                        she had a problem and you two been 
                        whispering on the phone non-stop 
                        the past coupla days...

           He turns away but she grabs his arm, wrenching him back.  
           Voice raised with anger:

                                 JUNE
                        I wanna know just what the hell you 
                        think you’re doing.

           He glares at his wife, then shakes his arm free.  Opens the 
           door and steps out onto the porch.

                                 STAN
                        I’ll be back later.  We can talk 
                        then.
           He pulls the door closed behind him.  June stands alone in 
           the hall.  Fuming.  Shell-shocked.

           CAR WINDSHIELD POV SHOT

           Stan heads down the steps of his house.

           PULL BACK:  Sheriff Docherty watches Stan climb into his blue 
           Chevy Silverado.

           Starts up his engine.  Tails him down the street.

           HIGHWAY

           The sun sets, shimmering through the trees, glistening from 
           the snow.

           Docherty hangs a quarter mile back from the Stan’s truck.  
           Just keeping him in sight.

           The Silverado disappears over a crest up ahead.  Docherty 
           rises over the same crest but...

           Stan’s truck isn’t visible.

           Docherty speeds up a little and takes the tight curve ahead, 
           revealing the next stretch of road...

           A long straight portion of highway: empty.

           Docherty presses down hard on the gas.  Brings the car up to 
           90 miles an hour.

           Scans the treeline left and right.  Shielding his eyes from 
           the sun.

           OUTSIDE STAN’S CABIN

           The sun sinks as the Silverado pulls up out front.  

           Stan steps out of his truck.  Josie and Kyle emerge from the 
           front door.

                                 KYLE
                        We got a big problem.

                                 JOSIE
                        There’s been a stay.  Houle’s 
                        execution has been postponed.

           Stan thinks a moment, then...

                                 STAN
                        So what?
                                 JOSIE
                        We can’t do it if they aren’t gonna 
                        do it.

                                 STAN
                        Oh, c’mon!  They’re gonna do it.  
                        This is just lawyer tricks.  No man’s 
                        ever come back from this close.

                                 KYLE
                        Same day, same time, same method.  
                        That’s what you said.  That’s what 
                        we agreed.

                                 STAN
                        Yeah?  Well that was before your 
                        fucking sister here decided to sell 
                        me down the river to the Sheriff.

                                 KYLE
                        What’s he talkin’ about?

           Before she can respond, Josie hears something.  Looks out at 
           the surrounding trees.

           IN THE DISTANCE:  Two headlights bounce across the rough 
           terrain towards the cabin.

           Stan turns.  Eyes wide with horror.

                                 KYLE
                        Who the hell is that?

                                 JOSIE
                        Were you followed?

                                 STAN
                        I don’t think so.

           Stan spins back to them.

                                 STAN
                        Get inside.  I’ll get rid of ‘em.

                                 KYLE
                        What about my truck?

                                 JOSIE
                        We ain’t got time to move it.

                                 STAN
                        Get inside.  Quick.

           They make for the cabin.  Close the door behind them.

           Stan moves up onto the porch and turns around.  Awaits the 
           car’s approach.
           INSIDE THE CABIN

           Josie looks at Bernie who notices the panic in her eyes.

                                 BERNIE
                        What’s going on?

                                 JOSIE
                              (to Kyle)
                        You got something to gag him?

                                 KYLE
                        Gag him?

                                 JOSIE
                        We need to keep him quiet.  What if 
                        he yells out?

           Kyle moves over to Bernie.

                                 KYLE
                        You ain’t gonna holler, are you?

           Bernie shakes his head.

                                 JOSIE
                        Kyle!

                                 KYLE
                        Whatta you want me to do?

                                 JOSIE
                        Hold his mouth.

           Kyle slides down the wall next to Bernie.  Puts his arm 
           around him and clamps a hand over his mouth.

                                 KYLE
                              (murmuring)
                        Sorry.

           Bernie nods - it’s okay.

           Josie moves over to the door.  Kneels in front of it.  
           Listens to the engine of the approaching car.

           OUTSIDE THE CABIN

           Docherty’s car pulls up.  It sits idling for a moment.

           Stan takes a swig from a hipflask.  Staring at the tinted 
           windows.  Steeling himself.

           Docherty kills the engine.  Emerges from the car and scans 
           the scene.  Taking particular note of Kyle’s truck.
                                 DOCHERTY
                        Stan?  How you doing?

                                 STAN
                        What’re you doing here, Tom?

                                 DOCHERTY
                        Just paying a visit.

                                 STAN
                        You following me?

                                 DOCHERTY
                        Not following.  Just concerned for 
                        your welfare.

                                 STAN
                        You suspended me, remember?  I’m 
                        not your concern nor purview no 
                        more.

           Stan takes another swig of whiskey.

                                 DOCHERTY
                        You driving drunk?

                                 STAN
                        Ain’t driving, ain’t drunk.

                                 DOCHERTY
                        I spoke to Rick down at Deer 
                        Lodge... he was worried about you.

           Stan flinches.

                                 STAN
                        I’m fine.

                                 DOCHERTY
                        Whose truck is that?

           Stan looks over at Kyle’s truck.

                                 STAN
                        Friend of mine.

           INSIDE THE CABIN

           Josie watches through a notch in the door.  Listening to the 
           conversation:

                                 DOCHERTY (O.S.)
                        That’s Kyle Deumann’s truck, ain’t 
                        it?

                                 STAN (O.S.)
                        Does it matter?
                                 DOCHERTY (O.S.)
                        Didn’t know you and Kyle were close.

           OUTSIDE THE CABIN

           The conversation continues:

                                 STAN
                        You need to be close to park your 
                        truck on another man’s land?

                                 DOCHERTY
                        I guess not.

           Docherty runs his boot across the icy dirt.

                                 DOCHERTY
                        Awfully cold out here.  You gonna 
                        invite me in?

                                 STAN
                        I don’t think so.

                                 DOCHERTY
                        How’s about we strike a deal?  You 
                        let me come inside, we have a quick 
                        drink and I’ll be on my way.

           BACK TO JOSIE

           Panicking.  She looks around the cabin.

           Windows run along the sides.  If they tried to use them 
           Docherty would see from his vantage point.

           Fireplace at the back.  No windows.

           Josie looks down at her muddy boots.  An idea.

           She yanks them off.  Starts unbuttoning her shirt...

           ANGLE ON KYLE.  Hand still pressed across Bernie’s mouth.

                                 KYLE
                              (hissing)
                        What the hell you doing?

           Josie ignores him.  Unbuckles her belt.

           OUTSIDE THE CABIN

           Docherty takes a few steps forward.
                                 DOCHERTY
                        C’mon.  Let’s go inside.  It’s 
                        getting dark.

           Stan moves to block his path.  Holds up a hand.

                                 STAN
                        Stop right there, Tom.  N-now you 
                        listen here... a man’s got a right 
                        to his privacy.

           Docherty keeps approaching slowly.

                                 DOCHERTY
                        Course he does.  But I got an 
                        obligation to the mental health of 
                        my staff.

                                 STAN
                        You saying I’m crazy?

           Docherty stops a couple of feet short.  Hand resting on the 
           butt of his gun.

                                 DOCHERTY
                        I’m saying I ain’t leaving until I 
                        get a look in that cabin.

                                 STAN
                        I’m afraid I can’t let you do that.

                                 DOCHERTY
                        You hidin’ something from me, 
                        Sergeant?

           Stan’s stony facade cracks as he descends into a visible 
           state of fear.

                                 STAN
                        You don’t want to look in there...

                                 DOCHERTY
                        Tell me why not.

                                 STAN
                        Because... because...

           Before he can answer the cabin door opens and Josie slips 
           outside and closes the door behind her.

           She’s wearing nothing but a white singlet and underwear.  
           Blanket wrapped around her shoulders.

           Docherty watches her long creamy legs as she glides forward.  
           His understanding growing with each step.

           Josie wraps an arm around Stan’s waist.  Stan cottons on.  
           Drapes his arm across her shoulder.
                                 STAN
                        So... now you know.

           Docherty glares at Josie with revulsion.

                                 STAN
                        I tried to warn you: a man needs 
                        his privacy.

                                 DOCHERTY
                              (to Josie)
                        No time to start something new, huh?

                                 JOSIE
                        Sorry you had to find out this way.

           INSIDE THE CABIN

           Kyle and Bernie strain to hear.  They lock eyes.

           Kyle loosens his grip.  Gently lifts his hand away from 
           Bernie’s mouth.

           Bernie nods with appreciation.  Doesn’t yell out.

           OUTSIDE THE CABIN

           Docherty turns back to Kyle’s truck.  Its presence now making 
           sense.

                                 STAN
                        We were trying to be discrete about 
                        this.  Trying to keep people from 
                        getting hurt.

           Docherty puts his hat back on his head and tramps back 
           towards his car.

           Josie steps forward and calls out after him:

                                 JOSIE
                        We’d appreciate it if you kept this 
                        to yourself, Tom.

           Docherty opens his car door.  Spits back:

                                 DOCHERTY
                        It’s Sheriff, Deputy.

           He climbs inside and slams his door.

           Starts his engine with a ROAR.  Reverses back down the road 
           at speed.  U-turns with a rooster tail of snow-slush.

           Josie and Stan watch his taillights retreating through the 
           forest.  Josie lets out a shiver of relief.
           Stan turns to her.  Eyes hard.

                                 STAN
                        We do it tonight.  Midnight.

           HOSPITAL CORRIDOR

           Josh walks along the corridor.  Stops outside a glass door.

           JOSH’S POV:  Liza lies in a bed.  Watching the television 
           above her bed.  Cradling a baby in her arms.  

           She sees Josh watching.  He smiles at her.  The smile isn’t 
           returned.

           Josh enters the room.  Sees what is on the television:

           SCOTT PRIDDIS being interviewed outside the courthouse.

                                 PRIDDIS (ON TV)
                        Regardless of his current status, 
                        Bernie Houle is to be afforded the 
                        same rights as every death row 
                        inmate and that includes his 
                        ongoing appeals process--

           Liza snaps off the television.  Glares at Josh.  An agonizing 
           beat of silence.

                                 JOSH
                        Liza...

                                 LIZA
                        You knew.

           Josh’s head dips.  An admission.  He watches his infant son.  
           Blubbing on his mother’s chest.

                                 LIZA
                        I want to call him Edward.  After 
                        Dad.

                                 JOSH
                        Of course.

                                 LIZA
                        And I want him to be there.  When 
                        they do it.

                                 JOSH
                        Liza, no...

                                 LIZA
                        This ain’t your call.
                                 JOSH
                        You want that to be one of his 
                        first experiences of the world?

                                 LIZA
                        I want to be able to tell him.  
                        When he asks why he doesn’t have a 
                        grandpa or a grandma like all the 
                        other kids.  I want to be able to 
                        tell him that he was there when 
                        they did it.

                                 JOSH
                        You of all people should know the 
                        world is ugly enough as it is...

                                 LIZA
                        So you admit it, huh?  You think 
                        it’s ugly?

                                 JOSH
                        I think... I don’t know what I 
                        think anymore...

           STAN’S CABIN

           Stan sits on the couch.  Josie next to him.

           Kyle sits against the wall next to Bernie.

           All staring into space.  Waiting.

           The GRANDFATHER CLOCK suddenly begins to chime causing them 
           all to jump.  Marks eleven o’clock.

           Stan takes a swig from his hipflask.  Drunk.

                                 KYLE
                        I don’t think you should drink 
                        anymore.

                                 STAN
                        I ain’t had much.

                                 JOSIE
                        I agree with Kyle.

           They exchange a look.  Josie, deadly serious.

                                 STAN
                        Alright, alright.  You god damn 
                        Deumanns.

           Stan screws the cap back on the flask.  A long silence.  Taps 
           his knee.  Can’t bear it for long.
                                 STAN
                        I was there the day your dad died, 
                        you know?

           Josie turns to him.

                                 JOSIE
                        I don’t wanna talk about that.

                                 STAN
                        I’m talking to your brother.

           He turns back to Kyle, who clearly wants to hear more.

                                 STAN
                        Was only on my second year.  First 
                        man I ever saw die.  Seen two more 
                        since.  Never had to kill a man 
                        myself.

           He catches Bernie’s eye.  Averts his gaze.

                                 KYLE
                        What happened?

                                 JOSIE
                        We know what happened, don’t we?  
                        He tried to rob a bank and got 
                        himself killed for it.  He lost his 
                        job and went crazy.  Knowing the 
                        particulars isn’t gonna help.

                                 STAN
                        Didn’t seem crazy to me.  He was 
                        real calm.  Real cool about it.  
                        Like dying wasn’t even an option.  
                        Right up to the end.  That was what 
                        bothered me about it.  The 
                        casualness of it all.  The ease of 
                        it.  How it all could come down to 
                        a fraction of a--

                                 BERNIE
                        I promise I won’t say nothing.

           They all turn to him.

                                 BERNIE
                        If you turn me over.  I won’t say a 
                        word.  I swear it.

           Kyle stares at Bernie for a long beat.  Turns to the others.

                                 KYLE
                        I believe him.

                                 JOSIE
                        Me too.
           Stan shakes his head.

                                 STAN
                        It’s not about believing or not 
                        believing.  They’re gonna wanna 
                        know how he survived those freezing 
                        nights.  Who helped him out.  What 
                        happened out there on that 
                        roadside.  They’ll get it out of 
                        him.  That’s their job.  They got 
                        his confession once.  They’ll do it 
                        again.  We can’t afford to take 
                        that risk.  Not now we’re so close.

           He turns to Bernie.

                                 STAN
                        I’m sorry but that’s the way it’s 
                        been from the start and nothing’s 
                        changed since.

           A POWDER BLUE BEDSHEET

           Lies across the dining table.  Fireplace blazing behind it.

           On it lies an IV catheter.  Tourniquet.  Tape.  Gauze.  
           Extension tubing.  3ml bottle of saline.

           CLOSE ON three vials as Stan carefully places them one at a 
           time on the table:

           SODIUM PENTOTHAL.  PANCURONIUM BROMIDE.  PENTOBARBITAL.

           Kyle unlocks Bernie’s handcuffs.  Leads him over to the 
           dining table.

           Bernie hesitates.  Then climbs onto it.  Lies down flat.

           Stan turns to Kyle and Josie.

                                 STAN
                        You two’re gonna need to hold him 
                        steady.

           They exchange a look then move forward and each take hold of 
           Bernie’s wrists.

           Stan lifts the IV catheter.

                                 BERNIE
                        You know what you’re doing?

           Stan puts the needle back down.  His face already glazed in a 
           nervous sweat.

           He reaches into his pocket and pulls out a piece of paper.  
           The notes from his telephone conversation with Rick.
           He unfolds it on the table, smoothing it out.  Passes the 
           rubber tourniquet to Josie.

                                 STAN
                        Round his bicep.

           Josie hesitates, then ties it on.

           Stan leans down to check the veins inside the crook of 
           Bernie’s elbow.  Breathing hard.  Swallows.

                                 STAN
                        Okay.  Okay.  I’m going to 
                        sterilize the area.

           He reaches for a bottle of cleansing solution.

                                 BERNIE
                        Why bother?

           Stan ignores him and applies the solution to a pad.  Rubs the 
           inside of Bernie’s elbow.

           He leans in again.  Having difficulty seeing Bernie’s veins.

                                 KYLE
                        You okay?

                                 STAN
                        I’m fine.

           He looks over at Bernie.

                                 STAN
                        You ready?

                                 BERNIE
                        Can I ask something first?

           Stan seems relieved at the potential delay.  Nods.

                                 BERNIE
                        You reckon you could turn on some 
                        music?

           Stan looks at Josie and Kyle.  Shrugs.

           Kyle lets go of Bernie’s wrist and moves over to a paint-
           speckled radio on the kitchenette bench.  Flicks it on.

           SISTER GOLDEN HAIR by America plays and continues over...

           THE IV NEEDLE

           Hovering.  Trembling in the air.
           It comes down and pierces Bernie’s flesh.  There are already 
           two other bleeding pinpricks from failed attempts.

                      “Well I tried to make it Sunday but I got so damn 
                                        depressed...”

                                 STAN
                        Fuck!

                                 KYLE
                        Jesus, you missed again?

                                 STAN
                        It’s not my fault!  His veins are 
                        shot to shit.

                                 JOSIE
                        You can’t keep sticking him like 
                        that.

                                 BERNIE
                        If you let me sit up on my side I 
                        can help you.

                                 KYLE
                        This is bullshit, man.  This is 
                        messed up.  You don’t know what the 
                        fuck you’re doing.

                                 STAN
                        Shut up!  All of you!  I can do 
                        this...

           He wipes away the blood from Bernie’s elbow and brings the 
           needle level with the skin.

                 “And I just can’t live without you, can’t you see it in my 
                                          eyes..?”

                                 STAN
                        Don’t think I’m going deep enough.

                                 JOSIE
                        Be careful.

                                 STAN
                        What do you think I’m doing?

                                 BERNIE
                        Wait.

           Houle starts pumping his fist to make his vein more 
           prominent.

           Josie feels Bernie’s muscles tightening through his skin.  
           Sick to her stomach.

           Stan plunges the needle back through Bernie’s skin.
           Frothy ruby red blood gushes from the extension tube, 
           spilling onto the bedsheet.

           Stan recoils, accidentally knocking the needle loose.

           Blood spurts forth in a heartbeat rhythm, streaming from the 
           puncture wound.

                                 KYLE
                        Holy shit.

                                 JOSIE
                        Jesus Christ, Stan.  Is that 
                        normal?

           Bernie lifts his head and checks it.

                                 BERNIE
                        You hit an artery, I think.

                                 JOSIE
                        This is pathetic.  This is amateur 
                        hour!

           Stan tosses a medical pad over to Josie.

                                 STAN
                        Hold this over.  I’m gonna try the 
                        other arm.

           He moves around the table as Josie tries to stem the 
           bleeding.

           Kyle steps in Stan’s path and holds up a forearm.

                                 KYLE
                        No.

                                 STAN
                        What the hell’re you doing?  Get 
                        outta my way, Kyle.

                                 KYLE
                        I ain’t gonna let you keep stickin’ 
                        him like that.  This is over.

                                 JOSIE
                        He’s right.  We can’t do this.  It’s 
                        crazy we even thought we could.

                                 STAN
                        You’re both out of your minds.  Do 
                        you know how close we are?  I’m not 
                        stopping because you two get a little 
                        squeamish at the sight of some blood.  
                        This ain’t even close to what he did 
                        to those poor Toohey folks.
                                 KYLE
                        We’re both saying no, right Josie?  
                        You’re outvoted.

                                 STAN
                        Well, too bad this ain’t a fucking 
                        democracy.  Now get out of my way.

                                 KYLE
                        I’m not gonna let you.

                                 STAN
                        Step back.

           Stan tries to shove him aside.  Kyle swings a punch at Stan, 
           clipping his ear.

           Stan clutches his ear.

                                 STAN
                        You god damn son of a bitch.

           He grabs Kyle’s shirtfront.  Kyle twists away.

                                 JOSIE
                        Hey, stop that!

           Stan stumbles over Kyle’s leg.  Regains his balance.

           The two men grapple, trying to loosen the other’s grip.

           Kyle shoves Stan backwards with all his might.  His shirt 
           tears and Stan staggers backwards.  Twisting around...

           Feet tangling in the strap of the maroon sport bag as he 
           tumbles and...

           SMASHES HIS HEAD ON EDGE OF THE FIREPLACE WITH A SICKENING 
           CRACK THEN...

           Falls down into the roaring flames, which spurts a stream of 
           glowing embers across the cabin floor.

           He lies face down in the blaze.  Unconscious.  Not moving.  
           Kyle stares, slack-jawed.  Total disbelief.

                                 JOSIE
                        Jesus!

           She rushes forward and grabs hold of Stan’s leg.  Pulls him 
           back.  He’s too heavy.

                                 JOSIE
                        Kyle.  Help me.

           Kyle moves forward and grabs Stan’s other leg.  They pull him 
           back.  Smearing smouldering ash and kindle across the floor.
           Josie drops to her knees and pats out the flames.  Rolling 
           Stan over...

           SKIN FLAYS AWAY FROM HIS FACE LIKE POTATO PEELS.

           He chokes on black ash.  Gurgling.  Half-cauterized wound on 
           his forehead streams blood.  White bone visible beneath.

           It’s a horrific sight.  Kyle and Josie react, recoiling.

           Stan tries to speak, but it comes out as a garbled protest 
           and suddenly, just as SISTER GOLDEN HAIR ends...

           He falls silent.  The ANNOUNCER’S VOICE COMES ON THE RADIO.

                                 ANNOUNCER (V.O.)
                        That was a special request from 
                        Robert out in Fort Benton...

           JOSIE reaches forward.  Presses her fingers to Stan’s wrist.  
           Withdraws her hand.  Brings it up to her head.

                                 JOSIE
                        Oh, god.  He’s dead... Jesus 
                        Christ, Kyle.  You killed him.

                                 KYLE
                        I--I didn’t... it was an 
                        accident... he tripped...  You saw 
                        it.  You both saw it.

           Kyle turns to Bernie, who sits on the edge of the table.  
           Holding the pad over his bleeding arm.  Staring wide-eyed at 
           Stan’s charred corpse.

                                 KYLE
                        You saw it, didn’t you?  Bernie?

           Bernie looks over at him.

                                 BERNIE
                        You didn’t mean it.

           DOCHERTY’S CAR

           Docherty drives through the night.  Taking his frustration 
           out on the gas pedal.  Knuckles white on the wheel.

           His phone buzzes.  He reaches into his pocket and answers.

                                 DOCHERTY
                        Yeah.

                                 JUNE (V.O.)
                        Hello?  This is June.  June Gittany.
           INTERCUT JUNE.  On the phone, in her pyjamas.  Looking at the 
           clock on the wall which reads just after one at night.

                                 DOCHERTY
                        June?  What’s going on?

                                 JUNE
                        Tom, it’s Stan... we had a fight 
                        and he hasn’t come home.  I’ve been 
                        trying his phone for the last two 
                        hours and he’s not answering.

           Docherty thinks a moment, lip curled with bitterness.

                                 DOCHERTY
                        June... I, uh... I hate to be the one 
                        to tell you this but I think you 
                        should know... I’ve found out 
                        recently that he and Josie have 
                        been... you know.  Seeing each other.

           June reels with shock.  Almost dropping the phone.

                                 JUNE
                        Are you crazy?  Stan?  He... he 
                        wouldn’t do that...

                                 DOCHERTY
                        Afraid I saw it for myself.  
                        Followed them up to that cabin he 
                        has.  I’m sorry you had to find out 
                        this way, June.  You’re a good 
                        woman and deserve better than what 
                        you’re getting.

           June stays silent.  Gazing off into space.

                                 DOCHERTY
                        I’ll tell you what... I’ll put an 
                        APB out on his car.  If someone 
                        spots him, I’ll let you know.

                                 JUNE
                        Okay... thank you...

           Docherty hangs up.

           END INTERCUT.

           June’s hand still rests on the phone.  Dazed.  And then...

           SHE RIPS THE PHONE TABLE AWAY FROM THE WALL AND HURLS IT 
           ACROSS THE ROOM.

           She whirlwinds around the room, screaming with impotent rage.  
           An eruption of explosive, bottled-up anger.
           Snatching family portraits from the walls.  Smashing them to 
           the ground.

           Tipping over furniture.  Sweeping ornaments from the mantle.

           June stands in the center of the room.  Scanning the 
           aftermath of her destruction.

           Her eyes finally land on: HER CAR KEYS.

           Lying on the floor next to the roses Stan bought her.

           She moves over to them.  Snatches them up.  Heads for the 
           front door.

           OUTSIDE JOSIE’S HOUSE

           Josie escorts Bernie towards the front door, scanning the 
           surrounding houses.  It’s late and all is still.

           Behind her Kyle lingers near Stan’s truck.  Josie turns:

                                 JOSIE
                        You coming?

                                 KYLE
                        Maybe I’ll wait out here.

           Josie stops.  Bites her lip.

                                 JOSIE
                        She’s not the same person anymore, 
                        Kyle.  She don’t remember... she 
                        don’t remember anything...

           Kyle wavers and then follows.

           JOSIE’S HOUSE

           The front door swings in and Bernie, Kyle and Josie enter.  
           The latter flicks on the light.

           WIDER.  The destruction we saw earlier has been mostly 
           cleared away.

           Josie leads Bernie over to the couch.  Motions for him to sit.

           Kyle scrutinizes the house.  It’s clear that he hasn’t been 
           here for a long, long time.

           Josie moves over to Kyle.  Whispers:

                                 JOSIE
                        What’re we gonna do?
                                 KYLE
                        I can’t kill him, Josie.  I just 
                        can’t.

                                 PAULA (O.S.)
                        Josie?

           They turn.  Paula stands in the doorway, wearing a nightgown.

                                 JOSIE
                        Hey, Ma.

           Paula’s eyes move from Kyle to Bernie, who holds the Calgary 
           Olympics pillow on his lap.

                                 PAULA
                        Who’s that?

                                 JOSIE
                        This’s just a friend of ours.  
                        Bernie.

                                 PAULA
                        Not him.  Him.

           She points at Kyle.  Josie balks, then stammers:

                                 JOSIE
                        Uh... t-that’s your--

                                 KYLE
                        I’m just a friend, too.

                                 PAULA
                        Bit late to be bringing friends 
                        over, don’t ya think?

           Josie doesn’t answer.  Paula moves over to Bernie.

                                 PAULA
                        You look familiar.  We met before?

                                 BERNIE
                        Don’t think so, Ma'am.

           She sits down on the couch.

                                 PAULA
                        Sure I’ve seen your face somewhere 
                        before...

           She sees the pillow in Bernie’s hand.

                                 PAULA
                        You like that?  Got that the first 
                        time my husband took me overseas.  
                        You ever been?
                                 BERNIE
                        To Canada?  No, ma'am, can’t say I 
                        have.

                                 PAULA
                        Oh, it’s a wonderful country.  So 
                        clean, so civilized compared to the 
                        trash you find in Great Falls.

           She shoots a pointed look in Kyle’s direction.

           Josie turns apologetically to Kyle and sees...

           His eyes are wide with a sudden realization.

           A CELL PHONE PEALS IN THE DARKNESS

           A bedside lamp turns on revealing Scott Priddis in a hotel 
           bed with someone who likely isn’t his wife.  He answers:

                                 PRIDDIS
                        Hello?

           We hear Josie’s slightly muffled voice but stay with Scott.

                                 JOSIE (V.O.)
                        What would happen if Bernie Houle 
                        made it across the border?

                                 PRIDDIS
                        Who is this?

                                 JOSIE (V.O.)
                        Answer the question.

                                 PRIDDIS
                        I-I don’t know.  He’d be extradited 
                        I guess.

                                 JOSIE (V.O.)
                        Back to Montana?

                                 PRIDDIS
                        Yes...

                                 JOSIE (V.O.)
                        Would he still be executed?

                                 PRIDDIS
                        I don’t know... extradition’s been 
                        refused on capital cases unless 
                        certain assurances have been given.

                                 JOSIE (V.O.)
                        Like what?

           Priddis starts to understand...
                                 PRIDDIS
                        That the extradited party won’t be 
                        subject to the death penalty.

                                 JOSIE (V.O.)
                        What would you do?

           Priddis hesitates.

                                 PRIDDIS
                              (”I’d turn him over”)
                        They may still execute him.  At 
                        best he’d get life without parole.

           A long pause.  Priddis listens to the silence at the other 
           end of the line...

                                 PRIDDIS
                        You should know that under Title 18 
                        of the United States Penal Code 
                        anyone who attempts to aid or 
                        assist an escaped--

           A dial tone interrupts him.  He slowly hangs up the phone, 
           deeply shaken.

           STAN’S CABIN

           Headlights play across it.  Kyle’s truck is still parked 
           nearby but Stan’s Chevy is gone.

           Wider shows June pulling up outside.  Dressed in pajamas and 
           a bathrobe.  She steps out of her car.

           INSIDE THE CABIN

           The door swings in.  June stands in the doorway.  Debbie 
           Boone softly sings “You Light Up My Life” on the radio.

                                 JUNE
                        Stan?

           JUNE’S POV:  The dining table, which has been cleared away, 
           blocks the view of her husband.

           She moves forward.  Catches sight of Stan’s leg.

                                 JUNE
                        Stan?

           She rushes forward.  Horrified by his mangled and burnt face.

           June reaches down and checks his pulse.  Feels something.  
           She shakes him by the shoulders.
                                 JUNE
                        Stan?  Stan?  Wake up!  Answer me!

           STAN LETS OUT A GUTTURAL GURGLE.

           His eyelids are fused shut.  He gulps in oxygen, grasping the 
           air in front of him blindly.

           Through his melted lips he manages a rasping:

                                 STAN
                        Josie?

           A knife to June’s heart.  Face twists with pain.  Eyes sting.

           She lets go of him.  Dodges his outstretched hands.

                                 STAN
                        Josie?  You there?

           June moves back out of frame.

           We stay with Stan.  His arms reaching forward.  They move to 
           his face.

           We hear the radio switch off.

                                 STAN
                        Oh god... oh god... I can’t see... 
                        Josie?  Why aren’t you answering?

           June’s legs reenter the frame.  The back of Stan’s hand makes 
           contact with them.  He wraps his hand around her calf.

                                 STAN
                        Josie?  I need help.  I’m hurt...

           REVERSE ANGLE ON JUNE.  FLOOR POV.

           She holds the radio to her chest.  Looks right down at us.

                                 JUNE
                        It’s not Josie.

           SHE RAISES THE RADIO OVER HER HEAD AND...

           SMASHES IT DOWN ONTO THE CAMERA WITH A SICKENING WET THWACK.

           JOSIE’S KITCHEN

           Kyle searches the drawers.  Josie stands in the doorway.  
           Watching Bernie speaking with her mother in the living room.

           Kyle finds what he is looking for:  a tattered map of Montana 
           and portions of the surrounding states.

           He spreads it out on the table.  Runs a finger across it.
                                 KYLE
                        If we drive up the Burma Road we 
                        can follow the border west and 
                        cross north of Kinnerly Peak.  
                        Shouldn’t be many patrols in that 
                        area.  Once we’re over we can 
                        follow the valleys up the MacDonald 
                        Range.  Turn him over in Fernie.

           Josie leans over the map.

                                 JOSIE
                        Difficult terrain up there.  It’ll 
                        take us three days at least.

                                 KYLE
                        We haven’t got a choice.  If we move 
                        now we can make the trail head by 
                        daybreak.

           Josie shakes her head, conflicted.

                                 KYLE
                        There’s no other way, Josie.  We 
                        made this mess.  All of us.  This’s 
                        the only way to make it right.

           They exchange a long, loaded look.  Josie finally answers:

                                 JOSIE
                        Okay.

           Kyle springs into action.  He snatches up the map.

           LIVING ROOM

           Josie moves over to her mother and Bernie.  He looks up at 
           her expectantly.

                                 JOSIE
                        We’re gonna try to get you across 
                        the border into Canada.  We’ll be 
                        turning you over to authorities 
                        when we get there.  What they do 
                        from there is up to them.

           Paula listens, not quite understanding. Bernie nods, grateful.

           A NAKED LIGHTBULB

           Flickers on and burns.

           Kyle surveys the chaotic contents of the small shed.

           He grabs a dusty canvas backpack from the shelf.  Begins to 
           fill it with items:
           Binoculars.  Rope.  Buck knife.  Two steel canteens.  First 
           aid kit.

           Finally his hand finds a can of bear spray.  Rust stains the 
           bottom rim.  But it’s good enough.

           He adds it to the side pocket of the bag.  As he does he 
           feels something in the pocket...

           He pulls it out.  A tattered photograph.  He studies it for a 
           moment then drops it on the bench and leaves...

           CLOSE ON THE PHOTO: Kyle, around 5, next to his father.  Knee 
           deep in a stream.  Proudly holding a decent sized trout.

           A PANTRY DOOR OPENS

           Revealing Josie.  She gathers food from the shelves.  Tins.  
           Snacks.  Power bars.  Anything non-perishable.

           A BEDROOM MIRROR

           Bernie stands in frame.  Trying on a quilted hunting jacket.  
           His hands don’t reach out the arm holes.

           Kyle kneels by the closet nearby.  Stuffing clothes into his 
           canvas bag.  He notices Bernie’s plight.  Shrugs.

                                 KYLE
                        Sorry.  He was a big man.

           Bernie nods.  Rolls up the sleeves.

           OUTSIDE JOSIE’S HOUSE

           Josie and Bernie emerge.  They head for Kyle, who fixes snow 
           chains to the tires of Stan’s truck.

           Josie twists back to her mother who stands in the doorway 
           watching them go.

                                 JOSIE
                        Go inside Ma.  You’ll get a cold.  
                        Aunt Maggie’s on her way.

           EMPTY URBAN STREETS

           Great Falls in the dead of night.  Snow falls.

           The Chevy Silverado navigates through the bleak maze.
           A GLOVED HAND

           Pouring coffee from a thermos.

           WIDER shows a bored GRAND FALLS POLICE OFFICER sitting in his 
           idling COP CAR.

           Face illuminated by the dash and computer.  Heat blasting.

           He takes a sip of coffee and sees...

           The Chevy glide along a bridge adjacent to the Officer’s car 
           and continue along the road.

           The Officer leans forward and checks the truck’s plates.  
           Prods his computer screen.  Sighs.

           Window whirs down and he dumps the coffee into the snow.

           INSIDE THE CHEVY

           Kyle at the wheel.  Josie next to him.  Bernie in the back.

           The darkness in the rear window suddenly blazes blue and red.

           Kyle’s eyes flick to the rearview.  Josie turns in her seat.

                                 JOSIE
                        Get down.

           Bernie ducks down.  Kyle slows the car.

                                 KYLE
                        What do I do?

                                 JOSIE
                        I don’t know.

                                 KYLE
                        Should I pull over?

           Josie shakes her head.  She doesn’t know.

           Kyle takes one last look in the mirror and...

           JAMS HIS FOOT DOWN ON THE ACCELERATOR and...

           WRENCHES THE WHEEL LEFT DOWN A SIDE ROAD and...

           The COP CAR ACCELERATES.  SIREN WHOOPS ON and...

           THE CHEVY’S TIRES

           Bounces down a tight alleyway behind a row of houses.  Smash 
           through trashcans.  Crushing the debris and continuing on 
           making a hard right onto a...
           SUBURBAN STREET

           The Silverado slides wide on the snow.  Elbows a parked car.  
           Continues on.

           The cop car does likewise.  Fishtails and stalls.

           The engine restarts and veers straight on and continues the 
           chase as we CUT TO:

           GREAT FALLS - HIGH ANGLE

           The soft throttle of two distant engines cut through the 
           silence.

           Orbs of light wend rapidly along the dark streets.  Quick 
           turns.  Left, right, left, right.

           THE WHITE HEADLIGHTS of the Chevy.  Pulling ahead.

           THE RED-BLUE-RED-BLUE strobe of the cop car.  Struggling to 
           keep up like an obscene game of PacMan.

           Suddenly, at the top of frame another blue and red light 
           materializes.  COP CAR #2.  Beelining for the chase.

           Just as it looks like the Chevy’s about to be caught in a 
           pincer...

           THE WHITE LIGHT MAKES A SUDDEN SHARP LEFT AND DISAPPEARS.

           Seconds later, Cop Car #1 floats by and continues on.  Pace 
           slowing slightly as we CUT TO:

           THE CHEVY SILVERADO

           Sitting in a carport between a house and a fence.  Lights 
           off, cooling engine clicking.  Steam dribbling from the hood.

           Cop Car #2 ROARS past behind.  Siren whining.

           Josie and Kyle exchange a look.  Wait for the siren to 
           subside.

           Kyle restarts the car and reverses back down the drive.

           THE CHEVY

           Roars along an empty US-89.  Red sun crests the horizon.

           Bernie watches the sunrise through the scribble of scrolling 
           trees.  The flickering light warming his face.
           DOCHERTY’S OFFICE

           Docherty enters.  Takes a pile of messages from his Secretary.

                                 SECRETARY
                        The Marshals Service has sent a 
                        BOLO to our friends up north.  
                        Every cow, fish and tree cop is on 
                        the lookout.

           Docherty nods, preoccupied.  Heads for his office.

                                 DOCHERTY
                        Draw me up some suspension papers 
                        for Josie Deumann.

                                 SECRETARY
                        Thought you were letting her slide?

           He turns back.  Annoyed at being questioned.

                                 DOCHERTY
                        Well I changed my mind.  Is that 
                        alright with you?

                                 SECRETARY
                              (she shrugs)
                        Chief Edwards called about that APB 
                        you sent out on Stan’s truck.  One 
                        of his officers tried to pull him 
                        over on Stuckey Road last night.  
                        He was liquored up or something and 
                        driving like a maniac.  Didn’t see 
                        no reason to chase him down and end 
                        up killin’ him.

           Docherty frowns.

                                 DOCHERTY
                        What time was this?

                                 SECRETARY
                        Didn’t say.

           Docherty doubles back for the main door.

                                 DOCHERTY
                        I’m goin’ out for a few.  See if 
                        you can get June Gittany on the 
                        line for me.

                                 SECRETARY
                        Something wrong?

                                 DOCHERTY
                              (mumbling)
                        Still trying to figure that out.
           A LICENCE PLATE

           A hand enters frame and pulls on the edges.

           WIDER reveals Stan’s truck.  Parked in a gravel dead-end on a 
           small rise.

           Kyle plies the plate off the car with a pop.  Stuffs it into 
           his backpack.

           Behind him, Josie and Bernie gaze out across the snow-covered 
           landscape through a break in the vegetation.

           Trees, trees and nothing but trees.  Riding the wave of 
           earth.  Gently undulating out into infinity.

           Kyle approaches them.  Checking his compass.

           The three of them exchange a look and set off.

           A TARP IS RIPPED AWAY REVEALING

           The battered Sheriff’s car.  The same one that hit Charlie 
           Cameron.

           We’re in a FLEET SERVICING SHED.  Much more advanced than 
           Kyle’s ancient setup.

                                 MECHANIC
                        Haven’t started repairin’ it yet.  
                        Truth be told it’s probably a write-
                        off when you add up the costs.

           He speaks with Docherty, who circles the car, inspecting the 
           damage.  Docherty lifts the trunk lid.

           INSIDE THE TRUNK:  Clean.  Spare tire in the well.  Unused 
           jack.  Nothing amiss.  Except...

                                 DOCHERTY
                        There supposed to be carpet in 
                        here?

           The Mechanic rounds the car and takes a look.

                                 MECHANIC
                        Yeah, normally.  Who knows?  We 
                        mighta spilled something on it and 
                        pulled it out.

                                 DOCHERTY
                        Did you?

                                 MECHANIC
                        Not that I recall.  One of my guys 
                        might’ve.  It’s an older model.
                                 DOCHERTY
                        Thanks.

           He walks off.

                                 MECHANIC
                        Should I take it to the wreckers?

                                 DOCHERTY
                              (without turning)
                        Not yet.

           ROCK-STREWN PATH

           Cutting through the forest.  Kyle leads the party along it.

           They move single-file careful not to slip on the icy ground.

           Bernie turns to Josie, who walks behind him.

                                 BERNIE
                        Why are you doing this?  Why didn’t 
                        you just turn me over?

           Josie thinks about this for a beat.  Focus on the path ahead.

                                 JOSIE
                        I’d kill you myself if I had the 
                        guts to do it.  But I don’t.  And 
                        I’d be fooling myself if I 
                        pretended that handing you over 
                        wasn’t just the same thing.

           They come up a rise where Kyle stands and see the border:

           A LONG SHARP SWATHE CUT THROUGH THE DISTANT TREES.

           Kyle turns back to them...

                                 KYLE
                        We should keep heading west.  Still 
                        too close to the Chief Mountain 
                        crossing.  They might have patrols 
                        and cameras out this way.

           HEAVY SNOW FALLING IN HEADLIGHTS

           Docherty at the wheel of his cruiser.  Scanning through the 
           gloom.  Thick dark clouds fat with snow overhead.  

           He slows to a crawl.  Veers right off the road.

           THE ROADSIDE

           The same spot Charlie Cameron was killed.
           Docherty emerges.  Leaves the car idling, headlights on.  
           Brings out a flashlight.  Sweeps the ground with it.

           Finds the tire tracks.  Ruts in the mud.  Frozen solid.

           He crouches down.  Runs a finger along the edge of the track.

           A twig SNAPS in the trees beyond.

           Docherty brings up his flashlight, revealing...

           A DEER.  Motionless, thirty yards away.  Partially obscured 
           in the undergrowth.  Eyes glimmer silver like moonlight.

           Docherty watches it.  A hint of amusement in his expression.

                                 DOCHERTY
                        Easy, girl.  Easy.

           WIDER as Docherty rises.  The car blowing exhaust.  The road 
           stretching out into the murk.  Deer just out of frame.

           Docherty QUICK DRAWS his service weapon.  FIRES.  A burst of 
           white smoke EXPLODES.

           Docherty waits for the smoke to clear.  Reholsters his gun.  
           Traipses out into the forest.

           A TRICKLING RIVER

           Kyle dips his canteen into the icy water.  Takes a drink.  
           One eye on a band of black clouds approaching from the south.

           Josie and Bernie sit on the rocks of the riverbed nearby.

                                 KYLE
                        It’ll be dark soon.  We should set 
                        up camp.

           He twists the cap on his canteen.  Turns back and sees...

           A GERMAN SHEPHERD bound from the steep tree-lined bank over 
           Bernie’s shoulder.  Trailing ten feet of taut leash behind.

           Seconds later two BORDER PATROL AGENTS follow the dog out.  
           BP AGENT #1, who holds the leash, yanks it to heel.

                                 BP AGENT #1
                              (waving)
                        Hey there!

           Hesitation.  They couldn’t run even if they wanted to.

                                 JOSIE
                        Hello!

           The two agents approach and stop about ten feet short.
                                 BP AGENT #1
                        How y’all doing?

                                 JOSIE
                        We’re alright.

           The BP AGENT #2, less friendly than his colleague, clocks 
           Kyle’s rifle.

                                 BP AGENT #2
                        Doin’ some hunting out here?

                                 JOSIE
                        Trying to.

                                 BP AGENT #1
                        Any luck?

                                 JOSIE
                        Not so far.

           BP Agent #2 glares at Bernie.

                                 BP AGENT #2
                        You guys are awful close to the 
                        border.

                                 KYLE
                        We are?

                                 BP AGENT #2
                        Just over the ridge there.

                                 JOSIE
                        Oh, we didn’t know.

                                 BP AGENT #1
                        Lot of folks get turned around out 
                        here.

           BP Agent #2 continues to scrutinize Bernie.

                                 BP AGENT #2
                        You all American?

                                 KYLE
                        Yes, sir.

                                 BP AGENT #2
                        Got any ID?  Passport?

                                 JOSIE
                        Passport?  Nah.  Didn’t bring it.

                                 KYLE
                        We’re just hunting.
                                 BP AGENT #1
                        You’re under no obligation to 
                        provide anything.

           BP Agent #2 shoots him a withering glare.

                                 BP AGENT #1
                        Unless you wanna, of course.

                                 BP AGENT #2
                              (re: Bernie)
                        Your friend speak?

           Bernie stands up and turns to face him.

                                 BERNIE
                        When I have cause to.

                                 BP AGENT #2
                        You look familiar for some reason.  
                        What’re ya?  Blackfeet?

                                 BERNIE
                        Mother was Chippewa.

                                 BP AGENT #2
                        Long way out of your neck of the 
                        woods.

                                 BERNIE
                        Not by choice.

           BP Agent #2 continues to stare.  A dog with a bone.  Kyle 
           breaks the tension.

                                 KYLE
                        Uh... you know what..?

           He slings his backpack off his shoulder.  Digs into the side 
           pocket.

                                 KYLE
                        Think I got my driver’s licence 
                        somewhere in here... if that helps 
                        you fellas out...

                                 BP AGENT #1
                        Well, we’d sure appreciate it.  Get 
                        a lot of wingnuts tryin to cause 
                        trouble outUUHHNNN--

           KYLE FIRES A HISS OF BEAR SPRAY INTO HIS FACE.

           In agony, BP AGENT #1 twists to the ground, trapping the 
           German Shepherd’s leash beneath him.

                                 JOSIE
                        Kyle!  No!
           BP Agent #2 gawps at his colleague for a split second, 
           stunned.  Then reaches for his weapon.

           Before he can unholster it, Kyle sprays him in the face too.

           He crumples to the ground.  Clawing at his face.  Screaming.

           The German Shepherd bays and growls, straining against its 
           trapped leash, which gives a little with each tug.

                                 KYLE
                        Run!

           The threesome break for the trees, scrambling over the uneven 
           ground.  Leaving the two agents writhing on the rocks.

           As they scramble up the steep slope we CUT BACK TO:

           DOCHERTY

           Moving through the forest.  Following the deer’s blood trail.

           Sweeping the ground with his flashlight.  He stops as the 
           light picks up a metallic glint on the ground.

           He crouches.  Brushes aside the leaf litter to reveal:

           A CELL PHONE.  Waterlogged.  Screen shattered.

           Docherty clicks off the light.  Twists back towards his...

           CAR.  Idling still, hundred feet away.  Headlights visible 
           through the trees.

           The snow getting heavier.

           ROCKY KNOLL - MAGIC HOUR

           Josie and Bernie ascend to the top of the ridge.  Gasping for 
           breath.  Sweat lashing from their foreheads.

           Kyle, fifty feet behind them, calls out:

                                 KYLE
                        Keep... going...

           He watches them disappear over the crown ahead.

           As he nears the top he turns back and scans...

           THE SNOWY TERRAIN.  Everything is still.  And then...

           THE GERMAN SHEPHERD appears from a grove of trees.  A mere 
           speck in the distance, but gaining at an alarming rate of 
           speed.
           Kyle turns back.  As he does...

           HIS FOOT SLIPS FROM THE ICY ROCKS, wedging down into the 
           cavity between them and...

           He tumbles backwards and...

           HIS TRAPPED LEG BENDS THEN SNAPS WITH AN AUDIBLE CRACK

           Kyle screams in pain.  Lying at an awkward angle.  Head 
           facing down the slope.

           He groans with pain in between breaths.  Tries to lift his 
           head to look at his leg.  Can’t see it.

           Twisting his neck, he sights the German Shepherd as it 
           reaches the base of the hill below and bounds towards him.

           Less than a minute from catching him.

                                 KYLE
                        Josie?  Josie?  Help me!

           No answer.  The ridge above remains empty.

           PRE-LAP: A MECHANICAL WHINE

           CAR AIR DUCT

           Blowing hot air.

           WIDER.  Docherty sits in his car.  Windows fogged.  He holds 
           the broken phone up to the air duct.  Drying it out.

           He flicks off the heat.  Presses the power button on the 
           phone.  Nothing...

           He thinks a moment.  His phone buzzes in his pocket.

                                 DOCHERTY
                        Hello?

           His Secretary’s voice comes on the line.

                                 SECRETARY
                        It’s me.  Been trying June Gittany 
                        all day.  Can’t get a hold of her.

           Docherty blows a puff of air from his lips.

                                 DOCHERTY
                        Alright.  I’ll look into it.

           He hangs up.  Looks down.  His phone in one hand.  The broken 
           phone in the other.  TIME CUT TO:
           A SIM CARD

           Lying in the cradle of an open phone.  Docherty’s fingers 
           reach in and pull it out of the slot.

           He places it in his phone.  Snaps it shut.  Powers on.

           Navigates to contacts.  Just a series of numbers.  No names.

           He dials the first.  After a few rings a VOICE answers.

                                 VOICE (V.O.)
                        Charlie?  Jesus Christ, Charlie is 
                        that you?  Where the heck’ve you 
                        been?  Heather’s been worried sick--

           Docherty’s eyes narrow.

                                 DOCHERTY
                        Charlie who?

                                 VOICE
                        What’s that?

                                 DOCHERTY
                        Charlie.  Who.

                                                             CUT BACK TO:

           KYLE, STILL TRAPPED

           Upside down.  Frantically scanning the rocks behind him.

           Suddenly the German Shepherd looms over a boulder to his 
           right.  The slavering hound bounds forward.  Snarling.

                                 KYLE
                        Oh God!

           He offers his arm.  Anticipates the pain.

           The dog clamps down.  Teeth tear through his jacket and deep 
           into his flesh.

           Kyle screams in pain.  Yells into the sky and then...

           Senses movement to his right...

           Bernie stands over him.  Wild-eyed.  Raises a football-sized 
           rock over his head...

                                 KYLE
                        No!

           Kyle shields his face as BERNIE SMASHES IT DOWN...
           A glancing blow onto the German Shepherd’s head.  The dog 
           yips with pain.  Releases Kyle’s arm.  Snaps at Bernie.

           The Chippewa man raises the rock again.  Crunches it down.

           This time his aim is true.  The dog’s head caves in.  A 
           gruesome crater of blood, brain and bone.

           Bernie isn’t done.  He raises the rock once more.  Smashes it 
           down... again... and again.  Pulverizing the dead dog.

           KYLE’S POV:  Bernie’s frenzied expression.  Cheeks shudder 
           with each blow.  White teeth grit tight.

                                 JOSIE
                        Bernie...

           Kyle looks up.  Josie stands at the top of the hill.

           Bernie finally ceases his pounding.  Panting heavily.  He 
           tosses the rock away.  Rises gingerly to his feet.

           HEADLIGHTS WEAVE THROUGH A FAMILIAR ROAD

           Stan’s cabin comes into frame and...

           IT’S A SMOULDERING RUIN.  Black jagged timber stabs the sky.

           Docherty pulls up.  Blinks with disbelief.  Takes a moment to 
           comprehend what he’s seeing.  Steps out of the car.

           He notices June’s car parked to the left.  Moves over to it.  
           Wipes frost from the window.

           June sits inside.  Staring ahead.

                                 DOCHERTY
                        June?

           She doesn’t respond.  Gazes ahead at the ruined cabin.

           He taps on the window.  She flinches.  Turns to him.

           Her electric window purrs down a few inches.

                                 DOCHERTY
                        June?  Where’s Stan?

                                 JUNE
                              (mechanically)
                        He’s dead.  I killed him.

           Docherty processes this.  Horrified.

                                 DOCHERTY
                        Where’s Josie?
           She glares at him for a long beat and then...

           Her window purrs closed.

           A GRISLY COMPOUND FRACTURE

           The bone splintering through the calf flesh, which is almost 
           torn in half.

           Wincing, Kyle tries to hitch himself up by the elbows to get 
           a look.  Every movement agony.

                                 KYLE
                        Is it bad?

           Bernie stands a distance away looking out over the valley 
           below.  Wiping his blood-stained hands on his jeans.

           Josie puts on a brave face.  Knows the situation is dire.

                                 JOSIE
                        It’s alright.  I’m gonna try and 
                        unwedge your foot.

           She reaches down into the gap between the boulders.  Grabs 
           Kyle’s boot by the toe and tries to twist it free.

           Kyle’s distressed ROAR echoes through the valley below.

           Josie sits up.  Shaking her head.

                                 JOSIE
                        I can’t do it.  I’m just gonna hurt 
                        you more.

           She raises her voice so Bernie can hear.

                                 JOSIE
                        One of us needs to go for help.

           Bernie turns around.

                                 KYLE
                        No!  He can’t.  They’ll kill him.

           He twists around to meet Bernie’s eye.

                                 KYLE
                        Cross the border.  Get help over 
                        there.

                                 JOSIE
                        It’ll take him two days at least to 
                        reach Fernie.  We don’t have time.  
                        You’re losing blood.  It’s only six 
                        hours back to the border crossing.
                                 KYLE
                        You’re asking him to kill himself!

                                 JOSIE
                        He needs to go back.

                                 KYLE
                        You go then.  He can stay here.

                                 JOSIE
                        And when they rescue you?  They’ll 
                        still have him.

                                 KYLE
                        Then -- for Christ’s sakes, I don’t 
                        fucking know -- both of you go!

                                 JOSIE
                        You think I’m gonna leave you alone 
                        out here?  For the wolves and the 
                        grizzlies?  It ain’t happening.

                                 KYLE
                        Leave the damn rifle then... I can 
                        take care of myself.

                                 JOSIE
                        On one leg?  Like hell you can.

                                 KYLE
                        Well, you’re sending him back there 
                        over my--

                                 BERNIE
                        I coulda killed her, you know.

           Kyle and Josie turn to Bernie.

           He moves forward.  Rolling down the sleeves of his jacket.  
           Covering his bloody hands.

                                 BERNIE
                        Liza Toohey.  She was right there.  
                        All it would have taken was a flick 
                        of the wrist.  Just a moment.  She 
                        saw my face.  Identified me 
                        afterwards.  Cos I let her live.  I 
                        coulda killed her but I didn’t.  
                        It’s the only half decent thing I 
                        did in my whole rotten life.  
                        Walking out that door.  No matter 
                        what they do to me, I’ll never 
                        regret it.

           ON Josie and Kyle.  Realization dawning on their faces.
                                 KYLE
                        No.  Wait.  Bernie, listen to me.  
                        Please.  Just go.  You can make it.

                                 BERNIE
                        I’m sorry.  I can’t.

           Josie nods with gratitude.  Kyle squeezes his eyes closed.

           A CHRISTMAS-THEMED COFFEE CUP

           A hand reaches for it.

                                 AUNT MAGGIE (V.O.)
                        Get a call in the middle of the 
                        night.  Without a hello or nothing 
                        Josie’s in the middle of telling me 
                        how something important’s come up 
                        and she needs me to come over.

           WIDER as Docherty brings the cup to his lips.  He sits on the 
           couch in Josie’s house.  Paula sits next to him.

           Aunt Maggie sits in the armchair opposite.  She throws up her 
           hands, exasperated.

                                 AUNT MAGGIE
                        Like I can just drop everything at 
                        her whim.

           Docherty winces as the hot coffee touches his lips.  He puts 
           it back down.

                                 DOCHERTY
                        A--um... colleague of hers at the 
                        police department was killed last 
                        night.  We have the suspect in 
                        custody but she isn’t talking.  We 
                        have reason to believe that Josie 
                        may have been with the deceased 
                        around the time of his death.  
                        We’re worried that some harm may 
                        have come to her.

                                 AUNT MAGGIE
                        Well, I certainly hope not.  She 
                        the only one in this family that 
                        tried to make a decent name for 
                        herself.
                              (motions to Paula)
                        Except her mother... but, well, you 
                        can see how that turned out.

           Docherty turns to Paula.  Her hands are wrapped around a 
           coffee cup, which rests on the Calgary Olympics pillow.
                                 DOCHERTY
                        Mrs. Deumann this is important.  
                        Can you remember anything about 
                        where Josie said she was going?

           Paula looks at her reflection in the coffee.

                                 PAULA
                        She wanted to go to the Olympics.

           Docherty turns to Aunt Maggie, who shrugs and...

                                 AUNT MAGGIE
                        She a little, you know...

           Points to her head as we CUT TO:

           THE BORDER

           A fifty-foot-wide ribbon of dead grass stretching out 
           endlessly.

           Exhausted, Bernie stumbles down the center of it through a 
           worsening snow storm.

                                                                TIME CUT:

           The strip of grass opens out as a two-lane highway cuts 
           across it.

           A BORDER CROSSING STATION sits ahead, illuminated and warm in 
           the darkness.  The shadow of Chief Mountain looms on the 
           horizon.

           Bernie stops at the crossroad.  Looks down.  Legs straddling 
           the red paint of the border.

           To the left, freedom.  To the right, death.

           He makes for the border station.

           A YOUNG BORDER PATROL AGENT sits at the window.  Feet crossed 
           on the desk.  Reading a newspaper.

           Bernie enters the bubble of light outside the window.

                                 YOUNG AGENT
                              (without looking up)
                        Closed.  Come back tomorrow.

                                 BERNIE
                              (muffled; through glass)
                        Please help me.  I need help.

                                 YOUNG AGENT
                        I said we’re--
           He looks at Bernie for the first time.  Instant recognition.  

           Jumps to his feet, throwing the newspaper aside.  Juts a 
           finger at Bernie.

                                 YOUNG AGENT
                        Uhhh-- don’t move.  Stay right 
                        there.

           He moves to the back of the station, fumbling for something 
           on his belt.  Disappears through a back door.

           ON Bernie, waiting.  He hears a voice to his left.

                                 YOUNG AGENT
                        Alright... turn around.  Uh, away 
                        from me.

           The Young Agent has a taser out, trained on Bernie.

           Bernie raises his hands.  Doesn’t turn.

                                 BERNIE
                        Please.  Wait just a second.  I 
                        need to talk to you--

                                 YOUNG AGENT
                        Please comply, sir!

                                 BERNIE
                        Hold on.  Just listen to me first--

                                 YOUNG AGENT
                        You need to turn around.

                                 BERNIE
                        I need help.  My friends--GUH!

           The Agent fires the taser into Bernie’s flank.

           TK-TK-TK-TK.  The barbs spark blue as Bernie flops heavily to 
           the ground thrashing with pain.

           The Young Agent keeps the trigger depressed and reaches for a 
           baton on his belt.  Edges forward.

           Bernie glares at him from the corner of his eye.  Neck 
           muscles contracting.

                                 BERNIE
                        P-p-please--

           THWACK!  The Young Agent brings down the baton.

           SMASH TO BLACK

           Bernie wakes.  Breathing heavily.  Face bloody and bruised.
           Looks around...

           A DARKENED CELL

           Rises groggily to his feet.  Calls out in a hoarse voice:

                                 BERNIE
                        HEY.  HELLO?  IS THERE ANYONE 
                        THERE?

           He pounds on the cell door.

                                 BERNIE
                        HEY!  ANSWER ME.  I NEED HELP.

           His hammering becomes more frenetic.

                                 BERNIE
                        I NEED TO TALK TO SOMEONE.  CAN YOU 
                        HEAR ME?  HEY!

           He kicks at the door.  It rattles on its hinges.

           Just then, he hears a key turn in the lock.  Steps back.

           The door swings open.  BRIGHT LIGHT.  Bernie shields his eyes 
           as...

           FOUR PRISON GUARDS BURST IN.  Tackle him to the ground.  Push 
           him face-down.  Each taking hold of a limb.

           Bernie struggles.  One of the guards twists his arm back.

                                 BERNIE
                        Aagh!

           The silhouette of a FIFTH MAN appears at the cell door.  
           Bald, thin.  Not wearing a uniform.

           He moves over to Bernie.  Bends down between his legs.  Yanks 
           down Bernie’s jeans.

           Bernie catches a glimpse of a needle in the Bald Man’s hand.

                                 BERNIE
                        No!  God!  Wait, wait.  Don’t--

           The Bald Man jabs the needle into Bernie’s flesh.  Depresses 
           the plunger.

           The drugs begin to take effect.  Bernie’s eyelids become 
           heavy.  Speech muddled...

                                 BERNIE
                        Don’t... don’t... don’t... die... 
                        don’t...
           As he drifts into unconsciousness we hear...

           PRE-LAP:  The CRACK of a rifle shot.

           JOSIE

           Stands at the top of the rocky knoll.  Firing the rifle into 
           the air from her hip.  It’s early morning.

           Josie brings up the binoculars...

           Miles to the south a helicopter glides over the trees.

           Josie waves at it.

                                 JOSIE
                        Hey!

           She fires into the air again.

           The helicopter doesn’t change trajectory.  Disappears behind 
           a mountain range.

                                 JOSIE
                        God damn it.

           She moves down off the ridge.

           Kyle lies in the same position as the night before.  Pale and 
           weary.  Weak and dying.

                                 KYLE
                        You should save the ammo.  Case you 
                        need to walk out.

           Josie doesn’t respond.  She sits on the boulder next to Kyle.  
           Unscrews the canteen.  Brings it to his lips.  He turns away.

                                 KYLE
                        We’re running low.

                                 JOSIE
                        You need it.

           Kyle’s lips stay closed.

                                 JOSIE
                        I’ll pour it up your nose if I have 
                        to.

           Kyle opens his mouth.  She pours in some water.  He swallows 
           and wipes his lips.

                                 KYLE
                        You always were a a fence wrecker.
           STATE PRISON

           Docherty and the Warden move down a corridor of cells.

                                 WARDEN
                        Turned himself in just after 
                        midnight.  Transferred him over 
                        here first thing.  Border jockeys 
                        got a little hit happy.

           They stop outside a cell.  The Warden unlatches the viewing 
           portal.  Docherty steps up and looks inside...

           BERNIE lies strapped to a hospital bed.  Drooling.  Face 
           swollen and bruised.  The blood has been cleaned away.

                                 DOCHERTY
                        Jesus.

                                 WARDEN
                        Doctor’s put him on some heavy 
                        sedatives to calm him down.  Don’t 
                        want him making a scene.  Guess no 
                        one wants to meet his maker.

                                 DOCHERTY
                        Mention where he’d been?

                                 WARDEN
                        Understand he was pretty 
                        incoherent.  Had a coupla’ good 
                        needlestick marks on his arms.  
                        Looks like he went and injected 
                        himself with God knows what.  
                        Whatever it was sure made him act 
                        crazy.  He was kickin’ and 
                        hollerin’ half the night.

                                 DOCHERTY
                        We gonna try and find out?  Where 
                        he went?

                                 WARDEN
                        Under normal circumstances?
                              (“Yes”)
                        But the Governor gave the word.  
                        Doesn’t want any more delays.

           PRE-LAP: A BABY WAILS...

           LIZA

           Sits at her kitchen table.  Bouncing baby Edward in her arms.  
           Staring down at the cell phone lying on the table.

           Josh enters.  Rubbing sleep from his eyes.
                                 JOSH
                        Someone call?  Heard your phone.

           Liza nods as he sits down opposite her.

                                 LIZA
                        The county prosecutor’s office.  
                        They found him.  It’s happening 
                        tonight.

           Josh bows his head.  Hides his face.  Struggling to find the 
           right reaction.

           When he looks up there are tears in his eyes.  He reaches 
           across the table.

                                 JOSH
                        I love you, Liza Toohey... I love 
                        you... I love you...

           Liza presses the back of her hand to her forehead.  Lets out 
           deep guttural sobs of relief.

           Tears drop onto baby Edward’s cheeks and...

           Liza finally reaches out and squeezes Josh’s hand.

           JOSIE

           Looks up at the night sky.  Kyle’s head cradled on her knee.  
           She presses a hand to his forehead.  They both stare up at...

           THE NORTHERN LIGHTS.  Shimmering like an oil slick.

                                 KYLE
                        You ever think about what the last 
                        thought to run through your mind’ll 
                        be?  Like whether it’ll be about 
                        something important?  Like someone 
                        you love or something you regret?  
                        Or maybe it’ll just be something 
                        real dumb.  Like a stupid old 
                        jingle from a TV commercial you saw 
                        when you was a kid.  Doesn’t seem 
                        fair.  Not getting to choose.

           Josie looks down at him.  Tears welling in her eyes.

                                 KYLE
                        Can you sing me something?

                                 JOSIE
                        Whatta ya want me to sing?

                                 KYLE
                        Whatever you want...
           Thinking, she shakes her head, at a loss.  Then she sings the 
           last song she remembers:  Sister Golden Hair.

           Josie sings it alone.  Acapella.  It sounds sad.  Mournful.  
           Hopeless.  But beautiful.  She sings and it continues over...

           LIZA AND JOSH

           As they drive through a throng of chanting anti-death penalty 
           protestors.

           BERNIE HOULE’S POV

           BLURRY.  DELIRIOUS.  INTERCUT WITH MOMENTS OF DARKNESS

           Watching his hands being shackled to the hospital bed frame 
           then...

           DARKNESS.

           Grated ceiling panels glide by...

           DARKNESS.

           We find ourselves in the execution chamber.  Bright 
           fluorescent light overhead.

           DARKNESS.

           Two guards work on each arm.  Can’t see what they are doing.

           DARKNESS.

           VIEWING GALLERY

           The witnesses file in and take their seats.

           Bernie Houle lies bound to the gurney.  Still faint and 
           delirious from the sedatives.

           Tubes extend from the crooks of his outstretched arms to a 
           panel in the wall behind him.  A one-way mirror sits above 
           the panel.

           A CHAPLAIN stands next to him.  Hand resting on Bernie’s 
           knee.  WARDEN off to the side, checks his watch.

           PAN ACROSS THE MEMBERS OF THE VIEWING GALLERY

           A small audience.  Some people we recognize.  Some we don’t.

           Liza bounces baby Edward on her knee.  Josh next to her.  
           Clutching her hand.
           Scott Priddis sits in the back row.  Docherty behind him.  
           Next to the door.

           A group of four elderly Chippewa Indians sit together to the 
           side.  Their relationship to Bernie is unclear.

           The Warden steps over to an intercom panel.  He presses a 
           button on it.

                                 WARDEN
                        We ready to commence?

           Liza inspects Bernie’s face.  He looks straight up at the 
           ceiling.  It’s the same angle she first saw him but now his 
           face is grey, withered and peaceful.

                                 INTERCOM (V.O.)
                        We’re ready, sir.

           The Warden turns to Bernie and extracts a prepared statement 
           from his pocket.

                                 WARDEN
                        Bernard James Houle, the state of 
                        Montana has sentenced you to death by 
                        lethal injection for the crime of two 
                        counts of first degree murder.  You 
                        have two minutes should you wish to 
                        make a final statement.

           Bernie doesn’t move for a long beat.  The Warden blinks.

                                 WARDEN
                        Did you hear me, Mr. Houle?

           Bernie’s gaze flickers with recognition.  He raises his head 
           slowly towards the viewing gallery.

           Locks eyes with Liza Toohey.  Gazes ahead blankly.  It’s 
           unclear whether Bernie can even see her.

           Liza is pinned under Bernie’s gaze.  She turns to Josh for 
           solace.  He tries to return her look... but cannot.  He 
           averts his eyes with shame.

           Liza holds Edward, who starts to blubber, tight to her chest.

                                 WARDEN
                        Do you have any final words, Mr. 
                        Houle?

           Bernie tries to speak.  Breathing hard.  Lets out a murmur.

           Docherty takes a small step forward.  Straining to hear.

                                 WARDEN
                        If you have anything to say, Mr. 
                        Houle, this is your final chance...
           ON BERNIE.  Shot from above.

           Straining to form words and...

           His arms tense against his restraints and...

           His chest begins to heave with panic and...

           Just as we think he might answer we...

           SMASH TO BLACK.

           And we stay on black...

           We stay on black for a long, long time...

           Long enough to hear our own thoughts again...

           Long enough to consider Bernie Houle's last seconds of life.

           Liza Toohey's unrelenting pain.

           Kyle and Josie Deumann alone and dying in the wilderness.

           And just as we think it might all be over...

           WE'RE ASSAULTED BY AN EXPLOSION OF SOUND AND WIND AND LIGHT

           Josie shields her eyes as...

           An angel burning like magnesium flame descends from the sky.

           No... not an angel...

           A helicopter.

           Josie tries to shake Kyle awake.
                                 JOSIE
                        Kyle!  Kyle, wake up!

           He groans through his dying delirium.

           THE HELICOPTER

           Idles in a clearing at the base of the rocky knoll.

           Kyle, strapped onto a stretcher, is loaded onto the 
           helicopter by a couple of paramedics.

           Josie climbs in after them.

           INSIDE THE HELICOPTER

           Josie sees Docherty, belted into one of the jump seats in the 
           back.  She pauses.  They exchange a look.

           She moves forward.  Straps herself into the seat opposite.

           One of the paramedics slams the door shut and taps the 
           pilot’s shoulder.  Spirals his finger upward.

           Josie and Docherty stare at each other for a long beat as the 
           engine drone pitches up to a deafening roar.

           Josie is the first to speak.  Yelling to be heard:

                                 JOSIE
                        Is he..?

                                 DOCHERTY
                        He’s gone...

           Josie bows her head.

                                 JOSIE
                        How’d you know?

                                 DOCHERTY
                        He said it.  He said it before the 
                        end.  Enough for me to know.

           Josie looks down at her sleeping brother.

                                 JOSIE
                        What’s gonna happen now?

                                 DOCHERTY
                        We forget about it.

                                 JOSIE
                        Everything?
                                 DOCHERTY
                        Everything.  We move on with our 
                        lives...
                              (then, the condition:)
                        ... both of us.  Together.

           Josie consider this.  Docherty stares back.  A lifeline.  But 
           at what price?  She shakes her head.

                                 JOSIE
                        I’m sorry, Tom.  I can't.  I can’t 
                        forget about it.  Not anymore.

           Docherty lowers his eyes.  Stung by her rejection.

                                 DOCHERTY
                        I always loved you, Josie Deumann.

           Josie’s lip quivers.

                                 JOSIE
                        You’ll make sure Kyle’s alright?  
                        To look after Ma?

           Docherty looks back up.  His jaw tight.  He nods.  Means it.

           She turns away.  Watches the glimmer of sunlight come over 
           the horizon.  Tom follows her gaze out the window.

           JOSIE’S FACE

           Framed in the helicopter window as it banks away from us 
           and...

           Arcs out across the infinite icy wilderness.

           Heading for the waking sun.

                                                            FADE TO BLACK

                                           THE END
