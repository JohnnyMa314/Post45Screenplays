           FADE IN:

           CLOSE ON - A ROLLED UP NEWSPAPER

           Swinging in the HAND that carries it.  Behind the paper a
           MARBLE FLOOR becomes an ELEVATOR FLOOR.

           The carrier taps the paper against his leg as the elevator
           moves.

           The elevator floor becomes a CARPETED HALLWAY.  The hand
           drops the paper in front of a door then reaches into a BAG
           and pulls out ANOTHER NEWSPAPER.

           The carrier walks down the hallway and does this a second
           time, then a third.  At the fourth door -

           INT. BRANDILL TOWERS - HALLWAY - DAY

           The paper lands at the feet of DAVE MONROE, 35, a friendly
           policeman doing SUDOKU in a FOLDING CHAIR.

                                 DAVE
                        My hand is here.

           PEDRO, 28, the newspaper delivery man, answers.

                                 PEDRO
                        I like to see you work for it.
                            (re: Sudoku)
                        You on Advanced yet?

                                 DAVE
                        They should call the goddamn Medium
                        level Advanced, just to fluff the
                        ego.  Label the next one Genius.

                                 PEDRO
                        It's all about celebrating mediocrity,
                        huh Dave?

           Pedro continues down the hall.  Dave picks up the paper and
           opens the door behind him.

           INT. MAURICE'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - DAY

           Dave steps into the swank apartment.

                                 DAVE
                        Mr. Lunel-Caspi?  I have your paper.

           MAURICE LUNEL-CASPI, 60, distinguished, French, and
           overbearing, appears in a SILK ROBE.
                                 MAURICE
                        He's late.  Again.

           Maurice grabs the newspaper and looks at the front page,
           clearly disappointed in what he sees.  He rummages the paper
           until he finds what he wants.

                                 MAURICE (CONT'D)
                        Page three beneath the fold.  A
                        national insult.

           Maurice steps into the

           LIVING ROOM

           And cuts out the article.  Dave awkwardly watches an ANKLE
           MONITOR poke out from beneath Maurice's robe.  

           Maurice tapes the clipping to a WALL COLLAGE of news items. 
           They read:

           -- "Head of French National Assembly Arrested in New York
           for Sex Assault."

           -- "Maurice Lunel-Caspi: 'I did not attack that maid.'"

           -- "MLC suspends campaign for French president"

                                 DAVE
                        Any big news?

                                 MAURICE
                        Does the most overpaid doorman in
                        New York want a hot tip to sell the
                        Post?

                                 DAVE
                        I'm a police officer.

                                 MAURICE
                        Whose job is to sit outside my door.  

           Dave turns to leave.

                                 MAURICE (CONT'D)
                        Third page beneath the fold.  There's
                        your answer.
                            (off Dave's look)
                        No new news.  

                                 DAVE
                        Your robe is ugly.
                                 MAURICE
                        Remember my lawyer's sending someone
                        at two.

           The door shuts behind Dave.

           Maurice stares at the wall, bored.  He scratches his ankle. 
           The skin around the monitor is irritated from his nails.

           Maurice flops onto the couch and flips through the paper.

           Maurice looks over at an interior DOORWAY.  He takes the
           newspaper and walks over.

           Maurice almost knocks, then fixes his robe and hair.  He
           knocks.

           No answer.

           Maurice knocks again.

                                 EDITH (O.S.)
                        Go away.

           Maurice opens the door.

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - DAY

           EDITH RIVET, 55, Maurice's commanding wife, rises from her
           LEATHER CHAIR and marches away from her LAPTOP.  She wears a
           BUSINESS SUIT and speaks with an ambiguous international
           accent.

                                 EDITH
                        We have one rule in this apartment. 
                        One rule.

                                 MAURICE
                        I saw an article you might find
                        useful.

           Edith starts pushing Maurice out of the room.

                                 EDITH
                        Wait until I come into the kitchen,
                        then show it to me.  Or, if it can't
                        wait, email me.

                                 MAURICE
                        You want me to email you from the
                        living room?

                                 EDITH
                        I want you to walk into the living
                        room.
                                 MAURICE
                        I will if you look at the article.

                                 EDITH
                        I'll look at it in the living room.

           Maurice makes a courteous gesture toward the door.

                                 MAURICE
                        After you.

                                 EDITH
                        Cut the gentleman crap and walk in
                        front of me.

           Maurice walks ahead.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Maurice steps into the living room.  Edith slams the door on
           him.  Maurice tries to open it.  Locked.

                                 MAURICE
                        You're a fucking child, Edith!

                                 EDITH (O.S.)
                        Keep sweet talking.

           Maurice steps away from the door and puts the paper on the
           table.  He fidgets, sits, stands, and sits.

           Edith marches out toward the front door.

                                 MAURICE
                        I'll just put the article aside then.

                                 EDITH
                        You look like a lazy slob.  Why don't
                        you get dressed?

                                 MAURICE
                        For what?  In case I bump into someone
                        I know in the bathroom?

                                 EDITH
                        Just because you can't go outside,
                        doesn't mean you have to give up on
                        having a day.  Maybe if you get
                        dressed you'll get some work done on
                        your book.

                                 MAURICE
                        I'll get work done if you look at
                        the article.
           Edith walks over and looks at the paper.

                                 EDITH
                        Which one?

           Maurice grabs a bejeweled PEN out of Edith's purse and circles
           an article.  Edith snatches the pen back.

                                 EDITH (CONT'D)
                        Watch the Visconti.

                                 MAURICE
                        Why don't you carry expensive jewelry
                        like a normal woman?

                                 EDITH
                        The pen is mightier than the earring.

           Edith drops her pen in her bag and looks at the article. 
           The headline reads, "Sale of news blog 'The Euro Post' drives
           stock price beyond value."  Edith brushes it aside.

                                 MAURICE
                        They say you're wasting our money.

                                 EDITH
                        My money.

                                 MAURICE
                        You don't think you should even read
                        it?

                                 EDITH
                        If I deem a company worth acquiring,
                        trust that it is.

           Edith puts on her coat and starts to leave.

                                 MAURICE
                        I'm going to work from the bedroom
                        today.

           Edith stops.

                                 EDITH
                        If you go in there, I'll know.

                                 MAURICE
                        You hid a camera?

                                 EDITH
                        I'll smell it on you.
                                 MAURICE
                        You're out all day while I'm stuck
                        here.  It doesn't make sense to let
                        the nice room go to waste.

                                 EDITH
                        If we're forced to share an apartment
                        because of your disgusting behavior-

                                 MAURICE
                        -I'm a victim of baseless accusation.

                                 EDITH
                        Promise me that you won't go in my
                        room.

           Maurice squirms.

                                 MAURICE
                        Fine.

                                 EDITH
                            (re: wall collage)
                        You wouldn't want to separate yourself
                        from this monument of self worship.

                                 MAURICE
                        You mean my comic collage of slander
                        leveled against me?

                                 EDITH
                        And don't sit around bored all day. 
                        Only boring people get bored by their
                        own company.

           As Edith turns to leave, Maurice reaches under her arm and
           steals her Visconti pen out of her purse.

           Edith leaves.

           Maurice takes the pen and shoves it down his pants.  He rubs
           the pen back and forth, then takes it out and sniffs it.  He
           drops the pen on the table with a satisfied grin.

           Maurice walks over to the collage and stares at it.

           His eyes wander to a PICTURE of him in a New York perp walk. 
           He has a slight paunch in the photo.

           Maurice looks down and sucks in his gut.  He holds it for a
           second then exhales.

           Maurice flops onto the couch and opens his LAPTOP.  He taps
           the top of the laptop, too distracted to work.  He closes
           the laptop.  He looks bored.  
           He picks up the TELEVISION REMOTE and turns on the TELEVISION.

           The TV turns onto some bland financial news.  Maurice channel
           browses until it lands on a news show where a female HOST,
           45, is conducting an interview with JAQUELINE LUNEL-CASPI,
           26, identified on screen as: "Daughter of MLC and Edith
           Rivet."

                                 JAQUELINE (V.O.)
                        He's a pig.  My father is a pig.

           The STUDIO AUDIENCE cheers.

                                 HOST (V.O.)
                        So in the opinion of MLC's daughter,
                        MLC is guilty?

                                 JAQUELINE (V.O.)
                        That's for the jury to decide.  I
                        will say I don't let my friends near
                        that snake.

           Maurice picks up his PHONE and dials.

                                 MAURICE
                            (dialing)
                        Pig.  Snake.  Stop mixing metaphors.
                            (talking into phone)
                        Edith, thank you for not picking up. 
                        I didn't want to talk to you either. 
                        Jaqueline's at it again.  Will you
                        call her?

           Maurice hangs up the phone.

                                 JAQUELINE (V.O.)
                        I think one of the great things about
                        your country, and why I am happy to
                        be studying here, is that you call
                        your leaders to task on their sexual
                        misconduct.  You end their careers. 
                        We need more of that in Europe.

                                 HOST (V.O.)
                        Let's get back to your mother, a
                        personal hero and a feminist icon. 
                        Why is she still with him?  And will
                        this trial impact her upcoming
                        purchase of The Euro Post?

           Maurice turns off the TV and sits for a moment.  He walks
           into the
           SECOND BEDROOM

           Which is much more modest than Edith's room.  He opens the
           top drawer of his DRESSER.

           The drawer is filled with socks, rolled and color-coded from
           light to dark.  Maurice starts reorganizing them from dark
           to light.

           Maurice closes the drawer and opens the CLOSET.

           The closet contains clothes also organized by shade and color.

           Maurice takes out a pair of SLACKS and walks with them back
           into the --

           LIVING ROOM

           Where Maurice starts to put on the pants.  He changes his
           mind and drops them on the floor.

           Maurice returns to the couch and opens his laptop.  He taps
           the top of the screen, and closes it again.

           Maurice walks over to the SIDEBOARD and pours himself a
           BRANDY.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - LATER

           The television shows a French channel covering a soccer match.

           Maurice lies on the floor staring at the ceiling with his
           feet on the couch.  Next to him are a somewhat depleted BOTTLE
           of Brandy and his glass.

           There's a KNOCK on the front door.

                                 DAVE (O.S.)
                        Mr. Lunel-Caspi?

           Maurice snaps out of his daze and stands as Dave enters.

                                 DAVE (CONT'D)
                        The legal associate is here.

           Maurice fixes his robe and hair.

                                 MAURICE
                        Send her in.

                                 DAVE
                        Don't you want to get dressed first?

                                 MAURICE
                        I'll consider it.
           Dave shakes his head and exits.  Maurice sits on the arm of
           the couch with his legs spread a little too wide.

           BECKY, 25, pretty in a tight outfit that stretches the limits
           of professional, strolls in.

                                 MAURICE (CONT'D)
                        Welcome to the lonely castle.

                                 BECKY
                        That's quite an entrance you have.

                                 MAURICE
                        Don't worry about Dave.  He's
                        harmless.

                                 BECKY
                        Maybe you could use some legal advice.

                                 MAURICE
                        Then, should we get down to business-

                                 BECKY
                        -Becky

                                 MAURICE
                        I prefer Rachel.

                                 RACHEL A.K.A. BECKY
                        Whatever.

                                 MAURICE
                        Rachel, do you want to take off that
                        pretty outfit?

                                 RACHEL
                        Isn't he a cop?

                                 MAURICE
                        If you're worried about Dave-

           Maurice reaches into his robe's pocket and pulls out a WAD
           of HUNDREDS.  He drops them on the table.

                                 MAURICE (CONT'D)
                        -You could always do this pro-bono. 
                        I believe that takes care of the
                        legality.

           Rachel looks at the money.

                                 MAURICE (CONT'D)
                        I put in extra for the added
                        circumstances.
           Rachel picks up the money and fans it.  She drops the cash
           in her PURSE.

                                 RACHEL
                        Do I recognize you?

                                 MAURICE
                        Why don't you take off that pretty
                        outfit?

           Rachel looks toward the front door nervously.  She looks at
           the master bedroom door.

                                 RACHEL
                        Is that the bedroom?

                                 MAURICE
                        No, it's this one.

           Maurice leads Rachel into the

           SECOND BEDROOM

           And sits on the edge of the bed.  Rachel moves toward him.

                                 MAURICE
                        Stop.  Stand back.

           She does.

                                 MAURICE (CONT'D)
                        Take off the left shoe first.  Leave
                        your right shoe.  Now your bracelet.

           LATER

           Rachel awkwardly tosses aside her undershirt, leaving her
           trying to balance in her bra and panties on one high heel.

                                 MAURICE (CONT'D)
                        You may now take off your right shoe.

           She does.  She finds this creepy.

                                 RACHEL
                        You're not going to hurt me?

                                 MAURICE
                        I'm offended you would ask.  There's
                        a police officer right outside. 
                        Crawl to me.

           Rachel crawls to him.  Maurice stands.
                                 MAURICE (CONT'D)
                        Take off my robe.

           LATER

           Rachel rides Maurice as he lies passively, his head propped
           up by multiple pillows.  He watches her without contributing
           any motion to the sex.

           Maurice hears the FRONT DOOR CLOSE.  He tosses Rachel off
           him and covers her mouth.

                                 MAURICE (CONT'D)
                        Shhhhhh.

           They listen.  Someone rustles through the living room.

           Maurice locks the bedroom door.

                                 EDITH (O.S.)
                        Maurice?  Are you in there?

                                 MAURICE
                        Yes, darling.

           Rachel stifles a laugh.  Maurice glares at her.

                                 EDITH (O.S.)
                        Did you steal my pen?

                                 MAURICE
                        How can I steal our shared property?

                                 EDITH (O.S.)
                        I had a panic when I couldn't find
                        it.  That's not funny.

           Edith tries to open the door.

                                 EDITH (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        Why is the door locked?

                                 MAURICE
                        I'm not dressed.

                                 EDITH (O.S.)
                        You haven't been dressed in days.

                                 MAURICE
                        I'll be out soon.

                                 EDITH (O.S.)
                        Never mind.  I have the pen.
           Maurice hears Edith walk out of the apartment and close the
           front door.  Maurice sighs with relief.

                                 RACHEL
                        I should go.

                                 MAURICE
                        Let's try you facing the other
                        direction.

           LATER

           Maurice lounges as Rachel gets dressed post-coitus.

                                 RACHEL
                        So, what do you do?

                                 MAURICE
                        Would you believe I'm a civil servant?

                                 RACHEL
                        I've had politician clients.

                                 MAURICE
                        But I'll wager none of them were
                        real civil servants.

                                 RACHEL
                        What they get you on?

                                 MAURICE
                        Nothing.  I'm innocent.

                                 RACHEL
                        Of course you are.

           Maurice closes his robe and leads Rachel into the

           LIVING ROOM

           Where they see Edith sitting on the couch and waiting.

                                 MAURICE
                        Edith, this is Becky, an associate
                        from Nick's office.

                                 EDITH
                            (to Becky)
                        You can leave.

           Becky hightails it out.

                                 EDITH (CONT'D)
                        I don't want to hear an explanation.
                                 MAURICE
                        I don't have one.

                                 EDITH
                        And you took my pen.

                                 MAURICE
                        It would seem you have better things
                        to be mad about.

                                 EDITH
                        Pen, prostitute, they're the same
                        thing.  Careless, risky behavior
                        that effects us both.

                                 MAURICE
                        Are you saying I should have been
                        more discrete?

                                 EDITH
                        Why would you do something that might
                        bring me back?

                                 MAURICE
                        I didn't think you'd come back for
                        the pen.

                                 EDITH
                        But it was a chance.  Just like Dave
                        coming in and finding you fucking. 
                        You had to skirt the danger.  Did
                        you pay with a credit card?

                                 MAURICE
                        I gave cash.

                                 EDITH
                        Bravo.  What if she'd been an
                        undercover cop?  You don't think
                        you're a high value target?  Maurice
                        Lunel-Caspi, awaiting trial in New
                        York for attempted rape and soliciting
                        prostitution.  They'd have a field
                        day.

                                 MAURICE
                        That would be hard on you.

                                 EDITH
                        And Dave just let her right by. 
                        What a moron of a doorman.

                                 MAURICE
                        He's a police officer.
                                 EDITH
                        He's a buffoon.  

           Edith marches to the front door.

           INT. BRANDILL TOWERS - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Edith opens the door and fakes a smile to Dave.

                                 EDITH
                        Dave, honey-

                                 DAVE
                        Yes, Ms. Rivet?

                                 EDITH
                        Did you happen to check that woman's
                        credentials?

                                 DAVE
                        Was she not supposed to be here?

                                 EDITH
                        No, of course she was supposed to be
                        here.

                                 DAVE
                        Because if someone came in who wasn't,
                        I have to report that.

                                 EDITH
                        She was supposed to be here, and if
                        you'd asked her for an ID, she would
                        have had one, but you are supposed
                        to confirm everyone before they come
                        in.

                                 DAVE
                        I don't understand what the problem
                        is.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Edith shuts the door and walks back to Maurice.

                                 EDITH
                        I'm going to have to start working
                        from here.

                                 MAURICE
                        Now, let's not over-react.

                                 EDITH
                        You think I want to?  You can't be
                        left alone.
                                 MAURICE
                        I've learned my lesson.  I'll work
                        on my book.

                                 EDITH
                        I will not be married to a sex
                        offender.

                                 MAURICE
                        The good news is you aren't.

                                 EDITH
                        I know, she misinterpreted the whole
                        thing.  Here's something you may not
                        realize.  Upstanding world leaders
                        don't make passes at hotel maids. 
                        Even if they think the maid might
                        enjoy their wrinkled body.

                                 MAURICE
                        Why don't you go back to France?

                                 EDITH
                        So they can pull your bail?

                                 MAURICE
                        I didn't ask the judge to make it
                        contingent on your presence.

                                 EDITH
                        Fucking sicko.  No, the head of the
                        National Assembly is not going to
                        spend three weeks in Rikers jail. 
                        It's bad enough that you let them
                        photograph you in that ridiculous
                        perp walk.

                                 MAURICE
                        It's a grand New York tradition.

                                 EDITH
                        It's barbaric.  How is a person
                        innocent until proven guilty when
                        they splash photos everywhere with
                        handcuffs?

                                 MAURICE
                        Finally, something we agree on.

                                 EDITH
                        I'll be in my bedroom working.  You
                        can reach me on email.

           Edith goes into her bedroom and slams the door.
           INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Maurice sits on the couch in front of his computer.  He is
           wearing actual pants and an actual shirt.  He stares at the
           screen.  He taps the top of the computer.  He looks at his
           NOTE CARDS on the table.

           One note card reads, "collectivist necessity."  Another reads,
           "adapting automation."

           Maurice types for a second then leans back.  He stands and
           walks to the master bedroom.  He knocks.

                                 EDITH (O.S.)
                        Send me an email.

                                 MAURICE
                        I did.

           Maurice hears typing.

                                 EDITH
                        I've replied.

           Maurice returns to the computer.

           Maurice looks at his email and sees a NEW MESSAGE from Edith. 
           He opens it.  His original email reads, "Come into the living
           room."  Her reply reads, "eat shit and die."  There's an
           ATTACHMENT labeled, "Maurice."  Maurice opens the file. 
           It's a picture of a MONKEY EATING SHIT.

           Maurice returns to the bedroom and knocks again.

                                 EDITH (CONT'D)
                        Email.

           Maurice keeps knocking.  Edith burst out into the living
           room.  She looks as though she's been crying.

                                 EDITH (CONT'D)
                        What?

                                 MAURICE
                        Have you been crying?

                                 EDITH
                        Fuck you.

           Maurice gestures for Edith to sit.  She does.

                                 MAURICE
                        I want to help with your acquisition
                        of Euro Post.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 MAURICE (CONT'D)
                        I know Pierre pretty well.  I think
                        we can get their editorial staff to
                        endorse you.

                                 EDITH
                        I don't need your help.

                                 MAURICE
                        Then help me with my book.

           Edith hesitates.

                                 MAURICE (CONT'D)
                        I can spam you all day.

                                 EDITH
                        What's the last thing you wrote?

                                 MAURICE
                        Chapter two.

                                 EDITH
                        So, you're on chapter three?

                                 MAURICE
                        No, I mean I wrote the chapter
                        heading.  "Chapter two."

                                 EDITH
                        Where are you stuck?

                                 MAURICE
                        Let me read you some of what I have
                        so far.
                            (reading)
                        "The collective spirit is an
                        unavoidable pre-condition for the
                        expansion of the spirit of freedom-"

                                 EDITH
                            (interrupting)
                        It's clunky.

                                 MAURICE
                        What is?

                                 EDITH
                        The sentence.

                                 MAURICE
                        Don't worry about the sentence. 
                        Just let me keep going.

                                 MAURICE (CONT'D)
                        "The social safety nets created, in
                        and of their own activities, are of
                        secondary value, their primarily
                        value is in the knowledge of their
                        existence-"

                                 EDITH
                        -It's awful.

                                 MAURICE
                        Let me read the whole paragraph.

                                 EDITH
                        It's a terrible sentence.

                                 MAURICE
                        It gets better.  "It is in that
                        knowledge that the spirit of the
                        group liberates the spirit of the
                        individual, beyond the essentials of
                        living into the essence of living-"

                                 EDITH
                        -I can't listen to this shit.

           Edith goes back into her bedroom.

           Maurice stares at his laptop, deflated.  He closes the
           computer and carries it into the

           SECOND BEDROOM

           Where he opens it on the bed.

           Maurice opens a LIVE SEX CHAT WINDOW on the computer.  There's
           a WOMAN IN LINGERIE looking bored.

                                 WOMAN IN LINGERIE (V.O.)
                        Hi there handsome.

                                 MAURICE
                        Don't talk until I say so.

                                 WOMAN IN LINGERIE (V.O.)
                        Oh, you're a kinky one.

           Maurice takes off his shirt.

                                 MAURICE
                        Stand up and turn around.

           Maurice hears the front door and muffled hellos.

           Maurice shuts the laptop.
                                 MAURICE (CONT'D)
                        Merde.

           There's a KNOCK on his door.

                                 EDITH (O.S.)
                        Maurice, Jaqueline and Nick are here.

                                 MAURICE
                        Hold on.

           Maurice starts to put his shirt on.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Maurice steps out to see Edith, Jaqueline, and NICOLAS DENMAR,
           55, Maurice's slick lawyer.

                                 MAURICE
                            (to Jaqueline)
                        Nice to see you somewhere other than
                        my television.

                                 JAQUELINE
                        No it isn't.

                                 EDITH
                            (to Jaqueline)
                        Don't sit like that.

           Jaqueline recrosses her legs.

                                 NICK
                        Shall we begin?

                                 EDITH
                        What kind of question is that?  Just
                        start so we can finish.

                                 MAURICE
                        I don't know.  Are we sure Jaqueline
                        isn't recording us?

                                 JAQUELINE
                        Have you even listened to my
                        interviews?

                                 MAURICE
                        They warm my heart on mute.  Maybe
                        Dave should frisk her for devices.

                                 JAQUELINE
                        Funny.  Freud said nasty humor comes
                        from guilt.
                                 EDITH
                        Dave has been swapped out for another
                        fellow.

                                 MAURICE
                        What?  Have we vetted this one?

                                 EDITH
                            (sarcastic)
                        He went through twelve rounds of
                        interviews and a Rorschach test. 
                        Sit.

           Edith gestures for Nick to begin.  Maurice marches away from
           the conversation.

           INT. BRANDILL TOWERS - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Maurice opens the door and sees JUSTIN WYATT, 42, a different
           police officer in Dave's chair.

                                 MAURICE
                        Who are you?

           Justin folds his MAGAZINE and looks up defiantly.

                                 JUSTIN
                        Officer Justin Wyatt.

                                 MAURICE
                        You don't stand for a world leader.

                                 JUSTIN
                        Not all of them.

                                 MAURICE
                        Where's Dave?

                                 JUSTIN
                        Downstairs.  We traded posts.

                                 MAURICE
                        You mean I have two men guarding me?

                                 JUSTIN
                        Don't flatter yourself.  Mr. Birke
                        on the seventh floor is awaiting
                        trial for insider trading.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Maurice bursts in on his impatient family and lawyer.
                                 MAURICE
                        We're not the only people under house
                        arrest in the building.

                                 EDITH
                        Yes, Kenneth Birke on the seventh
                        floor.

                                 MAURICE
                        You knew about this?

                                 JAQUELINE
                        There's no "we" under house arrest.  

                                 MAURICE
                        We should invite him to dinner.

                                 EDITH
                        Nicolas, control your client.

                                 JAQUELINE
                        Wouldn't the whole house arrest
                        situation make that a little
                        impossible?

                                 MAURICE
                        He's only in for insider trading,
                        not attempted rape.  I wouldn't be
                        surprised if he has building
                        privileges.

           Edith gives Nick a "hurry up" tap on the shoulder.

                                 NICK
                        Maurice, we're here for Jaqueline.

           Nick puts a BAG OF BAGELS on the table.  Maurice sits and
           starts in on them.

                                 NICK (CONT'D)
                        Discrediting these charges is a team
                        effort.  That means all of you have
                        to work together.

                                 MAURICE
                        Jaqueline, you could come to the
                        dinner.

                                 JAQUELINE
                        Why would I have dinner with an inside
                        trader?

                        You never want to see just me.  This
                        would take some pressure off.

                        Don't you think it would be nice to
                        have company?

                                 EDITH
                        If I want company, I'll leave the

                        Nicolas, do you bill by the hour?

                                 NICK
                        Absolutely.

                                 MAURICE
                        Then he won't mind waiting.  Edith,
                        go knock on their door.

                                 JAQUELINE
                        It's not enough she stands by you,
                        you want her to run errands.

                        When you make a jab like that, lean
                        forward.  It will make you more
                        threatening.  When you lean back
                        that way, it comes off as a defensive
                        bark from a scared little girl.

                                 MAURICE
                        Nicolas, why don't you take a stab
                        at the conversation?

                                 NICK
                        I want to update you on the status
                        of the trial.  Things are going about
                        as well as could be expected, and I
                        remain cautiously optimistic.

                        maligning your father in the public

                        He should just plead guilty.

                        Ha.

                        Of course I do!  Why else would I be
                        saying these things on TV?

                                 MAURICE
                        Because you're an attention hog.

                        It's not polite to psychoanalyze
                        your parent.  I think there's a
                        commandment against it.

                        What have I said to suggest I think
                        you're innocent?

                        I'll tell you what happened.

                        She needs to hear me tell the story.

                        Our strategy involves having you
                        plead the fifth and avoid the stand. 
                        We'll discredit the maid, and you
                        will never have to tell your side. 
                        That means I don't need to hear your

                        It's irrelevant.

                        The only thing that matters is
                        discrediting this maid.

                        She has a name.  It's Ama Parker.

                                 EDITH
                        Good for her.

                                 JAQUELINE
                        Excuse me?

                                 EDITH
                        I mean, most people get to have their
                        own name, but good for her that she
                        has one too.

                        By some strange circumstance, it
                        appears you may.  Do you choose to
                        be the child of a world leader and a
                        business mogul, both of whom will
                        lovingly hand you a golden career as
                        a graduation present?  Or do you
                        choose to be the daughter of a
                        criminal deviant and his disgraced
                        wife?  Neither of whom will be able
                        to make a single call on your behalf?

                                 JAQUELINE
                        I may have a blossoming career as a
                        TV pundit.

           Maurice and Edith chuckle.

                        I'm proud of your instinct for self
                        promotion, but do you really think
                        you're going to get calls you after
                        this trial?

                        Nick, what advice do you give when
                        your clients become overly emotional
                        in court?

                                 NICK
                        I usually tell them to imagine they're
                        in a long line at the DMV.  I find
                        that brings out the perfect balance
                        of indignant restraint.

                                 MAURICE
                        I'll make some phone calls for you.

                        out of school.

                        Don't humor me to control me.  You
                        hated it when I minored in psychology. 
                        You said it was soft.

                        You see your father not doing his
                        part, and you think, "if he's going
                        to let the Lunel-Caspi ship sink,
                        why should I stay onboard?"

                        That's my wall of vindication.

                                 NICK
                        She's right.  It sends a message
                        that you are not sympathetic with
                        the victim.

                                 MAURICE
                        Of course I'm not sympathetic with
                        the victim.  She's trying to frame
                        me!  If you have a problem with it,
                        don't bring journalists into my living

                        It's not about the collage, it's
                        about a pattern of behavior.

                                 MAURICE
                        My behavior is not the issue.  The
                        issue is your competence as a lawyer.

                                 JAQUELINE
                        Your behavior is the only issue.

                        fine. Doesn't your father deserve a
                        fair trial?

                                 EDITH
                        And can he get a fair trial if you
                        turn public opinion against us?

                                 JAQUELINE
                        Fine.  I'll think about it.
                                 EDITH
                        That's all we can ask.

                                 MAURICE
                        No, it's not all we can ask.  We can
                        ask for some goddamn loyalty.

                                 EDITH
                            (to Maurice)
                        Recognize a win.

                                 MAURICE
                            (to Nick)
                        Come into the other room with me.

                                 NICK
                        What for?

                                 MAURICE
                        I need some legal counsel.  Away
                        from their biased ears.

           Maurice leads Nick toward the master bedroom.

                                 EDITH
                        Not that one.

           Maurice nods and leads Nick into the second bedroom.

                                 JAQUELINE
                        If you had any self-respect, you'd
                        leave him.

                                 EDITH
                        Jaqueline, when you become married,
                        you will be perfectly free to leave
                        your own husband.  I'll support you
                        when you do.  In the meantime, don't
                        tell me to leave mine.

           INT. SECOND BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Maurice pulls Nicolas over by the bed.

                                 MAURICE
                        You have to get me a girl up here.

                                 NICK
                        I thought you wanted to talk about
                        the case.

                                 MAURICE
                        Are there any major changes?
                                 NICK
                        No.

                                 MAURICE
                        Then fuck the case.  I'm going crazy
                        up here.  Edith's always watching
                        me.

                                 NICK
                        So are the police.

                                 MAURICE
                        That's why you need to help.  Dress
                        her up like a lawyer.  That will get
                        her by.

                                 NICK
                        And implicate the firm?

                                 MAURICE
                        I did it before.  The doorman was
                        completely fooled.

                                 NICK
                        That could come back to me!

                                 MAURICE
                        It was only Edith who caught on. 
                        She's smarter than a cop.

                                 NICK
                        I don't want you telling me things
                        like this.

                                 MAURICE
                        I'm climbing the walls.  You're my
                        lawyer and a friend.  You're supposed
                        to take care of me.  Can't you see
                        I'm suffering?

                                 NICK
                        The issue is a non starter.

                                 MAURICE
                        You'll have to pay for her.  My bank
                        records are being looked at.  I can
                        pay you back.

           Nicolas opens the door and walks into the

           LIVING ROOM

           Maurice follows.
                                 MAURICE (CONT'D)
                        Good news, family.  Father's case is
                        looking better.

           Nicolas looks at Maurice like, "what are you talking about?"

                                 EDITH
                        In just that time?

                                 MAURICE
                        The maid is a hussy, lying bitch,
                        and she's going to crack.

                                 JAQUELINE
                        That the legal term?

                                 MAURICE
                        Nick, is that the legal term?

           Nicolas starts packing up.

                                 NICK
                            (to Edith)
                        Any news with the Euro Post?

                                 EDITH
                        Stick to the trial.

                                 NICK
                        All I'm saying is Denmar and
                        Associates has a corporate division. 
                        We'd love to pitch you.

                                 EDITH
                        My husband and I believe a healthy
                        marriage rests on separate friends
                        and separate lawyers.  Especially
                        when a lawyer can't control his
                        client.

                                 JAQUELINE
                        Do you know how proud I used to be
                        to introduce myself?

                                 MAURICE
                            (to Nick)
                        I like that you can't control me.

                                 JAQUELINE
                        Lunel-Caspi.  That's all I had to
                        say when I entered a room, and I
                        owned the floor.  Now, I avoid it. 
                        I just say Jaqueline.
                                 MAURICE
                        I thought most young people introduced
                        themselves by first name.

                                 JAQUELINE
                        I am branded with your last name. 
                        And that name is shit.  And you have
                        fucked me just as surely as Ama
                        Parker.

                                 MAURICE
                        I don't look at it that way.

                                 JAQUELINE
                        The truth is never how you see things.

           Jaqueline leaves.

                                 NICK
                        Keep the bagels.

           Nicolas leaves.

                                 EDITH
                        I have to go to a meeting.

                                 MAURICE
                        What about?

                                 EDITH
                        I'm buying some stupid food channel.

                                 MAURICE
                        They'll wait.  Sit with me.

                                 EDITH
                        Pass.

                                 MAURICE
                        I'll be in your room.

           Edith sits next to him.

                                 EDITH
                        What?

                                 MAURICE
                        I'm a good father.

                                 EDITH
                        It all depends on where you put the
                        bar.
                                 MAURICE
                        I haven't slept with any of her
                        friends.

                                 EDITH
                        There's an achievement.

                                 MAURICE
                        I hit on Mary, but she rejected me.

           Edith gets up to leave.

                                 MAURICE (CONT'D)
                        You see, I can take no.  I wouldn't
                        force myself on someone.

                                 EDITH
                        You're a pillar of virtue.

                                 MAURICE
                        If I can't convince my family, how
                        can I convince anyone?

           Edith's face become a little pitying.

                                 MAURICE (CONT'D)
                        What is that look?

                                 EDITH
                        What look?

                                 MAURICE
                        Is that pity?  Is that what pity
                        looks like on your face?

                                 EDITH
                        I suppose a little.

           Maurice stands.

                                 MAURICE
                        Don't fucking pity me.  I am Maurice
                        fucking Lunel-Caspi.  Head of the
                        French fucking National Assembly. 
                        One of the most powerful fucking men
                        in the world.  And a champion and
                        crusader for the downtrodden.

                                 EDITH
                        I like how you just tacked that on.

                                 MAURICE
                        I'm also a fantastic fucking dinner
                        host, and I'm going to invite that
                        inside trader to dinner.
                                 EDITH
                        I hope you cook for them.

                                 MAURICE
                        We'll fucking order take-out.  It's
                        New York.

           Maurice marches to the PHONE and picks it up.  Dials.

                                 MAURICE (CONT'D)
                            (into phone)
                        Hello, Marcus?...  Can you connect
                        me with Ken Birke's
                        apartment?...Thanks...Hello, is this
                        Ken?...  It's Maurice Lunel-Caspi
                        from upstairs?...  You knew we were
                        in the same building?...  Well, I'm
                        glad you follow the news...Look, do
                        you have a wife?...  Her name's Nina,
                        that's great.  My wife's name is
                        Edith.  Seeing as we're both brothers
                        in ankle monitors, I'd like to invite
                        you and Nina over for dinner
                        tonight...eight o'clock...Because
                        any earlier is boorish...Then it
                        will have to be tomorrow...Okay, see
                        you tomorrow at eight.

           Maurice triumphantly looks toward Edith, only to discover
           she's already left.

           Maurice flops onto the couch.  He looks around, seeming bored. 
           He gets up and walks into the second bedroom.

           INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

           Maurice, looking like he just woke up, stumbles in wearing
           his robe and slippers.  He opens the cabinet and takes out
           some CEREAL.  

           He opens the fridge and takes out some MILK.  He sniffs the
           milk, decides it's good enough, and pours it on his cereal. 
           He takes a bite, then picks up the bowl and walks while
           eating, leaving the milk out.  

           He passes through the

           LIVING ROOM

           Then opens the front door.

           INT. BRANDILL TOWERS - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           Maurice sees Justin and addresses him with a mouth full of
           cereal.
                                 MAURICE
                            (muffled)
                        Is my paper here yet?

                                 JUSTIN
                        Excuse me.

                                 MAURICE
                        My paper?

           Justin nods at the PAPER, but doesn't do anything.  Neither
           does Maurice.  Justin kicks it to Maurice.  Maurice kicks it
           back.  

           Justin begrudgingly lifts it up.  Maurice sees that his hands
           are full, opens his legs and grabs the paper between his
           thighs.

           Maurice pivots and shuffles inside while clutching the paper
           between his legs.

           INT. MAURICE'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - CONTINUOUS

           Maurice kicks the door closed, then opens his legs and drops
           the paper.  Maurice puts the bowl on the floor, picks up the
           paper, and walks into the

           LIVING ROOM

           Where he opens the paper and looks at the front page.  He
           becomes excited and bangs on Edith's door.

                                 MAURICE
                        Edith.  Edith.  We made the front
                        page.

           A SLEEPY GROAN comes from behind the door.

                                 MAURICE (CONT'D)
                        Come out and see it.

                                 EDITH (O.S.)
                        Go away.

                                 MAURICE
                        I'm opening the door.

           Maurice opens the door.

                                 EDITH
                        Go away!

           Maurice closes the door.  He gets his scissors and cuts out
           the article.  He tapes it to his collage.
           The article reads, "National Assembly discusses impeaching
           GLC."

           Maurice exits to his bedroom then returns carrying his laptop. 
           He sits facing the collage and opens the laptop.  He turns
           on the computer.  He presses some buttons, creating the sound
           of a SKYPE DIAL.

                                 FRENCH WOMAN(From Laptop)
                        Bonjour.

                                 MAURICE
                            (French with subtitles)
                        Is Mr. Bonnay available?

                                 FRENCH WOMAN (From Laptop)
                            (French with subtitles)
                        I'm sorry he's out.

                                 MAURICE
                            (French with subtitles)
                        Have him call me.  It's about an
                        amendment to the housing bill.

           Maurice closes the laptop.  He opens it again.  Maurice closes
           the laptop and exits.

           INT. SECOND BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Maurice tosses his laptop onto the bed then drops his robe
           and gets under the covers.  Maurice opens his laptop in bed.

           On the screen, Maurice opens up a SEX CHAT window.  A STRIPPER
           greats him.

                                 STRIPPER
                        Well, hello, handsome.

                                 MAURICE
                        Dance for me.

           The stripper starts dancing.  Maurice watches the screen as
           his eyes flutter in and out of sleep.

           LATER

           Maurice wakes from a nap.  He rolls over and sees his laptop. 
           The stripper sits in the chat window watching Maurice sleep.

                                 STRIPPER
                        Dream about me?

                                 MAURICE
                        How long was I out?
                                 STRIPPER
                        Only four hours.

                                 MAURICE
                        Jesus.  AmEx will love that one.

           Maurice closes the chat window and gets out of bed.  He puts
           on his robe and slippers.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Maurice walks in and sees Edith reviewing SPREADSHEETS on
           the couch.

                                 EDITH
                        I just needed a change of scenery. 
                        I'm not talking to you.

                                 MAURICE
                        Excluding that sentence, I assume.

           Edith keeps reading.

                                 MAURICE (CONT'D)
                        I've always wanted you to be a better
                        listener.

           Edith says nothing.

                                 MAURICE (CONT'D)
                        Perhaps I'll show you my stump speech.  

           Edith says nothing.

                                 MAURICE (CONT'D)
                        You make coffee?

           Edith points to the kitchen.

           KITCHEN

           Maurice pours himself a COFFEE.

                                 MAURICE (CONT'D)
                        The paper this morning, did you see
                        it?  It said that they're talking
                        about impeaching me.

           No response.

                                 MAURICE (CONT'D)
                        Are you excited about our dinner
                        guests?

           No response.
                                 MAURICE (CONT'D)
                        You are coming, right?  I'll take
                        your lack of response as a yes.

                                 EDITH (O.S.)
                        I'm not coming.

           LIVING ROOM

           Maurice walks over sipping his coffee.

                                 MAURICE
                        Well, you lied about the not talking
                        to me thing, so you'll forgive me if
                        I take that as a lie too.

           Edith carries her work into her bedroom.

           Maurice looks momentarily proud, then bored.  He flops onto
           the couch, spilling some of his coffee onto his lap.

                                 MAURICE (CONT'D)
                        Ow!

           SERIES OF SHOTS

           -- Maurice sits in front of his computer, trying to
           concentrate.

           -- Maurice lies on his back with his computer on his knees,
           trying to concentrate.

           -- Maurice walks with his coffee and trips over the cereal
           bowl from earlier.  He spills milk and coffee.

                                 MAURICE (CONT'D)
                        Damn it.

           -- Maurice lies in bed and starts to masturbate.  He gets
           bored and stops.

           INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           Maurice, dressed nicely, sits at an empty DINING ROOM TABLE. 
           He raps his fingers and looks bored.  He hears a KNOCK and
           perks up.

           INT. MAURICE'S APARTMENT - FRONT HALL - MOMENTS LATER

           Maurice walks toward the front door.

                                 MAURICE
                        Coming.  Coming.

           Maurice pauses about five feet from the door.
                                 MAURICE (CONT'D)
                        I'll be right there.  Hold on a sec.

           Maurice stands and waits.

                                 MAURICE (CONT'D)
                        Almost there.

           Maurice waits another second then opens the door.  KEN BIRKE,
           33, enters wearing a TOO HIP SWEATER.  His wife, NINA, 32,
           enters wearing an ARCHITECTURAL DRESS and WIDE RIM GLASSES.

                                 MAURICE (CONT'D)
                        I'm sorry.  I was just in the middle
                        of something.  Everything's so busy. 
                        Come in.

                                 KEN
                        It's rosé.

           Ken hands Maurice a BOTTLE OF WINE.  Maurice jokingly sniffs
           the bottle.

                                 MAURICE
                        Smells fresh.  I'll go put it in the
                        dining room.  Can I take your coats? 
                        Of course, you're not wearing any.

                                 KEN
                        Not too cold in the elevator.  Nina
                        almost wore one anyway.

                                 NINA
                        It looked awesome.

                                 MAURICE
                        I'll just deposit this in the dining
                        room.

           Maurice exits.

                                 NINA
                        The first thing you say is a dig at
                        me?

           Ken ignores her comment.

                                 KEN
                        Is that a Magritte?

                                 NINA
                        It's a Mondrian.  And it's a print.

                                 KEN
                        I know it's a print.
                                 NINA
                        Then don't act impressed.

           Maurice returns.

                                 MAURICE
                        Where are my manners?

           Maurice shakes their hands.

                                 MAURICE (CONT'D)
                        Maurice Lunel-Caspi.

                                 KEN
                        Ken Birke.

                                 NINA
                        Nina.

                                 MAURICE
                        Entré.

           Maurice leads them into the

           LIVING ROOM

           And gestures to the couch.

                                 MAURICE
                        We're just waiting on the Mrs.

           Ken and Nina sit.

                                 KEN
                        This short term rental, where you
                        find your broker?

                                 MAURICE
                        Thinking ahead to your next house
                        arrest?

                                 KEN
                        Ah, well, I suppose you never know.

           Nina shoots Ken a look.  Ken seems anxious and has an
           occasional sniffle. Maurice walks to the SIDEBOARD.

                                 MAURICE
                        You want a drink?  Bourbon, maybe?

                                 KEN
                        Is the Argentine peso worth more
                        than the Bolivian boliviano?
                                 MAURICE
                        Is it?

                                 KEN
                        Last time I checked

                                 NINA
                        I don't drink.

                                 MAURICE
                        Wild American youth.

                                 KEN
                        You should offer her a --

           Ken mimes smoking.

                                 NINA
                        Ken!

                                 MAURICE
                        What's your brand?

                                 NINA
                        Not that kind of smoke.

           Ken looks amused.

                                 MAURICE
                        Oh.  It's been hard for me to walk
                        to Washington Park.

                                 NINA
                        Frankly, with Ken's house arrest-

                                 MAURICE
                        -It's best not to bother with illegal
                        drugs.

                                 NINA
                        That's been our thought.  Kinda crazy,
                        but, you know.

           Maurice hands Ken his drink.

                                 KEN
                        Life saver.

                                 NINA
                        Actually, I will have a drink.

           Ken looks surprised.

                                 MAURICE
                        Excellent.  Bourbon as well?
                                 NINA
                        What are you having?

                                 MAURICE
                        A martini.

                                 NINA
                        Make it two.

                                 MAURICE
                        Don't get lost without me.

           Maurice exits.

                                 KEN
                        You'll drink here but not at Dad's?

                                 NINA
                        They're European.  Chill.

           KITCHEN

           Maurice makes two MARTINIS while he shouts to the other room.

                                 MAURICE
                        Do you like the gym?

           INTERCUT LIVING ROOM / KITCHEN

           Ken gets up and starts looking at Maurice's collage.

                                 KEN
                        What did he say?

                                 MAURICE
                        The gym in the building?  How do you
                        find it?

                                 KEN
                        Four point five out of ten.

                                 NINA
                        We should follow him into the kitchen.

                                 KEN
                        Bah.

           Ken starts thumbing through all of Maurice's STUFF.

                                 NINA
                        What are you doing?

                                 KEN
                        What are you doing?
                                 MAURICE
                        Does it have an elliptical machine?

                                 NINA
                        Not that I've seen.

           Ken looks through Maurice's BOOKS.

                                 NINA (CONT'D)
                        I'm going in.

                                 KEN
                        Suit yourself.

           Nina stands just as Maurice returns with the drinks.

                                 MAURICE
                        Then I don't feel so bad about being
                        stuck up here.

           Maurice notices Ken looking through his shelf.

                                 MAURICE (CONT'D)
                        See anything you like?

                                 KEN
                            (ignoring question)
                        Cheers.

           Ken toasts Maurice and Nina.  Maurice sits next to Nina.

                                 MAURICE
                        You sure you don't want to join the
                        gin crowd?

                                 KEN
                        Bourbon's great.

                                 MAURICE
                        Good man.  I always try to drink the
                        booze of the country I'm staying in. 
                        It shows solidarity.  When I'm in
                        Scotland, I drink Scotch.  When I'm
                        in Japan, I drink Sake.  When I'm in
                        Mexico, I drink the water.

           Nina rests a hand on Maurice's thigh.

                                 NINA
                        But you're drinking a martini.

                                 MAURICE
                        I may switch to bourbon later.  

           Maurice looks at Nina's hand on his thigh.
                                 MAURICE (CONT'D)
                        Where is Edith?

           Maurice goes and knocks on the bedroom door.

                                 EDITH
                        Go away.

           Maurice keeps knocking.

                                 MAURICE
                        Darling, our guests are here.

                                 EDITH (O.S.)
                        Fuck off!

                                 MAURICE
                        We like to use pet names for each
                        other.  I call her cunt mouth.  She
                        calls me fuck face.  It's magic when
                        we kiss.

                                 NINA
                        That's a lovely print you have.

                                 MAURICE
                        It came with the rental.  Like the
                        books.

           Maurice resumes knocking.

                                 MAURICE (CONT'D)
                        Edith, we all miss you.

           Edith throws the door open and stands fuming.

                                 EDITH
                        What?

                                 MAURICE
                        Edith, this is Nina and Ken.

                                 NINA
                        Your husband's been telling us
                        wonderful things about you.

                                 MAURICE
                        Is her scowl not as lovely as I said?

           Edith looks at Nina as though about to snap, then regains
           composure and walks calmly into the room.

                                 KEN
                        Ken Birke.
                                 EDITH
                        Edith.  Don't you two look smart?

                                 MAURICE
                        Edith envies intelligence.

           Edith pours herself a bourbon.

                                 EDITH
                        Refill?

           Edith freshens Ken's drink.

                                 EDITH (CONT'D)
                        Has Maurice been boring you with
                        stories?

                                 NINA
                        I love a good yarn.

                                 MAURICE
                        I was waiting for my audience.

                                 EDITH
                        But I've heard all your stories.

                                 MAURICE
                        That's why I make them up.  At the
                        age of fourteen, I was ranked number
                        one in the world at backgammon.

                                 KEN
                        No.

                                 EDITH
                        He loses at checkers.  But he can
                        wear you down with his chatter.

                                 NINA
                        I think he's a blast.

                                 EDITH
                        Ken, you strike me as a man who speaks
                        his mind.  Is my husband boring?

                                 KEN
                        If you want to share complaints about
                        him, I'm a good listener.

           Edith seems puzzled by this response.

                                 MAURICE
                        Ken, how have you been keeping busy
                        cooped up?
                                 KEN
                        Well, I can't trade O.P.M., so I'm
                        just handling my own portfolio. 
                        Stayin' in the game.

                                 NINA
                            (to Maurice)
                        What have you been doing?

           Nina seems flirtatious.

                                 MAURICE
                        Just plugging away at my book.

                                 KEN
                        What kind of book deal you got?

                                 MAURICE
                        A good one.

                                 KEN
                        I bet you do.

                                 NINA
                        What's it about?

                                 MAURICE
                        The social contract.  How the main
                        value of safety nets is not their
                        actual use so much as a sense of
                        security, allowing people to excel
                        without the fear of penury.  God,
                        why can't I put that in my book?  It
                        always comes out so much clearer
                        when you say it.

                                 EDITH
                        Clearer doesn't make it interesting.

                                 NINA
                        I think it sounds great.

                                 KEN
                        Socialist books make money.

                                 MAURICE
                        What was that?

                                 KEN
                            (catching himself)
                        I don't talk politics.  My bad.

                                 MAURICE
                        You've just started.
                                 KEN
                        Without thinking.

                                 MAURICE
                        You think I can't handle your opinion?

                                 KEN
                        Move on to someone else.

                                 MAURICE
                        Boy, spit it out.

                                 KEN
                        I'm no expert, but dependency breeds
                        dependency.

                                 MAURICE
                        Who would have thought?  A republican
                        in that sweater.

                                 KEN
                        Libertarian.

                                 MAURICE
                        Oh.

                                 KEN
                        Americans don't need to be treated
                        like infants.

                                 NINA
                        Ken will write you an amazon review. 
                        I think the book sounds fab.

                                 EDITH
                        Are you two hungry?

                                 MAURICE
                        Yes, I believe food is part of every
                        good dinner party.

                                 KEN
                        Where's your bathroom?

           INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Ken exhales and loosens his tie.

                                 KEN
                        Fuck.

           Ken takes out a BOTTLE OF RITALIN and pours some on the sink. 
           He crushes them with a TOOTHBRUSH and snorts.
           INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           Maurice, Nina, and Edith sit around a table of ITALIAN FOOD.

                                 NINA
                        I'm sorry about Ken.  He's under a
                        lot of strain.

                                 MAURICE
                        I was more interested in his better
                        half anyway.  Rosé?

           Edith chugs her bourbon and pushes the glass for Maurice to
           fill.

                                 MAURICE (CONT'D)
                        Nina?

                                 NINA
                        Fuck ya.

           Nina takes her new glass and puts it next to her almost full
           martini.

           INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Ken rummages through the medicine cabinet.  He finds a BOTTLE
           OF VIAGRA.

                                 KEN
                        Bingo.

           Ken pulls out his PHONE and snaps a photo of the prescription
           label.  Ken keeps rummaging the bathroom.

           INT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           Maurice, Edith, and Nina eat.

                                 NINA
                            (to Edith)
                        This pasta is great.

                                 MAURICE
                        I ordered it myself.

                                 NINA
                        And this is a great table.  Great
                        room.

                                 EDITH
                        Is your apartment not so nice?

                                 NINA
                        No, it's great.
           They hear a CRASH as Ken trips in the hall.  He enters,
           looking wired.

                                 KEN
                        I, uh, thanks for having us.

           Ken starts eating.  Maurice passes him a glass of wine.

                                 EDITH
                        Are you feeling all right?

           Ken gives a thumbs up.

                                 NINA
                        He's tops.

                                 MAURICE
                        You'll have to tell me what bottom
                        looks like.

                                 KEN
                        Have you hit bottom recently?

                                 MAURICE
                        I've never been better.

                                 KEN
                        I'm sorry, but if we're gonna talk,
                        then we might as well talk, right? 
                        Otherwise, we're not really talking.

                                 MAURICE
                        Edith and I communicate
                        telepathically.

                                 EDITH
                        Is that where these headaches come
                        from?

                                 MAURICE
                        I've been tickling your medulla

                        Ken, don't you love this table?

                                 KEN
                        It's all right.

                                 EDITH
                        You two enjoying Dave?

                                 KEN
                        He's fine.  Don't know why you sent
                        him down.
                                 MAURICE
                        You sent Dave downstairs?

                                 EDITH
                        I did.

                                 MAURICE
                        I thought they rotate guards.

                                 EDITH
                        Policemen.
                            (to Ken and Nina)
                        Dave made a little mistake on our
                        watch.  Nothing that would come up
                        at your apartment, but Maurice is
                        sneakier than he seems.

                                 MAURICE
                        I think they're sneaky too.

                                 EDITH
                        Would you like to know why I sent
                        Dave downstairs?

                                 MAURICE
                        Let's eat in the living room.  It's
                        a casual dinner.

           Maurice takes Ken and Nina's plates out of the room. Edith
           waves that it's okay to leave.

           LIVING ROOM

           The group gathers into the living room and puts food and
           drinks onto the coffee table.

                                 MAURICE
                        Should I put on music?

                                 EDITH
                        Afraid of talking?

                                 NINA
                        Music is good.

                                 EDITH
                            (re: wall collage)
                        Maybe Maurice will show you his
                        original art.

                                 KEN
                        I was looking at that.  Dish about
                        it.

           Maurice walks to the collage.
                                 MAURICE
                        Well, it's my wall of vindication. 
                        Have you been keeping your press
                        clippings?

                                 NINA
                        Ken can't look at them.

                                 MAURICE
                        An innocent soul knows no shame.

                                 KEN
                        They miss any dirt?

                                 EDITH
                        This dinner party.

                                 NINA
                        You are handling your house arrest
                        amazingly well.

                                 MAURICE
                        This is my favorite piece of coverage. 
                        It's a Paris Times editorial about
                        how the French have the good sense
                        not to think the private lives of
                        their politicians have anything to
                        do with public performance.

                                 KEN
                            (to Edith)
                        Don't you own The Paris Times?

                                 MAURICE
                        And this is my least favorite thing
                        on the wall.

           Maurice indicates the infamous PERP WALK PHOTO of Maurice
           being walked to the courthouse in handcuffs.

                                 MAURICE (CONT'D)
                        How, in the land of innocent until
                        proven guilty, they can make a man
                        who is merely accused walk in
                        handcuffs before photographers is
                        beyond me.

                                 EDITH
                        It's grotesque.

                                 MAURICE
                        Ken, did you have to suffer this
                        barbaric tradition?
                                 KEN
                        My lawyer got me out of it.

                                 MAURICE
                        Good man.  Or woman.  They let me
                        out a full half a block from the
                        courthouse so that every newspaper
                        and news network in the world could
                        line up to take photos.  I swear,
                        Home & Garden got a picture of me.

                                 KEN
                        About the only good thing he did. 
                        Fucker's mangling my case.

                                 MAURICE
                        Take my guy, Nicolas Denmar.  He's
                        the best.  As one innocent man to
                        another.

                                 EDITH
                        How on earth do you know he's
                        innocent?

                                 MAURICE
                        The Brandill Towers wouldn't rent to
                        anyone guilty.

                                 NINA
                        Oh, Susan Myer is guilty.

                                 MAURICE
                        Who is Susan Myer?

                                 KEN
                        Computer hacker on the fifth floor.

                                 MAURICE
                        You mean there are three people under
                        house arrest in this very building? 
                        How remarkable is that?  We should
                        start a book club.

                                 KEN
                        What would we read?

                                 MAURICE
                        Miranda rights.

           Nina forces a laugh and puts her hand on Maurice's knee.

                                 NINA
                        It's very nice of you to have us.
                                 EDITH
                        Nina, are you also in finance?

                                 NINA
                        I used to work at Sotheby's.  Now I
                        just sit on museum boards.

                                 MAURICE
                        Why did you stop?

           Ken mimes being pregnant.

                                 MAURICE (CONT'D)
                        You have kids?

                                 KEN
                        Any year now.

                                 EDITH
                        Well then dear, it appears you quit
                        too early.

                                 NINA
                        Honestly, I'm not even sure I want
                        children.

                                 KEN
                        Say again?

                                 NINA
                        What I really want is to re-claim
                        being a stay-at-home wife for the
                        countercultural, urban post-post-
                        feminist.

                                 EDITH
                        Maybe you can turn it into a college
                        major.

                                 KEN
                        She doesn't mean no kids.

                                 NINA
                        Edith, I admire you and all, but we
                        can't all run empires.

                                 MAURICE
                        Not unless they were very small.

                                 EDITH
                        Maurice's English is better than my
                        French.  When we're alone, we speak
                        English.

                                 MAURICE
                        But we always listen to French music.  

           Maurice turns on SERGE GAINSBOURG.

                                 NINA
                        Mmmm.

           Nina stands and starts to sway.

                                 MAURICE
                        I think eating is done.

           Maurice grabs all the plates, whether they're done or not. 
           Ken is left holding his fork.

                                 MAURICE (CONT'D)
                        Nina, why don't you come make drinks
                        with me?

           Maurice and Nina exit.

                                 KEN
                        Do you mind if I look around the
                        rest of your apartment?

                                 EDITH
                        Yes.

           KITCHEN

           Maurice carries stacked plates into the kitchen as Nina
           follows.

                                 MAURICE
                        Gin and Tonic?

                                 NINA
                        Hit me.
           Maurice makes two drinks.  Nina comes flirtatiously close.

                                 NINA (CONT'D)
                        Is that why you brought me in here? 
                        To watch you make drinks?

                                 MAURICE
                        You're the most entertaining person
                        in the apartment.

                                 NINA
                        I heard about you.

                                 MAURICE
                        And what did you hear?

                                 NINA
                        Things.

                                 MAURICE
                        What are you doing?

                                 NINA
                        What do you want me to do?

                                 MAURICE
                        Your husband's in the other room.

                                 NINA
                        He won't be later.

           Maurice puts his arm around her waist.

                                 MAURICE
                        You could come back in a few hours.

                                 NINA
                        I need a favor.

                                 MAURICE
                        Does it involve nibbling your rump?

                                 NINA
                        I need you to make a call for Ken.

           Maurice lets go instantly.  Nina tries to keep it flirtatious.

                                 NINA (CONT'D)
                        You know people in Washington,
                        probably in Albany.  You could get
                        the charges dropped.

                                 MAURICE
                        It's not the best time for me to be
                        granting favors.
                                 NINA
                        You could do it through back room
                        phone calls.  I know how these things
                        work.  I'd be very grateful.

           Maurice marches out of the kitchen.  Nina sighs and follows.

           LIVING ROOM

           Maurice, followed by Nina, sits as though ready to pounce.

                                 MAURICE
                        Don't you think it's odd that I had
                        to endure that humiliating perp walk
                        as he got snuck in the side of the
                        courthouse?

                                 EDITH
                        Maurice, do we have to?

                                 MAURICE
                        I just think it's an odd imbalance
                        when he's being accused of stealing
                        and I'm accused of lust.

                                 KEN
                        Insider trading is not exactly
                        stealing.

                                 EDITH
                        And sexual assault is not exactly
                        lust.

                                 MAURICE
                        But I'm not on trial for sexual
                        assault.  I mean, I am, legally, but
                        those charges will be thrown out as
                        spurious.  The real accusations come
                        in digging around my past behavior
                        and discovering that, surprise
                        surprise, I've had a sex life.

                                 EDITH
                        We don't want to hear about your sex
                        life.

                                 KEN
                        I wouldn't mind.

                                 MAURICE
                        What you do makes me sick.

                                 KEN
                        What happened to both being innocent?
                                 MAURICE
                        The case is irrelevant.  You're guilty
                        because the entire banking industry
                        is guilty.

                                 KEN
                        Now I'm the banking industry?

                                 MAURICE
                        It's an abomination that makes money
                        out of money.  

                                 KEN
                        You're a hundred times as rich as we
                        are.

                                 MAURICE
                        But our money comes from making
                        something.

                                 EDITH
                        Actually, love, your money comes
                        from marriage.

                                 MAURICE
                        But the origin of our fortune is
                        books.

                                 EDITH
                        The origin of my fortune.

                                 KEN
                        Which she inherited.

                                 MAURICE
                        But the origin of her family money
                        is tangible objects that add value
                        to the world.

                                 NINA
                        Ken, let's go.

                                 KEN
                        No, this is about to get good.

                                 MAURICE
                        You should listen to your hussy wife.

                                 NINA
                        Maurice!

                                 MAURICE
                        And next time you want a favor, offer
                        your own body.
                                 EDITH
                        She did what?

                                 KEN
                        You offered to fuck him?

                                 NINA
                        What was I supposed to do?  It's a
                        hail mary.

                                 KEN
                        And he said no?

                                 MAURICE
                        It's in my vocabulary.

                                 NINA
                        Come on.

                                 KEN
                        Still, clever.

                        You're not mad?

                        Mad? You've never had to fight for
                        anything.

                                 EDITH
                        I have fought harder than anyone in

                                 KEN
                        Okay, moneybags.  You're still going
                        to try and get my charges dropped. 
                        Whether you want to or not.

                                 MAURICE
                        You should take your wife's advice
                        and go.

                                 KEN
                        I don't think so.  Sitting there
                        with your passive income and class
                        derision.  And by the way, we're
                        upper class!

                                 EDITH
                        Lower upper class.

                                 KEN
                        Too bad I have this!

           Ken shows Maurice a photo on his phone.
                                 KEN (CONT'D)
                        That's a bottle of Viagra with your
                        name on it.  And this is a bottle of
                        Propecia, and this is grime buildup,
                        and in the other bathroom I found a
                        dildo.  Do what I want, or these go
                        straight to the press.

                                 MAURICE
                        Wow, Edith, I think he got us.

                                 EDITH
                        No choice but to play ball.

           Nina tries to pull Ken toward the door.

                                 KEN
                            (to Maurice)
                        I win?

                                 MAURICE
                        Sure.  I'll put a call in to the
                        secret society of back room deals.

                                 KEN
                        You think this is a joke?  A call to
                        the governor will be fine.

                                 NINA
                        Ken, they're not going to help us. 
                        Your plan is retarded.

                                 MAURICE
                        Actually, I will help you.  Not
                        because you're blackmailing me with
                        shit I don't care about, but because
                        you showed moxy.

                                 EDITH
                        Really?

                                 KEN

                                 NINA
                        They're lying.

                                 MAURICE
                            (to Edith)
                        It's what Mr. Absolon would have
                        wanted.

                                 EDITH
                        Karma for all of Mr. Absolon's favors.
                                 KEN
                        Who's Mr. Absolon?

                                 EDITH
                        An old friend we use as a moral
                        compass.

                                 MAURICE
                        And he would have said that, even
                        though you're a leach on the economy,
                        we should show you some charity.

                                 KEN
                        We don't have to argue anymore.

                                 MAURICE
                        Even though you're a pustule of
                        unsound logic and selfish thinking.

                                 KEN
                        I can still walk out.

                                 EDITH
                        You should do that.  We're not going
                        to make any phone calls.

                                 KEN
                        But you just said you would.

                                 MAURICE
                        Already?

                                 EDITH
                        It's too easy.  Mr. Absolon is a
                        code word we use at parties.  It
                        means play along as I lie through my
                        teeth.  

                                 MAURICE
                        As though there were anywhere else
                        to lie through.

                                 EDITH
                        You've found a few.

                                 KEN
                        You know what?  I don't need anything
                        from you.  No one hands anything to
                        me.

                                 EDITH
                        I'll call for you.

                                 KEN
                        You will?
                                 NINA
                        See you downstairs.

           Nina leaves.

                                 MAURICE
                            (to Edith)
                        Won over by all his clever fishing
                        for dirt?

                                 EDITH
                        Absolutely.  Asking if you'd hit
                        rock bottom, that's some virtuosic
                        political maneuvering.

                                 KEN
                        You couldn't tell I was looking for
                        material to blackmail with?

                                 EDITH
                        No, asking me to complain about
                        Maurice is subtle.

                                 MAURICE
                        Honestly, honey, you didn't really
                        guess it until he pulled out the
                        phone.

                                 EDITH
                        And it's embarrassing, but who expects
                        the clown machiavelli?

                                 KEN
                        So, you'll call tomorrow?

                                 EDITH
                        Probably not.

                                 KEN
                        Monday?

                                 EDITH
                        Maybe never.

                                 KEN
                        I'm confused.

                                 MAURICE
                        You're going to jail.

           Ken struggles for words then storms out.

                                 MAURICE (CONT'D)
                        You have a vibrator?
                                 EDITH
                        I can't believe he wasn't upset when
                        his wife's propositioned you.

                                 MAURICE
                        We showed them.

                                 EDITH
                        Sure did.

           Edith finishes her drink and head for her bedroom.

                                 MAURICE
                        I'm not a bad man.

           Edith stops.

                                 EDITH
                        I know.

                                 MAURICE
                        I can be a good husband and father.

                                 EDITH
                        That ship is sailed.

                                 MAURICE
                        What if it isn't?  What if I get
                        help?

                                 EDITH
                        Help for what?

                                 MAURICE
                        I have a problem.  It's medical.  

                                 EDITH
                        That's convenient logic.

                                 MAURICE
                        So, take the convenient logic and
                        let it give us another chance.

                                 EDITH
                        You don't deserve one.

                                 MAURICE
                        This thing with the maid?  You know
                        I didn't do that.

                                 EDITH
                        I want to believe you.

                                 MAURICE
                        I have cheated.
                                 EDITH
                        It's not the what, it's the how. 
                        I've cheated too, but you'd never
                        find out in the papers.

                                 MAURICE
                        I have a problem.

           Edith says nothing.

                                 MAURICE (CONT'D)
                        Tell me what you're thinking.

                                 EDITH
                        Your book is crap.  And it was nice
                        to see you mop the floor with that
                        yuppie couple.

                                 MAURICE
                        I'm going to kiss you.

                                 EDITH
                        No.

                                 MAURICE
                        I am.

                                 EDITH
                        No.

           Maurice kisses Edith.  She pushes him away.

                                 MAURICE
                        Now, I want you to pretend you didn't
                        say no just now, and that way you
                        can follow your gut without losing
                        face.

           Maurice kisses Edith again.  She hesitates, then kisses him
           back.

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Maurice bursts through the door with Edith.

                                 EDITH
                        Softer.

           Maurice kisses her softer.

                                 EDITH (CONT'D)
                        Softer.

           Maurice, with great difficulty and a lot of physical guidance
           from Edith, manages to kiss her gently.  
           He seems deeply uncomfortable with the lack of animalism.

                                 EDITH (CONT'D)
                        This way.

           Edith leads Maurice sensually toward the bed.  Maurice is
           constantly trying to steer their interaction more violent
           and aggressive, but Edith forces him to be slow and romantic.

                                 EDITH (CONT'D)
                        Softer.

           The begin to make love.  Maurice is like a caged tiger, jumpy
           and uncomfortable with Edith's languid energy, but unable to
           change their choreography.

           AFTER THEY'RE DONE

           Edith and Maurice lie in bed.  She looks content.  He seems
           anxious.  Maurice gets out of bed.

                                 EDITH (CONT'D)
                        You can sleep here tonight.

                                 MAURICE
                        It's too soon.  I don't want to
                        violate your space.

           Edith looks nervous as Maurice exits.

           INT. SECOND BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Maurice plops onto his bed and opens his laptop.  He logs
           into a SEX CHAT WINDOW.  A BUSTY BLONDE greets him.

                                 BUSTY BLONDE (V.O.)
                        Hello, handsome.

                                 MAURICE
                        Turn around and bend over.

                                 BUSTY BLONDE (V.O.)
                        Okay.

                                 MAURICE
                        Now bark.

                                 BUSTY BLONDE (V.O.)
                        Woof.

           Maurice starts to masturbate.
           INT. KITCHEN - MORNING

           Maurice, in his robe and slippers, is chipper as he poaches
           AN EGG.  He hums as he creates two BEAUTIFUL PLATES OF EGGS
           AND SPINACH.  He grabs one of the plates and saunters to the-

           LIVING ROOM

           And knocks on Edith's door.

                                 EDITH (O.S.)
                        One minute.

           Maurice opens the door.

                                 EDITH (O.S.) (CONT'D)
                        I said one minute.

           Maurice closes the door, a little miffed.  Edith comes out
           in HER ROBE.

                                 MAURICE
                        I made eggs florentine.

                                 EDITH
                        Thank you.

           Maurice tries to kiss her but Edith dodges the kiss and takes
           the eggs.

           KITCHEN

           Edith puts her plate on the ISLAND and gets ORANGE JUICE as
           Maurice watches.

                                 MAURICE
                        So, I'm not allowed in the room again?

                                 EDITH
                        You were right about it being too
                        soon.

                                 MAURICE
                        And when I tried to kiss you?

                                 EDITH
                        Maurice, last night happened.

                                 MAURICE
                        But shouldn't have.

                                 EDITH
                        I didn't say that.  It let us know
                        there's still something we can work
                        towards.
                                 MAURICE
                        You're an Indian giver.

                                 EDITH
                        We can't start out where we were
                        last night.  We have to take it slow.

           Edith takes a bite.

                                 EDITH (CONT'D)
                        This is really good.

                                 MAURICE
                        Fresh Direct.

           Maurice starts to eat.

                                 EDITH
                        You're going to need to do some
                        things.

                                 MAURICE
                        And what if I need you to win me
                        back?

                                 EDITH
                        You really think I should be making
                        the effort?

                                 MAURICE
                        What do you need me to do?

                                 EDITH
                        First, I need you to actually work
                        on your book.

                                 MAURICE
                        I thought you said it was crap.

                                 EDITH
                        It is crap, but until you come up
                        with a better one, you need something
                        to do.  

                                 MAURICE
                        What's house arrest good for if not
                        a chance to be lazy?  Like the flu.

                                 EDITH
                        What do you think I liked about you
                        last night?

                                 MAURICE
                        Being an asshole?
                                 EDITH
                        Having energy.  You need to put that
                        energy into something, or it poofs
                        away.  I also need you to get dressed
                        every day.

                                 MAURICE
                        Black tie or white?

                                 EDITH
                        If people think you're a loser, don't
                        look like a loser.  When you're back
                        on top, you can dress like a slob.

           Edith finishes breakfast.

                                 EDITH (CONT'D)
                        I'm going to my room.  See you at
                        lunch.

                                 MAURICE
                        If I'm available.

                                 EDITH
                        Don't disturb me.

           Edith exits.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Maurice, wearing SLACKS and a BUTTON DOWN, sits in front of
           his laptop and notes.  The TV is on in the background.  He
           types unproductively, one key at a time.  

           He looks over at Edith's door.  He goes to her door, almost
           knocks, then goes back to the couch.  He tries to type.  

           He takes the TV remote and tries to balance it on the top of
           his laptop.  The remote falls.  He notices something on the
           TV and becomes excited.  He turns up the volume.

           ON THE TELEVISION

           Jaqueline is being interviewed on NEW YORK ONE.  A caption
           reads, "Live: daughter of MLC."

                                 INTERVIEWER (V.O.)
                        Thanks, Mark.  Glad I'm not taking
                        the Midtown Tunnel.  We're here with
                        Jaqueline Lunel-Caspi, daughter of
                        Maurice Lunel-Caspi and Edith Rivet.

                                 JAQUELINE (V.O.)
                        Thanks for having me.
                                 INTERVIEWER (V.O.)
                        Jaqueline, you've been talking up
                        quite a storm since your father was
                        arrested.

                                 JAQUELINE (V.O.)
                        My mother taught me to speak my mind.

                                 INTERVIEWER (V.O.)
                        Much to our good fortune.  So, tell
                        us, what was it like having a sexual
                        deviant for a father?

           Jaqueline fidgets nervously.  She is choosing her words
           carefully.

                                 JAQUELINE (V.O.)
                        My father could have been a better
                        parent, it's true, but the biggest
                        problem was that I didn't get to see
                        him very often.

                                 INTERVIEWER (V.O.)
                        In the past, you've said that you
                        stopped feeling comfortable bringing
                        friends home at around fifteen.

                                 JAQUELINE (V.O.)
                        My dad can be overly flirtatious. 
                        But, the French have a very different
                        outlook on sexuality from Americans.

                                 INTERVIEWER (V.O.)
                        I'm sorry, I'm puzzled by your change
                        in tone.  In the past, you've called
                        him, "a sexual scum, who preys on
                        every woman around and uses power to
                        bully women into sex."

                                 JAQUELINE (V.O.)
                        I may have been lashing out a little.

                                 INTERVIEWER (V.O.)
                        Why did you refuse when the judge
                        offered to let him stay with you
                        under house arrest?  Forcing your
                        mom to fly to New York and rent an
                        apartment?

                                 JAQUELINE (V.O.)
                        I don't want to distract from the
                        case.  

                                 INTERVIEWER (V.O.)
                        Then why did you come on this show?
                                 JAQUELINE (V.O.)
                        I thought we might talk about other
                        issues.  I have a lot of very strong
                        opinions.

                                 INTERVIEWER (V.O.)
                        You want to talk about other issues?

                                 JAQUELINE (V.O.)
                        I thought we might talk about Gaza.

           Maurice excitedly runs to Edith's door.  He almost knocks,
           then runs back to his laptop and does some typing.  He looks
           back at her door expectantly.  After a second, Edith bursts
           into the living room.

                                 EDITH
                        What's she saying?

                                 MAURICE
                        Take a look.

           The television has switched to a DIFFERENT ANCHOR.  Maurice
           hits mute.

                                 MAURICE (CONT'D)
                        I guess they pulled her off.

                                 EDITH
                        Why didn't you knock?

                                 MAURICE
                        It's not lunch yet.  I thought you
                        wanted an email.

                                 EDITH
                        Not if Jackie's on TV.

                                 MAURICE
                        These rules are very confusing.

                                 EDITH
                        If she's on again, knock.

           Edith starts to leave.

                                 MAURICE
                        Edith, it's you.

           Edith turns and sees herself talking on TV under the words,
           "Previously Recorded."

                                 EDITH (on TV)
                        I'm not here to talk about my husband.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 EDITH (on TV) (CONT'D)
                        I just want to answer investor
                        concerns about my acquisition of The
                        Euro Post and say that everything is
                        moving smoothly.

                                 MAURICE
                        The deal's in trouble?

                                 EDITH
                        No.

                                 MAURICE
                        When did you do that interview?

                                 EDITH
                        An hour ago.

                                 MAURICE
                        While I was sitting right here?  And
                        you were in the bedroom?

                                 EDITH
                        You know, they have cameras on
                        computers now.

                                 MAURICE
                        Amazing.  From your laptop to CNN to
                        my TV.  What a long journey to travel
                        from the bedroom to the living room.

                                 EDITH
                        Don't marvel at technology.  It makes
                        you look like an old man.

           Edith turns to go.

                                 MAURICE
                        I should do something nice for
                        Jaqueline.

                                 EDITH
                        I know she'd enjoy a confession.

                                 MAURICE
                        I could try to get her a job.  Make
                        some calls.

                                 EDITH
                        Do you have any sway right now?

                                 MAURICE
                        The worst I will get is a no.
                                 EDITH
                        Okay.  Just be careful on the phone. 
                        Police could be listening.  The last
                        thing we need now is charges of
                        nepotism and bribery.

           Edith leaves.  Maurice gets his CELL PHONE and makes a call.

           INT. MAHOGANY OFFICE - DAY

           SENATOR MARK KALEY, 55, hangs up his PHONE RECEIVER and
           presses speaker phone.

                                 SENATOR KALEY
                        Maurice.  Good to hear from you.

           INTERCUT PHONE CALL

                                 MAURICE
                        Senator.  I'm in your state.

                                 SENATOR KALEY
                        So I hear.  You'll forgive me if I
                        haven't been to visit.

                                 MAURICE
                        Maybe you'll innocently touch a
                        staffer's shoulder and it will land
                        you in the apartment next to mine.

                                 SENATOR KALEY
                        I wouldn't be surprised.  Maurice, I
                        don't want to waste your time.  I
                        can't do a thing to help the case.

                                 MAURICE
                        I'll beat these charges on my own. 
                        And I would never solicit political
                        favors.

           This last sentence seems more directed at a third party: the
           possible wiretap Maurice is dancing around.

                                 MAURICE (CONT'D)
                        I have someone for you to hire.

                                 SENATOR KALEY
                        But that's not a favor?

                                 MAURICE
                        I'm doing you a favor.  This woman
                        is the best you will find.

           Maurice's intonation becomes very wink, wink, listen to what
           I'm really saying.
                                 SENATOR KALEY
                        And why do you think I would like
                        this woman?

                                 MAURICE
                        She's smart.  She's eager.

                                 SENATOR KALEY
                        A hard worker?

                                 MAURICE
                        The hardest.

                                 SENATOR KALEY
                        I don't think I need anyone.

                                 MAURICE
                        I would hire her in Paris, but she
                        lives in New York.  She'll be a great
                        addition on your staff.

                                 SENATOR KALEY
                        Send her by my New York office
                        tomorrow at seven.  PM.

                                 MAURICE
                        You won't regret it.

                                 SENATOR KALEY
                        I expect not to.

           Maurice hangs up.  He looks proud.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Nicolas sits opposite Maurice.

                                 NICK
                        Can't we just get started?

                                 MAURICE
                        Don't be impatient.  It's almost
                        one.

                                 NICK
                        Why don't you just knock on the door?

                                 MAURICE
                        Because I want to respect her
                        schedule.  Why don't you read a
                        magazine?

           Nick opens a MAGAZINE and starts reading.

           Edith comes out her door.  She sees Nick.
                                 EDITH
                        Nicolas?  What are you doing here?

                                 MAURICE
                        He came to update me on the case,
                        but I told him to wait.  I wanted to
                        include you in it.

                                 EDITH
                        I want to get some food and clear my
                        head.

                                 MAURICE
                        He brought Zabars.

           Nick puts out FOOD.  Edith sighs and sits.

                                 NICK
                        So, we hit a little bit of a speed
                        bump yesterday.

                                 MAURICE
                        What's going on?

                                 NICK
                        We'd been able to establish that Ms. 
                        Parker was farming out housekeeping
                        jobs to an undocumented worker.

                                 EDITH
                        What does that have to do with
                        anything?

                                 NICK
                        It establishes a pattern of deceit. 
                        The problem is that the worker seems
                        to be her mother, so we think it
                        would backfire and make her look
                        sympathetic.

                                 MAURICE
                        What else do you have?

                                 NICK
                        We think we can prove that she cheated
                        on her last year's taxes.

                                 EDITH
                        Which means what?

                                 NICK
                        It shows she needs money.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 NICK (CONT'D)
                        We're going to argue that this whole
                        case is just to lay groundwork for a
                        civil suit which would set her up
                        for life.  But here's the capper. 
                        Six months ago, she got breast
                        implants.

                                 MAURICE
                        That makes sense.

                                 EDITH
                        I'm sorry to keep asking the same
                        question, but what do breast implants
                        have to do with anything?

                                 NICK
                        Can't pay her taxes, but she can
                        afford breast implants?  Plus, it
                        suggests that she may have come on
                        to Maurice a little bit.

                                 EDITH
                        Why don't you poke holes in her story?

                                 NICK
                        It's a he-said, she-said.  These are
                        things we can prove.

                                 MAURICE
                        What else is there?

                                 NICK
                        That's it.

                                 MAURICE
                        You made me wait a half hour for
                        that?

                                 NICK
                        I didn't choose to wait.

                                 MAURICE
                        You could have said all that over
                        the phone.

                                 NICK
                        I wanted Zabars.

           Nick exits.

                                 MAURICE
                        I think things are looking good.  Is
                        something wrong?
                                 EDITH
                        I don't think you should include me
                        in these lawyer meetings any more.

                                 MAURICE
                        I thought you'd appreciate the
                        thought.

                                 EDITH
                        I do appreciate the thought.  It's
                        the action I'm not thrilled about.

                                 MAURICE
                        I'm sorry.

           Edith throws out her food and heads to her door.

                                 EDITH
                        I'll be in my room.

           Edith goes into her bedroom.  Maurice starts to clean up. 
           Edith sticks her head back out.

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Maurice follows Edith inside and grabs her waist.

                                 EDITH
                        Wrong idea.

                                 MAURICE
                        Tease.

                                 EDITH
                        Have a seat.

           Maurice takes a seat and Edith goes to her desk.

                                 EDITH (CONT'D)
                        I'm going to let you help me on my
                        acquisition.  Here are The Euro Post
                        financials.  You can look at them if
                        you want.  But, this is what I really
                        want from you.

           Edith hands Maurice two PACKETS.

                                 EDITH (CONT'D)
                        The first one is people I'm thinking
                        of hiring.  The second is current
                        staff: reporters, editors, managers.

                                 EDITH (CONT'D)
                        I want to cut thirty to forty percent. 
                        I'd love your advice on whom to sack.

           Maurice starts to read through the packets.

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Maurice is sitting on the floor with both packets and a
           HIGHLIGHTER, annotating the lists to death.  Edith stands
           up.

                                 EDITH
                        I'll see you later.

                                 MAURICE
                        Where are you going?

                                 EDITH
                        I have a meeting.

                                 MAURICE
                        You could hold your meeting here.

                                 EDITH
                        It's nice to see you working on
                        something.  You can continue after
                        I'm gone or in the morning.

           Maurice gets up and tries to kiss her.  She brushes him off.

           INT. FRONT HALL - MOMENTS LATER

           Maurice watches Edith go out the front door.

                                 MAURICE
                        Bye.

           INT. SECOND BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Maurice tosses his laptop onto the bed and opens it.  He
           signs into a SEX CHAT WINDOW.  He sees the same woman in
           lingerie from his first chat.

                                 WOMAN IN LINGERIE (V.O.)
                        I recognize you.

                                 MAURICE
                        I felt like a familiar face.

                                 WOMAN IN LINGERIE (V.O.)
                        That's sweet.
                                 MAURICE
                        Press your breasts up against the
                        camera.

           Maurice starts to unbutton his pants.

           LATER

           Maurice, looking bored, sits on the floor next to his open
           laptop.  He dispassionately watches the woman in lingerie
           dance.

                                 WOMAN IN LINGERIE (V.O.)
                        How am I doing?

                                 MAURICE
                        Just keep going.

                                 WOMAN IN LINGERIE (V.O.)
                        Is there something that you want?

                                 MAURICE
                        Not really.  Actually, yes.

           Maurice excitedly grabs a STACK OF PAPER.

                                 MAURICE (CONT'D)
                        I want to read to you from my book.

                                 WOMAN IN LINGERIE (V.O.)
                        Okay.

                                 MAURICE
                        Tell me what you think.

                                 WOMAN IN LINGERIE (V.O.)
                        I'm not exactly an expert.

                                 MAURICE

                                 MAURICE
                        Exactly.

                                 WOMAN IN LINGERIE (V.O.)
                        I want to rub it all over me.

                                 MAURICE

                        remove one form of value the other
                        shortly follows.

           INT. MASTER BEDROOM - DAY

           Maurice sits on the floor going through Edith's packets as
           Edith works on her computer.

           Maurice proudly carries the packets over and plops them on
           her desk.

                                 MAURICE

                        I'll look at them later.

           Maurices starts rubbing Edith's shoulders.  

                                 MAURICE
                        How about a study break?
           Edith removes his hands.

                                 EDITH
                        I'll look at them later.

           Maurice walks into the

           LIVING ROOM

           With a spring in his step.  He finds a stack of THREE UNREAD
           NEWSPAPERS.  He flips through the first one.  He starts
           cutting an article out.

           LATER

           Maurice finishes tacking the last article to his collage. 
           He contentedly flops onto the couch and starts typing.  For
           the first time, he seems to be typing easily.  He seems to
           get an idea, then grabs his phone and makes a phone call.

                        I'm going out.

                                 MAURICE
                        Wait.  Sit with me.

           Edith sits.

                                 MAURICE (CONT'D)
                        My political career may be over.

                                 EDITH
                        It may be.

                                 MAURICE
                        How was your day?

                                 EDITH
                        I think I have to back out of my
                        Euro Post bid.

                                 MAURICE
                        Competing offer?

                                 EDITH
                        My legal team thinks, without you in
                        office providing cover, I'm open to
                        an anti-trust suit.  They actually
                        want me to divest a couple companies.

                                 MAURICE
                        It's nice to be talking without
                        arguing.

           They sit for a second.  Neither has anything to say.
                                 MAURICE (CONT'D)
                        Where are you going?

                                 EDITH
                        Does it matter?

                                 MAURICE
                        Is that a new Restaurant?

                                 EDITH
                        I'll see you later.

           She exits.  Maurice turns on the TV.

           LATER

           Maurice is watching TV when he hears a KNOCK.

                                 MAURICE
                        One second.

           Maurice saunters to the

           FRONT HALL

           And opens the door.

           NAOMI, 22, sexy in her pantsuit, enters past Justin.

                                 NAOMI
                        Thank you, officer.

                                 JUSTIN
                            (to Maurice)
                        You're supposed to let me know when
                        the law firm sends someone by.

                                 MAURICE
                        I'm sorry.  I will in the future.

                                 JUSTIN
                        Do that.

           Maurice closes the door.

                                 MAURICE
                        Who are you?

                                 NAOMI
                        Naomi.  Nick sent me.

           Naomi saunters into the

           LIVING ROOM
           As Maurice follows.

                                 NAOMI (CONT'D)
                        Nice place.

           Maurice dials his phone.

           EXT. NEW YORK SIDEWALK - NIGHT

           Nicolas answers his phone while walking.

                                 NICK
                        Maurice!  Is she there yet?

           INTERCUT PHONE CALL

                                 MAURICE
                        Who is she?

                                 NICK
                        A little present for sending me Ken
                        Birke.  He was so eager to sign, I
                        charged him fifteen percent above my
                        usual rate.  But don't worry, I told
                        her to wait until Edith left.

                                 MAURICE
                        I thought you weren't going to send
                        anyone.

                                 NICK
                        I knew you'd be grateful.  Have fun.

           Nick hangs up.

           Maurice stands hesitantly.  Naomi waits for him to decide
           what to do.

                                 MAURICE
                        This way.

           Maurice leads her to the second bedroom.  As he does, his
           PHONE RINGS.  Maurice puts it on silent.

           INT. SECOND BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Maurice lies in bed, clearly post-sex, as Naomi gets dressed.

                                 MAURICE
                        What's the hurry?

                                 NAOMI
                        If you want to go twice, it's double.
                                 MAURICE
                        How far did you come from?

                                 NAOMI
                        Somewhere around none of your
                        business.

                                 MAURICE
                        Do you go to school?

                                 NAOMI
                        Would you like that?

           Maurice and Naomi jump as they hear THE FRONT DOOR OPEN. 
           Maurice locks the bedroom door.

                                 MAURICE
                        Hide.

           They hear someone MOVING ABOUT the apartment.  Someone tries
           to open the door.  Naomi ducks behind the bed.

                                 MAURICE (CONT'D)
                        I'm just getting dressed.

           Someone starts banging on the door.  Maurice puts on his
           robe and pulls the doorknob.

           Jaqueline stands on the other side, fire coming out of her
           nostrils.

                                 MAURICE (CONT'D)
                        Honey?

                                 JAQUELINE
                        If there wasn't a cop outside, I
                        would stab you.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Jaqueline marches into the room as Maurice follows.

                                 MAURICE
                        What have I done?

                                 JAQUELINE
                        I don't know why I ever expected
                        anything from you except sickness
                        and depravity.

                                 MAURICE
                        What happened?
                                 JAQUELINE
                        I went to see Senator Kaley.  He
                        grabbed my ass and tried to plant
                        one on me.  Correction, planted one
                        on me.

                                 MAURICE
                        That can't be right.

                                 JAQUELINE
                        You think I'd make this shit up?  I
                        just had to see you one more time,
                        so that my last image of you could
                        be one of hatred.

                                 MAURICE
                        There must have been some
                        misunderstanding.

                                 JAQUELINE
                        Misunderstanding?  What sort of
                        reasonable thing might he have been
                        thinking that would cause him to
                        grope your daughter?

                                 MAURICE
                        Let me call him.

                                 JAQUELINE
                        Where's mom?  I couldn't reach her.

                                 MAURICE
                        Don't go anywhere.

           Maurice rushes into the

           SECOND BEDROOM

           And grabs his cell phone.  Naomi pokes her head up from behind
           the bed.  Maurice waves for her to stay down.  He checks his
           phone: "12 missed calls"

                                 MAURICE (CONT'D)
                        Shit.

           LIVING ROOM

           Maurice bounds in and frantically dials.  Jaqueline drinks
           WHISKEY at the sideboard.

           INT. MAHOGANY OFFICE - NIGHT

           Senator Kaley is slumped dejectedly on his couch.  The PHONE
           RINGS.  He frantically answers.
                                 SENATOR KALEY
                        Hello?

           INTERCUT PHONE CALL

                                 MAURICE
                        You made a pass at my daughter?

                                 SENATOR KALEY
                        I didn't know she was your daughter. 
                        You didn't tell me that.

                                 MAURICE
                        You didn't recognize her from the
                        news?

                                 SENATOR KALEY
                        You think I have time to watch the
                        news?  I get summaries.  Is she there
                        with you?  You have to get her not
                        to go to the press.  I can help your
                        case.  No, I don't know that.  I can
                        try to help your case.

                                 MAURICE
                        You just attack any woman who comes
                        into your office?

                                 SENATOR KALEY
                        I thought you were sending a whore. 
                        I thought that's the type of
                        relationship we had.  I would never
                        let you near my daughter.  We've
                        been to orgies with whores her age.

                                 MAURICE
                        Why would I send you a prostitute?

                                 SENATOR KALEY
                        To coax me into calling the governor. 
                        But oh, this is much more clever. 
                        You set me up.  You used her to trap
                        me in a scandal.  Now I have to help
                        you.

                                 MAURICE
                        You think I used my daughter as bait?

                                 SENATOR KALEY
                        Why all the dancing around the topic? 
                        The wink-wink innuendo?
                                 MAURICE
                        I didn't know if my phone was tapped,
                        and I didn't want to be calling in
                        favors.

                                 SENATOR KALEY
                        Phone tapped?

                                 MAURICE
                        It probably isn't.

                                 SENATOR KALEY
                        Never call me again.

           Senator Kaley hangs up.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Maurice puts down his phone and looks at Jaqueline.

                                 JAQUELINE
                        I'm going to the police.

                                 MAURICE
                        You should.

                                 JAQUELINE
                        Don't try that reverse psychology
                        crap on me.

                                 MAURICE
                        If you feel you need to go to the
                        police, you should go to the police. 
                        And the press.

                                 JAQUELINE
                        It will ruin whatever shred you have
                        left.

                                 MAURICE
                        Probably.

                                 JAQUELINE
                        Oh no, you do not get to be noble
                        now.  You do not deserve to be noble
                        now.

                                 MAURICE
                        All I wanted was to help you.

                                 JAQUELINE
                        Stop that.  My last image of you
                        will not be sympathetic.  You can go
                        to hell for all I care.
           Jaqueline puts down her drink and starts to exit.

                                 JAQUELINE (CONT'D)
                        Tell mom to cut your balls off.

           Before Jaqueline can exit, Edith bursts inside.

                                 EDITH
                        Where is he?

           Edith walks over and knees Maurice in the balls.  Then she
           knees him in the face.

                                 EDITH (CONT'D)
                        You are the lowest form of scum on
                        earth, and that's belittling to scum.

                                 JAQUELINE
                        Why didn't you call me back?

                                 EDITH
                        I was in a movie.

                                 MAURICE
                        What did you see?

                                 EDITH
                        A 3-D film about fucking whales. 
                        What difference does it make?

                                 MAURICE
                        No difference.

                                 EDITH
                            (to Jaqueline)
                        Baby, are you all right?  Did he
                        hurt you?

                                 MAURICE
                        The police will examine her.

                                 EDITH
                        What?  You can't go to the police.

                                 MAURICE
                        Let her go.

                                 EDITH
                        You'll destroy all of us.

                                 JAQUELINE
                        He deserves to be taken down.
                                 EDITH
                        You won't be able to pin a criminal
                        charge on him.  And even if you could,
                        I know you think he deserves
                        punishment, but is it worth destroying
                        yourself to get even?  Destroying
                        me?  We don't deserve to be victims
                        of his baselessness.

                                 JAQUELINE
                        How am I destroying you?

                                 EDITH
                        My reputation is tied to his.  I use
                        his name to make business deals.

                                 JAQUELINE
                        You'll pick yourself up.

                                 EDITH
                        I heard your voice mail.  What do
                        you think it will look like that
                        someone was able to mistake you for
                        a prostitute?

                                 JAQUELINE
                        I was wearing a pant suit.

                                 MAURICE
                        High class escorts can dress that
                        way.

                                 JAQUELINE
                        I'll get a book deal out of it.

                                 EDITH
                        Do you have any bruises to photograph? 
                        Were there any witnesses?

                                 JAQUELINE
                        I have a red palm where I slapped
                        him.

                                 EDITH
                            (like a prosecutor)
                        Do you have anything to gain by
                        defaming the Senator?  Do you have
                        any way to prove any of your story?

                                 JAQUELINE
                        I was there.
                                 EDITH
                        Isn't it true that you went on
                        television and suggested that your
                        father was guilty of sex charges to
                        which he was later acquitted?

                                 JAQUELINE
                        That doesn't mean he was innocent.

                                 EDITH
                        Isn't it true that you have a deep
                        seated hatred of powerful men because
                        of your childhood neglect?  

                                 MAURICE
                        Edith!

                                 EDITH
                        Isn't it true that you're a vindictive
                        bitch?

                                 JAQUELINE
                        I object!

                                 EDITH
                        Look at him.  You know what happened. 
                        A media circus would just pervert
                        the truth.

                                 JAQUELINE
                        I never want to see him again.

                                 MAURICE
                        Honey.

                                 EDITH
                        You never have to see him again.

           Jaqueline kicks Maurice.

                                 JAQUELINE
                        I'm taking this whiskey.

           Jaqueline puts the BOTTLE in her purse and exits.

           Edith heads toward her room.

                                 MAURICE
                        Edith, wait.

                                 EDITH
                        You're not worth another kick.
                                 MAURICE
                        I'll leave.  I'll await trial in
                        Rikers.

           Edith comes back.

                                 EDITH
                        Don't you dare.

                                 MAURICE
                        You don't deserve to be around me.

                                 EDITH
                        Do you want to be front page in prison
                        clothes?

                                 MAURICE
                        I still love you.

                                 EDITH
                        I made you, and I deserve to get
                        something out of the decades of
                        investment I've put in.  Whose family
                        connections helped you get started? 
                        I made those introductions.  I've
                        funded your campaigns.  I've run
                        editorials to help your friends and
                        destroy your enemies.  I deserve to
                        have you in the National Assembly
                        making deals on my behalf.  You do
                        not get to destroy your career.

                                 MAURICE
                        I need you.

                                 EDITH
                        From now on, you will be like a ghost
                        in this apartment.  If I walk into a
                        room, you will hide so I don't see
                        you.  If I am in the living room,
                        you will not walk through it to get
                        to the bathroom.  You will pee in a
                        cup and wait until a path is clear.

                                 MAURICE
                        Okay.

           Edith goes to her room.  Maurice walks into the

           SECOND BEDROOM

           And opens his closet.  Naomi gets up from behind the bed.

                                 MAURICE (CONT'D)
                        You can go now.
           Maurice lifts HANGERS and starts putting on a SUIT.

                                 NAOMI
                        Is your wife gone?

                                 MAURICE
                        It doesn't matter any more.  You can
                        just walk through the living room.

                                 NAOMI
                        This extra time will cost something.

           Maurice hands her his WATCH.  Naomi exits.  Maurice finishes
           putting on the suit.

           INT. FRONT HALL - MOMENTS LATER

           Maurice takes a deep breath then opens the front door.

           INT. BRANDILL TOWERS - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Justin sees Maurice standing in the doorway.

                                 JUSTIN
                            (re: suit)
                        Special occasion?

           Maurice pushes past him and starts sprinting down the hall. 
           Justin pursues.

           INT. BRANDILL TOWERS - STAIRWELL - MOMENTS LATER

           Maurice slams through a door and starts running down the
           stairs.

           Justin comes after him.

                                 JUSTIN
                            (into walkie)
                        Runner in Stairwell B.

           A door opens below Maurice, and Dave starts running up the
           stairs.  Dave tackles Maurice.

           INT. BRANDILL TOWERS - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Dave and Justin drag Maurice back into the apartment.

                                 MAURICE
                        I want to go to Rikers!  I want to
                        go to Rikers!

           INT. LIVING ROOM - MORNING

           Nicolas sits opposite a sloppily dressed Maurice.
                                 NICK
                        You sure you won't let me fight it?

                                 MAURICE
                        I want to go to Rikers.

                                 NICK
                        Even though you broke your house
                        arrest, you didn't go outside.  The
                        judge is willing to let you stay if
                        Edith will vouch for you.

                                 MAURICE
                        I don't want Edith to vouch for me.

                                 NICK
                        At least put on something nice for
                        the cameras.

                                 MAURICE
                        That was last night.  This is what
                        they get today.

           Nick nods.

           INT. BRANDILL TOWERS - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Maurice and Nick walk past Justin.

                                 MAURICE
                        See you, Justin.

           Justin glares at Maurice.

           INT. BRANDILL TOWERS - ELEVATOR - MOMENTS LATER

           Maurice and Nick watch the elevator doors open and step into

           INT. BRANDILL TOWERS - LOBBY - CONTINUOUS

           As Maurice and Nick walk towards the door, a HUGE BODYGUARD
           steps in front of them.  Then ANOTHER HUGE BODYGUARD.  Then
           Edith.

                                 MAURICE
                        What's going on.

           The bodyguards pick up Maurice and carry him back to the
           elevator.

                                 MAURICE (CONT'D)
                        Hey!
           INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           The bodyguards throw Maurice onto the couch.  Edith and Nick
           stand by.

                                 MAURICE
                        You can't do this to me.

                                 EDITH
                        I wouldn't bet on that.

                                 MAURICE
                        Nick, you're not going to stand for
                        this.

                                 NICK
                        As your lawyer, if Edith can get you
                        to maintain house arrest until trial,
                        it is my legal advice that she do
                        so.

                                 MAURICE
                        This is imprisonment!

                                 NICK
                        What do you think house arrest is?

                                 EDITH
                        You guys can leave.

           Nick and the bodyguards exit.

                                 MAURICE
                        You do not get to win on this.

                                 EDITH
                        You're not thinking long term.

                                 MAURICE
                        I have a right to my own demise.

                                 EDITH
                        If you won't think of our well being,
                        think of Jaqueline.

                                 MAURICE
                        She'd enjoy watching me go to prison.

                                 EDITH
                        If you make this easy, I'll give you
                        a divorce.

                                 MAURICE
                        I wasn't asking for one.
                                 EDITH
                        Then I am.  We can't stay in this
                        marriage.

                                 MAURICE
                        I think I could.

                                 EDITH
                        It's toxic.

                                 MAURICE
                        For now, maybe.

                                 EDITH
                        For ever.  

                                 MAURICE
                        I'm sorry I ran.  It was a tantrum.

                                 EDITH
                        Tell me what happened.

                                 MAURICE
                        You get older.  You drift apart.

                                 EDITH
                        No that, you dolt.  In the hotel. 
                        With Ama Parker.

                                 MAURICE
                        You know the story.

                                 EDITH
                        I know the public version.  I want
                        the full version.

                                 MAURICE
                        I don't want to tell you.

                                 EDITH
                        Why?

                                 MAURICE
                        I'm afraid you won't find me
                        attractive again.

                                 EDITH
                        Maurice, I could not find you less
                        attractive if you were covered in
                        shit and beetles.

                                 MAURICE
                        I'm not even sure I know what
                        happened.  I mean, I know what I
                        did.
                                 EDITH
                        Start there.

                                 MAURICE
                        I made a pass at her.  She took it
                        wrong.

                                 EDITH
                        How did you make a pass at her?

                                 MAURICE
                        I saw her looking at me, and I thought
                        she was checking me out.  I still
                        think she was checking me out.  I'm
                        a handsome man, don't you think?

                                 EDITH
                        I used to.

                                 MAURICE
                        I pegged her for a shy one, so I
                        thought she would appreciate my being
                        forceful.  I thought she would want
                        to be taken.

                                 EDITH
                        Maurice.

                                 MAURICE
                        So, I walked up behind her, and I
                        grabbed her around the waist.

                                 EDITH
                        You didn't.

                                 MAURICE
                        I know it was a bad idea, but it was
                        early, and I was in a good mood. 
                        She pulled away, but I thought she
                        was playing hard to get.  I thought,
                        I'll give her one more chance to
                        loosen up.  So, I grabbed her one
                        more time, and she broke away.  Now,
                        I could tell she wasn't interested,
                        so I tried to explain.  But before I
                        got a chance, she was out the door.

                                 EDITH
                        Maurice, you assaulted that woman.

                                 MAURICE
                        I didn't.  I made a pass at her. 
                        But, from her point of view, she was
                        assaulted.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 MAURICE (CONT'D)
                        And she will always have a memory of
                        my face, my face trying to rape her. 
                        And, even if that's not what happened,
                        that's how she'll carry it.  For the
                        rest of her life.

                                 EDITH
                        We won't get divorced during this
                        news cycle.  It would look like an
                        admission of guilt.  Six months after
                        the trial: that's when we'll file.

           Maurice seems to accept this.

                                 EDITH (CONT'D)
                        I'm going back to my room.  In about
                        an hour, I'm going to have dinner. 
                        You should be out of the living room
                        and kitchen by then.

           Edith exits.  Maurice goes to his collage and starts pulling
           down press clippings.

           INT. SECOND BEDROOM - DAY

           Maurice, unshaven and unkempt, lies in bed in the afternoon
           sun.  His phone RINGS.  He is slow to answer it.

                                 MAURICE
                        Hello?

           EXT. COURTROOM STEPS - DAY

           Nicolas radiates pride as he talks on the phone.

                                 NICK
                        They dropped the charges.

           INTERCUT PHONE CALL

                                 MAURICE
                        Oh.

                                 NICK
                        We were able to get her husband to
                        admit that she paid him to marry her
                        so she could immigrate from Panama.

                                 MAURICE
                        How did you do that?

                                 NICK
                        Does it matter?  
                                 (MORE)
                                 NICK (CONT'D)
                        She can't bring a civil suit if she
                        gets deported, which was the whole
                        point.  And she's decided her
                        citizenship is more important than
                        revenge, so she's not going to testify
                        against you.

                                 MAURICE
                        Is she still getting deported?

                                 NICK
                        Not if she keeps her trap shut.  I
                        told you we would lick this.  Go
                        celebrate.

           Maurice puts down the phone.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Maurice knocks on Edith's door.  No response.  He keeps
           knocking.  Edith opens the door and stands furious.

                                 MAURICE
                        This is the last time.  We won.

           INT. FRONT HALL - LATER

           Maurice and Edith, dressed sharp, stand in front of the front
           door.

                                 MAURICE
                        You ready?

           INT. BRANDILL TOWERS - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Maurice and Edith walk past Justin.

                                 JUSTIN
                        Congratulations.

           INT. BRANDILL TOWERS - ELEVATOR - MOMENTS LATER

           Maurice and Edith ride the elevator, neither talking nor
           looking at each other.
                                 EDITH
                        Six months.

           INT. BRANDILL TOWERS - LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER

           Maurice and Edith walk through the lobby and out the front
           door, where they are engulfed in a cloud of FLASH PHOTOGRAPHY.

                                                               FADE OUT.
