           EXT. RURAL VILLAGE - THE CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC - DAWN 

           The sun rises over a sprawling landscape of green hills, lush 
           jungle, and manicured fields. A vast and majestic land. 

           TITLE CARD: THE CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC

           A quaint village, AISSA’S VILLAGE, rests atop a hill, waking 
           with the sun.

           EXT. RURAL VILLAGE STREET - DAWN

           A few OPEN AIR JEEPS line the road. Sparse POWER LINES zig 
           zag through the sky. A RADIO playing commercials can be heard 
           through a front door left ajar. 

           EARLY RISERS, mostly older women, hang laundry outside on 
           clotheslines to dry. 

           THREE YOUNG BOYS play soccer in the street. 

           INT. AISSA’S BEDROOM - DAWN 

           A young woman with a pure kind of beauty, complexion like 
           midnight, AISSA (17), rises from a worn, white bed. She 
           yawns, stretches.

           She turns on the faucet at a small sink in her room. Only a 
           few drops. 

           She WHACKS it. The water sputters out. She washes her face.

           EXT. AISSA’S YARD - LATER

           Aissa GRABS an old RIFLE from its resting place against the 
           side of the house. 

           She sits at a small table, and disassembles the rifle, laying 
           each part of the gun out methodically. 

           She uses a brush, cloth and a cord to clean out each part, 
           taking pride in the work. She then rapidly reassembles the 
           gun with military precision.  

           She aims against a BULLET-RIDDLED POST a mile away and shoots 
           expertly. 

           The bullet chips away at the post as it hits the target. 
           INT. AISSA’S KITCHEN - DAWN 

           AISSA’S MOTHER (40s) whisks eggs over a flaming cook top. 

           Aissa whirls in, surprising her mother with a kiss on the 
           cheek. Aissa’s mother smiles tenderly.

                                 AISSA’S MOTHER
                        Always early to rise, my little 
                        dove. 

                                 AISSA
                        There’s work to be done. 

                                 AISSA’S MOTHER
                        Always is. 

           Aissa’s sister, NAIMA (14) chipper, young girl with Aissa’s 
           clever, almond eyes, but a face that is rounder, softer, runs 
           into the kitchen. 

                                 AISSA
                        Late, again.

           Naima ignores her and makes her way to the kitchen sink. She 
           proceeds to brush her teeth. 

           Naima’s mother struggles to serve breakfast around her. 

                                 AISSA’S MOTHER
                        Naima! Do you mind?

                                 NAIMA
                        If someone hadn’t used all the 
                        water! 

           She shoots Aissa a dirty look. 

                                 AISSA
                        Maybe you should get up earlier. 
                        Then you wouldn’t be late to class! 

                                 NAIMA
                        It’s only first greetings. No one 
                        goes on time.

                                 AISSA
                        You go on time. 

                                 AISSA’S MOTHER
                        You’ll both be fed today and that’s 
                        what matters. 
           Aissa’s mother slides them plates of steaming scrambled eggs. 
           Naima sticks her tongue at Aissa. Aissa rolls her eyes.

           EXT. VILLAGE ROAD - DAY 

           Aissa waits for Naima.  

                                 AISSA
                        Come on!

           Naima shuffles up, school bag hanging from her shoulders. 

                                 NAIMA
                        I’m just a little late.

           The sisters walk to the school, Naima still dragging behind.

                                 AISSA
                        A little late is still late. You 
                        can do better than that. 

                                 NAIMA
                        Not everyone is perfect like you.

                                 AISSA
                        I’m not perfect. 

                                 NAIMA
                        Seems like it. 

                                 AISSA
                        If you work hard, Naima, you can be 
                        ten times better than me. You could 
                        make it to a city.

                                 NAIMA
                        You could have made it to the 
                        biggest city in the world if you 
                        said yes to the man from America.

                                 AISSA
                        What do I always tell you, Naima? 
                        If you want something, you have to 
                        earn it. If you let someone give 
                        you what you want, then they can 
                        also take it away. 

           Naima takes in this advice for a beat. 

                                 NAIMA
                        What if they don’t like me? 

           Aissa nudges Naima playfully. 
                                 AISSA 
                        Impossible. 

           Aissa softens. She corrects Naima’s posture, bringing her 
           shoulders back.

                                 AISSA (CONT’D)
                        Just sit up straight, and speak up. 
                        Show them how bright you are. 

                                 NAIMA
                        You think I’m bright? 

                                 AISSA
                        You’re my sister aren’t you? 

           Naima grins, reassured, as they arrive at her school. 

           EXT. OLD BRICK SCHOOLHOUSE - SAME 

           KIDS ages five through sixteen hurry into the brick building. 

           Aissa hugs Naima and sends her off. 

                                 AISSA
                        Naima! 

           Naima looks back, expecting an order. 

                                 AISSA (CONT’D)
                        Have fun.

           Naima smiles and runs into the school building. 

           INT. SUGAR CANE FARM OFFICE - DAY 

           Aissa hurriedly enters a thatch hut office. 

           A handsome man with patient eyes behind WIRE-FRAME GLASSES, 
           AISSA’S FATHER (50), sits at the single desk tapping his 
           watch.  

                                 AISSA’S FATHER
                        It’s not like the Aissa I know to 
                        be late.

                                 AISSA 
                        Almost late. 

           He checks his watch. She’s right -- one minute to spare. 
                                 AISSA’S FATHER
                        Did you practice? 

                                 AISSA
                        That old post didn’t stand a 
                        chance.

           Aissa kisses his forehead, and grabs a MACHETE and a pair of 
           THICK WOOL GLOVES hanging from the wall.

           She bounds to the back exit, turning her head, shooting a 
           mischievous smile at her father.  

           Her father chuckles to himself. 

           EXT. SUGAR CANE FARM OFFICE - SAME

           Aissa makes her way outside. A JEEP with FIVE OLDER WOMEN, 
           each holding machetes and gloves, waits on a dirt path. 

           One older woman, ARZIKI, dark, leathery skin, shouts out to 
           Aissa. 

                                 ARZIKI
                        You better run, child! 

           Aissa hops in the Jeep and takes the last spot. She breathes  
           a sigh of relief. 

           A BURLY DRIVER starts the ignition and the Jeep takes off 
           down a bumpy road. 

           EXT. BUMPY ROAD - DAY 

           The ladies ride to work, passing vast SUGAR CANE FIELDS. 

           Other FIELD WORKERS are already bringing down their shining 
           machetes on ripe sugar cane.   

           Arziki fixates on Aissa’s hands, taking one in hers. 

                                 ARZIKI
                        It’s really a crime to ruin those 
                        smooth, pretty hands. 

                                 AISSA
                        Oh, just quit it!

           Aissa snatches her hand back. 
                                 OLD LADY #2
                        You’re not cut out for this work, 
                        Aissa. Can’t even show up on time. 

                                 OLD LADY #3
                        Because she’s a silly, little brat. 
                        Had a good man and didn’t know what 
                        to do with him. 

                                 ARZIKI
                        I tell you what I’d do if I had me 
                        a prince-- 

                                 AISSA
                        He wasn’t a prince. He was a fool. 

                                 ARZIKI
                        Any fool with money like him is a 
                        prince to me. 

                                 OLD LADY #4
                           (shaking her head)
                        Hacking away in this heat when you 
                        could have gone to America. 

                                 ARZIKI
                        Glad you aren’t my daughter. You’re 
                        so stubborn, would’ve stopped my 
                        heart long ago. 

           The old women laugh. 

           Aissa looks wistfully out at the endless mountains that 
           cradle the fields. 

                                 AISSA
                        At least my heart’s still beating.

           EXT. SUGAR CANE FIELD - SAME 

           WHACK!

           The silver blade of Aissa’s machete comes down hard on the 
           cane, snapping it in half. 

           Machetes rise and fall above the sugar cane as other VILLAGE 
           WOMEN do the same all over the field. 

           The sun is hot in the sky and Aissa wipes the sweat from her 
           brow. She is distracted by DRUMS BEATING in the distance. 

           A few women stop their work and look to the town. 
           The drums get LOUDER. 

           The women continue their work, apprehensively. Aissa surveys 
           the area, concerned. 

           The drums are thundering, reaching a fast, angry crescendo. 

           Then silence. 

           Aissa looks again. Nothing. 

           BANG.

           Arziki is suddenly SHOT in the head. She falls, dead.  

           Armed men in white uniforms, THE LIGHT CRUSADERS OF CHRIST, 
           storm the field in a camouflaged JEEP. 

           Aissa drops to the ground. Her vision is blocked by the high 
           sugar cane. 

           Aissa flinches at the SCREAMS and GUNSHOTS as the women in 
           the field are SHOT unceremoniously. 

           SILENCE. 

           Aissa gently rises to peek above the cane. 

           AISSA’s POV

           Her village is in FLAMES, people are lined up and shot, their 
           bodies tossed into a fiery trench. 

           Crusaders run through the huts slinging the young women over 
           their backs and snatching anything of value. 

           Other Crusaders attack-- 

           THE SCHOOL 

           They force out the YOUNG BOYS AND GIRLS. 

           We can hear CRYING, SCREAMING.

           Aissa’s machete falls from her hands in horror. She drops to 
           the ground, gasping for air. Before she can catch her breath--

           A CRUSADER 

           creeps up behind her and flings his shot gun AROUND HER NECK, 
           tightening against her throat.
           He YANKS her away from her weapon, the metal pressing hard 
           against her neck. He tries to drag her through the field, 
           intent on making her a bounty of war.

           She THRASHES back, using her weight to throw him to the 
           ground, landing on top of him. 

           The fall knocks the wind out of the attacker. 

           She slingshots herself upright and LUNGES for the machete. 

           The Crusader regains strength and TAKES AIM through the scope 
           of the gun. 

           Seconds before he squeezes the trigger, Aissa JAMS a PIECE OF 
           SUGAR CANE into the barrel. The gun BACKFIRES, sending 
           Aissa’s attacker stumbling back.

           The Crusader clicks the trigger repeatedly but no bullets 
           fire. It’s useless. 

           Aissa swiftly STABS him deep in the chest with her machete. 

           He clings to life. 

           She struggles to rip the machete from his chest but it is 
           caught on his rib cage. She strains, pulling with all her 
           might. The machete REMAINS LODGED. 

           She backs up, takes both hands and MASHES them against the 
           butt of the machete. 

           It CRUNCHES in and he falls dead to the ground, the machete 
           permanently wedged between his bones. 

           Aissa gets down, and lies low, hidden in the sugar cane. 

           IN A TIME LAPSE SEQUENCE: 

           We rise over the fields to reveal Aissa’s BURNING VILLAGE 
           atop the hill. 

           A giant fire consumes more and more of it until there’s 
           nothing left.

           We see the sun travel across the field and set into the night 
           as Aissa’s village turns to ash. 

           EXT. SUGAR CANE FIELD - NIGHT

           DRUMS begin to BEAT again. The same angry cadence. 

           Aissa rises slowly. She sees the Crusaders leaving her camp. 
           The body on the ground attracts flies. 

           She takes off towards her burning village, gripping the cane, 
           breaking the stalks. 

           EXT. SUGAR CANE FARM OFFICE - NIGHT 

           Aissa spots the Farm Office, still burning. She runs into it.

           INT. SUGAR CANE FARM OFFICE - NIGHT 

           Aissa frantically searches through the burning remains of her 
           father’s office, tossing aside her father’s blackened desk.

                                 AISSA
                           (screeching, desperate)
                        Papa!

           She gasps when she spots among the wreckage-- 

           HER FATHER’S WIRE-FRAME GLASSES, broken on the ground. 

           As she crouches to pick them up, she breaks down sobbing, 
           holding the last remnant of her father to her chest. 

           EXT. AISSA’S VILLAGE - NIGHT  

           Aissa, teary-eyed and in shock, wanders through the ruins of 
           her town. 

           Buildings reduced to rubble. Clothing and other affects of 
           her neighbors are strewn across a bloody, dirty ground. 

           She desperately searches the vestiges of HER HOME, now merely 
           a heap of burnt lumber, but there are no signs of life. 

           All of her belongings have turned to soot. 

           Aissa continues on, choking on ungodly fumes emanating from 
           the SMOKING TRENCH -- the bodies of her loved ones 
           unrecognizable in a heap of charred, burning flesh. 

           Aissa is STARTLED by the sound of an ENGINE REVVING. 

           She moves towards the noise, ducking behind bricks. 

           She peeks out behind the dusty rubble and sees FOUR CRUSADERS 
           herding all the YOUNG BOYS and YOUNG GIRLS into jeeps. 

           Close on one village girl, tears in her familiar eyes. It’s 
           AISSA’S SISTER NAIMA.
           Aissa looks panicked, enraged, but she can’t do anything, 
           surrounded by armed thugs. 

           CLOSE ON CRUSADERS

           MEAN, BLACK EYES survey the haul of young boys and girls. A 
           leathery mouth sucks in smoke from a cigar. 

           The leader of the Crusaders, COMMANDER GABRIEL (35) exhales 
           smoke rings. He’s a black, grisly man with a mouth that 
           snarls even when he’s smiling, like he is now. 

           He motions languidly with his hand to hurry up.

           Subservient soldiers immediately respond, quickening their 
           pace. 

           One soldier is too slow. 

           The Commander’s hand beckons the slow soldier. 

           The slow soldier practically crawls over, bowed in deep 
           respect. 

           The Commander puts out his cigar on the soldier’s arm. 

           CLOSE on the soldier’s face grimacing in pain, a tear running 
           down his cheek, choking back any sounds of agony.

           The Commander lifts the cigar, revealing a NASTY BURN. 

                                 COMMANDER 
                        Next time, it’ll be in your eye. 

           Commander kicks him forward. He is much faster now. 

                                 COMMANDER (CONT’D)
                        Once we cross the southern border, 
                        we’ll unite with Christian soldiers 
                        more worthy of my command. 

           The Commander catches the clever, almond-shaped eyes of 
           Naima. 

           BEHIND RUBBLE 

           Aissa watches, tense, as the Commander walks over and speaks 
           inaudibly to her sister. 

           He strokes her face with his KNIFE, then sinks it into his 
           holster before she is lead into the Jeep.

           Aissa clenches her fist, her face red with barely contained 
           fury.
           As the Commander climbs into a Jeep, THE KNIFE falls out of 
           his holster onto the ground. 

           Aissa watches as they drive off. 

           WHEN THE DUST CLEARS

           Aissa walks to the site of the Jeeps. She spots the knife 
           glinting in the dirt. 

           She picks it up and inspects it. Its insignia is menacing: a 
           skeleton on a cross. It reads: 

           THE LIGHT CRUSADERS OF CHRIST

           Her knuckles turn white from her grip. 

                                 AISSA
                        I will cut you down with this. 

           Aissa takes off into the night, following the tracks of the 
           Jeep, with nothing but the clothes on her back and the knife.

           EXT. JUNGLE - DUSK 

           Aissa swiftly HACKS dense vegetation, a small, skinned rabbit 
           CARCASS on her shoulder.

           EXT. AISSA’S CAMPSITE - NIGHT 

           Aissa ties the last piece of grass tight on her makeshift 
           tent.

           She roams the flat area of the brush that surrounds her 
           campsite, collecting leaves and twigs. 

           INT. AISSA’S MAKESHIFT TENT - NIGHT 

           She sits down in her tent and begins to work with the 
           materials. 

           Aissa twists the leaves around the branches to make THREE 
           IDOL FIGURES. 

           She places them in a line. 

                                 AISSA 
                        Mother. Father. May you feel no 
                        pain and sorrow. May you look down, 
                        hopeful. May you watch fatefully as 
                        your firstborn, Aissa, avenges your 
                        death with fury. Bless my righteous 
                        journey to find my sister, your 
                        daughter. Guide me to find her 
                        still alive, and bring her to 
                        safety. I love you, always. Until 
                        we join in eternity.   

           She kisses two idol figures, and bows her head for a moment 
           of silence. HOT TEARS stream down her face but she doesn’t 
           make a sound.  

           She places each one into the fire, the smoke rises black. 

           Aissa picks up the last figure, and holds it tight. 

                                 AISSA (CONT’D)
                        It’s not goodbye yet. 
           INT. AISSA’S TENT - LATER 

           Aissa rolls over, trying to close her eyes. She clutches the 
           idol of her sister. 

           TICK. TICK TICK. TICK. 

           She shrugs off the noise in her sleepy haze. 

           TICK. TICK TICK. TICK. TICK TICK. TICK. 

           Aissa hears it again, closer to her tent. Her eyes slowly 
           open. This ticking is familiar. Dread crosses her face. 

           Aissa sits up carefully, looking around for the source of the 
           sound. She spots-- 

           A DEATHWATCH BEETLE 

           crawling along the edge of the tent. 

           Aissa tracks the bug as it ticks along. 

                                 AISSA
                        I know what you are. You will not 
                        bring death to me tonight. 

           She raises her fist and SLAMS the unfortunate bug into the 
           ground. 

           She wipes off the remains from her hands, relieved but 
           shaken. She apprehensively lies down and shuts her eyes. 

           A LOUD CRACK. A branch breaks right outside her tent. 

           Her eyes spring WIDE OPEN.

           Aissa gets up slowly, alert. Her hand tightens around the 
           dagger at her side and she peers out of the banana leaf door 
           on her tent.

           The brush SHAKES near the edge of the clearing. 

           EXT. AISSA’S CAMPSITE - SAME

           Aissa crawls out, low to the ground to avoid detection. 

           A HEFTY, BLACK, LUMBERING BODY emerges from the brush, 
           huffing. It sniffs around the fire at the ANIMAL CARCASS left 
           behind. 

           Aissa stealthily crawls around the tent. It disappears from 
           view. 
           Then SNARLING. 

           Aissa looks up to see a GIANT GORILLA’S FACE staring back at 
           her. It ROARS exposing its gleaming, sharp teeth.

           It hesitates. 

           Then SWIPES her hard. She rolls across the ground, clutching 
           her bloody face. 

           The gorilla CHARGES at her. 

           She quickly unsheathes her dagger and hops up in time to 
           avoid it. It falls, smacking the ground. 

           She scrambles away, around the fire, keeping the smoldering 
           flames between her and the giant beast. 

           The animal shakes off the fall, looks around and spots her 
           through the floating ashes.

           He circles around the fire towards her on all fours.  

           Aissa unsheathes her dagger, ready to strike, but maintains 
           her distance. She looks the beast dead in the eye, making 
           herself as big as she can. 

           The beast breaks eye contact and LUNGES at her across the 
           flames, fiery embers SHOOT into the air. 

           The gorilla SCREAMS in pain, beating its chest.

           Aissa takes advantage and BOLTS into the jungle. 

           EXT. JUNGLE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS 

           Aissa runs hard, panting, through the thick African brush. 

           The gorilla GALLOPS with ease through the familiar terrain, 
           GROWLING, in hot pursuit of prey.  

           She darts back and forth between shrubs and branches. We hear 
           the beast fast approaching through the trembling trees.  

           The growls get LOUDER.

           Aissa SMACKS into a TANGLE OF VINES. She cuts herself loose 
           with the dagger but it slows her down. 

           The gorilla ROARS, closer. 

           She gets through the vines but a low lying BRANCH sticks up 
           in her path. 
           She TRIPS. She hits the ground hard, and struggles to roll 
           onto her back. She can’t catch her breath. 

           She catches a glimpse of the full moon framed with tree 
           branches. The dots of light that peak through the trees blur 
           together as the branches begin to violently SHAKE. 

           She gets to her feet, looking for signs of the Gorilla. 

           Silence. 

           She takes a few steps. She raises her dagger defensively.  

           The gorilla DROPS down from the branch above her. He lands 
           directly on her back. She collapses under him. 

           She struggles to turn around and face him but his weight is 
           overpowering.  

           The Gorilla grabs her head in both palms and SMASHES it into 
           the ground. 

           Aissa grips tight on the dagger, reaches around and STABS the 
           gorilla in the leg. He yelps in pain, letting her head drop.

           She flips around underneath him. His eyes loom large and red. 

           He ROARS and gnashes his teeth, but she shoves his face away. 

           She’s losing strength rapidly, its snarling mouth ready to 
           maul her face, dripping saliva on her quivering hand. 

           With her free hand, she SHOVES her fingers deep into the leg 
           wound. 

           The Gorilla releases her, BEATING its chest, howling into the 
           black night. 

           Aissa jumps to standing and PLUNGES the dagger as fast as she 
           can into its body.

           The Gorilla begins to SCREECH, swinging its mighty arms at 
           Aissa. She DUCKS. She STABS indiscriminately.  

           The Gorilla keeps SWIPING her, scratching her, leaving her 
           bloody. 

           She hoists her dagger and in one swift motion STABS it deep 
           into the GORILLA’S EYE. 

           The gorilla STOPS, stumbling to all fours. 

           Aissa pants, recovering, and watches as the screeching beast 
           collapses onto the ground, dead.  
           A few seconds pass. Still no movement. Aissa approaches the 
           Gorilla and leans down over it.

           We see the Gorilla’s remaining blank eye, staring off, dead. 

           Aissa PLUCKS the dagger from the Gorilla’s face and SLICES it 
           from top to stern. 

           EXT. AISSA’S CAMPSITE - DAY 

           Aissa is hard at work. Her face bears the scars of the 
           Gorilla’s claws.  

           The GORILLA PELT hangs from a tree. 

           Useless guts stain the dirt. Gorilla meat cooks over a 
           rekindled fire.  

           EXT. TUNDRA - DAY - LATER

           Aissa roams through the high grass. Her items weigh heavy on 
           her back. Sweat drips into her eyes. 

           She looks to the east and spots a GIANT, SPRAWLING tree with 
           tentacle branches like Medusa. 

           Excitement crosses her face. She licks her lips and hastens 
           off in its direction. 

           Aissa reaches the tree. She frantically cuts a piece of bark 
           from it. She bites into it but spits out dry wood. 

           She reaches for a nearby leaf and plucks it down. She cuts 
           the tip of the leaf and turns it up like a canteen. 

           ONE SMALL DROP of moisture falls onto her lips. 

           She moans, dejected, the dry leaf fluttering to the ground. 

           EXT. JUNGLE - DAY - LATER

           Aissa wanders, tired, through the brush. She looks worn from 
           the day. She stops to catch her breath. She hears--

           TRICKLING WATER. Somewhere close by. 

           She stands completely still, sensing the direction.  

           She runs towards the source, darting through the trees. The 
           sound of a rushing stream grows louder. 
           EXT. JUNGLE WATERFALL - SAME 

           Aissa makes her way through the foliage and is struck in awe 
           by a WATERFALL.  

           At the foot of the waterfall is the most beautiful pool of 
           deep, cold, refreshing water Aissa has ever laid eyes on. 

           She is already tossing her pelt, idol and dagger to the 
           ground, and running to the pool. 

           She THROWS herself in. She laughs, gulping the water 
           greedily. She divines in her good fortune. 

           Aissa swims under the waterfall, emerging behind it, letting 
           the water rush down her back. She wipes the water from her 
           face and throws her head back in ecstasy. 

           When she opens her eyes she sees FOUR BLURRY FIGURES through 
           the curtain of water.  

           Aissa dives under the waterfall and swims under water, 
           undetected. She maneuvers out a few feet to get a better 
           look. 

           She raises her head just above the water line. Only enough to 
           breathe.

           THE SHORELINE 

           All of the figures wear long, red robes and stand around her 
           gorilla pelt. One figure reaches down to inspect it. 

           Aissa dives under the water and swims around to the far side 
           of the pool. She gets out, creeping along the bank towards 
           the robed intruders. 

           She crouches down silently and grabs a HEAVY RIVER ROCK. 

           Aissa creeps further along the bank, keeping the figures in 
           sight. 

           She comes up a few feet behind the kneeling figure and raises 
           the rock to strike.

                                 HOODED FIGURE
                        Calm, now. That rock is of no use 
                        to you, child. 

           Aissa hides the rock behind her. The Hooded Figure stands and 
           faces her. She removes her hood.

           A WRINKLED, TIME-RAVAGED FACE stares back at her. This is 
           HIGH SISTER ALMA (90s). 
                                 HIGH SISTER ALMA
                        This is a big pelt. Fully grown. 
                        You must be very strong to kill 
                        such a beast. 

           The other Hooded Figures turn to face Aissa. They remove 
           their hoods revealing sweet, old faces, smiling at her. HIGH 
           SISTER EBERI (60’s), HIGH SISTER AKILI (70s), HIGH SISTER 
           KALI (80s).

                                 HIGH SISTER KALI
                        Your body shows the scars of that 
                        battle. Your face is marked with 
                        victories past. 

           High Sister Kali reaches to touch Aissa’s face, her hands 
           spotted with old age. Aissa flinches. High Sister Kali smiles 
           broadly and retracts her hand. 

                                 HIGH SISTER EBERI
                        You’re bleeding, even now. 

           Aissa looks at her leg. Blood drips down. 

           High Sister Alma bends down, picks up the Idol Figure of her 
           sister. 

                                 HIGH SISTER ALMA
                        That wasn’t your only battle. Your 
                        soul is scarred with many wounds. 
                        You carry an idol of our faith. You 
                        are a believer, I can sense it. 

           Aissa nods. 

                                 HIGH SISTER AKILI
                        We are sisters in the gods. Let us 
                        tend your wounds.

                                 HIGH SISTER KALI 
                        We will care for you. Help you find 
                        your way. 

                                 HIGH SISTER ALMA
                        You must never lose your faith, 
                        child, even in the darkest times. 
                        You are on a righteous journey.  

           Aissa’s eyes spark.

                                 AISSA
                        I am on a righteous journey.
                                 HIGH SISTER ALMA
                        And you are weary, thirsty, hungry. 
                        This is no place for a girl. You 
                        know well the beasts that roam 
                        these parts, and not all of them 
                        are animals.

                                 HIGH SISTER KALI 
                        Have you seen the full moon? 

           Aissa nods. 

                                 HIGH SISTER ALMA
                        It is the eve of the Blood Moon. 
                        The Blood Moon brings out the 
                        nature of our destinies. It’s a 
                        sign our paths should cross. 

                                 HIGH SISTER EBERI 
                        We will give you wine, dress your 
                        wounds, give you a proper bed. 

                                 HIGH SISTER ALMA
                        Don’t make the mistake of 
                        overconfidence. You have been 
                        lucky, but luck always runs out in 
                        the bush. 

           Aissa considers, she surveys their smiling, old, kind faces. 

           She DROPS the rock. 

           EXT. HIGH SISTERS’ VILLAGE - DUSK 

           The laughter and good spirits of a festival carry through the 
           air. Lanterns glow in the night. 

           The High Sisters lead Aissa, now bathed and dressed in a 
           white robe, through the VILLAGE -- an alcove filled with 
           tents, communal fires and off-road vehicles on dirt roads.

           They approach a LARGE WOODEN CABIN in the center of the 
           village, seeping golden light. 

           It’s warm and inviting, and Aissa allows herself to relax. 

           INT. LARGE WOODEN CABIN - DUSK 

           A group of MUSICIANS play drums and flutes, and a pretty, 
           YOUNG GIRL sings an entrancing melody.
           Aissa is led through the bustling dining room. An enormous, 
           wooden table seats many VILLAGERS, and many YOUNG GIRLS, all 
           dressed in the same white robes. 

           Roasted ducks, rabbits, and other seasoned prey line the 
           table. Aissa’s mouth waters as delicacies of all kinds are 
           served in heaping portions. 

           The villagers drink ale and wine, and all are merry. 

           Aissa is seated at the table next to all the other girls. 

           A conspicuously beautiful girl, ZALIKA (16) is seated next to 
           Aissa. She is bright-eyed. Innocent and pure as fresh snow. 
           Something about her clean spirit draws us in. 

           She turns to Aissa, smiling with enthusiasm. Aissa ravenously 
           devours the meat on her plate, all but ignoring her. 

                                 ZALIKA
                        I’m Zalika. 

           Aissa grunts, mouth full.

                                 AISSA
                        Aissa. 

                                 ZALIKA
                        Where are you from? 

                                 AISSA
                           (mouth full)
                        Bambisi. 

           Aissa chews like an animal. Zalika, hopeful, pestering, 
           persists. 

                                 ZALIKA 
                        So... why are you here? 

           Aissa swallows, washing it down with wine.

                                 AISSA
                        I’m... on a righteous journey. 

                                 ZALIKA
                        Me too! That’s what the High 
                        Sisters told me anyway. A righteous 
                        journey. It sounds important. 

           Aissa pauses her gluttonous feast. 
                                 AISSA
                        The Crusaders have my sister. They 
                        slaughtered my village, my parents. 
                        It’s more than this.

           Aissa waves her hand to signify the festivities. Zalika grows 
           solemn. 

                                 ZALIKA
                        But how will you find them?

                                 AISSA
                        I followed their tracks for miles 
                        and miles until they disappeared in 
                        the bush, but they’re headed south 
                        to the border... I will find them. 
                        That is my only journey.

                                 ZALIKA
                        My village was also destroyed by 
                        the Crusaders. My parents are still 
                        alive, but as last born, I can only 
                        hope to do my sacred duty.

                                 AISSA
                        What is your duty? 

           Zalika smiles, gazing dreamily into some fantasy world.

                                 ZALIKA
                        Well... First I need to work on my 
                        presentation. The High Sisters say 
                        that the first ten seconds are the 
                        most important. I hope I walk out 
                        with the moonlight on my left. 

           Zalika turns to show Aissa her left side while presenting a 
           CHARMINGLY CROOKED SMILE. 

                                 ZALIKA (CONT’D)
                        But the best part, the very best 
                        part, is my betrothed. He will be 
                        handsome, and wealthy. And he will 
                        make sure I always wear the best 
                        silks. Oh, I love him already. 
                        We’ll live in a big house, all 
                        brick and wooden floors, and we’ll 
                        have land and I‘ll never have to 
                        work the fields again. 

                                 AISSA
                        That does sound nice. I hope you 
                        find him.
           Aissa sips her wine. Zalika politely eats her own dish. 

           High Sister Alma stands up. 

                                 HIGH SISTER ALMA
                           (bellowing)
                        WORSHIPERS OF THE BLOOD MOON! 

           The Villagers BANG on the table. 

                                 HIGH SISTER ALMA (CONT’D)
                        It is time. High Brother Davu will 
                        bless this holy night. 

           A Cloaked Figure next to High Sister Alma rises to his feet. 
           He removes his hood, revealing a face that is fully decorated 
           in red henna-like tatoos, this is HIGH BROTHER DAVU (40s). 

                                 HIGH BROTHER DAVU
                        Welcome, brothers and sisters. You 
                        are all here because this evening 
                        is a rare gift from the gods. A 
                        chance to renew and replenish. You 
                        all have been chosen for a higher 
                        purpose. A calling that most can 
                        only dream to achieve. Tonight you 
                        will fulfill the destiny of the 
                        Blood Moon. And you will attain 
                        ultimate happiness.    

           Davu grabs his golden goblet. 

                                 HIGH BROTHER DAVU (CONT’D)
                        I raise my glass to you, treasures 
                        of the bush. 

           He raises his glass to toast. The girls raise their glasses 
           with him. Zalika is delighted by the speech. 

                                 HIGH SISTER ALMA
                        It is our duty to shepherd the 
                        chosen into the Valley of the 
                        Light. But first comes darkness.

           We watch from Aissa’s point of view as a BLACK BAG suddenly 
           comes down over her head. 

           OVER BLACK

           Aissa flies into fight mode. She grips tight on the hands 
           that keep the bag over her head. 

           She writhes under the bag, she can’t draw breath. She chokes 
           on fumes that taste of chemicals. 
           Faint screams and thudding can be heard all around her, feet 
           scuffle in the dirt. 

           Aissa struggles a few more seconds then loses consciousness.

           INT.  VILLAGE TENT - HOURS LATER  

           We can only see black for a moment before the bag is removed, 
           revealing a bright, out of focus scene.

           The tent materializes as Aissa’s eyes adjust to the light. 

           It is full of the young girls from the feast. Each are 
           chained to chairs that line the tent wall. 

           SISTER WIVES work to ready the girls for the ceremony.  

           Aissa looks down and discovers that she is also chained. The 
           High Sisters in red robes paint red designs on her arms and 
           legs. Another begins painting her lips red.

                                 AISSA
                        Where am I? What are you doing to 
                        me? 

           Aissa struggles against her restraints.

                                 HIGH SISTER ALMA 
                        You were chosen, Aissa, for the 
                        very highest honor.

           High Brother Davu approaches. 

                                 HIGH SISTER ALMA (CONT’D)
                        You will be one of us now.

                                 AISSA
                        I can’t stay here! My sister--

                                 HIGH BROTHER DAVU
                        Your sister is long gone, sold into 
                        the brothels. 

           High Brother Davu grabs Aissa's jaw, examining it.

                                 HIGH BROTHER DAVU (CONT’D)
                        And if she's as pretty as you are, 
                        she’d be given to a war lord as a 
                        trophy. Don't be naive. You are 
                        lucky, the gods have blessed you.
                                 AISSA
                        Where is my knife?! Where are my 
                        things? 

           High Brother Davu’s tone turns darker as he looks Aissa up 
           and down. 

                                 HIGH BROTHER DAVU
                        You have nothing. You can do 
                        nothing. And if you defy us, you 
                        will be cut. Some men prefer their 
                        women without their “male” parts. I 
                        guarantee you won’t feel the same. 

           He kneels down and licks her foot. She CRINGES. 

                                 HIGH BROTHER DAVU (CONT’D)
                        Besides, red looks great on you.

           He exits the tent. 

           EXT. MAKESHIFT AUCTION STAGE - NIGHT 

           Aissa and the girls, in white robes and chains, are dragged 
           onto the stage. Zalika grabs Aissa’s hand, assuring.

                                 ZALIKA
                        Don’t worry, Aissa, this is all 
                        part of it. Don’t fight it. It will 
                        be wonderful in the end. 

           Aissa pulls her hand away.

                                 AISSA
                        I wouldn’t be so certain.

           The girls are lined up on stage and the women in red STRIP 
           the girls’ robes off, leaving the girls naked on the stage. 

           Even Zalika seems shocked, terrified. This wasn’t the ritual 
           she had come to look forward to.

           THE AUDIENCE

           The leering eyes of mostly OLD MEN in the audience, looking 
           to make a purchase. Some point and make obscene gestures 
           toward the stage. 

           THE STAGE

           Zalika GASPS, startled, as one YOUNG GIRL standing next to 
           her is immediately grabbed and hauled off stage, auctioned 
           off. 
           THE AUDIENCE 

           Wealthier men sit behind curtained cabanas, bidding on the 
           women in secret. 

           The men down below throw up their hands to bid on each of the 
           girls. 

           THE STAGE

           Girls, some in tears, are prodded and made to show off their 
           bodies. 

           Zalika looks around, scared, trying to cover herself and 
           doubting everything she’d ever been taught.

           THE AUDIENCE 

           The wealthy man behind the curtain shakes hands with TWO MEN, 
           exchanging MONEY.  

           THE STAGE

           Aissa is SNATCHED from the group, her white robe thrown over 
           her shoulders. 

           Aissa finds Zalika’s fearful eyes, still naked on the stage. 

           INT. WEDDING TENT - NIGHT 

           Aissa is dressed by the women in red, put into a wedding 
           garment, powdered, her make-up touched up. 

                                 HIGH SISTER ALMA
                        Your suitor, our husband, is one of 
                        the wealthiest in the land. He will 
                        give you many houses, and sons if 
                        you are worthy. 

           They smother her in jewelry, placing a delicate ring on her 
           finger. 

           High Sister Alma wraps her robes over her shoulders, and 
           kisses her on the forehead for luck.

                                 HIGH SISTER ALMA (CONT’D)
                        You will do well to please him. 

           EXT. WEDDING CEREMONY - NIGHT 

           Aissa is presented by the women to a cheering crowd. She is 
           escorted down an aisle. 
           The “Blood Moon” hangs high, its red ring foreboding in the 
           night. 

           A lecherous, wrinkled, UGLY OLD MAN waits at the end, with 
           his THREE OTHER WIVES (30s, 40s & 50s), who support him. 

           Aissa looks furious, but remains silent, still in chains, 
           still no escape in sight, surrounded. 

           High Brother Davu brings Aissa’s hand to her suitor. He wraps 
           their hands in white cloth, then he holds a DOVE up in the 
           air.  

           The crowd CHEERS. 

           He STABS the dove, blood running down, staining the white 
           cloth that binds Aissa’s hands with the man who purchased 
           her. 

           The old man smiles at Aissa, revealing years of bad hygiene. 
           He definitely doesn’t floss. 

           Once the cloth is soaked red, TWO GUARDS CARRY Aissa inside a 
           “Marital Tent.” 

           INT. MARITAL TENT - NIGHT 

           Aissa is tossed on the bed. The guards exit. 

           She quickly looks around, jumps up, scanning the room for 
           useful items. 

           She spots something and dives for it. 

           She freezes when a SHADOW walks across the tent. 

           Her "suitor" enters as she collects herself, and stands near 
           the bed. 

           He takes off his shirt, and unbuttons his pants, chuckling to 
           himself. He is ancient. 

           He grabs her arm to pull her closer. She resists the embrace, 
           even in chains, clutching something under her robes. 

                                 OLD MAN 
                        You’re so pretty, I bet you have 
                        sweet nectar running between your 
                        thighs... 

           Aissa grimaces as he kisses her neck, ripping her dress and 
           robes.
           The robes fall on the bed. A RUSTY METAL OBJECT peeks into 
           view. 

           He pushes her onto the bed and climbs on top of her, heaving, 
           breathing heavy. 

           In a quick motion, she grabs a rusty TENT STAKE from under 
           her robes, turns, and STABS him viciously in his side, 
           piercing his lungs. 

           He tries to cry out but only blood spurts from his mouth. 

           She pushes him off of her and onto the bed. Aissa removes the 
           stake, blood pouring onto the sheets. 

           Aissa holds the stake high and drives it deep into his 
           throat. 

           The old man’s eyes widen, shocked. He takes his last 
           struggling, gurgling breaths and expires.

           Breathing heavily and hearing the party outside, Aissa 
           contemplates her next move as he bleeds out on the bed. 

           It almost looks like the "marriage" was consummated. 

           EXT. MARRIAGE TENT - SAME

           Aissa escapes, tearing a hole in the back of the cloth tent. 

           She peers around to see if it’s clear and crawls through. 

           TWO GUARDS stand in front of the tent, patrolling. 

           She takes off in the opposite direction. 

           The guards come upon the hole in the tent, examining it 
           quizzically. Aissa is no longer in sight. 

           EXT. VILLAGE COMPOUND - SAME 

           Aissa frantically searches for High Brother Davu’s tent, 
           wearing only the tattered, bloodied remains of her “wedding” 
           dress, her hands still loosely chained together.

           She passes a group of Sister Wives dancing around a fire. She 
           dodges them behind an empty tent. 

           She runs through the maze of dwellings. She finally sees a 
           tent decorated with a brightly colored tapestry, one that 
           matches Davu’s markings. 
           INT. HIGH BROTHER DAVU TENT - SAME 

           Aissa enters the tent, she spots her GORILLA PELT hanging 
           from one of the beams. She stands on her tip toes to grab it 
           when she sees--

           HIGH BROTHER DAVU walks out from behind a Japanese folding 
           screen, his robes open. 

           He admires himself in front of a full length mirror. We see 
           now that he is a EUNUCH. 

           He slowly brushes a tattered black wig he wears. A large 
           STACK OF BILLS clutter the vanity in front of him. 

           Aissa freezes. 

           Brother Davu spins around, clutching his robes, and spots 
           Aissa standing barefoot and bloodied before him. 

           He quickly re-ties his robes and points a black GUN at her. 

                                 HIGH BROTHER DAVU
                        I told you to give up hope. 

           Brother Davu clicks the safety off of the gun. Aissa steps 
           closer. 

           In her periphery, she spots the idol of her sister on the 
           stand next to him. 

           Brother Davu follows her gaze. A smile creeps across his face 
           and he grasps the IDOL of Aissa’s sister. He throws it at her 
           feet. 

                                 HIGH BROTHER DAVU (CONT’D)
                        You should have this. It’s all you 
                        will ever see of your sister, a 
                        token to take to your grave.

                                 AISSA
                        It is you who should give up hope. 

           Aissa leans down and grabs the idol, eyes never leaving Davu. 
           He readjusts the gun in his hand, unsteady.

                                 HIGH BROTHER DAVU
                        What a shame. Beauty like yours 
                        unclaimed, unused. Only the 
                        naturally beautiful can afford to 
                        be so ungrateful.  

           She RUNS towards him, enraged, a mad expression fiercely 
           etched across her face. 
           Brother Davu SHOOTS the gun. The bullet ricochets and misses.  

           She KNOCKS him off his feet, and TACKLES him to the ground, 
           his black wig flying off. She STRADDLES his frail body.  

           He struggles desperately, flailing his arms, trying to get 
           her off.  

           He yelps as she grabs his HEAD, lifting it

           HER FACE FURIOUS, she SLAMS his head into the ground angrily, 
           like the gorilla, over and over, until his skull cracks open 
           like an egg. 

           She FORCES her thumbs into his EYE SOCKETS, deeper and deeper 
           until only two BLACK HOLES remain. 

           A puddle of blood grows around him.   

           She grabs his GUN from his now lifeless hand and stands, 
           spitting on his corpse. 

           She rummages through his chest and finds her dagger. She 
           holds it up, examining the gleaming steel, and the symbol of 
           the Light Crusaders. 

           EXT. VILLAGE COMPOUND - NIGHT 

           Aissa stealthily navigates her way through the village, the 
           GORILLA PELT on her shoulders. She spots the exit in the 
           distance where the village becomes the jungle. 

           She darts to freedom when she sees--

           ZALIKA 

           crying, is dragged by two guards into a marital tent. A 
           figure waits inside. 

           Aissa stops dead in her tracks. 

                                                        CROSS FADE TO:

           EXT. AISSA’S VILLAGE - NIGHT - FLASHBACK

           SCREAMS ring out from the burning village, flames rising from 
           the rooftops.

           Naima is dragged off by Crusaders. Her eyes wide with fear.

           BACK TO PRESENT:
           EXT. VILLAGE COMPOUND - NIGHT

           The look in Aissa’s eyes shows us her decision. 

           INT. MARITAL TENT #2 - NIGHT 

           ZALIKA’S POV

           AN OLD MAN thrusting and shoving on top of her. 

           Sweaty, grotesque, grunting. He is not the man of her dreams. 

           A GUN SHOT blasts and--

           HIS HEAD EXPLODES. 

           Zalika SCREAMS, shocked, as chunks of brain matter and specks 
           of blood fly onto her cheek. 

           What’s left of the old man’s head hangs limp, scorched flesh 
           on top of her. 

           Reveal behind him, our heroine, Aissa, holding the gun at 
           point blank range, her chains shot off. 

                                 AISSA
                        Get up. 

                                 ZALIKA
                        You killed him! You just shot him--

           Aissa drags her out from under him. Zalika grabs the bloody 
           sheet, wrapping it around her. 

           TWO GUARDS rush into the tent, and are shocked by the 
           gruesome scene.  

                                 GUARD #1 
                        Stop murderer!

           Only a few feet away, Aissa shoots them both with ease, right 
           in the forehead. They fall to the ground.

           Aissa grabs a second gun from Guard #1’s corpse.

                                 ZALIKA
                        Where are we going?

           Aissa grabs Zalika’s hands, still chained together. Zalika is 
           terrified as Aissa shoots a bullet at the ground, right 
           through her chains. 

           The chains drop to the floor.
                                 AISSA
                        You can keep asking stupid 
                        questions or you can get out of 
                        here alive. 

           EXT. MARITAL TENT #2 - NIGHT 

           A PASSING WOMAN IN RED spots the two girls as they exit the 
           tent, Zalika covered in blood. 

                                 WOMAN IN RED 
                           (screaming)
                        GUARDS! GUARDS! 

           Aissa quickly slits the woman’s throat. Blood GUSHES out and 
           she collapses to the ground, silenced.

                                 AISSA
                        Here! 

           Aissa tosses the smaller gun to Zalika. She inspects it, 
           bewildered. 

                                 AISSA (CONT’D)
                        Point and shoot. 

           Guards swarm the tent. Zalika stands frozen in the carnage 
           around her, unable to react. 

                                 AISSA (CONT’D)
                        Like this.

           Aissa GRABS her arm and pulls the trigger, shooting GUARD #1 
           in the head. 

           Aissa stands ready, Zalika cowers behind her, holding onto 
           her arm. 

           The Guards close in on them. 

           Zalika closes her eyes and SQUEEZES the trigger with both 
           hands. 

           She hits GUARD #3 and GUARD #4 and they EXPLODE backward from 
           the impact. 

           GUARD #5 manages to break through the gunfire and reach 
           Aissa. 

           Aissa roundhouse kicks Guard #5 in the head and brings him to 
           the ground with her legs wrapped around his neck. 
           She slams him into the ground and cuts his throat without 
           hesitation. 

           Another guard lunges at her from behind but she turns and 
           stabs him in the chest.

           The last guard retreats, then BANG. He falls, shot, Aissa’s 
           smoking gun aimed in his direction. 

           Zalika stands holding her gun outright with her eyes closed. 
           She opens one eye, cautiously.  

           Aissa rushes to her side. 

                                 AISSA (CONT’D)
                        Can’t imagine how many you’d hit if 
                        you’d open your eyes!

           They hear shouting guards in the distance. Women wail over 
           the dead. 

           EXT. VILLAGE COURTYARD - SAME

           Aissa and Zalika run towards the jungle through a panicked 
           group of old men and young women. 

           Guards follow them, hot on their trail. 

           Zalika is shooting at her pursuers. Her eyes are open. She’s 
           learning.

           Aissa feverishly looks around for a viable escape from their 
           attackers. 

           She sees an OBESE OLDER MAN forcing a YOUNG WOMAN into a 
           DILAPIDATED TRANSPORT VAN parked on the opposite side of the 
           yard. 

           Aissa shoots Zalika a look. 

                                 AISSA
                        The van.

           Zalika nods and they make a run for the vehicle. Aissa weaves 
           through the crowd as they try to stop her. 

           One man reaches for her pelt, but she--

           CUTS HIS HAND OFF.  

           He WAILS in pain, retracting his stubbed arm. 
                                 AISSA (CONT’D)
                        Nobody takes anything from me ever 
                        again.

           The Obese man sees Aissa coming towards him and stops 
           struggling with the Young Girl. The Girl bolts off in the 
           opposite direction. 

           He’s distracted as Aissa charges at him, and THROWS her 
           knife. 

           He drops like a sack of potatoes, KNIFE wedged in his 
           forehead. 

           Aissa’s hand reaches down and yanks the knife back. 

           INT./EXT. PASSENGER VAN - CONTINUOUS

           Aissa climbs into the driver seat, hunting for the keys. They 
           drop down from the visor. She starts the engine and looks at 
           the passenger seat. 

           NO ZALIKA.  

                                 AISSA
                        Shit! 

           Aissa looks through the windshield and sees a group of women 
           has Zalika trapped in the middle of the courtyard. Guards 
           approach to see what the commotion is about.

           Zalika screams out from her human imprisonment.

           Aissa slams her foot into the base board of the van. It 
           SCREAMS forward, throwing dust everywhere, heading straight 
           for the crowd.  

           People jump out of the way, if they can.

           At the last second she veers to the right and opens her 
           driver side door.

           Metal CRUSHES bone as the women surrounding Zalika are plowed 
           down by the car door. 

           Zalika is left standing as villagers run for their lives. The 
           van comes to a screeching halt. Aissa flings open the 
           passenger door. 

                                 AISSA (CONT’D)
                        Come on!
           Zalika daintily steps over the dead bodies and enters the 
           van. She hops up and Aissa peels off before she can close the 
           door. 

           They roar off into the night as villagers run for their 
           lives. 

           EXT. DIRT ROAD - DAWN 

           The rusty, old van sputters. Black smoke billowing from the 
           exhaust pipe. The van slows to a stop.

           Aissa exits. She opens the engine and chokes on a cloud of 
           smoke. 

                                 AISSA
                        It’s shot. 

           Zalika, exiting the van, looks sad, guilty. 

                                 ZALIKA
                        I knew something like this would 
                        happen! We’ve cursed the Gods and 
                        now they will punish us!

           Aissa turns to Zalika. 

                                 AISSA
                        What they did to you could never be 
                        the work of Gods. What they did to 
                        you was simple, human greed. If 
                        anyone has cursed our Gods, it is 
                        them.

           Zalika nods, only half believing Aissa.

                                 ZALIKA
                        But what are we going to do? 

                                 AISSA
                        We’re going to walk. 

           EXT. DIRT ROAD - LATE MORNING  

           Zalika looks worse for wear. Aissa charges along, like a 
           soldier on the battlefield.

                                 ZALIKA
                        I’m tired. 

                                 AISSA
                        We’ll sleep when we get there. 
                                 ZALIKA
                        ...I’m thirsty. 

                                 AISSA
                        We’ll drink when we get there. 

                                 ZALIKA
                        Where is ‘there’? 

                                 AISSA
                        Be quiet, Zalika. There are 
                        militias in the jungle and they 
                        WILL be looking for us.  

           Zalika walks silent. Then she can’t help herself. 

                                 ZALIKA
                           (whispers)
                        Come on, tell me where we’re going. 

                                 AISSA
                        I told you -- we’re going to get 
                        the Big Gun. Then it’s to the 
                        southern border.

                                 ZALIKA
                        We already HAVE guns. 

                                 AISSA
                        Not little guns, Zalika. I have big 
                        vermin to kill. I need the Big Gun. 

                                 ZALIKA 
                        Kalashnikov? 

                                 AISSA
                        Bigger. 

                                 ZALIKA
                        HK416?

                                 AISSA
                        Bigger. 

                                 ZALIKA
                        You mean... you must mean...

                                 AISSA
                        I want their loved ones to watch as 
                        I lay metal into their faces, until 
                        they can no longer recognize who 
                        they are. Until their souls flee, 
                        not sure what they inhabit anymore.  
           Zalika looks at Aissa in stunned silence. They walk for a few 
           beats, Zalika trailing behind. 

                                 ZALIKA
                        I might know someone who can get 
                        you the gun you want... 

           Aissa stops in her tracks. 

                                 AISSA
                        Who? Take me there. 

                                 ZALIKA
                        I... I don’t know. They’re really 
                        dangerous...

           Aissa marches to her, grabs her by the arm and looks her mean 
           in the eye. 

                                 AISSA
                        I saved your life. If you want to 
                        keep it, you’ll tell me everything.

           Zalika nods, meek. Aissa releases her. 

                                 ZALIKA
                        I don’t know if they live there 
                        still. I knew a boy ten years 
                        ago... he was a good friend to me. 
                        But his parents were arms dealers 
                        and the village wouldn’t have them, 
                        so they moved to a compound across 
                        the jungle, on the outskirts of a 
                        small trading post. I hid in their 
                        truck when they left, not wanting 
                        to leave him, and I stayed at their 
                        armory until my parents found out. 
                        They were furious. 

           Zalika allows herself a small, defiant smile, but it fades 
           away. 

                                 ZALIKA (CONT’D)
                        I haven’t seen him since. I could 
                        take you there, but it’s far from 
                        here, even with all the way we 
                        drove. It could take all day and 
                        all night to get there. And they 
                        might be long gone. 

                                 AISSA
                        If they have the gun I need, it 
                        would be worth a thousand days and 
                        nights on foot. Show me.
           EXT. ARMS DEALER COMPOUND - DAWN 

           Aissa and Zalika come upon a makeshift camp built of 
           corrugated steel. A shanty town, but luxurious compared to 
           the last village.

           As they get closer, they see a COUPLE, arguing. 

           Watkin Wyk (late 30s) a thuggish, South African white boy, 
           SMACKS a passed out, AMERICAN TOURIST (40s) in safari gear 
           with a frying pan. 

           TOURIST POV

           Watkin peers down, confused. 

                                 WATKIN
                        Dammit, I always fokk this part up!

           Anri Wyk (30s) an equally thuggish, pale pixie of girl with 
           white-blonde hair, screams at Watkin in frustration. 

                                 ANRI 
                        Hit him again! 

           Watkin hits him again. 

                                 ANRI (CONT’D)
                        Oh, that’ll do I guess. 

           Anri cuts his throat, drains his blood into a sack. 

           Watkin looks up and spots Aissa and Zalika watching, still in 
           their bloodied “wedding” garments. 

           Zalika looks terrified. Watkin jumps to standing, wielding 
           the frying pan. 

                                 WATKIN
                        Who da fokk are you?! 

           Anri looks up, pissed, concerned.

                                 ANRI
                        Yeah! Who da FOKK are you?!

           Aissa shoves Zalika forward. 

                                 ZALIKA
                        Um, hi Mr. Wyk. It’s Zalika. Me and 
                        Elian used to play together?  

           Anri and Watkin stare at Aissa and Zalika trying to remember. 
                                 ANRI 
                        Oh my fokkin’ god! Little Zali! Is 
                        that you?

           Anri wraps her in a warm embrace. 

                                 ANRI (CONT’D)
                        Look at you! What happened, baby 
                        girl? You’re covered in blood!

           Zalika hugs her back tight. She begins to cry. 

           Anri shares a look with Watkin. He shrugs. 

                                 ANRI (CONT’D)
                        Come in, cherrie, Anri will take 
                        care of you. 

           INT. WATKIN & ANRI’S SHACK - DAY 

           Anri cooks something questionable in the frying pan. 

           Strange artwork, CROSSES and ANIMAL SKULLS decorate the steel 
           walls. 

                                 ANRI
                        Elian is going to be so happy to 
                        see you. It’s been very long. 

           Aissa and Zalika sit at a table with Watkin. They have 
           showered and been given fresh clothes, Americanized t-shirts 
           and jeans. Aissa’s Gorilla pelt is draped over her shoulders. 

                                 ZALIKA
                        I have missed Elian. Very much. 

           Anri places a pitcher of thick, blood red liquid on the 
           table. 

                                 ANRI
                        Tell me, little Zali, what makes 
                        you cry so? 

           Zalika tries to hold it in, but can’t help but break down 
           again.

                                 ZALIKA
                        The Crusaders burned our village... 
                        and I was sent to the High Sisters 
                        to be married. But it was horrible! 
                        And Aissa saved me from them. But 
                        my parents will never take me back 
                        once they hear what I have done. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ZALIKA (CONT'D)
                        I’ve betrayed their wishes. Now I 
                        can never go home... 

           Anri wipes Zalika’s tears.

                                 ANRI
                        You always have a home here, sweet 
                        girl.

                                 AISSA
                        You can’t stay here. The Crusaders 
                        are burning villages to the ground, 
                        all the way to the southern border, 
                        and they will burn you too.

                                 ANRI
                        I think we should be fine. 

                                 AISSA
                        You don’t know these savages. 
                        You’re not safe. No one is safe 
                        until Gabriel and his army are 
                        stopped.  

           Anri takes notice of Aissa’s determination. 

                                 WATKIN
                        I decide what is safe. 

           ELIAN WYK (17) a white South African boy, handsome, but rough 
           around the edges, like a young Clint Eastwood, walks in. 

           Zalika’s eyes light up and she springs to her feet, hugging 
           Elian.  

                                 ZALIKA
                        Elian! 

           Elian returns the excitement. 

                                 ELIAN 
                        Zalika? Is that really you? 

                                 ZALIKA
                        I never thought I’d see you again.

                                 ELIAN
                        I can’t even believe you’re here. 
                        When was the last time?

                                 ZALIKA
                        Almost ten years ago, hiding in 
                        your armory, begging mother to let 
                        me stay. 
                                 ELIAN
                        She never liked us. She was always 
                        mean.

                                 ZALIKA
                        She still is... I’m so happy to be 
                        with you all! 

           Elian moves closer to Zalika, gazing at her warmly and taking 
           her hands in his. Electric. 

                                 ELIAN
                        I’m happy to be with you. 

           A beat as Elian and Zalika smile at each other.

                                 AISSA
                        I heard you have guns. 

           Aissa breaks up the reunion. 

           A TENSE MOMENT as the hosts take offense to her bluntness. 
           Looks like Watkin might make a move but he starts to chuckle. 

                                 WATKIN 
                        You came to see a fokkin’ show?! 

           Watkin SLAMS his hand on the table loudly. He exits. Aissa 
           follows, Zalika trailing behind.  

           INT. GUN ROOM - DAY 

           Watkin opens the metal doors to reveal WALL TO WALL GUNS. 

           MACHINE GUNS, SHOT GUNS, PISTOLS, KNIVES, BULLETS, KEVLAR 
           VESTS. The Holy Grail of weaponry. 

           And set aside, in a special case, is THE BIG GUN. The 
           biggest, meanest, sharpest machine gun you’ve ever seen.

           With a weapon like that, Aissa might stand a chance. 

           Aissa can’t help but stare. Watkin follows her gaze.

           He removes the Big Gun from its precious case. It’s more 
           impressive up close. 

                                 WATKIN
                        Beautiful, isn’t she? Nick-named 
                        The Big Gun cause it’s a big 
                        FOKKIN’ gun. Eight hundred and 
                        fifty rounds in less than a minute, 
                        easily the fastest anywhere. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 WATKIN (CONT'D)
                        Light weight and easy to aim with 
                        up-to- the-minute stabilization 
                        technology. But it’s the hollow 
                        point bullets that make sure you 
                        can’t lose. She can really fok 
                        someone up.

           Aissa’s eyes grow large. 

                                 WATKIN (CONT’D)
                        You planning to fok someone up?

                                 ANRI
                        Quit toying with the girl. Show it 
                        to her.

           Watkin holds the Big Gun in his arms like a baby. He flips it 
           around and points it directly at Aissa. 

           Anri squeals with glee.

           Aissa stands still, defiant. She pushes her chest into the 
           nose of the gun. Zalika clutches her arm.

           Watkin lowers the weapon. He laughs uproariously. 

                                 WATKIN
                        I’m just fokkin’ with you. No need 
                        to be so serious. You want to touch 
                        the gun, pretty cherrie? 

           Aissa nods. 

                                 ANRI
                        Well, then you need to give us 
                        somefin’. We don’t give guns away 
                        for free. 

           Aissa reaches into her jeans pocket and drops the jewelry 
           from her “wedding” into Anri’s hands. Anri sifts through it.   

                                 ANRI (CONT’D)
                        Pretty, but fake. This won’t buy 
                        you the Big Gun. 

           Aissa’s face drops with disappointment. 

           Watkin twists his mustache, examining Aissa. 

                                 WATKIN
                        That pelt... is that--

                                 AISSA
                        A gorilla. 
                                 WATKIN 
                        Shit. That’s pretty fokkin’ dope. 

                                 ANRI
                        I bet you’d look really fresh in a 
                        fokkin’ gorilla coat, Watkin! 

                                 WATKIN
                        Ok. That’s the price. Your gorilla. 

           Aissa hesitantly removes the massive gorilla fur. She hands 
           it to Watkin. He SNATCHES it, throwing it on. 

           He showboats, smiling wide, revealing his gold teeth. 

                                 ANRI
                        Fokkin’ fresh, Watkin. Like a king.

                                 WATKIN
                        I am the fokkin’ king! 

           Watkin beats his chest like a gorilla, chases Anri around 
           playfully. She giggles. He catches her, kissing her. They get 
           lost in the moment. 

                                 AISSA
                        ...the gun?

           Watkin stops kissing Anri. She giggles. 

                                 WATKIN 
                        Yes! The gun. Don’t worry, it’s 
                        still here, cherrie. 

           Watkin holds the gun out. Aissa reaches out for it. Before 
           she can grab it--

           SHOUTING from outside. 

           Watkin yanks the gun back out of instinct. 

           HULKING NIGERIAN ARMS DEALERS storm through the armory door. 

           Zalika SCREAMS, Aissa pushes her and Elian out of the way of 
           the attacking Nigerians. 

           NIGERIAN #1 grabs Aissa by the hair and drags her to the 
           ground. She uses her dagger to stab his BIG TOE.

           He stumbles and Aissa regains traction. She turns to face 
           him. 

           He KICKS her square in the chest and she goes TOPPLING into a 
           gun rack. He inches towards her, ready to kill.
           Elian and Zalika cower, out of sight from the Nigerians, 
           behind a gun rack. Zalika tries to peak out but Elian holds 
           her back. He motions to a corner at the opposite end.  

           Aissa quickly grabs a pistol from the gun rack and puts down 
           her attacker. He falls. She crouches behind the gun rack, 
           shooting Nigerians from cover. 

           Watkin is locked in a battle with the BIGGEST NIGERIAN, buff, 
           ferocious, a shark with legs. They struggle for the Big Gun. 

           He overpowers Watkin, flinging him to the floor, and takes 
           the Big Gun. He STOMPS his boot on Watkin’s head, keeping him 
           down.  

                                 BIGGEST NIGERIAN 
                        When you first got into the trade, 
                        I tolerated you. You stayed out of 
                        my way. Now you’re in my way.

           The Biggest Nigerian inspects the weapon, taken aback by its 
           magnificence. 

                                 BIGGEST NIGERIAN (CONT’D)
                        Can’t deny your quality. But you’re 
                        not expanding south. In fact, 
                        you’re not expanding at all. You’re 
                        imploding. 

           He finds the correct hand configurations, points and aims at 
           Watkin’s head.

           The Big Nigerian is half a second from blowing Watkin’s 
           brains out when--

           Anri grabs a SICKLE from the wall, and in one graceful swing 
           DECAPITATES the Big Nigerian. 

           His head falls to the floor with a thud.

                                 WATKIN
                        Tight.

           Anri swings again and CHOPS a Nigerian in half, his torso 
           falling to the floor. 

           Watkin plucks the Big Gun from the dead arms of the Nigerian, 
           and gets to work, gunning down their attackers. 

           It’s wildly impressive. 

           Anri fights alongside Watkin, slicing any Nigerian soldier 
           who gets near.
           MORE NIGERIANS flood the gun room. 

           Watkin lets out a thunderous battle cry as he SHOOTS DOWN the 
           oncoming attackers. 

           He writhes as he is hit by enemy bullets, but it doesn’t slow 
           him down.

           Anri grabs a FLAMETHROWER from the wall and showers FIRE on 
           the horde of Nigerians. Men run, engulfed in flames. 

           The fire quickly spreads to the wooden beams, and the 
           compound begins to burn.  

                                 WATKIN (CONT’D)
                        Oh shit! 

           Elian peeks out from the gun rack. The Nigerians are 
           distracted with Watkin and Anri in a FULL ON GUN-FIGHT

                                 ANRI
                        Elian, Go!

           Elian crawls along the back wall, Zalika following, towards 
           the corner and lifts a TILE from the ground. 

           Aissa looks across through the fight and sees THE DISTURBED 
           TILE Elian lifted. 

           Aissa crawls over and slips the tile out of place to reveal a 
           SMALL UNDERGROUND TUNNEL. 

           She wiggles through. Her hand hits the tile as she descends, 
           and it SHATTERS.

           One Nigerian hears the noise and spots Aissa disappearing 
           into the floor. 

           INT. UNDERGROUND TUNNEL - CONTINUOUS

           Aissa DROPS down the narrow, vertical opening. 

           She tumbles to the ground, into a larger channel. Light 
           shines through at the other end. She runs toward it. 

           Faint yells from the armory echo in the tunnel. It escalates.  

           BANG. BANG. BANG. 

           Aissa RUNS. 
           EXT. WATKIN AND ANRI’S CAMP - SAME

           Aissa bursts into a clearing. She sees Elian tending to 
           Zalika under a neighboring tree and angrily marches over.

           She snatches Zalika away from Elian like a disobedient child. 

                                 AISSA
                        We are leaving. 

           Zalika resists. 

                                 ZALIKA
                        Not without Elian. 

                                 AISSA
                        He isn’t part of the plan. 

                                 ZALIKA
                        There is no plan, Aissa! You’re as 
                        lost as we are! 

           They hear footsteps racing down the tunnel. The Nigerian Arms 
           Dealers flood out of the tunnel towards the trio. 

                                 ELIAN
                        We need to move! 

           Elian grabs Zalika’s hand and takes off. Aissa whips around 
           to see Zalika dart into the jungle. 

           She takes off after them. The Nigerians follow close behind. 

           EXT. DEEP JUNGLE - CONTINUOUS

           Elian runs like a gazelle through the dense greenery, Zalika 
           struggles to keep up. 

           Aissa RUNS for her life, trailing behind them. She looks over 
           her shoulder and sees the Nigerians close on her heels. 

           Close enough to GRAB HER WRIST. 

           Aissa is YANKED through her attacker’s legs. She screams, but 
           quickly flips around and STABS the Nigerian in the back of 
           the knee. 

           He drops to the floor, WAILING in agony.  

           Aissa scrambles to standing as the others nearly catch her.  
           She takes off, dodging Nigerian gunfire. She almost catches 
           up to Zalika and Elian when Elian guides Zalika down a SHARP 
           RIGHT TURN. 

           Registering, Aissa corrects her path, barely making the turn, 
           and avoiding a GIANT BED OF LEAVES. 

           She notices its oddly precise arrangement as she SLAMS 
           sideways into a tree. 

           The Nigerians are feet away from Aissa when they FALL FLAT. 
           They struggle to get up, everything they grab sinks. 

           Nigerian #1 tries to shoot his gun, but it’s clogged with 
           what we’re realizing is QUICK SAND. 

                                 ZALIKA 
                           (shouting)
                        Aissa! Aissa!

           Elian runs over to help Aissa up. She shrugs him off, pushing 
           herself to standing. 

                                 ELIAN
                        We have to hurry, I don’t know how 
                        long it will hold them. 

           The trio runs off into the dense jungle. 

           EXT. CRUSADERS OF CHRIST CARAVAN - NIGHT 

           NAIMA crouches with other girls in a cage that is being 
           carried by soldiers. 

           The Crusaders beat their drums to the same angry rhythm.

           The cage comes to a halt and the drums stop in time.  

           COMMANDER GABRIEL climbs out of his Jeep. He walks back 
           through the group towards Naima’s cage. 

           He grips either side of the cage bars, looking up and down at 
           each of the scared girls. 

                                 COMMANDER GABRIEL
                        Shh. It’s ok. No harm will fall to 
                        you while you are in my care.   

           He snaps his fingers. 
                                 COMMANDER GABRIEL (CONT’D)
                        In fact, we are going to celebrate 
                        in your honor. It’s not every day 
                        we come across such beauty. 

           Commander Gabriel reaches through the cage and strokes one of 
           the girl’s cheeks. He looks into Naima’s eyes.  

           HIS JAGGED SMILE.

           Soldiers carry in a BADLY BEATEN MAN tied to a wooden 
           CRUCIFIX. His screams are muffled because his mouth is 
           crudely sewn shut. 

                                 COMMANDER GABRIEL (CONT’D)
                        When I found you girls, your souls 
                        were lost. You were destined to die 
                        a thousand fiery deaths in Satan’s 
                        torment. We saved you from that 
                        fate, and you should find your 
                        hearts filled with gratitude.

           The girls’ gaze follows the man as he is lowered in front of 
           them. 

                                 COMMANDER GABRIEL (CONT’D)
                        To make sure you understand, and 
                        are truly grateful, I am going to 
                        show you what happens when you 
                        don’t believe. 

           The soldiers start hammering the crucifix into the ground. 

                                 COMMANDER GABRIEL (CONT’D)
                        This man... this man is a pagan and 
                        a sodomite. 

           The prisoner screams as his hands are NAILED to the cross.

                                 COMMANDER GABRIEL (CONT’D)
                        Each village of sinners we burn, 
                        each Unforgiveable we slaughter 
                        brings us one step closer to our 
                        holy goal. 

           He raises his hands to the heavens. 

                                 COMMANDER GABRIEL (CONT’D)
                        Our war has just begun. May the 
                        Lord bless our sacred journey to 
                        restore Africa in His name. 

           Other Crusaders unload firewood from the jeeps in the 
           caravan. They place it at the base of the crucifix.
           Commander Gabriel yells out to his troops in a thundering 
           bellow. 

                                 COMMANDER GABRIEL (CONT’D)
                        Crusaders!

           The crowd cheers.  

                                 COMMANDER GABRIEL (CONT’D)
                        CRUSADERS! What happens to 
                        Unforgiveables?

                                 CROWD
                        THEY BURN!

           The caravan erupts in celebration. Some shoot their guns. 

           Commander Gabriel turns to the girls. 

                                 COMMANDER GABRIEL
                        That’s right. They burn. 

           A woman in ALL WHITE, face obscured, emerges. The Crusaders 
           immediately KNEEL.

                                 CROWD
                        ALL HAIL THE WHITE WITCH!

           The WHITE WITCH (30s) lights a TORCH and hands it to 
           Commander Gabriel.

                                 COMMANDER GABRIEL
                        May the Almighty have mercy on your 
                        soul.

                                 WHITE WITCH 
                        Amen.

           Commander Gabriel tosses the torch at the base of the 
           crucifix. The firewood ignites and engulfs the infidel. 

           He rips through the wire stitching on his mouth. BLOOD 
           CURDLING SCREAMS.

           Commander Gabriel crouches down next to the cage. He grabs 
           Naima’s face through the bars, kissing her sloppily.  

                                 COMMANDER GABRIEL
                        You don’t want to burn. 
           EXT. JUNGLE - DAY 

           Aissa bounds ahead as Zalika rushes to keep up and Elian 
           keeps a safe distance. 

                                 AISSA
                        I don’t trust him. 

                                 ZALIKA
                        He can help us, Aissa! He’s an arms 
                        dealer, he knows where to get the 
                        Big Gun.

                                 ELIAN
                        You’re wrong, Aissa.

                                 AISSA
                        Wrong about what? 

                                 ELIAN
                        Me not being part of the plan. I am 
                        the plan. You need the Big Gun to 
                        face the Crusaders. I can help you 
                        get it.  

           Aissa turns abruptly to face Elian.

                                 AISSA
                        Your parents. You just let them 
                        die? Where is your honor?

                                 ELIAN
                        It was my mother’s wish. I know if 
                        my parents have perished, they 
                        would want me to live on in their 
                        name. They wanted me to bring 
                        Zalika to safety and have a chance 
                        at life.

           Aissa is silent. 

                                 ZALIKA
                        He saved my life, Aissa. 

           Zalika grabs Elian’s hand. 

                                 ZALIKA (CONT’D)
                        He makes me feel... like I have a 
                        home. He makes me feel safe.

           Elian gazes at Zalika, truly taking in her beauty for the 
           first time. 

           Aissa witnesses their moment and softens.
                                 AISSA
                        How can you get the Big Gun? 

                                 ELIAN
                        Our supplier is in the Congo. If we 
                        can get there, we can get the Big 
                        Gun.

           Aissa contemplates for a beat. 

                                 AISSA
                        We’ll travel to the Congo, to your 
                        source. But if you’re lying, even 
                        the Gods won’t be able to help you. 

           EXT. JUNGLE - LATER

           The trio continues trekking in a particularly dense part of 
           the bush. 

           A CRYING BABY 

           wails faintly in the distance. 

                                 ZALIKA 
                        Did you hear that? 

           Zalika tip toes off in the direction of the sound.  

           Elian and Aissa share a worried, confused look, following. 

           Zalika pushes through branches, the cries getting louder. 

           Zalika GASPS as she sees an INFANT in a basket in a small 
           clearing. 

           Aissa watches as Zalika walks closer. She goes to touch it, 
           to comfort it. 

                                 AISSA
                        DON’T! 

           An ARMED CHILD #1, 10, appearing out of nowhere, CRASHES the 
           butt of an AK into Zalika’s head, knocking her out cold. The 
           child drags her into the jungle.

           Aissa reacts, her hand flying to her knife but they are 
           suddenly surrounded by ARMED CHILDREN, pointing weapons. 

           Elian puts his hands up. Aissa shoots him a disdainful look. 
           EXT. JUNGLE - LATER 

           An ARMED CHILD #2, 8, SHOVES Aissa forward with the butt of 
           his gun. 

           Elian walks obediently. 

           A MANGY CAMP emerges in the distance. Make-shift dwellings, 
           soldiers of all ages in dirty clothes patrol with guns. 

           EXT. REBEL CAMP - DAY 

           Aissa SLAMS to the ground as she is thrown into a DIRT HOLE 
           about ten feet deep. 

           Elian and Zalika are already crouched in the dirt. Aissa 
           pulls herself to standing, her eyes frantically searching for 
           a way out.

           The two Armed Children guard the prisoners at the edge of the 
           hole. 

           Zalika looks stunned, flushed, apologetic. 

                                 ZALIKA
                        I’m sorry... I’m so sorry... I 
                        thought the baby would die in the 
                        bush.

                                 AISSA
                        Sorry’s no use to us. Because of 
                        your kindness, my sister’s going to 
                        die!

                                 ELIAN
                        It’s okay, you didn’t know. 

                                 AISSA
                        What happens when they decide they 
                        don’t need prisoners? Our enemies 
                        only have to pull the trigger.  

           Aissa slides down the dirt wall to the ground, defeated. She 
           reaches into her pocket and pulls out the idol of her sister. 

                                 AISSA (CONT’D)
                        This could really be over... I 
                        might never see her again.

           Aissa’s eyes well with tears. 

                                 ZALIKA
                        Don’t say that.
           She rolls the idol through her fingers, examining it. 

                                 AISSA
                        Maybe I should have left her with 
                        the High Sisters. They don’t 
                        require sense.  

           Zalika looks hurt. 

                                 ELIAN
                        She cares. She’s a good person. 

                                 AISSA
                        You know where good people wind up? 
                        Here. In a cage. The bad people 
                        always beat the good people. 

                                 ZALIKA
                        That’s not true. 

                                 AISSA
                        I’ve never seen a good person win. 

           Aissa looks sad, thinking of her own demons. 

                                 ELIAN
                        It’s not about being a good person 
                        or a bad person. It’s about who has 
                        the guns. 

           OUTSIDE THE HOLE 

           Armed Child #1 holds a gun, his small body weighed down with 
           sheets of bullets. He smiles, waving to a friend, his dimples 
           show.

           Rebels gather, all heavily armed, many young boys, too young 
           to hold guns. 

           Women, frightened looks on their faces, are led in chains 
           into tents.

           Armed Child #1 gushes cheerfully to the younger, Armed Child 
           #2. 

                                 ARMED CHILD #1
                        We’re going to the palace by the 
                        sea. The pretty White Witch will 
                        bless us all. And we will all 
                        become Light Crusaders of Christ. 
                        Fighting in HIS name. Part of 
                        COMMANDER GABRIEL’S army! 
                                 ARMED CHILD #2
                        I want to go to a palace. 

           The REBEL LEADER yells out a wild call. Silence overtakes the 
           busy, crowded campsite, all eyes on the Rebel Leader.  

                                 REBEL LEADER 
                        Today we travel south to the sea. 
                        To The Palace of The Light 
                        Crusaders of Christ. We will join 
                        them to create an army that is 
                        INVINCIBLE! 

           The crowd ROARS with applause. 

                                 REBEL LEADER (CONT’D)
                        Today, Christian rebels everywhere 
                        will join in resistance! We will 
                        not be crushed under the thumb of 
                        Islam, we will not be tainted with 
                        the pagan worship of the hillsides. 
                        We will forge in blood a NEW 
                        AFRICA! A peaceful Africa! A 
                        Christian Africa!

           The crowd SHOOTS bullets in the air, yelling and cheering. 

           The Rebel Leader lifts a goblet of red wine. 

                                 REBEL LEADER (CONT’D)
                        To a Christian Africa. 

           He slowly brings it to his lips, about to take a sip. 

           CRASH 

           A bullet RIPS through the glass, it shatters instantly. 

           A second later a bullet RIPS through the Rebel Leader’s 
           skull. He hovers then drops. 

           The crowd pauses, unsure how to react. Then the Armed Child 
           #1 screams at the top of his lungs. 

                                 ARMED CHILD #1 
                        GOVERNMENT SOLDIERS! 

           The Rebels spring to action, they OPEN FIRE in the direction 
           of the government soldiers. 

           GOVERNMENT SOLDIERS, in camouflage and military decoration, 
           RETURN FIRE. Soldiers drop, wounded, crying out in agony. 

           THE HOLE
           Aissa is alert, already looking for ways out of the hole. 

                                 AISSA
                        We need to go now! 

           Aissa digs her fingers into the dirt attempting to climb. She 
           makes it part of the way before the dirt CRUMBLES in her 
           hands and she falls down HARD on the ground. 

           The three stare up at freedom. 

           OUTSIDE THE HOLE

           The Armed Children guarding them hear the commotion. They 
           look scared but aim their weapons and FIRE out at the 
           Government Forces. 

           GOVERNMENT SOLDIER #1 charges at them. Armed Child #2 fires 
           his machine gun, stumbling back from the recoil.  

           The Government Soldier’s CHEST EXPLODES. He screams. 

           The older Armed Child #1 pats him on the back. 

                                 ARMED CHILD #1 
                        See? Christ will guide your gun. 

           The Armed Child #2, reassured, takes aim. 

           Before he can squeeze the trigger a bullet KNOCKS him back 
           into the open pit.  

           THE HOLE 

           Aissa, Zalika and Elian dive out of the way of the falling 
           child soldier. 

           Armed Child #1 runs to the edge of the pit and sees his 
           friend dead at the bottom. 

           Elian locks eyes with Armed Child #1. Armed Child #1, 
           realizing the new threat to his life, quickly aims the gun 
           and fires off a round. 

           It misses.

           Elian jerks the gun from the dead Armed Child #2’s hands and 
           SHOOTS Armed Child #1. 

           He stumbles, trips into the hole. His bullet-ridden body 
           limp. 

           Zalika chokes back tears, seeing the children’s lives expire 
           in front of her. But there’s no time for mourning. 
           Elian grabs her, lifts her to his shoulders and Zalika 
           clutches the dirt, dragging herself out of the hole. 

           Aissa grabs her TREASURED KNIFE from the body of Armed Child 
           #1 and Elian gives her a leg up. 

           Elian pushes her up and Zalika grabs her hand, pulling her to 
           standing. 

           Aissa drops to the ground, on her stomach, holding her hand 
           as far as it will reach for Elian. 

           TWO REBELS SPOT them escaping and RUN towards them. 

           Aissa’s desperate face pleads with Elian. 

                                 AISSA
                        Hurry! 

           Elian tries to grab Aissa’s hand but it’s too far away.

           The Two Rebels are a hundred feet away. One shoots his gun. A 
           bullet skims Zalika’s arm, she falls back against a tree. 

           AISSA’S HAND 

           outstretched, grasping. 

           ELIAN’s EYES 

           fierce, frightened. 

           Elian grabs Aissa’s SWEATY PALM, but keeps SLIPPING.

           He grabs her hand with both of his and pulls hard. Aissa 
           falls forward but manages to pull him high enough to GRIP the 
           ground. 

           Elian is almost out. He grips his hand on the edge of the 
           hole to balance his weight, but the dirt slips from beneath 
           him, he loses his footing. 

           The Rebels are fifty feet away. Aissa rethinks, quickly. 

                                 AISSA (CONT’D)
                        THE GUN! 

           Elian, moving fast, grabs the gun and tosses it to Aissa. 

           Seconds before the Rebels slaughter them, Aissa lays lead 
           into their chests, riddling them with bullet holes. 

           Aissa now holds the butt of the gun out to Elian. He swiftly 
           grabs hold and Aissa PULLS with all of her might. 
           Elian’s scrambles up and over the ground, finally out.

           Aissa RUNS for the jungle. Zalika, wounded, slumping against 
           the tree, can barely move. 

           Elian runs, grabs Zalika in his arms and follows Aissa out of 
           the camp. 

           The booming gunshots of civil war echo throughout the camp. 

           EXT. JUNGLE - LATER

           Aissa, Elian and Zalika forge ahead through the brush. 

           Zalika rubs her arm where a LARGE SCAB has formed.

           Aissa begins to push the pace and walks far ahead of the 
           other two.

                                 ZALIKA
                        Aissa, hold on! 

           Zalika tries to catch up with her but Aissa still outpaces 
           her.

                                 ZALIKA (CONT’D)
                        Where are you going?

                                 AISSA
                        That was too close. It’s time we 
                        say goodbye and you go home. I will 
                        find my own way and you must find 
                        yours.

           Aissa starts to walk off on her own. Zalika follows. 

                                 ZALIKA
                        You won’t survive the jungle on 
                        your own -- I won’t let you kill 
                        yourself!

                                 AISSA
                        My sister needs me and you’re 
                        slowing me down.

           Elian runs and catches up to Aissa, grabbing her shoulder.

                                 ELIAN
                        You need us. To cross the border. 

           Aissa stops, considering. 
                                 AISSA
                        I can do it on my own. Nothing will 
                        keep me from my sister. 

                                 ELIAN
                        You don’t have papers. You’re from 
                        an outsider village and you’re of 
                        the old ways. If you’re lucky, 
                        they’ll lock you up for a week then 
                        turn you around. Unlucky, someone 
                        might find your torso in a ditch.

                                 AISSA
                        How can you change that? 

                                 ELIAN
                        My parents were gun smugglers. I 
                        have ways. 

                                 AISSA
                        I can sneak in easier alone.

                                 ELIAN
                        Maybe... but maybe you’re caught 
                        and your sister is murdered before 
                        you get to her. Or maybe you’re 
                        murdered, right there, for your 
                        religion. Or... you can come with 
                        us, safe travel guaranteed, get the 
                        Big Gun and you can go into battle 
                        with a real chance of winning.

           Zalika pleads with Aissa.

                                 ZALIKA
                        You can’t do it all by yourself! 

                                 AISSA
                        Your recklessness almost cost my 
                        sister her life.

                                 ZALIKA
                        And we won it back by helping you 
                        escape, think of the hole, if it 
                        wasn’t for us, you would still be 
                        in it! 

                                 AISSA
                        If it wasn’t for you, we never 
                        would have been captured. I care 
                        for you, but you’re weak, Zalika. 
                        You’re a prisoner of tradition. I 
                        can’t risk her life again.
                                 ZALIKA
                        Then teach me, Aissa. 

                                 AISSA
                        I don’t know if that’s possible.

                                 ZALIKA
                        Those kids -- those little 
                        children... no one is safe. I know 
                        now that what I wanted was never 
                        real. I have nothing, Aissa, no 
                        home, no children, no money, 
                        nowhere to go. And if I ever hope 
                        to have any of that, first we must 
                        fight to make it safe.  

           Aissa softens under the full weight of their plight.

                                 ZALIKA (CONT’D)
                        You took it upon yourself to save 
                        me from that place... Let me try to 
                        be a hero instead of another 
                        victim. Let me help you find your 
                        sister.

           Zalika grabs Aissa’s hand. Aissa looks down, touched, giving 
           in. 

           EXT. DIRT ROAD - LATER 

           The three travelers gaze ahead as the border appears over the 
           horizon. 

           TITLE CARD: THE CONGO

           EXT. BORDER WALL - SIMULTANEOUS

           The border is drawn by a twenty foot high concrete wall. 
           HEAVILY ARMED GOVERNMENT GUARDS patrol back and forth. 

           A line of IMMIGRANTS wait to cross through the small, chain 
           linked fenced opening. 

           Guards rough-handle the travelers. They take any worthwhile 
           personal items and throw them into LARGE BINS. 

           EXT. DIRT ROAD - SIMULTANEOUS

           Elian spots one particular guard, EDGAR (50), from their 
           hiding spot. He is a small, portly, balding Australian man 
           with GIANT GLASSES. 
                                 ELIAN
                        Him. 

           Elian points out the guard to the group. 

           EXT. BORDER WALL - LATER

           Elian leads the girls up to the border opening. Other guards 
           notice that they are not in line. Border Guard #1 attempts to 
           stop them. 

                                 BORDER GUARD #1
                        Halt! Get in line with the others!

           Elian keeps walking forward, nonchalantly. 

                                 ELIAN
                        No need. I’m here to see Edgar. 

           Edgar the guard notices the commotion from behind the fence. 
           He recognizes Elian and rushes over to help. 

                                 EDGAR
                        That’s enough. 

           Border Guard #1 backs off but remains suspicious. He tightens 
           his grip around his gun. 

           Edgar walks over toward Elian and the girls. He ushers them 
           through a side entrance of the gate, then into a tiny shack. 

           INT. EDGAR’S BORDER OFFICE - SAME

           Edgar rushes them into the small office and shuts the door. 

                                 EDGAR
                        What the hell are you doing, Elian?

                                 ELIAN
                        I got into a bind and had to bring 
                        some friends along. 

                                 EDGAR
                        You risked too much coming here. 
                        This isn’t how we do business.

                                 ELIAN
                        Didn’t have a choice. I’m assuming 
                        the same deal applies. 

           Edgar looks at Aissa and Zalika. He looks back to Elian. 
                                 EDGAR
                        Fine. But you’ll have to wait until 
                        sunset. I can’t guarantee safe 
                        passage otherwise. 

                                 ELIAN
                        Thank you.

                                 EDGAR
                        Don’t thank me yet.

           INT. OLD RAILROAD CAR - NIGHT

           Darkness except for the light of one candle. The trio sits 
           around in silence, waiting. 

           The door opens. Edgar greets them.

                                 EDGAR
                        Ride’s here. Hurry, you don’t have 
                        much time. 

           EXT. BORDER CROSSING - SAME

           Edgar leads them out back to a running VAN. 

           HUGE, BLACK FIGURES lurk from behind the van. They are the 
           Nigerians. 

           Aissa is the first to see them. 

                                 AISSA
                           (shouting)
                        The Nigerians! It’s a trap!  

           Edgar GRABS Elian, SHOVES him in the back of van.

           Aissa grabs Zalika and RUNS. 

           Before they can get anywhere, a TOWERING NIGERIAN appears in 
           their way. They spin around but several more appear behind 
           them. 

           They are overpowered, bound, and thrown into the back of the 
           van. 

                                 ELIAN
                        You sold us to the Nigerians!?

                                 EDGAR
                        I go where the money flows, mate. 
                        No hard feelings. 
           A NIGERIAN #3 hands Edgar some money. 

                                 NIGERIAN #3
                        And the girls? 

                                 EDGAR
                        Consider that a personal gift from 
                        me. 

           The Nigerian #3 smiles, his teeth bright against the 
           darkness. 

           EXT. VILLAGE RUINS - DAY 

           The Crusaders stand around a decimated village. Their war 
           drums ringing in the air.

           Naima and the other captures are still in a cage, guarded by 
           Crusaders near the caravan. 

           A Crusader leads a line of CAPTURED WOMEN, daisy chained 
           together, through the wreckage. 

           Commander Gabriel takes a look and waves the women forward. 

           THE CAGE

           Naima and the girls see the new crop of women led in front of 
           the commanding officers. Naima leans forward against the bars 
           to get a better look. 

           COMMANDER GABRIEL

           inspects the girls one by one. He is quite impressed. 

                                 COMMANDER GABRIEL
                        You were right. THESE girls are 
                        precious. Good job, soldiers.

           Commander Gabriel looks at the cage. 

                                 COMMANDER GABRIEL (CONT’D)
                        But... so many new mouths to feed.  
                        Perhaps we need to do some 
                        housekeeping. OUT. 

           Crusaders open the cage and force the terrified girls out. 

                                 COMMANDER GABRIEL (CONT’D)
                        Line up. 

           The girls scurry into line, Naima included. 
                                 COMMANDER GABRIEL (CONT’D)
                        I am like Noah, choosing the finest 
                        specimens for the master, Christian 
                        race, as all the heathens perish. 

           He inspects each girl. He grabs GIRL #1’s face. 

                                 COMMANDER GABRIEL (CONT’D)
                        Take this beauty. A fine example of 
                        the classical, North African 
                        female. 

           Commander Gabriel then point blank shoots GIRL #2 in the 
           face. She drops. 

           GIRL #3 runs away, screaming, crying. He shoots her too. She 
           drops. 

                                 COMMANDER GABRIEL (CONT’D)
                        This is very upsetting. 

           He rubs his forehead with the butt of the gun, frustrated. He 
           continues walking along, surveying girls. 

                                 COMMANDER GABRIEL (CONT’D)
                        Why these pagan whores resist my 
                        will I’ll never understand. I am a 
                        LIVING GOD! 

           Commander Gabriel goes down the line shooting three girls in 
           a row. 

                                 COMMANDER GABRIEL (CONT’D)
                        If I bless you with death, you take 
                        the blessing.

           He stops at Naima. 

                                 COMMANDER GABRIEL (CONT’D)
                        You will be good, won’t you? 

           Naima nods her head. 

                                 COMMANDER GABRIEL (CONT’D)
                        Good. 

           Commander Gabriel shoots the girl next to her. Naima 
           trembles. 

                                 COMMANDER GABRIEL (CONT’D)
                        Does that frighten you? Make your 
                        young body quiver?

           Naima nods, shaking. 
                                 COMMANDER GABRIEL (CONT’D)
                        You come with me. 

           Two crusaders GRAB Naima and take her away. She’s bewildered, 
           but doesn’t scream.

           INT. NIGERIAN’S VAN - NIGHT

           Aissa, Zalika and Elian sit bound together in the backseat. 
           Nigerians surround them on all sides, heavily armed.

           Aissa tries to wiggle out of her binds. Elian catches her 
           eyes, shakes his head “No.”

                                 NIGERIAN #3
                        We’ll get a nice sum for these 
                        three. Be rid of the boy, and we’re 
                        rid of his family for good. 

                                 ELIAN 
                        You don’t want to get rid of me. 

                                 NIGERIAN #3
                        You’re bad for business -- the son 
                        of a rival arms dealer? We’d kill 
                        you right now if you weren’t so 
                        pretty. You’ll fetch good money as 
                        a boy-whore. 

                                 ELIAN
                        I am not my parents -- I have no 
                        interest in the arms trade. I can 
                        be of value to you.  

                                 NIGERIAN #3
                        Of course you would say that now 
                        that we have you in chains.

                                 ELIAN
                        I’ll prove it to you. 

                                 NIGERIAN #3
                        Nothing could convince me. 

                                 ELIAN
                        Even my trade route? 

           The Nigerians look at each other. 

                                 NIGERIAN #3
                        You’d give up your source? 
                                 ELIAN
                        You know we have better weapons. I 
                        can tell you how to get them. 

                                 NIGERIAN #3
                        Or we could just torture you and 
                        take the information. 

                                 ELIAN
                        They won’t even let you into the 
                        compound without me. There’s a 
                        secret stockpile. Only our family 
                        knows the location. They deal to 
                        us. We deal to the rebels.  

                                 NIGERIAN #3
                        Ok, pretty boy, you have a deal. I 
                        will spare your hides and you will 
                        take us there. 

                                 ELIAN
                        First you take off the chains. 

           Elian’s chains clink as he holds his hands out.

           EXT. ABANDONED SCHOOL - NIGHT

           Aissa, Zalika and Elian are shoved out of the van and into an 
           OVERGROWN SCHOOLYARD.

           The faint lines of a handball court and a broken basketball 
           hoop. A FADED UNITED NATIONS banner hangs tattered on a chain 
           link fence. 

           Nothing else around for miles. Just empty desert. 

           INT. SCHOOL MAIN BUILDING - SAME

           Elian leads them into the main building. 

           Old classrooms line either side of the hallway. Crumbling  
           boxes with the UN insignia sit on weed-covered desks. Dust 
           everywhere. 

           They pass into the--

           EXT. SCHOOL COURTYARD - SAME

           Drunken PEACEKEEPERS in bright blue uniforms stumble out of a 
           CORRUGATED TIN DOOR.  
           The sounds of drunken fighting and laughing echo in the 
           courtyard. 

           The Nigerians follow Elian inside. 

           INT. PEACEKEEPER BROTHEL & SALOON - NIGHT 

           TRAFFICKED BOYS AND GIRLS as young as twelve are chained to 
           the walls, drugged almost to the point of losing 
           consciousness on dirty mattresses. Thin, cheap curtains 
           divide them. 

           Some curtains are closed, occupied by grunting Peacekeepers. 

           Elian walks past, his eyes avoiding the atrocities before 
           him. Aissa and Zalika follow, dragged by Nigerian #1 and #2.

           The group reaches a PEACEKEEPER #1 (60) a towering, haggard 
           man.  

           Peacekeeper #1 doesn’t speak, just counts out a thick stack 
           of money. He looks up from the stack and sees the towering 
           Nigerians. 

           He stops the group. 

                                 PEACEKEEPER #1
                        They can’t come in here. We don’t 
                        allow their kind. 

           He shoots a look at Nigerian #1. The Nigerians finger their 
           weapons, offended. 

                                 ELIAN
                        Do you know who my parents are? I 
                        am Elian Wyk. If they find out you 
                        turned me away, they will demand 
                        your head. On a spike. 

           The Peacekeeper winces in disgust.

                                 PEACEKEEPER #1
                        I’ll let Paul know. Follow me. 

           INT. PEACEKEEPER BROTHEL & SALOON BACK ROOM - NIGHT 

           The Nigerians enter, tense, on the offensive. Elian follows. 

                                 ELIAN
                        They will serve you. 
                                 NIGERIAN #2
                        They will serve us, or we will make 
                        them serve us.

           Paul, (40) a big, brutish, skinhead in a blue U.N. 
           Peacekeeper uniform, enters the room. 

           He puts his index finger and thumb together and WHISTLES. 

           The Nigerians turn. 

                                 PAUL 
                        See, all dogs respond when I 
                        whistle.
                           (to Elian)
                        This is not our agreement. You know 
                        we don’t allow animals indoors.

                                 ELIAN
                        It might be time to diversify your 
                        trade routes. 

                                 PAUL
                        I don’t need you telling me how to 
                        run my business. 

                                 ELIAN
                        Not telling, suggesting. They have 
                        access to areas of the Congo that 
                        we’ve been trying to get at for 
                        years. Why not take this 
                        opportunity? 

                                 PAUL
                        Why not keep them all to yourself? 

                                 ELIAN
                        My parents are dead, Paul. Consider 
                        it our final business. I’m cashing 
                        out.

                                 PAUL
                        I guess I could consider it. I’ve 
                        never sold to one of them before, 
                        but they are the ones doing most of 
                        the killing. 

           Paul turns to the Nigerians, who stand outraged but composed.

                                 ELIAN
                        If you could put aside your... 
                        differences for the moment and 
                        think about the money-- 
                                 PAUL
                        Not everything is about money. Sure 
                        peacekeepers buy whores from the 
                        rebels, and sell guns to the 
                        militias, but deep down we’re just 
                        trying to save The Dark Continent 
                        from itself. We can’t be tainted by 
                        it, if we’re going to fulfill our 
                        burden as civilized men. 

                                 NIGERIAN #2 
                        Civilized men recognize that money 
                        is the same color wherever you go. 

                                 PAUL
                        Oh! The Beast speaks. Maybe you are 
                        a different breed. So tell me, what 
                        makes you different from all the 
                        other darkies? 

                                 ELIAN
                        Paul. 

           Nigerian #2 steps forward, grinning his toothless grin. 

                                 NIGERIAN #2
                        No it’s okay, let me answer. See 
                        the difference with us is--

           Nigerian #2 YANKS his gun up and OPENS FIRE, blowing Paul 
           backward, ripping apart his chest. The other Nigerians follow 
           suit, wreaking havoc with their machine guns.

           Peacekeepers react to the ambush and return fire. Some of the 
           Nigerians are shot, fall to the ground. 

           The room erupts into an all out bar room brawl, bullets 
           flying everywhere. 

           Aissa drops to the ground, crawling towards the back of the 
           room as the Nigerians and Peacekeepers kill each other.  

           Elian waits, crouched by a door scanning the crowd for his 
           friends. Aissa almost makes it to him when-- 

           WHAM! 

           A Peacekeeper knocks her in the head. She KICKS his shins, he 
           doubles over. She grabs the gun in his hands and uses his own 
           gun to bash his face in. 

           Aissa yanks the gun back and puts a bullet in his head, 
           ending him. 
           Peacekeepers RUN at her. 

           She sprays fire indiscriminately, taking out both Nigerians 
           and Peacekeepers. 

                                 ELIAN
                        Come on! 

           Zalika picks a gun off a dead Nigerian and crawls over to the 
           trafficked boys and girls, still chained to the walls, 
           cowering away from the gunfire. 

           Zalika takes aim at a YOUNG GIRL, chained like the rest. The 
           Young Girl shields her face, whimpering.

           Zalika SHOOTS. 

           The Young Girl looks down, surprised to be alive, as her 
           chains fall to the ground. Zalika tosses her the gun. The 
           girl grasps it, shocked. 

                                 ZALIKA
                        Free the kids. Kill the rest. 

           Zalika then runs to Elian. A bullet GRAZES her thigh. She 
           yelps, but it doesn’t slow her down. 

           She joins Aissa and Elian and they take off down a hallway. 

           INT. PEACEKEEPER HALLWAY - NIGHT 

           Elian leads Aissa and Zalika through a labyrinthine system of 
           hallways. 

                                 AISSA
                        How are we going to find the guns 
                        in here?

                                 ELIAN
                        I’ve been here a million times. 

           Elian turns around the corner and skids to a stop, backing up 
           when he sees ARMED GUARDS standing outside the room. 

                                 ELIAN (CONT’D)
                        That’s it. There are guards. 

           Without even looking, Aissa shoots around the corner. 

                                 AISSA
                        Not anymore. 
           Elian looks. Three guards lie on the ground, full of bullets. 
           A fourth struggles down the hallway, then slumps, dead.

           They run down the corridor. 

           INT. PEACEKEEPER GUN ROOM - NIGHT 

           An old kindergarten classroom. Guns of all kinds are stacked 
           against the wall haphazardly. What it lacks in presentation 
           it makes up in sheer quantity. 

           Elian grabs an assortment of guns and bullets and throws them 
           into a supply bag laying on the floor. 

           He hands a gun to Zalika. She takes it with a newfound 
           confidence. 

           Aissa looks around, awestruck. She spots THE BIG GUN. In 
           fact, many of them, just laying against the wall in a corner. 

           She grabs two, slinging them over her shoulder and wraps 
           herself in bullet magazines. 

                                 AISSA
                        With this, I will avenge my 
                        parents. With this, I will save 
                        her. 

           HEAVY BOOTS STOMP down the corridor. 

           Three Armed Peacekeepers storm the room. 

           Elian takes care of the other TWO PEACEKEEPERS coming through 
           the door with TWO UZIS. The third takes aim at Zalika. 

           Zalika blasts him away before he can get off the shot. He 
           FLIES against the wall.

           Aissa laughs in surprise. 

                                 AISSA (CONT’D)
                        Well, look at you. 

           Elian steps over their bodies and exits the room, Aissa and 
           Zalika follow. 

           INT. PEACEKEEPER HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           They run through the hallway. Elian spots a door at the far 
           end. 
           He bolts toward the door as PEACEKEEPERS chase them down the 
           hallway, firing. 

           Even Zalika is shooting with ease, taking them out one by 
           one. 

           Then Zalika suddenly slows down. Her gun slips from her hand.

                                 AISSA
                        Zalika! Run! 

           Zalika COLLAPSES. Aissa tries to get Zalika up. 

           Elian sees what has happened and turns back. 

           The Peacekeepers CLOSE IN ON THEM.  

           Elian reaches them, swiftly lifts Zalika in his arms and 
           runs.

           Aissa stops, turns, holding up THE BIG GUNS. She FIRES, 
           bullets EXPLODING from her superior weapons. Bullet casings 
           circle around her. 

           Aissa runs to the door, and as she flings open the exit 
           doors, we see ALL of the Peacekeepers lie dead and bloody in 
           the hallway behind her.

           EXT. REAR OF SCHOOL - SAME

           Elian, Zalika and Aissa make it out into the open. They see 
           TWO BORED HORSES tied to a rusty bike rack.  

           More Peacekeepers STORM through the door. 

           The trio bolts toward the horses, bullets WHIZZING inches 
           from their heads.

           Aissa flings her guns onto one of the waiting horses. It 
           bridles at the cargo. She mounts the horse.

           Elian throws the supply bag onto the second horse, hoists 
           Zalika on back and gets on.

           The three ride off, peacekeepers cursing them as they 
           disappear into the night.

           EXT. SAVANNA - NIGHT 

           Firewood CRACKS in a fire. The night sky is filled with 
           stars, brighter out here. 
           Zalika rests next to Elian, who strokes her head. 

                                 ELIAN
                        Are you feeling any better?

                                 ZALIKA
                        Better than Aissa’s sister. Better 
                        than all those children... 

                                 ELIAN
                        You scared us back there. 

           Aissa takes inventory of their haul. They have the arsenal of 
           a small army. 

                                 AISSA
                        She’s weak from hunger and thirst. 
                        We’ll hunt tomorrow.

           Zalika coughs spasmodically but recovers.

                                 ZALIKA
                        It’s nothing. 

           The three sit in silence for a beat, soundlessly praying for 
           Zalika’s return to good health. 

           Elian turns to Aissa.

                                 ELIAN
                        How do you plan to get her back? 

                                 AISSA
                        That’s what the Big Gun’s for. 

                                 ELIAN
                        There’s a lot more of them than 
                        there are of you. 

                                 AISSA
                        Never underestimate tactical 
                        advantage. Plus, I’m an amazing 
                        shot. 

           Aissa aims an assault rifle from their stock pile, then flips 
           and re-holsters with ease.

                                 ELIAN
                        And modest. 

                                 AISSA
                        No room for modesty in battle. 
                        Maybe that’s something you need to 
                        learn. 
                                 ELIAN
                        How’d a country girl like you learn 
                        how to shoot anyways? 

                                 AISSA
                        Where I’m from, you only need to 
                        run once to learn how to shoot a 
                        gun. The first time we ran I was 
                        six years old. The Crusaders 
                        destroyed my village, but they 
                        weren’t as strong. Not as many. The 
                        only reason my family survived is 
                        because of the rusty, old rifle my 
                        dad used to protect the chickens. 
                        He could barely use the thing but 
                        that’s all that stopped my story 
                        from ending there. From then on, he 
                        made me and my sister practice 
                        every day. It’s funny, when the day 
                        actually came, it was no help at 
                        all.

           Elian stares at the ground, bitter at the course of their 
           lives. 

                                 ELIAN
                        I’m alone now, too. I grew up 
                        around guns, was raised with guns, 
                        and it made no difference. 

                                 AISSA
                        A lot of times, evil wins. 

                                 ELIAN
                        But not this time? 

                                 AISSA
                        Maybe if my sister was weak, more 
                        innocent, then she would perish. 
                        The world would break her like a 
                        twig. But my sister is brave. My 
                        sister is cunning. My sister... 

                                 ZALIKA
                        ...Is like you. 

           Aissa tears up as she describes her best friend in the world, 
           the pain of her loss becoming concrete. 

                                 AISSA
                        She’s alive. I know it. 
           INT. PALACE OF THE LIGHT CRUSADERS OF CHRIST - NIGHT 

           A STEAMING HOT MEAL

           is placed before a nervous Naima. She’s dressed in jewels, 
           bathed and perfumed. 

           Across from her Commander Gabriel stares intently. He watches 
           her move like a hawk watches a sparrow. 

           Naima looks down, afraid to make eye contact. She cuts a tiny 
           piece of BLOODY MEAT, bringing it to her lips. She bites into 
           it hesitantly. 

           Commander Gabriel sips his wine never allowing his eyes to 
           leave her. He holds his meat with his hand, rips it with his 
           teeth. 

                                 COMMANDER GABRIEL
                        You like the meat?

           Naima nods. 

                                 COMMANDER GABRIEL (CONT’D)
                        Speak, girl. 

                                 NAIMA
                        Yes. I like the meat. 

                                 COMMANDER GABRIEL
                        Eat.

           Naima cuts another piece of meat. 

                                 COMMANDER GABRIEL (CONT’D)
                        Put it in your mouth. 

           Naima puts it in her mouth.

                                 COMMANDER GABRIEL (CONT’D)
                        I like to think it gives me luck 
                        when I eat the flesh of the 
                        conquered. 

           Naima spits the meat out in disgust and the Commander rises 
           throwing his chair across the room and GRABS Naima by the 
           neck. She chokes. 

                                 COMMANDER GABRIEL (CONT’D)
                        Is something wrong? 

           Naima struggles to shake her head ‘no.’
                                 COMMANDER GABRIEL (CONT’D)
                        You don’t like the meal I’ve given 
                        you, you worthless, pagan whore! 

           Commander Gabriel PUNCHES Naima across the face, BREAKING her 
           nose. She is thrown to the floor, her hand clutching her 
           bloody face. 

           Commander Gabriel marches over, the piece of bloody meat in 
           his hand. He crouches down by Naima. 

                                 COMMANDER GABRIEL (CONT’D)
                        You will accept your Lord’s bounty!

           He grabs Naima’s hair, forcing her to stare up at him. She 
           slowly opens her mouth. Commander Gabriel SHOVES the meat 
           into her face. 

           She chews, eyes more and more determined and devours the 
           entire human steak. 

           Commander Gabriel raises to standing, amused.

                                 COMMANDER GABRIEL (CONT’D)
                        That’s much better, Naima. 

           Commander Gabriel walks over to his wine, chugs all of it. 

           Naima crawls over to him and KISSES his dirty boot. She looks 
           up at him. Commander Gabriel smiles. 

           EXT. DESERT - DAY 

           TITLE CARD: ZAMBIA 

           Elian, Zalika, and Aissa ride through the simmering, endless 
           desert. Zalika looks worse for wear, conscious but barely 
           able to sit up on Elian’s horse. 

                                 ELIAN
                        She needs water.

                                 ZALIKA
                        I’m fine. 

                                 ELIAN
                        You’re sick and we need to get you 
                        water. 

                                 AISSA
                        Once we get to the oasis we can try 
                        and find help. It shouldn’t be too 
                        far from here.
           In the distance--

           A COLORFUL PARADE OF REFUGEES

           march along, singing a jubilant song of triumph. 

                                 ELIAN
                        Look! There are people traveling. 
                        Maybe they can help! 

                                 AISSA
                        It’s a mirage.

                                 ELIAN
                        I’m going to check it out. 

           Elian kicks his horse and gallops off, Zalika on back. Aissa 
           follows, skeptical. 

           EXT. DESERT PARADE OF PEOPLE - DAY 

           Elian rides up to the train of REFUGEES. It is clear they 
           carry all that they have in the world. 

           Elian spots a woman, RAHEL (35) who looks kind. 

                                 ELIAN
                        Hey! Stop! Please, stop! 

           Rahel stops, reluctantly. 

                                 ELIAN (CONT’D)
                        Where are you headed? 

                                 RAHEL
                        To the Refugee Camp in Zambia. The 
                        Crusaders destroyed our village. 

           Aissa, not far behind on horseback, pipes up. 

                                 AISSA
                        The Crusaders? 

           MEANWHILE 

           An elderly woman CHIKE (60) traveling with the group spots 
           Zalika on the back of Elian’s horse, looking extremely ill.

           Chike approaches her. She inspects Zalika’s face, her throat. 

           Aissa steadies her horse and questions Rahel.
                                 AISSA (CONT’D)
                        The Crusaders destroyed my home 
                        too. How long ago were they in 
                        these parts?

                                 RAHEL
                        The night of the Blood Moon. 

                                 AISSA
                        Do you know where they are going? 

                                 RAHEL
                        People from other villages will be 
                        at the Refugee camp. Maybe they 
                        will know. The Crusaders have been 
                        destroying our villages, taking our 
                        children and building their army 
                        all over. They’re stronger than 
                        ever. 

           Chike approaches Aissa. 

                                 CHIKE
                        Your friend needs help. She is not 
                        well. She needs to come with us. 

           INT. CHIKE’S REFUGEE TENT - NIGHT 

           Zalika lies on a makeshift bed on the ground. Chike cuts up a 
           mixture of herbs. A clay pot full of BUBBLING LIQUID sits on 
           a small fire. 

           Chike hums a strange melody while she works. 

           Elian sits next to Zalika, holding her hand. Aissa watches 
           the proceedings from a corner, critical but hopeful. 

           Chike takes half of the chopped herbs and puts them into a 
           mortar. She grinds them into a THICK PASTE. The other half 
           she places into the boiling pot. 

           Chike sticks her finger into the paste in the mortar. Chike 
           chants loudly as she rubs her fingers down Zalika’s nose and 
           forehead.

           Chike pours the boiling herbs into two mugs. She hands them 
           to Aissa and Elian.  

                                 AISSA
                        What’s wrong with her? Will she be 
                        alright?
                                 CHIKE
                        Her spirit is weakened from the 
                        sickness. She will need your 
                        strength as well as her own. Drink 
                        every drop and join your strength 
                        to hers. 

           Chike chants as they drink the bitter liquid. 

                                 CHIKE (CONT’D)
                        All of it.

           They finish, grimacing, and Chike takes their mugs. 

           A MALE REFUGEE steps forward. 

                                 REFUGEE
                        There is nothing more to be done. 
                        She is in the hands of the Gods 
                        now. Please, eat something. 

           Aissa and Elian look hesitant to leave. 

                                 ELIAN
                        I need to be with her. I need to 
                        keep her safe.

                                 REFUGEE
                        Please, Chike will take good care 
                        of your friend--

                                 ELIAN
                        I’m not leaving her side.

           The Refugee nods, understanding, and beckons Aissa. Aissa 
           warily follows. 

                                 CHIKE
                        I’ll give you some time together. 

           Chike exits. Elian strokes Zalika’s face, the quiet and 
           intimacy of their first moment alone charging the atmosphere. 

           Zalika turns her heavy head to take in the sight of the boy 
           she’s loved since childhood.

                                 ZALIKA 
                        Is it true you’ve thought of me all 
                        these years?  

                                 ELIAN
                        Every night. Every day. 
                                 ZALIKA
                        Even with the High Sisters, when I 
                        closed my eyes and saw the man in 
                        my dreams, it was you.

                                 ELIAN
                        Maybe all of this happened because 
                        it’s our destiny to find each other 
                        again. 

           Zalika laughs with bittersweet joy.

                                 ZALIKA
                        I really hope so. That’s all I hope 
                        for. 

           Zalika suddenly becomes serious, and clutches Elian’s arm.

                                 ZALIKA (CONT’D)
                        Never leave me, Elian!

           Elian leans over and touches his lips to Zalika’s, kissing 
           her softly, with all the love he has in his heart. 

                                 ELIAN
                        I’m right here. And I’ll never 
                        leave you again. 

           Zalika wraps her arms around him as tight as she can. 

           EXT. REFUGEE CAMPFIRE - NIGHT 

           Aissa walks toward a roaring camp fire where many broken 
           families gather for a sense of community. 

           Aissa spots Rahel, the woman from earlier. She takes a seat 
           next to her around the fire. 

                                 RAHEL 
                        How’s your friend? 

                                 AISSA
                        She’s doing better. 

                                 RAHEL
                        My prayers are with her. 

           An older, FEMALE REFUGEE hands out makeshift bowls. 

           She hands one to Aissa. She ladles stew into her bowl.

                                 AISSA
                        Thank you. 
           Aissa eats hungrily.

                                 AISSA (CONT’D)
                        Do you know where the Crusaders 
                        were headed? 

                                 RAHEL
                        I heard the rebels talk about a 
                        palace by the sea. They’ve been 
                        gathering troops all around the 
                        region, burning non-Christian 
                        villages to the ground. 

                                 AISSA
                        The palace by the sea... Do you 
                        know where it is?

                                 RAHEL
                        They can’t be too far from here. 
                        There are many abandoned diamond 
                        mining towns along the sea in 
                        Namibia. Many had palaces built for 
                        the colonial mine owners. They 
                        would watch from their palaces as 
                        their slaves cut diamonds from the 
                        Earth. But soon, better diamonds, 
                        cheaper to cut, were found in other 
                        parts. Now all the palaces are full 
                        of sand... If you want to find 
                        them, they can be found. The 
                        Crusaders are not hiding. 

                                 AISSA
                        I will find them. It’s only a 
                        question of when. 

           Rahel places her hand on Aissa’s.

                                 RAHEL
                        You have a strong spirit. This 
                        pleases the Gods. They will support 
                        your righteous journey. 

                                 AISSA
                        My journey is righteous. But I will 
                        kill them all, with or without the 
                        favor of the Gods. 

           INT. TENT - DAY 

           Zalika wakes. She stretches, yawning. She smiles when she 
           sees Elian curled up on the floor beside her bed. 
           EXT. TENT - DAY

           Zalika peeks out, still smiling. Aissa waits outside, 
           dressed. The horses are tied out front, their belongings 
           packed on top. 

           Chike stands behind Zalika. 

                                 AISSA
                        There you are. How are you feeling?

           Zalika responds enthusiastically, through she still looks 
           weak.

                                 ZALIKA
                        I’m fine! I feel wonderful! 

                                 AISSA
                        That’s great news. 

           Elian emerges from the tent, dressed. 

                                 ELIAN
                        You should rest, Zali. You were ill 
                        just last night. 

                                 ZALIKA
                        We have to find Aissa’s sister, we 
                        can’t waste any more time. 

                                 AISSA
                        She’s right. We need to move on 
                        today. 

           She turns to Chike. 

                                 AISSA (CONT’D)
                        We owe you a great debt. 

                                 CHIKE
                        A kind soul will always find help 
                        with me. 

           Chike hands Zalika a bag. She looks inside to find medicinal 
           herbs, clothes, cans of food, and a pot.

           Zalika throws her arms around Chike and squeezes her tight.   

                                 ZALIKA
                        Thank you, for everything.

                                 CHIKE
                        Do as I instructed and pray to the 
                        Gods, my child.  
           Elian helps Zalika onto his horse. Chike turns to Aissa. 

                                 CHIKE (CONT’D)
                        Be safe on your journey. And 
                        Aissa.... Beware false friends.

           Aissa pauses, deciphering Chike’s message, then nods and 
           mounts her horse. Aissa kicks the horse, it bucks and gallops 
           off. Elian and Zalika follow. 

           The group is out by less than half a mile when they spot in 
           the distance--

           A DUST STORM 

           raging towards the refugee camp. Aissa yanks her reigns and 
           raises her hand to test the wind. Nothing. 

           She looks harder into the horizon. The dust storm moves with 
           incredible speed. This is a man-made creation. 

           The storm descends upon the camp. Young boys beat bucket 
           drums on horseback. This is the Christian rebel group that 
           tossed our trio in the hole. 

           They THUNDER DOWN upon the camp with lightning speed, slicing 
           anyone in their path. Refugees SCATTER in all directions, 
           fleeing as the Rebels open fire. 

           Some of the more equipped Refugees FIRE their weapons into 
           the incoming storm. 

           OUT AND OUT WAR breaks out.

           Aissa, Zalika and Elian witness the violence from afar. 

                                 AISSA
                        Protect Zalika. I’ll be back.

                                 ZALIKA
                        You’re not leaving me here! I’m 
                        strong enough to fight. 

                                 ELIAN
                        Where are you going?

           Before they can protest, Aissa drives her horse right into 
           the storm. 

           Aissa pulls out THE BIG GUN. She takes aim and SPRAYS FIRE 
           across FIVE CHRISTIAN REBELS who ride through a CLOUD OF 
           DUST.  

           Their horses emerge, but no riders. 
           Aissa turns and is KNOCKED off her horse by a Christian 
           Rebel. 

           She whips around, gun in hand. The dust creates low 
           visibility. 

           The Christian Rebel springs on Aissa and knocks the Big Gun 
           to the ground. He HITS her, she stumbles back but regains her 
           footing. 

           She charges at him, but he catches her momentum in a headlock 
           and forces her to the ground. She goes down on her stomach. 
           The rebel tightens his grip. Aissa can’t break it. 

           A SINGLE GUNSHOT

           pierces through the dust. The Christian Rebel falls, dead, 
           trampled into the sand by his escaping horse. 

           Zalika emerges on her horse holding a smoking gun, Elian on 
           back. She smiles, self-assured.

           Aissa locks eyes with her, proud, and for a moment Zalika 
           turns into Naima. Aissa blinks and Zalika is Zalika again. 

           THE CHRISTIAN REBELS BEGIN TO RETREAT

           Aissa grabs her Big Gun, tossed in the sand. She sees a Rebel 
           on horseback, dragging a young REFUGEE GIRL behind him by a 
           rope tied to the horse.  

           Aissa takes aim, shoots and hits the Rebel in the shoulder. 
           It knocks him clean off his horse. The horse bucks, stopping. 

           Aissa quickly grabs the reigns of the Rebel’s horse, Zalika 
           and Elian follow on horseback.

           Aissa removes the rope from the Refugee Girl’s waist, still 
           attached to the Rebel’s horse, and wraps it around the fallen 
           Rebel’s NECK, like a leash. 

           The Refugee Girl runs for her life.  

           Aissa mounts the Rebel’s horse, and begins to walk the horse, 
           yanking the Rebel with her. The Rebel screams in pain, 
           struggling against the tight grip of the rope.

                                 AISSA
                        You’re going to tell me everything.  

           The Rebel wails, unable to breath. Aissa picks up the pace 
           and the rope TIGHTENS around the Rebel’s neck.
                                 AISSA (CONT’D)
                        Don’t feel like talking?

           Aissa kicks her horse and it begins to TROT, fast. The rope 
           nearly breaks the Rebel’s neck as he runs to keep in speed. 

           EXT. DESERT OASIS - LATER 

           Aissa slows her horse, still dragging the captured Christian 
           Rebel behind her into the lush, palm-tree-dotted oasis. Elian 
           and Zalika follow, not far behind. 

           Aissa comes to a clearing and halts her horse. She dismounts, 
           stone-faced. She makes her way toward the scruffy prisoner, 
           rope burns on his neck.

           She cuts the rope from the horse and takes it in her hands. 
           She wraps it around her elbow tight.

           Aissa prods the Crusader with her gun to rise. He struggles 
           to get up. 

                                 AISSA
                        If you aren’t going to use those 
                        legs then you don’t need them. 

           Aissa jams the nose of the gun into one of his KNEECAPS. She 
           SHOOTS. He yelps and buckling to the ground. She pulls him 
           up, leading him to a PALM TREE TRUNK. 

           Aissa takes the rope slack and wraps it around the trunk 
           multiple times. 

           Zalika and Elian stay back at the edge of the clearing, 
           dismounting their horse. 

           Zalika, seeing Aissa with the prisoner, starts to walk over 
           to help but Elian grabs her hand. 

                                 ELIAN
                        Let her do this on her own. 

           The Christian Rebel, worn from being dragged and shot, does 
           not put up much of a fight. 

           Aissa stands back, inspecting her handy work. She grabs her 
           prisoner by the hair. 

                                 AISSA
                        I spared your life for one reason, 
                        and one reason only. You are going 
                        to tell me where the Crusaders are. 
           The Christian Rebel manages a meek laugh. She strikes him 
           VICIOUSLY across the face with the butt of the gun. He falls 
           silent. 

                                 AISSA (CONT’D)
                        That’s the trouble with your kind. 
                        You don’t respect your enemies. I 
                        will ask you again.

           Aissa takes her foot and presses it into his GROIN. 

                                 AISSA (CONT’D)
                        Where are they going?

           The Christian Rebel groans in pain. He spits bloody teeth at 
           her feet. Aissa presses harder. He moans, high pitched, in 
           pain. But still no words. 

           Aissa removes her foot. The Christian Rebel looks up at her. 

                                 CHRISTIAN REBEL
                        Stupid girl. 

                                 AISSA
                        What did you say?

                                 CHRISTIAN REBEL
                        Stupid girl! You can do whatever 
                        you like to me. But once they find 
                        you they won’t just kill you. 
                        Someone like you will get special 
                        attention.

           Aissa holsters her gun and reaches for her dagger. She grabs 
           his WRIST tight. 

           Aissa takes the dagger and DIGS it into his thumb nail bed. 
           He VOCIFERATES in agony. She digs deeper and slowly twists 
           the knife, the screaming increases. 

           The nail POPS off and into the forest bed. 

                                 AISSA
                        Where is the palace?!

           Tears run down the Crusaders cheeks but still he does not 
           break. 

           Aissa removes the dagger from his thumb. She grabs his face, 
           and with the dagger in her right hand holds the point inches 
           away from the Crusaders EYE.
                                 AISSA (CONT’D)
                        Do you think they will take you 
                        back with one eye?

           He doesn’t move.

                                 AISSA (CONT’D)
                        Let’s find out.

           Aissa pushes the knife in closer. 

                                 CRUSADER
                        WAIT!

           Aissa pulls back the knife, she smirks. 

           EXT. DESERT OASIS - SAME

           Aissa walks her horse out of the clearing where Elian and 
           Zalika are waiting. They run to meet her. 

           Behind her Elian sees blood dripping from the CUT THROAT of 
           the Crusader, still tied to the palm tree. 

                                 AISSA
                        We’re going to Namibia. 

           EXT. DESERT - DAY 

           EPIC MONTAGE 

           TITLE CARD: NAMIBIA 

           The Western Theme from the opening credits lifts and swoons 
           as-- 

           -- Aissa, gallops along the vast, golden desert, mountains 
           and rock formations mighty in the distance. 

           -- Elian riding not too far behind, Zalika’s arms wrapped 
           around him.  

           -- The three trot along a mountain side, the sun setting in 
           the distance. 

           -- The trio walk their horses through a narrow, DANGEROUS 
           MOUNTAIN PASS. The ground hundreds of feet below.   

           -- The trio come upon a CLIFF, the sun is swallowed by the 
           darkness of the night. The stars begin to twinkle in the sky. 
           -- Aissa looks beyond the cliff, she sees A WHITE PALACE 
           sitting by the sea, waves crashing against it. Torches are 
           lit in the windows, one by one as day turns to night.  

           EXT. CLIFF - NIGHT 

           A CAMPFIRE reflects in Aissa’s dark, fierce eyes as she 
           stares at the palace. 

           Elian sits by the fire, roasting a can of beans. 

           Aissa turns, jerking her SHOTGUN upright.

           A glass bottle sits atop some rocks. 

           Aissa points, shoots, SHATTERS the glass bottle with ease. 
           She tosses the gun to Zalika, who catches it, ready. 

                                 AISSA
                        Practice makes perfect. 

           Aissa gets up and shows Zalika the right posture. Places her 
           hand in the right position on the gun. 

                                 AISSA (CONT’D)
                        You’re gunna watch him, watch his 
                        hands. Bring it UP. Like this.

           Aissa brings her gun up to shoulder height. 

                                 AISSA (CONT’D)
                        Aim with both eyes open. Look 
                        through the viewfinder.  

           THROUGH THE VIEWFINDER: 

           Zalika sees the bottle move in and out of the cross hairs. 

                                 AISSA (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Steady your hand. Don’t forget to 
                        breathe.

           Zalika exhales slowly, the viewfinder steadies on the target. 

           BACK TO CLIFF

           Zalika adjusts her posture and the position of her hands on 
           the gun.

                                 AISSA (CONT’D)
                        Remember, squeeze, don’t pull the 
                        trigger. 
           She looks through the viewfinder. 

           Her finger SQUEEZES the trigger. 

           CRASH. The bottle explodes, shards of glass flying.  

           Zalika jumps up and down. She hugs Aissa. Aissa lets a small, 
           rare smile cross her lips.  

                                 AISSA (CONT’D)
                        See? You can do anything. 

           Aissa’s smile fades, remembering her sister. 

           As Zalika looks over, searching for signs of Aissa’s pride in 
           her, she looks just like Naima. Aissa hugs her, as if 
           embracing her sister. 

           Elian calls over. 

                                 ELIAN
                        Dinner’s served. 

           EXT. CLIFF - LATER 

           The three devour the beans, sitting around the camp site. The 
           fire crackles. 

                                 ELIAN
                        What are you going to do when this 
                        is all over? 

                                 ZALIKA
                        All I want is somewhere to go home 
                        to... I want to build that home 
                        with someone I love. 

           Zalika gazes at Elian fondly. He smiles at the thought. 

           Aissa keeps eating her beans. 

                                 ELIAN
                           (to Aissa)
                        What about you?

           Aissa looks up from her plate. 

                                 AISSA
                        Huh? 

                                 ELIAN
                        The future. What do you plan to do 
                        after?
                                 AISSA
                        There is no future yet. For me, the 
                        future begins when I find her. 

           Elian nods. Zalika grows quiet, eating her beans. 

                                 AISSA (CONT’D)
                        The horde that slaughtered my 
                        village took only a day. And that 
                        is one group from one region. 
                        They’re building an army to conquer 
                        all of Africa. 

                                 ELIAN
                        They’ll never achieve that. 

                                 AISSA
                        But they will die trying, and they 
                        will leave Africa mutilated in 
                        their wake. 

           Aissa looks at their stock pile of guns. 

                                 AISSA (CONT’D)
                        No one gives you a future. It’s up 
                        to us now, if we want it, we have 
                        to take it.  

           EXT. CLIFF - MORNING 

           Aissa straps her guns to her horse, and mounts it. 

           Elian helps Zalika onto her horse. She waves him away and 
           attempts to mount the horse herself. Elian looks on proud,  
           grabbing his bags. 

           Zalika suddenly falls off her horse, landing in a crumpled 
           pile. 

           Elian runs to her. She looks up, frightened. 

           BLOOD 

           oozes from her EYES, EARS, NOSE, and MOUTH. 

           She touches her face, blood pouring all over her hands. 

                                 ZALIKA
                        What’s happening to me?! 

           Aissa jumps off her horse, hurrying to Zalika. She shares a 
           fearsome look with Elian.
           Zalika struggles to standing, stumbling against Elian, 
           holding him, blood streaming, soaking his clothes.

           She looks wildly into Elian’s eyes. 

           Elian puts his arms around her, desperate to save her.

                                 AISSA
                           (quiet)
                        The sickness. 

           Elian holds Zalika close.

                                 ELIAN
                        Zalika... We need to do something!

                                 AISSA
                        There’s nothing we can do. 

           Zalika tries to speak but spurts blood, horrified. 

                                 ZALIKA
                        Elian... Don’t....

           Aissa grabs Elian’s arm. He shoves her away HARD. 

                                 AISSA 
                        Drop her! The blood! Take off your 
                        shirt! 

                                 ELIAN
                        I won’t let her die! I won’t leave 
                        her!

                                 AISSA
                        There’s nothing we can do! The 
                        blood will kill you!

           Zalika looks up at Elian, her eyes becoming more peaceful as 
           she drips into an ever-growing puddle of blood. 

                                 ZALIKA
                        Elian... Save yourself. 

                                 ELIAN
                        But... but I love you, Zalika... 

           Zalika gazes into Elian’s eyes, sad, giving up. She raises 
           her hand weakly, stroking his cheek. She smiles.

           Then COUGHS VIOLENTLY, choking on her own blood. Elian holds 
           her closer, ignoring his own fate. 
                                 ZALIKA
                        I love you... 

           Their eyes remain locked until the very last breath. 

           Zalika’s soul escapes, her body lifeless in Elian’s arms. 
           Elian breaks down sobbing, continuing to hold on even after 
           she’s gone.

           Aissa bows her head in respect, her eyes filled with tears. 

           EXT. CLIFF - LATER 

           Aissa sets fire to ZALIKA’S BODY underneath a bed of twigs. 
           Elian removes his shirt, tossing it into the flames. 

           They sit quietly, watching yet another loved one perish in 
           smoke. 

                                 ELIAN
                        She shouldn’t have died. 

                                 AISSA
                        A lot of things shouldn’t happen. 
                        But they do. 

                                 ELIAN
                        She did nothing wrong. She survived 
                        and was getting better. She didn’t 
                        deserve it. 

                                 AISSA
                        The world is cruel. The virus can 
                        deceive you. I only hope you 
                        haven’t sacrificed yourself, too. 

                                 ELIAN
                        Why does it matter? We will be 
                        slaughtered come nightfall. 

                                 AISSA
                        With the guns we have we can--

                                 ELIAN
                        You really think so, Aissa? You 
                        said it yourself, you’ve never seen 
                        good win. 

                                 AISSA
                        And you said it’s not about good or 
                        evil, it’s about guns. 
                                 ELIAN
                        Even guns can fail you. They have 
                        an army...

                                 AISSA
                        You want to live in a world run by 
                        the animals who destroyed my 
                        village? Zalika’s village? If it 
                        weren’t for them Zalika would be 
                        alive today, happy, in her home, 
                        with her parents. She never would 
                        have been sent to the High Sisters 
                        and that bastard wouldn’t have 
                        raped her. She never would have 
                        gotten sick. Don’t let her die in 
                        vain. There are thousands of girls 
                        like Zalika, Elian. The Crusaders 
                        want to conquer all of Africa. 
                        Imagine how many more will die if 
                        they win. 

           Elian stares at Zalika’s body, no longer visible in the 
           billowing, black smoke. 

           EXT. CRUSADER COMPOUND GATE - NIGHT

           Aissa and Elian, fortified with all manner of weaponry, climb 
           the steep rocks up from the sea to the IRON GATES that 
           protect the Crusader Compound. 

           Their horses are tied up behind them, back on the shore of 
           the moonlit ocean. 

           As they get closer, we can spot several PATROLLING GUARDS 
           surveying the perimeter of the gate. 

           Elian spots TWO GUARDS on roof tops. They scan the horizon 
           periodically. He quietly points them out to Aissa. 

           Aissa takes note.

           The gate SWINGS OPEN, revealing the compound.

           The CRUSADER COMPOUND is a dusty ghost town, an abandoned 
           diamond mining city losing the battle of time. 

           Historic TRAIN CARS and Colonial HOUSES half buried in the 
           sand are now lit with the activity of Crusader soldiers.

           THE PALACE looms over the train cars and houses-turned-
           barracks beyond the small, sand-filled city. 

           Aissa spots-- 
           A WHITE CARGO SUPPLY TRUCK approaching the gate on a narrow, 
           sandy service road that bleeds into the desert. 

           Aissa takes a single silencer pistol from her armaments. 

           Aissa fires TWICE. Silently.  

           ON ROOF TOPS

           The guards fall gracefully from their posts.

           ON THE GROUND

           The Patrolling Guards on the ground take notice of the 
           commotion and wander over. 

           Aissa re-holsters her gun. 

           With the guards distracted, Aissa and Elian sneak behind the 
           truck, shielded from the view of Patrolling Guards and the 
           SECURITY POST on the other side.

           The DRIVER in the truck chats idly with the GATE GUARD as he 
           hands him his papers. 

           ON THE ROOF OF THE TRUCK

           Aissa hoists herself onto the ROOF of the truck. She peers 
           over and observes Elian struggling to follow her but he 
           cannot get leverage. She reaches down to help him up. 

           THE GATE

           The Gate Guard exits his security post and does a quick 
           inspection of the vehicle. He peeps around the back of truck 
           just as Elian’s foot disappears over the ledge. 

           THE ROOF OF THE TRUCK

           Aissa LIFTS Elian ON TOP right before the Guard makes it to 
           the back of the truck. Elian throws himself down flat.  

           THE GATE

           The Gate Guard waves the truck through the gate.  

           EXT. CRUSADER COMPOUND - SAME

           Aissa and Elian ride the roof of the truck until it comes to 
           a stop at the barracks. They barely breathe. 

           CRUSADERS pour out of the barracks to greet the truck, 
           excitedly anticipating it’s arrival. 
           The Drivers of the truck get out and head to the back. They 
           open the lift gate to reveal SEVERAL DOZEN KEGS OF BEER.

           The Crusaders PUSH IN to help unload the precious cargo. They 
           hoist kegs above their heads. 

           Aissa and Elian wait until the last Crusaders disappear into 
           their dwellings with the beer. 

           Aissa peaks over the edge of the truck to check for danger. 
           All clear. 

           She climbs down from the roof of the truck. Elian follows.

           Aissa and Elian carefully navigate their way through the 
           compound, looking for clues.

           They peek into one brightly lit DWELLING. 

           THROUGH WINDOW

           A few Crusaders chug beer and cheer loudly as they watch a 
           soccer game on a small SATELLITE TELEVISION. 

           OUTSIDE

           Aissa and Elian spot a group of THREE CRUSADERS coming their 
           way. They dart behind a SAND DUNE. 

           CRUSADER #1 chugs beer from a plastic cup. He smacks his 
           lips.

                                 CRUSADER #1
                        I never thought I’d taste the stuff 
                        again. God, war makes a man miss 
                        beer. 

           CRUSADER #2 claps in agreement. CRUSADER #3 scratches his 
           groin, under a heaving belly. 

                                 CRUSADER #3
                        All we need now are the whores. 

           The three men laugh. 

                                 CRUSADER #1
                        Plenty of them down in the mine. 

                                 CRUSADER #2
                        Commander Gabriel says we’d be good 
                        Christians to sow our seed into the 
                        heathens. Let them receive the 
                        spirit and bear Christian sons!
           The Crusaders pass them, laughing. A few beats later Aissa 
           and Elian follow. 

           EXT. ABANDONED DIAMOND MINE - NIGHT 

           The Crusaders approach the entrance to a long forgotten 
           DIAMOND MINE. 

                                 CRUSADER #1
                        We got some real pretty ones now. 

           Crusader #1 cranks a lever, bringing a rusty MINE CAR to the 
           forefront. 

                                 CRUSADER #3
                        A soldier’s greatest reward for 
                        battle. 

           The Crusaders chuckle.

           Crusader #1’s chuckle becomes a muffled, gurgling scream as 
           his THROAT IS CUT from behind.

           Crusader #2 readies his gun but Elian is already behind him, 
           twisting his head until his neck BREAKS. He drops to the 
           ground.

           Crusader #3 runs, but he’s drunk and he’s fat and doesn’t get 
           far. Aissa THROWS her knife. 

           It lands smack in the back of his skull. He TEETERS under his 
           shifting weight and TOPPLES OVER. 

           Aissa walks over and plucks her dagger from his head, wiping 
           the blood off on the Crusader’s shirt. 

           Aissa returns to the MINE CAR. Elian already sits in it. 

                                 ELIAN
                        Let’s find your sister. 

           Aissa jumps in and the mine car ZOOMS down a steep track. 

           INT. ABANDONED DIAMOND MINE SHAFT - NIGHT 

           The car SHOOTS through a twisting, whirling tunnel, high 
           above the ground.  

           Wooden beams hold lanterns that reflect on the unrefined 
           diamonds. They glimmer in the bedrock. 
           After what feels like a mile-long ride, the car slowly loses 
           momentum, coming to a halt. 

           Aissa and Elian exit the car where the tracks end. 

           A GIRL CRYING echoes through the chamber. 

           Aissa and Elian follow the sound. 

           INT. ABANDONED DIAMOND MINE ATRIUM - NIGHT 

           Aissa and Elian enter an Atrium carved high out of the rock. 
           Organ music reverberates from the walls, played by a SLAVE 
           GIRL.

           Other SLAVE GIRLS in black tunics huddle along the back wall, 
           chained. 

           Aissa’s eyes search for Naima in the line of girls, but she 
           is no where to be found.

           The girls turn their gaze to the center of the room where--

           A woman in an all white habit, THE WHITE WITCH (30s), BEATS 
           the CRYING GIRL (18) mercilessly. The girl’s black cloth RIPS 
           as the whip strikes her. 

           Aissa ventures closer and the woman turns her head revealing-- 

           ANRI’S SINISTER SMILE. 

                                 ANRI
                        Your tears are the tears of your 
                        dying gods. 

           Anri brings down her whip HARD on the bloody, bare back of 
           the Crying Girl. 

                                 ANRI (CONT’D)
                        They please me, so I will ensure 
                        they keep flowing. 

           She holds the whip high and STRIKES her again. Flesh splits  
           under the impact.

           Aissa pauses, stunned by the scene before her. Elian strides 
           forward, unafraid of the woman in white. 

                                 ELIAN
                        I brought you the Unforgiveable, 
                        mother.  

           Anri drops her whip, turning. The Crying Girl scampers away.
                                 ANRI
                        Son! 

           Anri turns sickly sweet, embracing Elian. 

                                 ELIAN
                        I brought her here, as you asked. 

           Anri snaps her fingers. GUARDS SEIZE an unsuspecting, shocked 
           Aissa.

                                 ANRI
                        My son, your father perished in 
                        battle. But we will avenge him. 
                        Those Nigerians will suffer dearly 
                        before I end their worthless lives. 

                                 ELIAN
                        I believe in your vengeance, 
                        mother. 

           Anri strokes Elian’s head. He lays his head against her 
           breast, intimate. 

           Aissa struggles against her captors.

                                 AISSA
                        TRAITOR! You’ve betrayed Zalika! 

                                 ELIAN 
                        Zalika could have been saved. I 
                        would have made her my queen and 
                        taught her the ways of the light. 
                        She would have been safe here. But 
                        your darkness got her killed. 

           Elian lingers for a moment on his mother’s breast, then walks 
           to Aissa. He strips her guns, throwing them over his 
           shoulder, though she remains wrapped in magazines. 

           Aissa looks disgusted with his betrayal. 

                                 AISSA
                        The Crusaders got her killed! 

                                 ELIAN
                        Your heathen magic drew the 
                        sickness. Only the one true God can 
                        heal. You sent her to that hell! 

                                 AISSA
                        How could you? How could you 
                        support the people who killed 
                        Zalika’s family?! 
                                 ELIAN
                        I am loyal to my mother. And only 
                        to her. 

                                 ANRI
                        If we want a Christian motherland, 
                        there will be casualties. This is 
                        Africa, there are no clean hands.

           SERIES OF FLASHBACK SHOTS: 

           EXT. LITTLE WHITE CHURCH - DAY - FLASHBACK

           YOUNG ANRI (14) bright, eager eyes in a white habit enters a 
           little, white church with dozens of young, white girls in 
           white habits.

                                 ANRI (V.O.)
                        When I first arrived in the Congo 
                        as a young girl, I was naive, a 
                        Dutch Christian missionary sent to 
                        save the Dark Continent.

           INT. ANRI’S ROOM - DAY - FLASHBACK

           In a sun-soaked room, Anri lays on the bed, reading her blue 
           bible.

                                 ANRI (V.O.)
                        I thought with my little, blue 
                        bible I could change this place. 

           Anri kisses the cross hanging by a silver chord around her 
           neck. 

                                 ANRI
                        But it changed me.

           EXT. LITTLE WHITE CHURCH - DAY - FLASHBACK

           A group of ARMED MEN raid the little, white church. 

           SCREAMS sound from inside. 

           INT. LITTLE WHITE CHURCH HALLWAY - DAY - FLASHBACK

           Armed Men GRAB Missionaries, throwing them onto their 
           shoulders, ripping their white habits.
           INT. ANRI’S ROOM - DAY  - FLASHBACK

           Anri cowers in her bed as a man approaches her, menacing. 

           She GRABS a hot, lit candle and throws it into the man’s 
           face. He SCREAMS as the hot wax, fire and glass maim him. 

           EXT. LITTLE WHITE CHURCH - DAY - FLASHBACK

           The church is ON FIRE, big angry flames raising into the blue 
           sky.

           On the side of the church, Anri jumps out of the second story 
           window. She falls with a sickly CRACK. She limps away, blood 
           on her white habit, unnoticed.  

                                 ANRI (V.O.)
                        I lost my faith. 

           EXT. JUNGLE - DAY - FLASHBACK

           Anri and Watkin fire machine guns into an oncoming group of 
           Armed Men, wild grins on their faces. Bodies drop. 

                                 ANRI (V.O.)
                        I wanted to kill them all. I met 
                        Watkin. He helped me and I loved 
                        him. Then came my sweet Elian.

           Little Elian (10) peeks out behind his parents. Anri smiles 
           at him.

                                 ANRI (V.O.)
                        We realized then that we didn’t 
                        need to kill them. With our help, 
                        they’d kill each other. So we 
                        started selling guns. 

           Elian clings to Anri as she and Watkin kiss passionately, all 
           of the Armed Men dead on the ground.   

           INT. CHURCH - DAY - FLASHBACK

           Anri hesitantly enters a church, empty save for a few souls. 
           Scattered light rays from a dusty stained-glass window give 
           her an ethereal glow.

                                 ANRI (V.O.)
                        One day, a strange feeling came 
                        over me and I found myself once 
                        again in the house of the Lord.
           A young Commander Gabriel, dressed in a priest’s uniform, 
           preaches to YOUNG BOYS at the front pew. Anri approaches. 
           Commander Gabriel catches her eye. 

                                 ANRI (V.O.)
                        And that’s when I met him. 

           Commander Gabriel stops preaching, walks straight to her. He 
           holds out his hands. Anri takes them.

           Anri is so moved, silent tears stream down her face. 

                                 ANRI (V.O.)
                        He gave me back my faith. 

           EXT. CRUSADERS COMPOUND - DAY 

           Throngs of soldiers cheer before Commander Gabriel and Anri, 
           now dressed as the White Witch. Trucks full of weapons are 
           unloaded and given out to the soldiers.

                                 ANRI (V.O.)
                        And I gave him an army. 

           Anri blesses Commander Gabriel with THE DAGGER that is now in 
           Aissa’s possession. 

           BACK TO PRESENT: 

           INT. ABANDONED DIAMOND MINE ATRIUM - NIGHT 

           Anri’s eyes wistful, she stares off. 

                                 ANRI
                        Lord Gabriel saved me. Maybe he 
                        will save you. But above all, Lord 
                        Gabriel will save Africa.

                                 ELIAN
                        I think she will learn much from 
                        Commander Gabriel.

           The guards chain Aissa’s hands. 

           The Slave Girls begin to sing an abridged version of the 
           Hallelujah Chorus, accompanied by the organ. The sound of the 
           music echoes through the amplifying walls of the cave. 

           Four Crusaders carry Commander Gabriel, in his crisp, white 
           uniform, on a black throne. 
           Walking beside him is NAIMA, dressed in a white wedding 
           garment, decorated, her face bruised. 

           Behind them, A PLATOON OF THE COMMANDER'S FIERCEST WARRIORS 
           follow.

           One crusader pulls a lever and an enormous OCULUS opens in 
           the ceiling, shining down a concentrated beam of moonlight, 
           refracted through a COLOSSAL DIAMOND.

           The Crusaders set the thrown down with great care and 
           reverence, beneath the oculus, illuminating Commander Gabriel 
           like the god he thinks he is. 

           Naima kneels by his feet, bowing her head. All the crusaders 
           follow suit, dropping to their knees, bowing their heads.  

           The organ music comes to a close and the captured girls stop 
           singing on cue.

           Anri approaches Commander Gabriel. She kneels.  

                                 ANRI
                        Lord Gabriel, may I seek your 
                        attention? 

                                 COMMANDER GABRIEL
                        You are my White Witch, you may 
                        have my attention whenever you 
                        desire it. 

                                 ANRI 
                        An Unforgiveable snuck into our 
                        camp plotting to kill you. I 
                        thought you might want to decide 
                        her fate personally. GUARDS! 

           The guards drag Aissa to the center.

           Aissa’s head hangs low as she’s shoved in front of a massive, 
           iron crucifix. BURNT SHACKLES hang from the cross. 

           The Guard grabs her face, forcing her head up. Aissa notices 
           Naima. Naima’s eyes grow WIDE WITH FEAR as she recognizes 
           Aissa. 

           Elian watches Aissa closely as her eyes light up, worried, 
           completely focused on Naima. Elian senses a connection. 

                                 ANRI (CONT’D)
                        You will kneel before our Lord of 
                        Lords, King of Kings. 

           The Guards let Aissa go. She does not kneel. 
           One guard KICKS her in the back of the knees. She goes down 
           to the ground. 

                                 COMMANDER GABRIEL
                        Defiant, little girl. Where did 
                        they find her? 

                                 ANRI
                        Elian brought her. She’s a murderer 
                        of good Christian soldiers 
                        throughout the land. 

                                 COMMANDER GABRIEL
                        Is that so?

                                 AISSA
                        I will murder you next. 

           Anri SLAPS Aissa hard across the mouth. BLOOD trickles down 
           her lip.

           Commander Gabriel laughs. He rises from his throne. 

           Anri hands Commander Gabriel the knife Aissa has carried with 
           her on this journey. 

                                 ANRI
                        Your blessed dagger. The brazen 
                        thief stole it.

           Commander Gabriel admires it, then sheathes it. AISSA’S 
           TREASURED KNIFE, now safely back in the Commander’s sheath, 
           flashes beneath his robes. 

           Commander Gabriel looks Aissa up and down. He comes closer, 
           lifting her chin gently to look into his eyes. 

                                 COMMANDER GABRIEL
                        You may stand. 

           Aissa stands up, nose to nose with the Commander. Her face 
           remains stoic.

                                 COMMANDER GABRIEL (CONT’D)
                        Look at these eyes, so full of 
                        hate, so full of passion! What will 
                        it take to kill that passion, I 
                        wonder? 

                                 ELIAN
                        I know how. 

                                 COMMANDER GABRIEL
                        Son of the White Witch, step forth. 
           Elian approaches the Commander. 

                                 ELIAN
                        The girl is in search of her 
                        sister. 

           Elian points to Naima.

                                 ELIAN (CONT’D)
                        SHE is her sister.

           Naima, hearing this, struggles to remain still, unfeeling.

                                 COMMANDER GABRIEL
                        Ridiculous. There were no survivors 
                        from her village. 

                                 ELIAN
                        There was one. 

                                 COMMANDER GABRIEL
                        Naima, speak! 

                                 NAIMA
                        I know not the Unforgiveable. Let 
                        her burn for her wicked deeds. 

           Aissa puts on a good show. 

                                 AISSA
                        That poor girl is not my sister. 

                                 ELIAN
                        Then I guess it wouldn’t concern 
                        you if I shot her. 

           Elian draws his gun on Naima. Naima gasps, shutting her eyes.  
           Aissa freezes, not sure how to react in her chains. 

           Commander Gabriel raises his hand up. 

                                 COMMANDER GABRIEL
                        That will be enough, Elian. 

           Elian lowers his gun, still keeping an eye on Aissa. 

                                 COMMANDER GABRIEL (CONT’D)
                        This girl is to be the virgin 
                        vessel of my holy bloodline. She is 
                        chosen. I will hear no more talk of 
                        her unfaithfulness. You have served 
                        your Lord well. Now your prisoner 
                        will burn. Take her to the cross. 
           Elian yanks Aissa toward the Crucifix. Aissa rapidly throws 
           her chains around Elian’s neck, using him as a human shield. 

           In less than a second she pulls with all her strength and his 
           neck snaps. 

           He collapses, DEAD.

           Anri SHRIEKS, the piercing sound BELLOWS through the arena. 
           She points her long, pale finger at Aissa.

           GUARDS SWARM AISSA, awaiting orders.

                                 ANRI
                        Gabriel! I beg you...

           Anri still screams. CROCODILE TEARS flood down her face.

                                 ANRI (CONT’D)
                        Let me kill her myself.  

           Commander Gabriel nods. Naima looks on, horrified.

           The Crusaders form a circle around Anri and Aissa. One Guard 
           pushes Aissa into the center of the circle. 

           Aissa spots her BIG GUN just out of reach on Elian’s body 
           laying at the edge of the circle. 

           An EXECUTIONER in all black steps into the circle, handing 
           Anri a gruesome, medieval AX on a long pole.

           Anri swings the ax skillfully back and forth, stalking her 
           prey. 

           Blade outstretched, she RUNS at Aissa. 

           Anri spins the blade and SWIPES her. Aissa screams, falling 
           backward against guards as the sharp blade slices her skin, 
           blood flowing down her arm. 

           The guards push her forward to the ground. 

           Anri lets out a pained BATTLE CRY and SLAMS down her blade at 
           Aissa. Aissa JERKS her chains into its path. The blade cuts 
           her chains, freeing her, before it sticks in the ground. 

           Anri struggles to dislodge the blade. 

           Aissa rolls onto her back and KICKS Anri square in the chest. 
           Anri flies backward, taking the ax with her, stunned by the 
           blow. 

           Aissa scrambles to standing, squatting in battle stance. 
           Anri CHARGES at her, eyes red with hatred. 

           Anri SWINGS the ax at Aissa’s neck but Aissa CATCHES the 
           metal pole in her hand and grips it with all her might. 

           They struggle for the weapon. Aissa kicks Anri in the legs. 
           Anri loses her grip and falls back against the guards.  

           The Executioner immediately tosses Anri a SPIKED MACE. 

           Aissa circles her with the ax, careful of Anri’s next move. 

           Anri swings the mace, Aissa flings it back with her Ax. 

           Their weapons COLLIDE as they struggle to land a hit. They 
           clash in the air. 

           Aissa’s ax strikes Anri’s mace, sticking into the wood. Anri 
           pulls the mace back, yanking the ax hard out of Aissa’s hand, 
           flinging it to the ground.

           Anri raises the mace. Aissa flinches, backing away towards 
           the edge of the circle.

           Anri laughs coldly at Aissa’s reaction. 

                                 ANRI (CONT’D)
                        You came halfway across Africa, and 
                        now you will die for NOTHING! 

           She lunges toward Aissa, mace ready to swing like a baseball 
           bat. Aissa DIVES out of the way.

           CRUNCH. 

           The mace lands in the temple of one of the guards. Anri 
           quickly removes it and turns to attack Aissa. 

           Aissa is too fast, she grabs the fallen ax. As Anri raises 
           the mace, Aissa sinks the ax into her belly. 

           Anri stumbles backward from the blow, dropping the mace. She 
           looks down at the blade in shock. 

           Aissa frantically crawls backward, out of the way of Anri’s 
           attack radius. 

           While the guards tend to their dead comrade, Aissa grabs the 
           Big Gun on Elian’s body, just behind the dead guard. 

           Anri reaches for the ax in her belly and begins to pull it 
           out, unconcerned for the blood spewing from the wound. 
           Anri removes the ax and stumbles toward Aissa, slowly raising 
           the ax in the air. 

                                 ANRI (CONT’D)
                           (shrieking)
                        I will slay you, evil beast!

           Aissa whips around to face Anri. She holds the Big Gun, 
           loaded and cocked. 

           She pulls the trigger. 

           Anri flies backward, ax still raised. The SPRAY of Aissa’s 
           fire HITS Anri hard, knocking her off balance. 

           Her body spasms, filled with bullet holes. 

           Blood leaks out of a hundred wounds, staining her white dress 
           red as she melts into the floor. 

           Aissa turns toward Commander Gabriel looking him wildly in 
           the eye.

                                 AISSA
                        GABRIEL! I have killed your White 
                        Whore, now I’m coming for YOU!

           Commander Gabriel, aghast, points at Aissa. 

                                 COMMANDER GABRIEL
                        Kill her!

           The Crusaders in the circle aim their weapons. 

           Pistols, shotguns, semi-automatics, guns that only get off a 
           few rounds a minute, guns that are SLOW in comparison to 
           Aissa’s magnificent piece. 

           Aissa drops to duck as bullets fire. 

           She quickly spins and fires, taking out the dozen guards in 
           the circle, her gun SPLATTERING BULLETS in every direction, 
           eight hundred and fifty rounds a minute. 

           Men drop instantly, falling at the hands of her superior 
           weapon, torn apart by hollow point bullets.

           Commander Gabriel grabs Naima by the arm and hurries out of 
           the room, disappearing down a MINE SHAFT, followed by FOUR 
           CRUSADER GUARDS. 

           Aissa turns to run after the Commander but the Crusaders 
           tighten their ranks around her. One of the guards grabs her 
           shoulder and throws her to the ground. 
           She looks up in time to see him raise a RIFLE TO HER HEAD. 
           She FIRES the Big Gun, shooting his arm CLEAN off. 

           He falls to the ground in shock, writhing and twisting, blood 
           SPURTING from the missing limb. His hand still holds his gun, 
           twitching on the ground.  

           Aissa turns and stands to face--

           THE REMAINING CRUSADERS 

           DESCENDING upon her, guns and machetes raised. Aissa eyes the 
           mine shaft Commander Gabriel ran down and breaks for it, 
           dodging their bullets and firing back at them.

           INT. ABANDONED DIAMOND MINE SHAFT - SAME 

           Aissa runs for her life down the narrow tunnel, Crusaders 
           fast on her heels. 

           Bullets wiz by her head and slam into the soft rock around 
           her.

           She screams as she is HIT with a bullet in the shoulder. 

           WHEELS SCREECH against metal, Aissa turns and sees--

           THE MINE CART. 

           Waiting at the rickety platform. The battle cries of the 
           horde get louder, echoing around her.

           She vaults into the cart and presses a green button on the 
           cart’s lever.

           The cart LURCHES forward, slowly picking up speed, the 
           Crusaders CLOSE IN.

           Crusaders RUN through the tunnel after the cart.

           They aim their guns, and fire at will.  

           Aissa DUCKS inside the cart, bullets RICOCHET off the metal. 
           She quickly reloads her gun. 

           She waits for a lull, then rises out of the cart and 
           unleashes a BARRAGE OF BULLETS on the Crusader army. 

           One Crusader spots an old breaker box in the rock wall of the 
           cave. He takes aim through the chaos and shoots it, sending 
           sparks flying, cutting the power. 
           Aissa lunges forward as the cart comes to an abrupt halt. She 
           yanks on the lever desperately, Crusaders CLOSE BEHIND, but 
           the cart doesn’t budge. 

           She leaps out of the cart and RUNS up the narrow, precarious 
           tracks, now a hundred feet above the ground.

           Crusaders CHASE her, drawing fire. 

           MASSIVE, JAGGED ROCKS CRASH down from the cave ceiling as 
           Aissa turns to MOW DOWN the incoming Crusaders, single file. 

           They FALL from the tracks, a hundred feet into the abyss 
           below.

           The following wave of soldiers TRIP on their corpses, losing 
           balance and falling to the same fate.

           Her gun EXPLODES BULLETS at lightning speed. 

           As the closest crusaders drop, more storm towards her, only 
           to disintegrate under the blast of her gun. 

           Aissa looks up and spots a glimmer of MOONLIGHT at the end of 
           the tunnel. Almost out. 

           One Crusader breaks through the carnage and SNATCHES HER 
           ANKLES from underneath her. 

           She SLIPS off the tracks, and CLINGS to the rails. 

           Aissa hangs on to the dilapidated wooden boards by the edges 
           of her fingers. She dangles over the darkness. 

           Aissa struggles to pull herself up onto the tracks. Her grip 
           begins to slip as the Crusader stands over her, raising his 
           MACHETE for the kill. 

           Aissa’s eye catches a moving shadow on the ceiling. A 
           STALACTITE swings back and forth above their heads.

           The Crusader inches closer. He holds the machete against her 
           throat.

           Crusader gunfire sparks off towards her. One bullet strikes 
           the wobbling stalactite. The jagged rock DROPS, IMPALING 
           Aissa’s attacker.  

           Aissa grapples along the steel underlay of the mine tracks. 
           She reaches a stable area, then hoists herself back onto the 
           tracks. 

           She turns to face her enemies as they get CLOSER.
           No mercy as she WIPES OUT the last of the Crusader soldiers. 
           SHOCK fills their faces as LIFE ESCAPES them, bodies falling 
           left and right. 

           She does not stop firing until the clips are empty.

           Their bodies are left UNRECOGNIZABLE by the carnage. 

           After all is said and done, Aissa is the only warrior 
           standing, dirtied, beaten but alive. 

           She runs towards the light. 

           EXT. CRUSADER DIAMOND MINE - SAME 

           Aissa emerges bloodied but determined. The compound is empty,  
           the rest of the Crusader army drunk in their dimly lit 
           barracks.

           Aissa reloads her gun and sets her eyes on--

           THE PALACE, lit in the night.

           INT. THE PALACE - NIGHT 

           Aissa enters, leaving bloody footprints on the marble floor.  
           FOUR CRUSADER GUARDS lie dead on the floor behind her 

           She carries only the Big Gun.

           Aissa looks around for any signs of life. She hears a 
           rumbling behind a closed door. She draws her HAND CANNON, on 
           the offensive. 

           The door flings open. A SLAVE GIRL runs out of the room. She 
           doesn’t even notice Aissa as she flees. 

           Aissa flinches but does not shoot.

           INT. PALACE BEDROOM - NIGHT 

           Aissa peers inside the vacated room. It is empty except for a 
           tattered mattress and an oil lamp. She moves on. 

           INT. THE PALACE UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT 

           Aissa makes her way through the upstairs hallway, listening 
           for any signs of movement. 

           A FAINT SCREAM. 
           Aissa moves swiftly through the corridor towards the sound. 
           She reaches DOUBLE DOORS. She tries the handle but the doors 
           are locked. 

           Aissa presses her ear to the door. She can hear the muffled 
           voices of Naima and the Commander. 

           INT. COMMANDER GABRIEL’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 

           Naima crouches in the corner, cut and bloodied. 

                                 NAIMA
                        PLEASE!

           The Commander SLAMS her into a dresser. She SMACKS her head 
           on the way down but remains conscious. She attempts to crawl 
           away. 

                                 COMMANDER GABRIEL 
                        I thought I might be able to 
                        destroy the pagan soul in you. 

           Naima whimpers, hiding behind a night stand. Commander grips 
           the dresser by both ends and FLIPS it upside down. He throws 
           it into the wall, BREAKING IT, shards of wood flying. 

           Naima cries. 

                                 COMMANDER GABRIEL (CONT’D)
                        But now I see, I must destroy you 
                        to destroy the pagan soul. Just 
                        like the rest! 

           INT. THE PALACE CORRIDOR - SIMULTANEOUS  

           Aissa sits crouched outside of the bedroom doors. She takes 
           the Big Gun and WHIPS it over her shoulder. 

           She makes her move.

           With the butt of the gun she smashes the lock and kicks in 
           the doors. 

           INT. COMMANDER GABRIEL’S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Aissa CRASHES into the room, the BIG GUN READY.

           The Commander aims his gun at the disabled Naima. 

           Aissa aims her gun at Commander Gabriel’s head. 
                                 AISSA
                        Drop your gun. Now. 

           Commander Gabriel cannot hide his shock. He keeps his gun 
           pointed at Naima. 

                                 COMMANDER GABRIEL
                        You are something special. You must 
                        have killed a hundred guards. It 
                        makes sense. I knew God wanted to 
                        test me. 

           He strokes Naima’s face with the gun. 

                                 COMMANDER GABRIEL (CONT’D)
                        He sent you, Devil. But I’ll not be 
                        pulled into the flames. 

           Commander Gabriel hoists Naima by her waist, still pointing 
           the gun at her head. 

           He suddenly turns to shoot Aissa. She beats him to the draw 
           but misses her target. 

           Her bullet RIPS through his EAR, BLOWING IT OFF. Gabriel 
           SCREAMS, clasping the hole where his ear used to be. 

           He drops Naima in the process. She falls, woozy from her head 
           wound.  

           He gets off a round of his own that bounces off the back 
           wall.

           The Commander stumbles around, disoriented. Blood GUSHES from 
           his ear wound, throwing off his balance. He palms the wall. 

           Aissa takes advantage. She runs and slides on her side, 
           knocking the COMMANDER off balance with her feet. Commander 
           Gabriel CRASHES to the ground. 

           Caught off guard the Commander’s GUN tumbles to the floor. 

           The Commander grabs for his gun but Aissa KICKS the gun 
           halfway across the room. 

           Adrenaline-charged, she jumps up, ready for an attack. 

           He looks up and sees Aissa standing over him. He tries to 
           slingshot himself up but she CLOTHESLINES HIM back to the 
           floor.

           Aissa drops down on his stomach, straddling him. 
           She WHIPS out her BIG GUN. She takes aim but the Commander 
           grabs the gun nozzle.

           They struggle for control of the gun. 

           Enraged, Commander Gabriel PUNCHES her dead in the jaw, 
           sending Aissa stumbling backwards, the Big Gun flying out of 
           her hands. 

           He stands up, regaining strength, and staggers to Aissa. 

           Gabriel takes Aissa’s head in his hands and KNEES her in the 
           temple. She collapses on all fours, breathless. 

           Commander Gabriel walks over, undoing his pants. He crouches 
           over her and licks her face as he wraps his GIANT BICEPS 
           around her neck. 

                                 COMMANDER GABRIEL (CONT’D)
                        Your fear tastes good. 

           Aissa CLAWS his arm trying to release the grip.

           She rocks up and back and FLINGS the Commander onto his back, 
           flipping him over. He smacks the ground. 

           Aissa quickly SNATCHES the CRUSADER DAGGER from his holster.

           She RAISES the dagger and LUNGES at his head. He GRABS her 
           before she can strike and SLAMS her into the wall. She 
           tumbles to the floor. 

           He grabs her legs and drags her towards him but she WRIGGLES 
           out from his grip and KICKS him in the face, sending him 
           back.

           Aissa jumps up, dagger still in hand. She charges at him, the 
           rage of her revenge written on her face. 

           They parley IN HAND TO HAND COMBAT.

           Aissa attempts to land the dagger anywhere on the Commander’s 
           body. He blocks her at every turn. 

           She raises her leg to kick him but he grabs her foot. She 
           ELBOWS him in the jaw.

           The Commander shifts his body weight and CATAPULTS Aissa into 
           the STAINED GLASS WINDOW on the opposite wall. A giant crack 
           forms. 

           She falls like a swatted fly, incapacitated. She groans. 
           Commander Gabriel stumbles up and over to Aissa, covered in 
           blood. 

           Aissa sits MOTIONLESS. 

           He leans in slowly, like he is about to plant a kiss on her 
           but instead wraps his hands around her neck. He squeezes 
           tight. 

           Aissa wraps her hands around his and tries to pry them off, 
           but she’s exhausted. He’s too strong. 

           She WHEEZES, loses strength.  

           Suddenly, the Commander’s BODY FLIES sideways CRASHING 
           through the cracked, stained glass window. 

           He lands on the TERRACE, arms outstretched like Jesus. 
           MASSIVE BULLET HOLES SMOKE from his side. 

           Colored glass rains down around his battered face. He 
           twitches, in a pool of blood. 

           AISSA’S POV

           The room is fuzzy. A soft figure leans over her. It’s Naima, 
           holding the BIG GUN.

                                 NAIMA
                        Aissa!

           The figure slowly comes into focus. Aissa recognizes her 
           friendly face. Naima drops the gun next to Aissa.

           Naima, crying, throws her arms around the sister she never 
           thought she’d see again. She weeps into Aissa’s chest, Aissa 
           cries in relief as she holds Naima close, strokes her head.

                                 AISSA 
                        It’s okay. It’s okay. I’m here now. 

                                 NAIMA
                        He-- He did--

                                 AISSA
                        Forget it. We move on like we 
                        always do.   

           Naima nods, wiping her tears and helps her sister to 
           standing. She sees the dagger on the floor, picks it up and 
           hands it to Aissa. 

                                 NAIMA
                        Finish it.
           They look at each other and then at the shattered window. 
           Aissa clutches her knife.

           EXT. COMMANDER GABRIEL’S TERRACE - SAME

           Aissa climbs onto the broken window sill and stares down at 
           the Commander. He GASPS for air, lifting his head to look at 
           her. 

                                 COMMANDER GABRIEL
                        You don’t understand... they 
                        deserved to die!

           She jumps down on top of him and DRIVES the knife into his 
           EYE. He screams. 

                                 COMMANDER GABRIEL (CONT’D)
                        No! AWAY, away Demon! It burns! It 
                        BURNS! 

           Blood pours from Commander Gabriel’s open mouth. His body is 
           still. The Commander is dead. 

           EXT. CRUSADER COMPOUND - DAWN 

           Aissa and Naima drag the COMMANDER’S CORPSE through the 
           palace doors. 

           Aissa steps over the dead bodies of her enemies. 

           EXT. DIAMOND MINE - DAWN 

           CAPTURED GIRLS, led by Naima, walk shell shocked out of the 
           diamond mine. They strain their eyes in the sudden 
           brightness.

           EXT. CRUSADER COMPOUND BARRACKS - DAWN 

           Aissa opens the door to a barracks of YOUNG BOYS chained to 
           their beds. 

           The light wakes them. A few look up. 

           EXT. CRUSADER DWELLINGS - DAWN 

           Aissa watches as the newly freed soldier boys and slave girls 
           enter the dwellings of the last crusaders alive, wielding 
           knives. 
           INT. CRUSADER DWELLING - DAWN

           Spilled beer and plastic cups litter the floor of the 
           barracks as the Crusaders snore in their beds.

           The boys and girls enter. 

           They swiftly and silently cut the throats of their captors.

           One after another, the drunk Crusaders bleed out, fast 
           asleep. BLOOD runs into the spilled beer.

           EXT. CRUSADER COMPOUND - DAWN 

           Aissa rides a gallant, black horse. Commander Gabriel, nailed 
           to a crucifix, is dragged behind her. 

           Naima rides at her side on her own horse. 

           Behind them is a new army of young girls and boys. They are 
           covered in jewels and gold, some on horseback, some in jeeps. 
           They all hold guns. 

           Aissa turns her horse around, addressing them. The abandoned 
           compound BURNS behind her. 

           A group of young people help erect the iron crucifix. 

           Aissa brings her horse around to the front addressing the 
           crowd with Gabriel’s corpse behind her. His remaining eye is 
           wide open and terrified. 

                                 AISSA
                        Sisters, brothers. I have 
                        slaughtered your tormentors. See 
                        them lifeless, limbless on the 
                        ground. See Commander Gabriel BURN. 

           Aissa throws a match and the cross IGNITES, MELTING his flesh 
           from his bones. 

                                 AISSA (CONT’D)
                        We will take back what they stole 
                        from us. We will take back Africa.

           Pan over the fierce, crying, cheering faces of the rescued 
           youths. They FIRE their guns into the air with jubilation. 

           Aissa nudges her horse, it BUCKS UP and GALLOPS off. Naima 
           and the new army follow Aissa’s command.

           Africa’s majestic beauty ahead, the sun rises on a new day.
                                        THE END
