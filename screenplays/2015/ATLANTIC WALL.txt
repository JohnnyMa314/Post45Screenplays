           FADE IN:

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - SHENANDOAH VALLEY - WEST VIRGINIA - 1921

           A SHAFT OF SUNLIGHT passes through a tapering crack in a dark 
           hospital room curtain, falling across the OPEN HAND of a 
           thirteen-year-old boy named LOWRY SCOTT.

           Dressed in his best shirt and trousers, Lowry sits on a 
           wooden chair beside a hospital bed. 

           The room is silent and sparse. A crucifix hangs on a wall.

           Lost in thought, the boy stares at the tiny, airborne dust 
           particles swirling in the shaft of sunlight falling on his 
           hand. Then slowly... 

           His young eyes drift upward toward HIS MOTHER (30’s), lying 
           in bed, sleeping in a numb morphine haze. 

           Her face is a deep blue swell of bruises. 

           Her shattered jaw is wired shut. 

           Lowry watches her chest rise and fall as she sleeps, then 
           reaches out, gently tucking her hair behind her ear.

           He glances at her bedside table, where her small ST. 
           CHRISTOPHER NECKLACE lies in the darkness. 

           Lowry gently picks up the St. Christopher pendant. The 
           delicate necklace chain is broken...  

           CLOSE ON PENDANT: ENGRAVED IN THE SOFT SILVER, IS THE WORN 
           IMAGE OF A MAN GRIPPING A CHILD IN HIS ARMS AS HE FIGHTS TO 
           CROSS THE CURRENT OF A FURIOUS RIVER... 

           INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - MOMENTS LATER

           Lowry walks alone down a long empty hospital corridor toward 
           the exit...

           EXT. RAILROAD TRACKS - LATER

           The late afternoon sunlight shines through the trees as Lowry 
           walks home through the woods on the RAILROAD TRACKS...
           EXT. FARMHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Lowry slowly approaches the farmhouse where he lives.

           He notes to himself there is no vehicle in the driveway, then 
           walks nervously up onto the porch...

                                 LOWRY
                             (calling out)
                        Dad?

           There is no answer.

           INT. KITCHEN - FARMHOUSE - SECONDS LATER

           Lowry walks into the kitchen.

           An OVERTURNED DINNER TABLE lies on its side in the corner, 
           abandoned from the previous evening... 

           Dishes are broken everywhere.

           FLIES buzz on the boiled potatoes and cold meat on the 
           kitchen floor. 

           It looks like a crime scene.

           The boy stares at the mess for a moment, then takes off his 
           good white shirt, folds it, and sets it aside. 

           Shirtless, he reaches into the mud room closet for a BROOM... 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. FARMHOUSE - SERIES OF SHOTS - MOMENTS LATER

           Bare-chested and thin, Lowry METICULOUSLY CLEANS THE HOUSE...

           -INT. KITCHEN - The boy sweeps up fragments of the shattered 
           dinner plates and glassware...

           -INT. KITCHEN - On his hands and knees, Lowry SCRUBS HIS 
           MOTHER’S DRIED BLOOD SPATTER off the kitchen floor...

           -INT. KITCHEN - Lowry uprights the table on the newly cleaned 
           kitchen floor...

           -INT. FOYER - He straightens the shoes and boots by the door 
           into perfect rows...
           -INT. BEDROOM - He makes the beds, methodically folding the 
           blankets and sheets tightly beneath the mattress in a 
           practiced Military Fashion...

           -INT. LIVING ROOM - He carries in SPLIT WOOD and neatly 
           stacks it beside the fireplace from the outdoor wood pile...

           -INT. LIVING ROOM - Lowry carefully dusts a shrine-like 
           DISPLAY CASE of war memorabilia above the fireplace: 
           DISTINGUISHED SERVICE CROSS, a TRENCH-WARFARE GAS MASK, A 
           BAYONET, and a WWI REVOLVER...

           -EXT. BACKYARD FIELD - As the sun sinks, Lowry sits in an 
           ABANDONED WOODEN CANOE overgrown with dirt and wildflowers. 
           He picks a fistful of DAISIES from the bow of the canoe.

           -INT. KITCHEN - Lowry places the flowers in a vase on the 
           kitchen table...

           As night falls, the APPEARANCE OF THE FARMHOUSE IS 
           TRANSFORMED INTO A CLEAN AND WELCOMING HOME, AS IF NOTHING 
           EVER HAPPENED...

           EXT. KITCHEN - FARMHOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT

           In the kitchen lit by oil lamps, Lowry, exhausted, sleeps 
           with his head in his arms at the kitchen table.

           WE SEE THE SHADOW OF A MAN PASS OVER HIM, then suddenly...

           A DOG BARKS.

           LOWRY LURCHES UP at the table, as if to attention...

           Lowry’s father ROBERT SCOTT (late 40’s) stands in the kitchen 
           doorway with his WHITE DOG beside him. 

           Robert’s LEFT ARM IS MISSING, AMPUTATED AT THE ELBOW IN AN 
           ARMY FIELD HOSPITAL three years before. 

           Long-term post trauma SHELL-SHOCK hovers in the vacant 
           darkness behind Robert’s eyes. 

                                 LOWRY
                        You hungry, dad? I’ll fix you 
                        something...

           Robert slowly sits down at the table. He smells like alcohol.

           Lowry, clearly nervous, stands and reaches in the ice box, 
           filling a plate with bread and cured meat.
           Robert stares vacantly at the spotless kitchen as his white 
           dog rests his muzzle on his thigh... 

           There’s a beat of silence, then he speaks to Lowry without 
           looking at him...

                                 ROBERT
                        Do you think I’m your enemy?

           Lowry hesitates, not knowing how to answer correctly...

                                 LOWRY
                        No, sir.

           Lowry slowly places the food in front of his father.

                                 ROBERT
                        Are you afraid of me?

           Lowry doesn’t answer...

           Robert SEIZES Lowry’s wrist with his good arm.

           The boy trembles...

                                 ROBERT (CONT’D)
                        Are you afraid of me?

                                 LOWRY
                        Yes. Yes, sir.

                                 ROBERT
                        What exactly are you afraid of?

                                 LOWRY
                        I...I don’t know...

                                 ROBERT
                        Yes. You do. You’re afraid I’ll 
                        kill her...and you’ll be left alone 
                        here with just me. 

           Terrified, Lowry remains silent.

           Robert releases Lowry’s wrist.

                                 ROBERT (CONT’D)
                        It’s a father’s job to teach, so 
                        I’m going to teach...

           The boy keeps his eyes to the kitchen floor.
                                 ROBERT (CONT’D)
                        People think that war begins on the 
                        outside...and it works its way 
                        inside. But they’re wrong. All wars 
                        begin inside. Inside someone.

           Robert pauses...

                                 ROBERT (CONT’D)
                        This is a war. I am your enemy. And 
                        you are losing because you’re 
                        afraid...

           Robert’s dark eyes well with shame...

                                 ROBERT (CONT’D)
                        You’re afraid to do what you know 
                        you need to do to win. 

           Robert’s eyes tear as he looks at Lowry.

                                 ROBERT (CONT’D)
                        Son, one of these times, I am going 
                        to kill her. Unless you do 
                        something about it.

           INT. FARMHOUSE - LATER THAT NIGHT

           The house is dark except for an oil lamp burning low.

           A SPRING-WOUND VICTROLA PHONOGRAPH SPINS IN THE LIVING ROOM 
           PLAYING  THE SARABANDE MOVEMENT OF J.S. BACH’S CELLO SUITE#1 
           IN G MAJOR.

           The haunting cello music echoes through the house as...

           INT. LOWRY’S BEDROOM - SAME MOMENT

           Lowry lies awake in bed in the darkness.

           He hears thunder in the distance and the sound of the 
           Victrola playing downstairs...

           EXT. PORCH - MOMENTS LATER

           With a glass of grain alcohol in his hand, Robert sits on the 
           farmhouse porch. 

           With his white dog curled up at his feet, Robert’s eyes grow 
           heavy and drift. 
           Distant lightning flickers in the night sky as the sound of 
           the phonograph drifts out onto the porch...

           As THUNDER ROLLS in the distance, Robert stirs from sleep. 

           He stands stiffly from the wooden chair, pats the dog’s neck, 
           and walks across the porch toward the door...

           As Robert approaches HE SEES LOWRY STANDING IN THE DARKNESS 
           ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SCREEN DOOR.

           Rain begins to fall in the darkness as Robert stares at his 
           young son through the screen...

                                 ROBERT
                        Do it. 

           There is a beat of silence.

                                 ROBERT (CONT’D)
                        Please.

           Without another word, Lowry raises his father’s SERVICE 
           PISTOL FROM THE SHADOWS AND PULLS THE TRIGGER, SHOOTING HIS 
           FATHER THROUGH THE SCREEN...

           The WHITE DOG BARKS FURIOUSLY as...

                                                        WE HARD CUT TO:

           EXT. RAILROAD TRACKS - MOMENTS LATER

           Lowry runs through the wet darkness along side a slow moving 
           FREIGHT TRAIN.

           The boy pulls himself up onto an EMPTY FLATBED FREIGHT CAR...

           EXT. FLATBED TRAIN CAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Leaning against his BEDROLL, tears streak from his eyes as 
           Lowry hugs his legs to his chest.

           As the dark landscape passes, the boy looks up at the MOON 
           BREAKING OUT OF THE CLOUDS as we...

                                                         FADE TO BLACK:
           SUPER TITLE: 23 YEARS LATER - SOUTHERN ENGLAND - JUNE 1, 1944 

                                                               FADE TO:

           EXT. THE ENGLISH CHANNEL - JUNE 1, 1944 - NIGHT

           The brilliant moon hangs high above the English Channel, 
           reflecting silently on the dark waves below.

           Scattered storm clouds drift across the night sky toward 
           occupied Europe. There is no sound but the wind.

           It is five days before the execution of Operation Overlord, 
           where the Allies will cross this Channel and invade Nazi 
           occupied Normandy in the largest and deadliest amphibious 
           assault in the history of warfare...

           But in this quiet moment, on this peaceful night, it’s as if 
           there is no war at all... 

           EXT. BREAK WALL - PORTSMOUTH, ENGLAND - SAME MOMENT

           Alone at the end of a BREAK WALL jutting out into the dark 
           harbor, AMERICAN AIRBORNE CAPTAIN LOWRY SCOTT (a.k.a. Lowry), 
           now a grown man in his 30’s, stands in uniform.

           Behind him in the distance, ANTI-AIRCRAFT GUN BATTERIES aim 
           at the heavens. 

           Lost in thought, Capt. Scott stares east out at the dark 
           channel...

                                 CAPT. SCOTT (V.O.)
                        Dear Lord, we ask you to look down 
                        on us tonight...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. UNDERGROUND PUB - LONDON - LATER THE SAME NIGHT

           THE AUDIO REMAINS SILENT - THE ONLY SOUND WE HEAR IS CAPT. 
           SCOTT’S VOICE OVER AS WE MOVE THROUGH...

           A dimly-lit, underground pub in wartime. 

           Cigarette smoke hangs in the air.

           The street level windows are BLACKED OUT and fortified with 
           SANDBAGS. 
                                 CAPT. SCOTT (V.O.)
                        We ask that you see us for what we 
                        are...

           THE CAMERA SILENTLY MOVES PAST: Baby-faced, untested AMERICAN 
           and BRITISH SOLDIERS in the prime of youth, flirting and 
           competing for the attention of THREE PRETTY LONDON GIRLS 
           whose smiles light up the dark pub.

           We keep PUSHING to a...

           A far back corner, where Capt. Scott sits at the head of a 
           table, surrounded by his ELITE UNIT OF SEVEN ‘JEDBURGH’ 
           PARATROOPERS (all early 20’s).

           Their heads are bowed as Capt. Scott says GRACE over their 
           meal...

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                        Bless these men. Because they are 
                        my men...

           Several of Capt. Scott’s men glance up at him as he speaks, 
           respectfully registering his sentiment.

                                 CAPT. SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        Give them courage, and show them 
                        mercy in the days to come. We thank 
                        you for the food on this table, and 
                        for this moment of peace to share 
                        it. Amen.

                                 SCOTT’S MEN
                             (in unison)
                        Amen.

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                        Let’s eat.

           Scott’s men fall at ease, eating and drinking informally.

           JOLSON, (21), a handsome rifleman from San Angelo, Texas 
           looks at Capt. Scott.

                                 JOLSON
                        Sir?

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                        Yeah?

                                 JOLSON
                        Can you tell us anything, Sir?

           Capt. Scott looks at his men. 
           It’s clear by their expressions that Jolson is speaking for 
           all of them.

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                             (addressing all seven)
                        You won’t be returning to camp. We 
                        head to Portsmouth at midnight. 
                        There’s a briefing at Southwick 
                        house tomorrow at 0900. 

           The men exchange loaded glances.

                                 CAPT. SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        That’s all I’m at liberty to tell 
                        you. You’ll learn more at the 
                        briefing.

           Jolson nods.

                                 JOLSON
                        Understood, Sir.

           There is a beat of silence where Scott’s men’s attention stay 
           on him.

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                             (off their look)
                        Is there something else?

           DeROSA, (23) a heavy set, fast talking machine gunner from 
           Bensonhurst speaks up with brash Brooklyn banter... 

                                 DEROSA
                             (to Capt. Scott)
                        Leigh needs your honest opinion on 
                        something, Cap...

           LEIGH, (19) the youngest member of the unit turns sheepishly 
           red, trying to cut DeRosa off...

                                 LEIGH
                             (to DeRosa)
                        No man, shut up...

           DeRosa ignores Leigh’s protest.

                                 DEROSA
                             (to Capt. Scott)
                        In yesterday’s post, our young 
                        comrade received a letter from his 
                        sweetheart back in...(pauses)...

           DeRosa pauses, turning to Leigh...
                                 DEROSA (CONT’D)
                             (to Leigh)
                        Where you from again?

                                 LEIGH
                        Michigan.

                                 DEROSA
                        Land of ten thousand lakes...

                                 LEIGH
                        That’s Minnesota...

                                 DEROSA
                        Don’t. Fucking. Care.

           DeRosa turns, speaking collectively for the group...

                                 DEROSA (CONT’D)
                        What we do care about, as your 
                        brothers-in-arms, is said letter 
                        from the blue-eyed-girl back in the 
                        north woods.

                                 LEIGH
                        Brown eyes. 

           The young men around the table are accustomed to enjoying 
           this banter.

           DeRosa turns to the Capt. Scott...

                                 DEROSA
                             (to Capt. Scott)
                        Cap, we’ve all read the letter. We 
                        have differing opinions of its 
                        meaning. I personally think she’s 
                        moved on to greener Michigan 
                        pastures. Leigh, understandably, 
                        was upset by this interpretation 
                        and would respectfully like your 
                        opinion, sir.

           There is a beat of silence. 

           Capt. Scott looks at his men. 

           It’s clear by Leigh’s vexed expression, he doesn’t know what 
           to expect.

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                        Give me the letter.
           Leigh BREAKS INTO A BOYISH SMILE, and pulls the letter from 
           his pocket. He hands it to Captain Scott at the head of the 
           table.

           As Capt. Scott scans the letter, the young men around the 
           table eagerly await his thoughts. 

           It’s clear they love him like a father.

           After a moment, Scott carefully folds the hand written letter 
           and places it back in its envelope.

                                 LEIGH
                        So...what do you think, sir?

           Capt. Scott starts to say something...

           When suddenly a MASSIVE EXPLOSION OUTSIDE ON THE STREET 
           VIOLENTLY ROCKS THE PUB.

           SANDBAGGED WINDOWS SHATTER AS THE LIGHTS ARE KNOCKED OUT...

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           EXT. OUTSIDE THE PUB - LONDON STREET - SECONDS LATER

           An AIR RAID SIREN screams through the dark London night. 

           Surface to air ANTI-AIRCRAFT FIRE streams into the sky.

           The BUILDINGS on the far side of the block are BURNING.

           As Capt. Scott and his men rush out into the street, Scott 
           sees one of the PRETTY GIRLS (19) stumbling down the 
           cobblestones. HER BODY IS COMPLETELY ENGULFED IN FLAMES from 
           a GERMAN INCENDIARY BOMB.

           Her friends SCREAM FOR HELP, as CAPT. SCOTT PULLS OFF HIS 
           JACKET AND RUNS FOR THE BURNING GIRL...

           HE TACKLES HER TO THE GROUND, TRYING TO SMOTHER THE FLAMES 
           WITH HIS UNIFORM.

           LYING IN THE STREET, HER BODY SHAKES UNCONTROLLABLY.

           THE COLLAR OF HER DRESS IS BURNED INTO THE COOKED SKIN ON HER 
           YOUNG FACE. 

           SHE CLINGS TO SCOTT, DISORIENTED AND TERRIFIED...
                                 PRETTY LONDON GIRL
                        What’s happening...what’s happening 
                        to me...

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. GRAND HOTEL CABOURG, OCCUPIED NORMANDY - SAME MOMENT 

           The Nazi occupied seaside town of Cabourg, France - 140 
           kilometers across the English channel.

           On the boardwalk facing the sea, crimson and black SWASTIKA 
           BANNERS flutter in the night wind outside the richly lit 
           GRAND HOTEL CABOURG... 

           GERMAN GUARDS and DRIVERS stand outside as LIVE MUSIC rises 
           from the interior...

           INT. BALLROOM - GRAND HOTEL CABOURG - SAME MOMENT

           An opulent BALLROOM of the commandeered 19th century luxury 
           hotel.

           A STRING QUARTET plays...

           The dance floor is full, as high ranking locally-stationed 
           NAZI OFFICERS in uniform waltz with their elegantly dressed 
           WIVES visiting from Germany... 

           Among the dancing couples is GERMAN ARMY COMMANDER RAINER 
           BUSHNELL, (early 40’s). He is handsome, sharp in his dress 
           uniform, but his eyes are weary from years at war with the 
           Allies...

           Bushnell waltzes with his wife ELISE (mid-30’s), the only 
           daughter of a prominent member of Hitler’s political cabinet. 
           ELISE is a beautiful, privileged Aryan woman. 

           As the couple dances, their movements are precise and 
           practiced, but passionless. They don’t look into each other’s 
           eyes...

           As the song ends Bushnell glances at the ornate CLOCK mounted 
           on the wall above the ballroom entrance...

                                 BUSHNELL
                        We should go. The car leaves early. 

           ELISE looks at him.
                                 ELISE
                        The car will leave whenever we say 
                        it leaves. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BALLROOM BAR - GRAND HOTEL CABOURG - MOMENTS LATER

           Bushnell stands alone at the ballroom bar. 

           He DOWNS HIS DRINK AND MOTIONS TO THE BARTENDER FOR ANOTHER. 
           He watches ELISE from across the room. She laughs, shakes 
           hands, and flirts...

           Bushnell reaches for his fresh drink, drains it in two 
           swallows, sets the empty glass on the bar, and walks toward 
           the door...

           As Bushnell exits the ballroom we HEAR THE RISING SOUND OF A 
           GALLOPING HORSE lapse in as we...

                                                           HARD CUT TO:

           EXT. WOODS TRAIL - AN HOUR LATER

           Still in dress uniform from the party, Bushnell GALLOPS AT 
           HIGH SPEED THROUGH THE DARK WOODS ON THE BACK OF A BEAUTIFUL 
           BLACK FRENCH TROTTER RACING HORSE. 

           EXHILARATED BY THE ALCOHOL IN HIS BLOODSTREAM AND THE RUSH OF 
           ADRENALINE, BUSHNELL CROUCHES LOW IN THE SADDLE AS TREE 
           BRANCHES RACE PAST HIM...

           As they clear the edge of a woods into an open field, the 
           horse opens his stride in the darkness, breaking away, and 
           they speed home toward a warmly lit HORSE STABLE in the 
           distance...

           EXT. HORSE STABLE - MOMENTS LATER

           A horse stable late at night.

           Commander Bushnell strokes the face of the MAGNIFICENT BLACK 
           HORSE towering over him...

           An elderly FRENCH HORSE BREEDER (late 60’s), clearly woken 
           from sleep moments before, stands nervously in background 
           beside TWO OF BUSHNELL’S ELITE GERMAN GUARDS.

           Bushnell speaks in French to the trainer...
                                 BUSHNELL
                             (to the trainer)
                        How much to purchase this animal?

           The elderly man glances at the MP-40 SUBMACHINE GUNS gripped 
           by the two Guards surrounding him...  

                                 HORSE BREEDER
                        Commander, for you, there is no 
                        charge.

           Bushnell looks at the old man standing in stable boots, 
           trousers, and a night shirt. His thin white hair is still 
           matted from his pillow.

                                 BUSHNELL
                        It’s a gift for my daughter. It 
                        should be bought, not stolen. Name 
                        me a fair price for the animal, a 
                        trailer, and enough feed to 
                        transport him back to Germany. My 
                        men will fetch him in the morning.

           INT. BUSHNELL’S RESIDENCE - HOTEL CABOURG - AN HOUR LATER 

           Bushnell quietly unlocks the door and steps into the foyer of 
           his residence suite at the commandeered hotel. 

           He pauses, noticing Elise’s bags are packed and waiting by 
           the door.

           Bushnell walks silently through the suite and peers into the 
           dark bedroom.

           For a beat, he watches ELISE sleeping...

           EXT. BALCONY - HOTEL SUITE - MOMENTS LATER

           Bushnell steps out onto the balcony. He lights a cigarette 
           and gazes east out at the sea.

           As he unbuttons his uniform collar, Bushnell hears his wife’s 
           voice behind him...

           They speak in their native German...

                                 ELISE
                        Where were you, Rainer?

           Bushnell turns and sees ELISE standing in a white nightgown.
                                 BUSHNELL
                        I went to buy Ida a birthday 
                        present.

           She looks at him.

                                 ELISE
                        You haven’t been home to see her 
                        since her last birthday, yet you 
                        make time to abandon me at a party 
                        in order to buy her a present?

           Bushnell looks into her blue eyes.

                                 BUSHNELL
                        I won’t be returning to Berlin with 
                        you. I’m keeping my command here.

                                 ELISE
                        What? Don’t be...

                                 BUSHNELL
                             (interrupting)
                        Elise...you should ask me for a 
                        divorce. 

           Elise pauses, suddenly breathless, blind-sided by the 
           notion...

                                 BUSHNELL (CONT’D)
                        I’m sure your father could have it 
                        facilitated quietly. I’ll sign 
                        whatever you like.

           Her pretty face floods with a hurt expression as she pushes 
           her blonde hair self-consciously behind her ear...

                                 ELISE
                        This is about the affair? I stopped 
                        seeing him, Rainer. I told you 
                        that. It’s been months...

                                 BUSHNELL
                        You shouldn’t have, if he made you 
                        happy... 

           Elisa exhales in teary spite...

                                 ELISE
                        What is wrong with you? You used to 
                        fight for me...

           Bushnell lets out a surge of contempt...
                                 BUSHNELL
                        Are you fucking serious? 

           But immediately he cuts himself off, not allowing his 
           emotions to color what he has to say...

                                 BUSHNELL (CONT’D)
                        Time is running short. Go back to 
                        Berlin. Be happy while you can. 

           Elise reads his face and the serious undertone of his 
           comment.

                                 ELISE
                        Why are you doing this?

           Bushnell gazes at the sea. HALF-SUBMERGED STEEL ANTI-TANK 
           BARRICADES dot the low tide beach as the first hue of dawn 
           glows on the horizon.

                                 BUSHNELL
                             (staring at the 
                              barricades)
                        My place is here. My responsibility 
                        is here. And whether your father or 
                        the rest of high command want to 
                        admit it, we are gravely 
                        underestimating the Allies. Rommel 
                        is right. We can’t let them in. Not 
                        one inch. We have to stop them at 
                        the Atlantic Wall or all of this is 
                        over.

                                 ELISE
                        So stop them. Dead on the beaches.

                                 BUSHNELL
                        Hitler’s paranoia has tied our 
                        hands... 

                                 ELISE
                        You should not speak that way...

                                 BUSHNELL
                        We need to advance our armored 
                        reserves to the beachhead! We need 
                        to move the 12th Panzer Divison to 
                        Carentan! We need to quit 
                        pretending we control the sky 
                        because we don’t! Not anymore... 

           Elise looks at the frustration in her husband’s eyes.
                                 BUSHNELL (CONT’D)
                        My job is to lead my men. I say 
                        kill and they kill. They put their 
                        lives in my hands. But how can I 
                        lead them when I do not understand 
                        our fundamental objective? What’s 
                        our endgame? It’s undefined. 
                        (pause) But I can tell what the 
                        Allied objective is, because it’s 
                        very clear and it’s very simple: 
                        stop us.

           EXT. LONGUES-SUR-MER, NORMANDY COASTLINE - LATER THAT MORNING

           The breathtaking Normandy coastline.

           The morning sun cuts shafts of light through the low hanging 
           clouds, casting shadows on the heavily FORTIFIED BEACHHEADS 
           and CONCRETE BUNKERS of HITLER’S ATLANTIC WALL...

           We PUSH IN FROM AN AERIAL SHOT as we see...

           Far below, on the top of the sea cliff, an eleven-year-old 
           FRENCH BOY in a worn cap rides a BICYCLE through a field of 
           yellow wildflowers. This is JASPER. 

           EXT. SEA CLIFF TRAIL - CONTINUOUS

           Jasper pedals quickly through the flowers toward A HILL in 
           the distance.

           Mounted on the front of Jasper’s bicycle is a large BASKET 
           FULL OF FRENCH CIGARETTES. 

           After a moment of riding, Jasper slows and glances down at 
           his rear bicycle wheel. 

           CLOSE UP ON: A SPOOL OF FINE SEWING THREAD HAS BEEN CURIOUSLY 
           ATTACHED TO HIS REAR TIRE ASSEMBLY. 

           The end of a thread has been tied to a SMALL PIN extending 
           the tire axle beyond the spokes. 

           As Jasper rides, the thread is peeled off the LARGER SPOOL 
           and collects on the AXLE PIN.

           EXT. HIDDEN GERMAN ARTILLERY BATTERY - MOMENTS LATER

           As Jasper nears the hill, WE REALIZE IT IS NOT A HILL but a 
           perfectly camouflaged, earth-covered GERMAN ARTILLERY BATTERY 
           overlooking the beachhead below.
           Several armed GERMAN SOLDIERS manning the battery, SHOUT as 
           Jasper approaches. 

           They raise their weapons.

           Jasper immediately stops the bike and waves, showing his 
           hands and calls out to them...

                                 JASPER
                        Cigarettes! 

           Then he attempts to say it in German...

                                 JASPER (CONT’D)
                        Zigaretten!

           The German soldiers lower their weapons and signal for him to 
           approach.

           Jasper smiles again and gets off his bike.

           For a moment, Jasper kneels down as if to tie his shoe...

           But as he does this, he quickly and discreetly CUTS THE 
           THREAD WITH A POCKET KNIFE, REMOVES THE COLLECTED THREAD FROM 
           THE AXLE PIN, AND STUFFS IT IN HIS TROUSER POCKET.

           EXT. HIDDEN GERMAN ARTILLERY BATTERY - MOMENTS LATER

           Jasper carries the BASKET OF CIGARETTES.

           As a crowd of GERMAN SOLDIERS approach him, Jasper glances at 
           the massive, 152 MM GERMAN NAVAL GUN aimed out at the 
           channel.

           Jasper diverts his eyes back to the Soldiers and smiles.

                                 JASPER
                             (to the Soldiers)
                        Zigaretten?

           EXT. HIDDEN GERMAN ARTILLERY BATTERY - MOMENTS LATER

           Jasper quickly sells out of cigarettes and he thanks them...

                                 JASPER
                        Danke. Danke...

           As Jasper turns counting the coins, he sees that a GERMAN BOY-
           SOLDIER (12), a member of HITLER YOUTH, is RIDING JASPER’S 
           BICYCLE. 
           The boy is barely a year older than Jasper. His standard-
           issue German uniform is too big for him. His sleeves are 
           rolled up and his helmet is loose on his head. 

           Jasper watches as the German boy smiles, riding through the 
           yellow flowers.

           As Jasper approaches, the German boy sees him and stops 
           pedaling.

           The boy’s smile fades as he slowly dismounts the bicycle and 
           picks up his RIFLE.

           There is a moment of silence as the two boys stare at each 
           other. 

           Jasper reaches in his jacket pocket. He pulls out a stick of 
           HARD PEPPERMINT CANDY. 

           Jasper breaks the stick and offers half to the German Boy 
           Soldier.

           Feeling the eyes of the other Soldiers on him, the German boy 
           in the uniform just stares at the candy...

           EXT. SOUTHWICK HOUSE, HAMPSHIRE, ENGLAND - SAME MORNING

           The morning sun rises on a PICTURESQUE ESTATE in the south 
           England countryside. 

           At the center of the estate is Southwick House, an early 19th 
           century Georgian style manor which serves as the ALLIED 
           SUPREME COMMAND HEADQUARTERS for Operation Overlord.   

           INT. UNDERGROUND BRIEFING ROOM, SOUTHWICK HOUSE - SAME MOMENT

           Capt. Scott and his seven men encircle a LARGE MAP TABLE 
           detailing the Normandy Coast. 

           They listen intently as they are briefed by SEVERAL OFFICERS, 
           as well as BRIGADIER GENERAL LANCASTER (50’s), a larger-than-
           life, chain-smoking commanding officer with a heavy West 
           Texas accent... 

                                 GENERAL LANCASTER
                             (addressing them all)
                        The principle French Resistance 
                        leader in the region is a man named 
                        Alain. He owns a tobacco store in 
                        Caen. 
           Lancaster motions to the slightly inland French town on the 
           map.

                                 GENERAL LANCASTER (CONT’D)
                        He and his network have taken 
                        considerable risks to compile a 
                        report detailing the exact German 
                        defensive positions in the Overlord 
                        landing areas. It’s a map of every 
                        fixed gun, bunker, pillbox, and 
                        rocket battery dialed-in to the 
                        meter. We get that map and we know 
                        exactly where and what is waiting 
                        for our boys so we can blow it the 
                        fuck to hell before Allied boots 
                        touch the sand. 

           Lancaster lights a cigarette...

                                 GENERAL LANCASTER (CONT’D)
                        Ike and Montgomery are time 
                        committed to Overlord. We’re on a 
                        tight clock. Unfortunately, Alain’s 
                        radio operator was captured by the 
                        Gestapo two days ago. So this has 
                        to be hand to hand and it has to 
                        happen now. That’s where you men 
                        come into play. 

           The General MOTIONS to Capt. Scott...

           Capt. Scott steps up to the MAP TABLE. He demonstrates the 
           physical movements of the mission visually on the map as he 
           explains...

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                             (addressing his men)
                        To avoid detection, we’re taking a  
                        glider in under cover of darkness. 
                        We will release tow ten kilometers 
                        off the Normandy coast and come in 
                        silent. We’ll land in these fields 
                        west of Caen. Word is Rommel’s 
                        getting creative with his air 
                        landing defensives. There are 
                        reports of all sorts of passive 
                        obstacles and intentional flooding. 
                        The low cloud ceiling won’t give us 
                        much time to adjust. 

           Scott motions to the landing area on the map.
                                 CAPT. SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        Once on the ground, we hike in, 
                        establish an O.P. in the woods 
                        outside Caen and wait until dawn. 
                        At 09:00 Jolson and myself will 
                        infiltrate the town, attain the map 
                        from our French contact, and rally 
                        back at the O.P.. We hold there 
                        until nightfall, then hike the 23 
                        kilometers to our extraction point 
                        on the coast.    

           His men listen intently, absorbing the information...

                                 CAPT. SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        An additional factor of note: 
                        Allied bombers will be pounding 
                        specific targets in that very 
                        sector in preparation for the 
                        invasion... 

           Capt. Scott references a specific RECONNAISSANCE 
           PHOTOGRAPH...

                                 CAPT. SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        This is one you all need to be 
                        aware of so no one gets caught in 
                        the wrong place at the wrong 
                        time... 

           CLOSE UP ON PHOTO: Capt. Scott points to an aerial view of a 
           MASSIVE RAILROAD BRIDGE spanning over a river near the 
           coastline.

                                 CAPT. SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        Sixteen German supply trains pass 
                        over this bridge every day. It’s a 
                        lifeline for their coastal 
                        defenses. 

                                 JOLSON
                        It’s very close to our extraction 
                        site, sir...

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                        Correct. Less than a kilometer. 
                        That’s why you need to know about 
                        it. At 06:00 sharp the day after 
                        tomorrow the 354th Fighter Group 
                        are going to level it. That’s an 
                        hour past our pick up window so we 
                        should be long gone by then.
           The men NOD and glance at each other absorbing the 
           information.

                                 CAPT. SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        You’ve got ten hours to sleep, eat, 
                        and gear up. Glider lifts off at 
                        23:00. 

           The General interjects.

                                 GENERAL LANCASTER
                        Men, the success of this operation 
                        is absolutely critical to our boys 
                        on the beaches. We’re talking about 
                        saving the lives of thousands of 
                        Allied troops. Men just like you. 
                        So you think about them when you’re 
                        over there. They’re depending on 
                        you. Hell, you think about lives of 
                        every poor fucking soul in Poland 
                        and France and Holland...you let 
                        the lives of those millions drive 
                        you. Because make no mistake, this 
                        war is going to go one of two ways, 
                        and the flag that remains 
                        determines the future of this god-
                        given world. 

           EXT. ENCAMPMENT BASEBALL DIAMOND - MOMENTS LATER 

           From a distance, Capt. Scott watches HIS MEN blow off steam 
           in a scrimmage baseball game on a MAKESHIFT DIAMOND. 

           The young men laugh in the overcast morning light.

           DeRosa CRACKS A HIT into the infield and the men SCRAMBLE TO 
           MAKE THE PLAY. 

           Standing on first-base, Jolson notices Captain Scott watching 
           and turns and SALUTES...

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                             (to Jolson)
                        At ease...

           Jolson calls out to the Captain...

                                 JOLSON
                        Cap? You wanna’ play?

           Captain Scott shakes his head as he takes a quick head count 
           of his men...
                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                             (to Jolson)
                        Where’s Leigh?

           Jolson motions to an OVERGROWN FIELD in the distance...

                                 JOLSON
                        You know him Cap, he’s wandering 
                        around somewhere...

           Scott NODS.

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                             (to all his men)
                        Wrap this up. Get some shut-eye 
                        before we roll. 

                                 SCOTT’S MEN 
                             (in unison)
                        Sir. Yes, sir.

           EXT. LAVENDER FIELD - SOUTHWICK PROPERTY - MOMENTS LATER

           Five hundred yards away from the Allied Headquarters, Capt. 
           Scott approaches the youngest member of his unit, Leigh, 
           standing alone in the middle of an overgrown LAVENDER FIELD.

           As if in a trance, Leigh stares out into the vast expanse of 
           small purple flowers. 

           Leigh turns and sees the Captain approaching and SALUTES.

                                 LEIGH
                        Hello, sir. I didn’t see you 
                        there...

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                        What are you doing out here, Leigh?

           Leigh looks out at the field of flowers. 

           Early summer HONEY BEES buzz from blossom to blossom. 

           The field is full of life.

                                 LEIGH
                        Well, sir...

           Leigh pauses, nervously running his hand across the tops of 
           the flowers.
                                 LEIGH (CONT’D)
                        We’re going in tonight, for real, 
                        right?

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                        Yes, we are.

           Leigh pauses...

                                 LEIGH
                        How come nobody else seems scared? 

           ENGLISH SPARROWS dart through the humid June air.

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                        They’re all scared, Leigh. That’s 
                        why they’re playing ball. All 
                        together. And that’s exactly where 
                        you should be. 

           Leigh nods.

                                 LEIGH
                        Sir, I never killed nobody before. 
                        What...what if it’s not in me? 

           Captain Scott looks at the young man.

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                        It’s in you. It’s in everyone. 
                        Whether you like it or not. 
                        Now go catch up with your unit. 
                        That’s an order.

                                 LEIGH
                        Yes, sir.

           Leigh SALUTES and Scott dismisses him.

           As Leigh walks away Capt. Scott calls after him...

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                        Leigh...

           Leigh turns back to the Captain.

                                 LEIGH
                        Yes, sir?

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                             (re: the letter)
                        It’s not a Dear John letter. 
                                 LEIGH
                        It’s not? 

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                        No. She’s just afraid you’ll forget 
                        about her.

           Leigh smiles.

                                 LEIGH
                        Thank you, sir.

           Leigh turns and hustles back toward his unit playing 
           baseball.

           Alone, the air carries the scent of lavender as Capt. Scott 
           stares out at the vast field of purple flowers.

           INT. GENERAL LANCASTER’S QUARTERS - MOMENTS LATER

           Capt. Scott is lead into General Lancaster’s private quarters 
           by CHIEF WARRANT OFFICER BARTHOLOMEW, a thin man in his 30’s.

           Capt. Scott SALUTES the General who sits at his desk eating 
           lunch.

           The General rises...

                                 GENERAL LANCASTER
                        At ease, Captain.

           The General glances at C.W.O. Bartholomew.

                                 GENERAL LANCASTER (CONT’D)
                             (to Bartholomew)
                        Shut that door on your way out.

           Bartholomew exits, closing the door behind him.

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                        You wanted to see me, sir?

                                 GENERAL LANCASTER
                        Coffee? 

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                        I’m fine, sir. Thank you.

           The General sits down on the edge of desk and looks at Capt. 
           Scott.
                                 GENERAL LANCASTER
                        There is another element to your 
                        mission I didn’t disclose to your 
                        men.

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                        Another element, sir?

                                 GENERAL LANCASTER
                        We believe there could be an 
                        infiltrator within the French 
                        intelligence group in Caen. Someone 
                        working their way in. It would 
                        explain the loss of the Radio 
                        Operator, among other things.

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                        I see, sir.

                                 GENERAL LANCASTER
                        That map is extremely important to 
                        the success of Overlord. We cannot 
                        afford under any circumstances to 
                        allow the Germans to get that 
                        intelligence. 

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                        Yes, sir.

           Lancaster looks Capt. Scott in the eyes.

                                 GENERAL LANCASTER
                        For that reason, once you have 
                        acquired the map, you are to 
                        personally neutralize any potential 
                        intelligence leaks that could 
                        compromise the invasion. Without 
                        bias. 

           Scott pauses...

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                        Without bias? Does that include the 
                        French Operatives who gathered the 
                        intelligence for us?

                                 GENERAL LANCASTER
                        It does. There’s simply too much 
                        riding on this. We need you to 
                        clean the house. Do you understand?

           There is a silent beat as Capt. Scott absorbs the gravity of 
           the order...
                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                        I understand. Is there anything 
                        else?

                                 GENERAL LANCASTER
                        No. You’re dismissed.

           Capt. Scott salutes Lancaster.

           As Capt. Scott turns for the door Lancaster calls after him.

                                 GENERAL LANCASTER (CONT’D)
                        Captain?

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                        Yes, sir...

                                 GENERAL LANCASTER
                        Is your head right on this?

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                        Yes, sir.

                                 GENERAL LANCASTER
                        Good. Because your boys are going 
                        to need you over there.

           EXT. SIDE STREET - CAEN, OCCUPIED NORMANDY - SAME MOMENT

           LOW ANGLE ON: BICYCLE TIRES rattling over centuries old 
           cobblestone pavers as young Jasper, wearing his cap, pedals 
           through the narrow streets of Caen...

                                                          CROSS CUT TO:

           EXT. STREET CAFE - SAME MOMENT

           Rain puddles reflect the drifting clouds in front of a French 
           street cafe.

           NAZI SS WAFFEN OFFICER KARL METZGER (30’s) wearing a BLACK SS 
           UNIFORM sits with his legs crossed, drinking espresso and 
           reading the paper at an outdoor cafe table.

           Sitting at the next table near Metzger is regular German Army 
           Commander Bushnell.

                                                           CUT BACK TO:
           EXT. CAEN STREET - INTERSECTION - SECONDS LATER

           As Jasper rides into a traffic circle, he VEERS his bicycle 
           suddenly to avoid a massive 65 TON GERMAN TIGER TANK RUMBLING 
           THROUGH THE INTERSECTION. 

           As he turns the handle bars to correct, Jasper’s front bike 
           tire accidentally HITS A PUDDLE, SPLASHING SETTLED RAIN WATER 
           IN THE GENERAL DIRECTION OF METZGER, catching his attention.

           Metzger YELLS OUT at Jasper.

                                 METZGER
                             (in German, subtitled)
                        Boy! Stop! Stop I said!

           Hearing the FIERCE VOICE but not understanding the language, 
           Jasper looks over his shoulder as he rides, seeing... 

           Metzger STANDING AND YELLING from the cafe table.

           At first instinct, JASPER PEDALS HARDER, PICKING UP SPEED...

           But in the street ahead TWO GERMAN SOLDIERS SHOULDER THEIR 
           RIFLES in response to the SS Officers orders...

           With no clear escape, Jasper HITS HIS BRAKES.

           The little boy dismounts his bicycle and walks it back to the 
           cafe where Metzger stands waiting.

           Jasper removes his cap and tries to straighten his hair in 
           fearful respect.

                                 METZGER (CONT’D)
                             (in German, subtitled)
                        Where are you going in such a 
                        hurry, boy?

           Jasper SHAKES HIS HEAD and looks down at the ground.

           METZGER VIOLENTLY SEIZES JASPER’S FACE IN HIS HAND AND FORCES 
           THE LITTLE BOY TO LOOK IN HIS EYES.

                                 METZGER (CONT’D)
                             (in German, subtitled)
                        Look at me when I speak to you.

           At the nearby table, Bushnell glances up from his cigarette, 
           watching the exchange between Metzger and the boy.
                                 METZGER (CONT’D)
                             (in German, subtitled)
                        Do you know what I heard as you 
                        passed me by so rudely?

           Jasper tries to remain calm as Metzger grips his young face..

           The TWO GERMAN SOLDIERS flank the boy on either side.

                                 JASPER
                             (in French, subtitled)
                        I don’t understand...

           Metzger TOUCHES HIS EAR WITH HIS FREE HAND AND MAKES A 
           SOUND...

                                 METZGER
                        Ca-chink...ca-chink...ca-chink...

           Jasper is terrified.

                                 METZGER (CONT’D)
                             (in German, subtitled)
                        Money. 

           Metzger lets go of Jasper’s face and TAPS THE SIDES OF 
           JASPER’S TROUSERS with his silver SS ”DEATH’S DEAD” 
           (TOTENKOPFRING) RING.

           The COINS inside Jasper’s pockets JINGLE.

                                 METZGER (CONT’D)
                             (to the Soldiers)
                        Search him.

           The SOLDIERS search Jasper.

           They empty the contents of his pockets out onto a cafe table: 
           TWO FISTFULS OF COINS, HALF OF A PEPPERMINT STICK, and a 
           LARGE BIRD’S NEST OF MULTICOLORED SEWING THREAD. 

           Metzger looks at items the items, then back at Jasper.

                                 METZGER (CONT’D)
                             (to Jasper, in German)
                        Where did you get the money?

           Jasper SHAKES HIS HEAD...

                                 JASPER
                             (in French, subtitled)
                        I’m sorry, sir. I don’t 
                        understand...
           Metzger’s face grows flush with anger. 

           At the other cafe table, Bushnell WATCHES SILENTLY AS 
           METZGER’S RIGHT HAND SLIDES TO HIS WALTHER P-38 SIDEARM AND 
           UN-CLIPS THE HOLSTER FLAP...  

           Suddenly Bushnell INTERJECTS, SPEAKING TO JASPER IN FRENCH...

                                 BUSHNELL
                             (to Jasper, in French)
                        Boy, where did you get the money?

           Metzger SHOOTS BUSHNELL A LOOK, CLEARLY ANGRY AT BEING 
           INTERRUPTED, BUT HE IS OUTRANKED BY COMMANDER BUSHNELL...

                                 JASPER
                             (to Bushnell in French)
                        I sell cigarettes and candy from my 
                        father’s store...to your soldiers. 

           Metzger stares at Bushnell. THERE IS AN ACUTELY PALPABLE 
           TENSION BETWEEN THE TWO MEN, COMMON BETWEEN OFFICERS IN 
           HIMMLER’S SS AND THE REGULAR GERMAN ARMY.

                                 BUSHNELL
                             (to Metzger, in German)
                        He’s a delivery boy. Why don’t you 
                        save the bullet for someone who 
                        might shoot back.

           INT. TOBACCO SHOP - DAY

           A small, family run tobacco shop on a cobblestone backstreet. 

           Among the memorabilia on the walls is an old black and white 
           PHOTOGRAPH of an OLDER COUPLE kissing outside the shop in the 
           late 1920’s. 

           There are no customers as Jasper’s worried father ALAIN (40) 
           wipes his hands on his clerk’s apron as his sister VIVIENNE 
           (29) sweeps the shop floor. 

           Vivienne is a remarkably beautiful young woman who once had a 
           radiant grin and infectious wit that could illuminate the 
           dullest of rooms...

           But the killing of her and Alain’s parents (the couple in the 
           photograph) during the Battle of France, and the years of 
           occupation since, have stolen her youthful lust for life.

           Edgy and anxious, Alain steps out from the counter and paces. 
                                 ALAIN
                        I want you to leave tonight and 
                        join the others at the Abbey. 

           Vivienne nods.

                                 VIVIENNE
                        Alright.

           Alain’s voice is stern...

                                 ALAIN
                        They’re growing restless. You need 
                        to keep them focused. Do you 
                        understand that?

           Vivienne looks at him, not liking his tone.

                                 VIVIENNE
                        Yes. Of course I understand. You’re 
                        my brother, Alain, not my employer. 
                        Don’t speak to me that way. 

           Alain looks at Vivienne for a moment, then gives her an 
           APOLOGETIC NOD and nervously runs his hand through his hair.

                                 ALAIN
                        He should be back by now.

           Vivienne leans the broom against the wall.

                                 VIVIENNE
                        He’s been late before.

                                 ALAIN
                        Not like this. 

                                 VIVIENNE
                        He’s smart...

                                 ALAIN
                        He’s not as smart as he thinks he 
                        is. I’ve told him a dozen times to 
                        come straight home and not mess 
                        around...

           There is a silent beat, then Vivienne walks across the room 
           and reaches out, squeezing her older brother’s hand.

           EXT. TOBACCO SHOP - SAME MOMENT

           His heart gripped with fear, Jasper races his bicycle as fast 
           as he can down the back streets...
           INT. TOBACCO SHOP - SECONDS LATER

           As Jasper rushes through the door, Alain yells, his voice 
           full of parental fear, but coming across as anger...

                                 ALAIN
                        Jasper! Where have you been?

           Jasper closes the shop door behind him and SLIDES TO THE 
           FLOOR, HOLDING HIS KNEES TO HIS CHEST.

           Safe for the moment, Jasper exhales in silence...

           Alain and Vivienne rush to him.

                                 ALAIN (CONT’D)
                        What is it?

           Jasper doesn’t answer.

           Alain and Vivienne look at each other as she strokes her 
           nephew’s head.

                                 ALAIN (CONT’D)
                        What happened, son?

           Jasper slowly shakes his head as he stoically forces the raw 
           fear from his young mind...

                                 JASPER
                        Nothing, Papa. I’m fine. I’m sorry 
                        I was late...

           The little boy REACHES IN HIS POCKET AND PULLS OUT THE 
           TANGLED BALL OF SEWING THREAD. 

           JASPER PUSHES THE THREAD INTO HIS FATHER’S HAND. Alain looks 
           at his son with an expression conveying both paternal pride 
           and guilt.

           INT. STORAGE ROOM - TOBACCO SHOP - MOMENTS LATER

           A storage room in the rear of the shop, stacked high with 
           loose tobacco bins and a work table.

           Jasper watches his father and aunt as they UNTANGLE AND 
           SEPARATE THE DIFFERENT COLORED BALLS OF THREAD.

           Using a defined measuring system, Alain TIES an end of a 
           thread section to one of TWO PEGS ON THE WALL. 
           He winds the thread back and fourth between the pegs, 
           meticulously counting each time, measuring the length of the 
           thread.  

           On paper, Vivienne takes the thread measurement and plugs it 
           into a mathematical RATIO EQUATION, CORRELATING THE 
           CIRCUMFERENCE OF THE BICYCLE TIRE TO THE CIRCUMFERENCE OF THE 
           AXLE PIN. 

           The solution of that equation is an ACTUAL DISTANCE.

           Alain retrieves a hidden TOPOGRAPHICAL MAP of the Normandy 
           coastline buried deep inside a BIN OF LOOSE TOBACCO.

           CLOSE UP ON MAP:  Punctuating the map are HAND DRAWN, COLOR-
           CODED NOTATIONS REVEALING THE POSITIONS OF GERMAN WEAPON 
           BATTERIES dotting the landscape.

           Using a SCALE RULER, Alain carefully triangulates the 
           position of the Naval gun battery Jasper visited that morning 
           and carefully DRAWS IT ON THE MAP and...

           WE REALIZE THAT JASPER, USING THIS THREAD SYSTEM AND DELIVERY 
           ROUTE, HAS BEEN COLLECTING GERMAN WEAPON LOCATION AND 
           DISTANCE INFORMATION FOR THE FRENCH RESISTANCE.

           EXT. BUNK TENT - ALLIED OPERATIONS, PORTSMOUTH  - DUSK

           Capt. Scott stands in FULL PARATROOPER JUMP GEAR.

           He stares into the BLOOD-RED SUN as it sets on the southern 
           English landscape. 

           The beautiful, fleeting light casts Scott’s face in a 
           haunting, almost unearthly glow.

           Purple-black storm clouds build on the western horizon, 
           blowing in off the Atlantic.

           Capt. Scott eyes the clouds, then turns, heading toward the 
           bunk tent...

           INT. BUNK TENT - SAME MOMENT

           The interior of the tent is a flurry of focused activity as 
           Scott’s men methodically inventory their WEAPONS, AMMUNITION, 
           AND JUMP GEAR, preparing for the impending mission.

           As Capt. Scott enters the tent his men pause their activity 
           and immediately STAND AT ATTENTION.
                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                             (to all)
                        At ease.

           His men listen. 

                                 CAPT. SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        We’ve got weather coming in. I 
                        spoke with General Lancaster. We’re 
                        moving the jump window up to 21:00.

           The men look at each other, registering the information.

                                 WOODS
                        Sir, given the timetable change, 
                        won’t that leave us more vulnerable 
                        to detection?

           Capt. Scott NODS.

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                        It’s the only way we get in before 
                        the storm grounds us. 

           EXT. ALLIED AIRFIELD - 21:00 HOURS

           The wind has increased and rain clouds build, shrouding the 
           moon in the night sky.

           On the tarmac of an ALLIED AIRFIELD, the propellers of a C-47 
           TRANSPORT PLANE SPIN as GROUND CREW TECHNICIANS safety 
           inspect the inch-thick, flexible NYLON TOW CABLE connecting 
           the C-47 tow plane to...

           A WACO CG-4 GLIDER positioned behind the C-47 on the runway. 

           Constructed primarily of military-grade canvas and plywood 
           framing, the lightweight, 48-foot glider is an ENGINE-LESS 
           AIRCRAFT, designed for silent approach and undetected troop 
           and cargo insertion.  

           IN FULL PARATROOPER JUMP GEAR, WEAPONS, and BACK-UP 
           PARACHUTES, Capt. Scott and his seven man unit shoulder an 
           additional 150 pounds each across the tarmac toward the 
           glider...

           EXT. RUNWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           As rain begins to fall, the C-47 transport plane takes flight 
           from the end of the runway, towing the glider behind it into 
           the dark sky...
           EXT. ABOVE THE ENGLISH CHANNEL - LATER

           Lightning flickers in the distance as rain falls harder.

           The C-47 flies low through heavy cloud cover over the English 
           Channel, towing the glider 350 feet behind it...

           INT. GLIDER - SAME MOMENT

           The interior of the glider is lit by RED FILTER JUMP LIGHTS.

           Capt. Scott and his men sit in rows in their heavy jump gear. 

           They are barely able to hear over the DEAFENING DRONE of the 
           multiple 1200 horsepower C-47 engines ahead of them.

           Under the red light, Capt. Scott glances at the young faces 
           of his men. It’s clear by their controlled breathing and 
           hyper-focused stares that they are anxious.

           The GLIDER PILOT, (late 30’s) YELLS over his shoulder from 
           the cockpit to the Captain and his men...

                                 GLIDER PILOT
                             (yelling)
                        Tow release in ten seconds!

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. ABOVE THE ENGLISH CHANNEL - SECONDS LATER

           Nearing the Normandy coastline, the long nylon tow rope 
           RELEASES FROM THE NOSE OF THE GLIDER.

           The C-47 transport plane banks up and veers away, 
           disappearing onto the clouds as it returns to England...

                                                           CUT BACK TO:

           INT. GLIDER - SAME MOMENT

           Inside the glider, the sound of C-47 engines fade into the 
           distance...

           And what was overwhelmingly loud, now falls into SUDDEN 
           ETHEREAL SILENCE. 

           The only thing audible is the wind outside on the wings of 
           the aircraft...

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. GLIDER - MOMENTS LATER

           Without a sound, masked by clouds, the glider cuts through 
           the darkness above the Normandy coastline and soars east over 
           occupied territory... 

                                                           CUT BACK TO:

           INT. GLIDER - SECONDS LATER

           The interior of the glider remains silent.

           The Pilot leans over his shoulder...

                                 GLIDER PILOT
                             (to Scott)
                        LZ in six minutes...

           Capt. Scott makes a silent HAND SIGNAL to his men...

           And they all, like clockwork, begin to LOCK AND LOAD their 
           WEAPONS.

           Capt. Scott slides a FULLY LOADED MAGAZINE into his THOMPSON 
           SUB-MACHINE GUN, racks the action, and checks the safety.

           Then each man checks his SEAT RESTRAINTS in preparation for a 
           hard landing.

           Leigh, at the rear of the glider, CANNOT GET HIS SEAT 
           RESTRAINT TO PROPERLY LOCK. 

           From the front of the glider, Capt. Scott NOTICES HIM 
           STRUGGLING.

           LEIGH TRIES IT AGAIN, TRYING TO FORCE THE HARNESS CLIP, BUT 
           IT DOESN’T LOCK INTO PLACE...

           Capt. Scott stows his weapon, unlocks his own seat restraint, 
           and makes his way between the row of men to the rear of the 
           glider...

           Leigh looks up from his seat as his Captain approaches...

                                 LEIGH
                        I’m sorry, sir. I can’t get this 
                        damn thing to...

           SUDDENLY THERE IS A MUFFLED THUMPING SOUND...

           THEN A SUDDEN BURST OF LIGHT...
           AND EVERYTHING COMES APART...

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           EXT. GLIDER - SAME MOMENT

           AT 800 FEET ABOVE THE FRENCH COUNTRYSIDE, THE GLIDER IS 
           LITERALLY CUT IN HALF BY A GERMAN ANTI-AIRCRAFT SHELL...

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. GLIDER - CONTINUOUS

           UNRESTRAINED AND STUNNED BY THE SHELL CONCUSSION, CAPT. SCOTT 
           IS VIOLENTLY SUCKED OUT OF THE SHREDDED FUSELAGE INTO THE 
           NIGHT SKY... 

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           EXT. MID AIR - CONTINUOUS

           CAPT. SCOTT’S P.O.V.: FOR A SPLIT SECOND, AS IF IN SLOW 
           MOTION, CAPT. SCOTT SEES HIS MEN’S FACES GROWING SMALLER, 
           FURTHER AWAY, DESCENDING INSIDE THE BURNING GLIDER AS IT 
           BREAKS APART, PITCHES HARD, AND DIVES TOWARD THE EARTH 
           BELOW...

           THEN EVERYTHING ACCELERATES INTO A BLINDING BLUR AS SCOTT’S 
           BODY IS SEIZED IN A UNCONTROLLABLE SPIN, PLUMMETING TOWARD 
           THE EARTH. 

           SCOTT TRIES TO MAINTAIN HIS FOCUS, BUT CANNOT FIND THE 
           HORIZON. 

           HE FLATTENS HIS BODY TRYING TO SLOW HIS DESCENT AND CLAWS AT 
           HIS CHEST, TRYING TO LOCATE HIS PARACHUTE D-RING... 

           THE EARTH RUSHES TOWARD HIM.

           AT THE LAST POSSIBLE MOMENT, SCOTT GRIPS THE D-RING AND PULLS 
           THE RIP-CORD.

           AT AN ALTITUDE OF ONLY 150 FEET, CAPT. SCOTT’S PARACHUTE 
           DEPLOYS. 

           HIS BODY IS JERKED UPWARD AND RIGHTED. 

           HIS DESCENT IS SLOWED, BUT HE’S STILL TOO LOW TO BE FALLING 
           SO FAST...

           100 FEET...
           HIS MIND RACING, HE LOOKS DOWN, TRYING TO SURVEY HIS LANDING 
           ZONE.

           THE LANDSCAPE BELOW IS COMPLETELY SHROUDED IN GROUND 
           FOG...HE’S COMING IN BLIND.

           50 FEET...

           Suddenly he is enveloped in ghostly white fog. 

           He can smell the Earth but can’t see anything...

           He grits his teeth and braces for impact, expecting his legs 
           or spine to be broken...

           BUT INSTEAD HE HITS WATER...

                                                           HARD CUT TO:

           EXT. UNDERWATER - FLOODED HAY FIELD - CONTINUOUS 

           CAPT. SCOTT SINKS INTO THE SIX FOOT DEEP STANDING WATER OF AN 
           INTENTIONALLY FLOODED HAY FIELD...

           SUBMERGED, THE 130 POUNDS OF JUMP GEAR WEIGHS HIS BODY DOWN 
           LIKE AN ANCHOR. HE CAN’T STAND UPRIGHT...

           HIS PARACHUTE DESCENDS INTO THE WATER AROUND HIM, TANGLING 
           HIS THRASHING BODY IN WET FABRIC AND PARACHUTE CORDS.

           HE CAN’T BREATHE...

           CAPT. SCOTT, DESPERATELY RIPS HIS JUMP KNIFE FROM HIS BOOT 
           AND SLASHES OUT, CUTTING FREE HIS EQUIPMENT AND PARACHUTE, 
           FIGHTING FOR HIS LIFE...

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. WATER SURFACE - FLOODED HAY FIELD - SECONDS LATER

           Seconds later, Capt. Scott bursts through the surface water 
           of the flooded field.

           His chin just above the waterline, he gasps for air, trying 
           to catch his breath...

           He looks around trying to take in his surroundings...

           Out in the fog, Capt. Scott makes out the FLICKERING ORANGE 
           GLOW OF FLAMES...
           Slogging though the flooded field, Capt. Scott rushes toward 
           the distant light of the fire...

           EXT. GLIDER CRASH SITE - MOMENTS LATER

           Droplets of rain hit the surface of the neck high water as 
           Capt. Scott rushes toward the crash site.

           As he nears he sees a BURNING GLIDER WING JUTTING AT A SEVERE 
           ANGLE UPWARD INTO THE FOG.

           THE REMAINS OF THE GLIDER FUSELAGE IS ALMOST COMPLETELY 
           SUBMERGED.

           Scott rushes forward, TRIPPING ON SOMETHING AT HIS FEET 
           BENEATH THE SURFACE... 

           He looks down into the water...then GASPS, seeing LEIGH’S 
           LIFELESS BODY, EYES OPEN STARING UPWARD, STILL IN HIS HEAVY 
           JUMP GEAR, HIS PARACHUTE NEVER GETTING THE CHANCE TO OPEN.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. SUBMERGED GLIDER FUSELAGE - SECONDS LATER

           Capt. Scott dives beneath the surface. 

           The burning glider wing eerily illuminates the surreal 
           underwater world... 

           Holding his breath, Capt. Scott peers into the remains of the 
           fuselage.

           HIS MEN ARE ALL DEAD. 

           SOME ARE STILL TRAPPED IN THEIR SEAT RESTRAINTS. 

           SOME FLOAT SUSPENDED BENEATH THE WATER, THEIR ARMS SPREAD 
           OPEN AS IF EMBRACING ANGELS ONLY THEY COULD SEE...

           EXT. OAK TREE - WOODS - LATER

           Rain falls in the foggy woods as Capt. Scott sits at the base 
           of an oak tree holding his knees tightly against his chest.

           Now on higher ground, he is filthy and soaked to the bone. 

           His entire body SHAKES from cold and shock.

           His trembling right hand grips his BROWNING .45 HANDGUN.
           As Scott stares blankly into the dark woods, TEARS BEGIN TO 
           WELL IN HIS EYES. 

           He palms the loaded weapon in his hand, touches the muzzle to 
           his forehead, feeling the mortal weight of it.

           His mind floods with darkness...

           Breaking down, he bites into the index knuckle of his right 
           hand, drawing blood, trying to fight off the overwhelming 
           rush of loss. 

           WHEN SUDDENLY HE SEES SOMETHING MOVING THROUGH THE TREES IN 
           THE FOG.

           SCOTT INSTANTLY RISES TO ONE KNEE.

           HIS HEART POUNDING, HE AIMS HIS WEAPON, UNSURE OF THE 
           TARGET...THEN HE SEES IT...

           Twenty feet away, a WHITE DOG walks silently out of the fog. 

           The animal stares at Scott, unafraid.

           Capt. Scott’s heart races as he keeps his weapon raised. 

           There is a moment of silent recognition between the two.

           Then the DOG’S HEAD TURNS SUDDENLY, HEARING A FAINT RUSTLING 
           SOUND IN THE WOODS INAUDIBLE TO SCOTT. 

           In a flash, the DOG DARTS AWAY into the fog.

           Then Scott FREEZES, REALIZING HE IS SURROUNDED...

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           EXT. WOODS NEARBY - SAME MOMENT

           A SQUAD of armed GERMAN SOLDIERS hunt through the foggy woods 
           for crash survivors...

           EXT. OAK TREE - WOODS - CONTINUOUS

           Capt. Scott can see THEIR SILHOUETTES moving through the fog 
           all around him. His mind races...

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. OAK TREE - SECONDS LATER

           A GERMAN SOLDIER pauses beneath the oak tree to urinate...

                                                        SHIFT ANGLE TO:

           EXT. OAK TREE CANOPY - SAME MOMENT

           Eleven feet directly above the German Soldier, Capt. Scott 
           braces himself between two tree limbs.

           Holding his breath, not making a sound, Scott AIMS HIS PISTOL 
           AT THE TOP OF THE MAN’S HEAD.

                                                         SHIFT BACK TO:

           EXT. OAK TREE - SECONDS LATER

           After a moment, the unaware Soldier zips up his trousers, 
           shoulders his rifle, and continues on into the fog.

           EXT. OAK TREE - A MOMENT LATER

           Scott eases off the trigger and climbs down from the tree.

           He takes a compass reading, then heads toward the treeline, 
           putting distance between himself and the Soldiers...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BUSHNELL’S RESIDENCE - HOTEL CABOURG - MOMENTS LATER

           In his undershirt, Bushnell sits alone at an ornate WRITING 
           DESK in his hotel suite.

           With a GLASS OF SCOTCH and a burning CIGARETTE, he writes a 
           letter home to his daughter...

           CLOSE UP ON LETTER: AS HE WRITES IN GERMAN...

                                 BUSHNELL (V.O.)
                             (in German, subtitled)
                        To my dearest daughter Ida, I am so 
                        sorry I will not be able to be with 
                        you on your birthday this year. I 
                        know that ten will be a wonderful 
                        age for you. You will do many new 
                        exciting things. And there will be 
                        changes as well. Some of them will 
                        be difficult...
           Bushnell pauses. He drinks deeply from his scotch, trying to 
           articulate his thought, then continues writing...

                                 BUSHNELL (V.O.)
                        And that will not all be easy to 
                        understand. Someday, when you are 
                        older, and this war is over, I will 
                        try to explain, but for now, please 
                        know how very much I love...

           Suddenly there is a KNOCK AT THE SUITE DOOR interrupting 
           Bushnell’s thoughts.

           Bushnell glances at his watch, registering the late hour, 
           then sets down his pen...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. HALLWAY - HOTEL CABOURG - MOMENTS LATER

           A GERMAN STAFF OFFICER stands outside the hotel suite door in 
           the richly decorated, red carpeted hallway.

           A moment later, the door opens and Bushnell steps out, now in 
           uniform. He is all business.

           The Staff Officer SALUTES HIM.

                                 STAFF OFFICER
                        Heil Hitler.

           Bushnell returns the salute.

                                 BUSHNELL
                        Heil Hitler.

                                 STAFF OFFICER
                        I’m sorry to disturb you at such a 
                        late hour, sir...

                                 BUSHNELL
                        What is it?

                                 STAFF OFFICER
                        We’ve shot down an American glider, 
                        sir. Twenty-five kilometers west of 
                        Caen...

                                 BUSHNELL
                        A single glider?
                                 STAFF OFFICER
                        Yes, sir. Thirteen casualties at 
                        present count.

                                 BUSHNELL
                        Survivors?

                                 STAFF OFFICER
                        Possibly. One of our units found a 
                        single parachute some distance from 
                        the crash site. The harness had 
                        been cut free.

           Bushnell pauses, absorbing the information.

                                 BUSHNELL
                        Show me on a map.

           EXT. HILLSIDE - SAME MOMENT

           In the wet darkness, Capt. Scott kneels in the grass at the 
           top of a hillside.

           He pulls his jump jacket over his head, creating a tent to 
           block out light-leaks, then strikes a PARATROOPER’S CIGARETTE 
           LIGHTER.

           In the orange flame light, Scott locates his position on a 
           small LAMINATED MAP and takes a reading on his COMPASS. 

                                                               FADE TO:

           EXT. NORMANDY LANDSCAPE - DAWN

           The first grey light of dawn rises on the wet rural 
           landscape. 

           EXT. RAILROAD YARD - OUTSKIRTS OF CAEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Dense woods back up to a RAIL YARD on the outskirts of Caen.

           A murder of CROWS fill the canopies of the dark wet trees.

           Concealed at the edge of the woods, Capt. Scott looks down on 
           the quiet rail yard and the small TRAIN DEPOT beyond.

           A hundred yards away, a single GERMAN SENTRY walks back and 
           forth guarding the empty train platform.
           Armed with only his Pistol and his jump-knife, Scott 
           patiently scans the area for other movement, but the only 
           personnel he sees is the lone Sentry.

           Slowly, Scott begins making his way down from the treeline...

           EXT. RAIL YARD - SECONDS LATER

           Avoiding the Sentry’s sight line, Scott quietly makes his way 
           through the rail yard using a LONG ROW OF DORMANT BOXCARS for 
           cover.

           As he passes the boxcars he is struck with A HORRIFIC SMELL. 

           Keeping an eye on the Sentry, Scott GLANCES INSIDE ONE OF THE 
           MANY OPEN BOXCARS... 

                                                          QUICK CUT TO:

           INT. BOXCAR - CONTINUOUS

           SCOTT’S P.O.V. INTO THE BOXCAR: Ten-inch air-holes have been 
           rough cut into the sides with barbed wire stretched over the 
           openings.

           THE FILTHY FLOOR IS STAINED WITH DRIED BLOOD AND FECES. 

           THE INTERIOR WOODEN WALLS SURROUNDING THE WINDOWS AND DOOR, 
           ARE SCRAPED AND RAGGED, AS THOUGH THEY HAVE BEEN CLAWED AT BY 
           COUNTLESS SMALL HANDS. 

           A wave of suffocating dread floods Capt. Scott’s 
           expression...

           EXT. RAIL YARD - SECONDS LATER

           With his .45 drawn, Scott moves discreetly, stepping over 
           rows of steel tracks. 

           He approaches the train platform from the German Sentry’s 
           blind side...

           EXT. TRAIN PLATFORM - SECONDS LATER

           Scott advances quickly along a brick wall. 

           He reaches the end of the wall and peers around the corner. 
           From his vantage point he can see into the TRAIN DEPOT 
           itself, where TWO ADDITIONAL GERMAN SOLDIERS have ducked out 
           of the rain and are preoccupied drinking coffee.

           Scott holsters his .45 and draws the KNIFE from his boot.

           Scott’s heart pounds as he calculates the ten meters of open 
           platform before the Sentry’s position... 

           Scott palms the knife grip, exhales for an instant trying to 
           remain calm, and then ADVANCES ON HIM...

           Scott crosses the open concrete platform quickly...

           As he nears, the Sentry hears something and turns...

           Capt. Scott sees his face. The young German soldier is barely 
           seventeen.  

           He looks at Scott with a curious, almost friendly look, NOT 
           UNDERSTANDING WHAT IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN...

           IN TWO FIERCE MOTIONS, SCOTT DRIVES HIS KNIFE INTO THE 
           SENTRY’S NECK, TURNS THE BLADE INSIDE THE WOUND, AND CUTS A 
           DIAGONAL LINE THROUGH THE YOUNG MAN’S VOICE BOX, 
           EXTINGUISHING ANY SOUND HE MIGHT HAVE MADE.

           THE SOLDIER’S EYES REGISTER FEAR AS HIS PANICKED HANDS FUMBLE 
           FOR HIS RIFLE, BUT CAPT. SCOTT SEIZES HIM, GRIPPING HIS BODY 
           IN A FIERCE EMBRACE UNTIL THE YOUNG MAN’S LIFE SLIPS FROM 
           HIM...

           Scott glances back at the train depot...

           The other Soldiers continue drinking their coffee, having not 
           heard a thing...

           INT. BOXCAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Hidden inside one of the nightmarish boxcars, Capt. Scott’s 
           hands tremble from adrenaline as he strips off the young 
           Sentry’s clothes.

           Capt. Scott drags the dead naked body into a corner, then 
           inspects the Sentry’s uniform. 

           One side of the Sentry’s COAT COLLAR is stained with blood. 

           With his jump knife, Capt. Scott carefully cuts away the 
           stained collar material away, then cuts the other side of the 
           collar to make it look symmetrical. 

           He begins putting on the German uniform over his own...
           EXT. STREET - CAEN - AN HOUR LATER

           Dressed in the German Uniform, Scott walks down a busy 
           morning street in the occupied town of Caen. 

           His eyes drift to the cobblestones as he is passed by a 
           CONVOY OF GERMAN ARMORED VEHICLES and PERSONNEL CARRIERS 
           loaded with GERMAN INFANTRY.

           Scott veers and ducks down a quiet side street... 

           INT. TOBACCO SHOP - MOMENTS LATER

           A door bell RINGS as Capt. Scott steps through the door into 
           the empty tobacco shop. 

           Capt. Scott glances around the quiet shop. There is no one 
           behind the counter.

           As Scott steps forward toward the counter he hears A VOICE 
           call out...

                                 ALAIN (O.S.)
                        Bonjour.

           Capt. Scott turns and sees Alain enter wearing a clerk’s 
           apron from a back hallway. He is carrying a large stack of 
           BURLAP TOBACCO SACKS.

           Alain eyes the man standing the German sentry's uniform...

                                 ALAIN (CONT’D)
                        Guten Tag.

           Scott doesn’t answer.

                                 ALAIN (CONT’D)
                        Zigaretten?

           It’s clear Capt. Scott’s silence is making Alain nervous.

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                             (in German)
                        I’ve come to buy an applewood pipe.

           Alain looks at Capt. Scott...

                                 ALAIN
                             (in English)
                        You are the American?

           Capt. Scott NODS.
           Alain removes a HIDDEN STEN SUBMACHINE GUN FROM BENEATH THE 
           BURLAP SACKS HE’S BEEN AIMING AT SCOTT AND STOWS IT BENEATH 
           THE SHOP COUNTER.

           Alain extends his hand.

                                 ALAIN (CONT’D)
                        My name is Alain.

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                        Captain Lowry Scott, 82nd Airborne, 
                        Special Operations Unit. 

           As Alain shakes his hand he steps out from the counter, LOCKS 
           THE SHOP DOOR, AND TURNS THE SIGN OVER TO ‘CLOSED’. 

                                 ALAIN
                        Follow me.

           INT. STORAGE ROOM - BACK OF TOBACCO SHOP - SECONDS LATER

           The same windowless storeroom we saw earlier.

           From inside a storage bin of tobacco, Alain pulls the 
           INTELLIGENCE MAP, detailing the hidden German defenses.

           Alain sits down at his desk.

           Capt. Scott looks over Alain’s shoulder as he unrolls the 
           map.

           CLOSE ON INTELLIGENCE MAP: Capt. Scott stares at the wealth 
           of information.

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                        It’s not encrypted.

           Alain shakes his head.

                                 ALAIN
                        They pulled our encryptor from her 
                        home last week. When they were done 
                        with her, they tied her naked body 
                        on the front of a Panzer and drove 
                        her through the streets. 

           Scott absorbs the story, then looks back at the meticulously 
           rendered map...

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                             (re: the map)
                        This details the defenses in these 
                        specific five beachheads only. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 CAPT. SCOTT (CONT'D)
                        You realize if the Germans find 
                        this, they’ll be able to deduce the 
                        exact location of the Allied 
                        landing...

                                 ALAIN
                        Yes. So don’t let them find it. 

           Alain begins to fold the map...

                                 ALAIN (CONT’D)
                        I was concerned you weren’t 
                        coming...

           As Alain speaks we SHIFT ANGLES TO REVEAL:

           POSITIONED BEHIND HIM, UNSEEN BY ALAIN, CAPT. SCOTT SILENTLY 
           DRAWS HIS JUMP KNIFE FROM THE BACK OF HIS JACKET...

                                 ALAIN (CONT’D)
                        German Soldiers in the shop this 
                        morning talked of an allied 
                        aircraft shot down during the 
                        night...

           SCOTT SILENTLY OPENS THE KNIFE BLADE BEHIND HIS BACK. 

                                 ALAIN (CONT’D)
                        I sent the rest of my people ahead.

           Scott’s HEART RACES as his gaze fixes on a KILL POINT in 
           Alain’s exposed neck... 

           As Alain slides the folded map into a small waterproof 
           sleeve, CAPT. SCOTT REACHES FORWARD TO EXECUTE ALAIN WHEN...

           SUDDENLY A CHILD’S VOICE CRIES OUT FROM THE MAIN INTERIOR OF 
           THE TOBACCO SHOP, SHATTERING THE TENSION...

                                 JASPER
                             (from the shop)
                        PAPA! 

           In a flash, SCOTT HIDES THE KNIFE as Alain looks to the door.

                                 ALAIN
                             (to Capt. Scott)
                        That’s my son...

           Capt. Scott’s expression shifts...

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                        Your son?
                                 ALAIN
                        Wait here... 

           Alain shoves the folded map in his apron pocket and rushes 
           out of the storeroom...

           INT. BACK HALLWAY/TOBACCO SHOP - CONTINUOUS

           Alain hurries down the back hallway toward the front of the 
           shop, calling to Jasper... 

                                 ALAIN
                             (calling out)
                        Jasper?

           As Alain enters the front room he STOPS...

           Standing in the tobacco shop is SS Commander Karl Metzger, 
           (the SS Officer from the cafe), and TWO OTHER SS OFFICERS.

           Metzger GRIPS JASPER FIRMLY BY THE BACK OF HIS SMALL NECK. 

           Alain eyes Metzger, wanting to intercede, but weighing his 
           words carefully...

                                 ALAIN (CONT’D)
                             (to Metzger)
                        Can I help you, commander.

           Metzger looks Alain up and down.

                                 METZGER
                        This is your store, yes?

                                 ALAIN
                        Yes.

                                 METZGER
                        You own it with your 
                        sister...Vivienne? Is that correct?

           Alain nods. It’s clear the SS has done their research.

                                 ALAIN
                        That’s correct.

                                 METZGER
                        And is this your child?

                                 ALAIN
                        Yes. Has he done something?
                                 METZGER
                        I’m afraid he has...

           METZGER KICKS THE BACK OF JASPER’S LEGS, SENDING THE BOY TO 
           THE FLOOR.

           ALAIN, UNABLE TO STOP HIMSELF, INSTINCTIVELY LURCHES FORWARD 
           TO PROTECT HIS SON...

           BUT THE INSTANT ALAIN MOVES THE OTHER TWO SS OFFICERS DRAW 
           THEIR PISTOLS.

           Alain FREEZES in his tracks.

                                 ALAIN
                        Please...he is just a thoughtless 
                        boy. If he has done something, 
                        please let me have an opportunity 
                        to fix it...

           Metzger pauses.

                                 METZGER
                        I don’t think your boy is 
                        thoughtless. On the contrary, I 
                        think your boy’s head is quite full 
                        of thoughts...

                                 ALAIN
                        I’m sorry. I’m not sure I 
                        understand, sir.

           Metzger nods.

                                 METZGER
                        An unusual thing happened 
                        yesterday. Your son rudely rode his 
                        bicycle past me and made a mess of 
                        my boot. 

                                 ALAIN
                        And for that I am genuinely sorry. 

                                 METZGER
                        I’m sure you are. That’s not why 
                        I’ve come. I’ve come because your 
                        son did the strangest thing when he 
                        left the cafe.

           Alain remains silent, unsure of what to say.

                                 METZGER (CONT’D)
                        I had him empty the contents of his 
                        pockets onto the table. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 METZGER (CONT’D)
                        He had some money, which I presume 
                        was yours. He had some candy, which 
                        I imagine is rare for most children 
                        in wartime. And he had some knotted 
                        up balls of sewing thread.

           Alain listens.

                                 METZGER (CONT’D)
                        And do you know what he did? When 
                        he ran off, he left the candy and 
                        money behind.

                                 ALAIN
                        I can only assume he was 
                        frightened, sir. 

           Metzger nods.

                                 METZGER
                        Yes. That would be the logical 
                        conclusion. 

           Metzger forcefully GRIPS the top of Jaspers hair.

                                 METZGER (CONT’D)
                        But you know what he did make a 
                        point to take with him? The thread. 

           Alain’s face grows tight.

                                 METZGER (CONT’D)
                        Now why would he do that? Leave the 
                        money and candy, but take those 
                        worthless balls of colored thread.

                                 ALAIN
                        I don’t know, commander.

                                 METZGER
                        I don’t know either. And that’s why 
                        I’ve come to your shop. I want the 
                        answer...

           Suddenly they hear the sound of APPROACHING BOOT STEPS from 
           the hallway behind Alain.

           Metzger and the two other SS Officers redirect their 
           attention, as Capt. Scott, unarmed in his German Sentry 
           uniform enters the room.

           Metzger looks at Scott’s appearance. 
                                 METZGER (CONT’D)
                        Soldier, what are you doing in 
                        here?

           Without a word, Capt. Scott, holds up TWO FISTFULS OF BALLED 
           UP LOOSE THREAD. 

           He walks slowly behind the shop counter and DROPS THREAD ON 
           THE COUNTER TOP.

           Metzger releases Jasper’s hair and walks over. 

           He looks down at the thread. 

                                 METZGER (CONT’D)
                             (to Scott)
                        Explain yourself...

           SUDDENLY A DEAFENING BURST OF FULLY AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE RIPS 
           THROUGH THE FACE OF THE WOODEN COUNTER, PUNCHING A HALF DOZEN 
           ROUNDS INTO METZGER’S THIGHS AND ABDOMEN. 

           METZGER, BADLY WOUNDED, STAGGERS BACKWARD AND HITS THE FLOOR.

           THE OTHER TWO SS OFFICERS TURN, SWINGING THEIR WEAPONS TO 
           AIM...

           AS SCOTT RAISES ALAIN’S STEN SUBMACHINE GUN ABOVE THE COUNTER 
           AND OPENS FIRE AGAIN IN A VICIOUS BARRAGE... 

           STRIKING A SECOND SS OFFICER IN THE NECK AND HEAD, KILLING 
           HIM INSTANTLY...

           WRITHING ON THE FLOOR, METZGER DRAWS THE PISTOL FROM HIS 
           HOLSTER...

           ALAIN GRABS JASPER, PULLING HIM TOWARD THE HALLWAY TO PROTECT 
           HIM...

           METZGER FIRES.

           HIS BULLET STRIKES ALAIN FROM A LOW ANGLE, TRAVELING UNDER 
           HIS RIBS, SPIRALING UP THROUGH HIS CHEST CAVITY, PUNCTURING 
           BOTH HIS LUNGS.

           STUNNED BY THE BULLET, ALAIN WRAPS JASPER IN HIS ARMS, 
           SHELTERING HIM WITH HIS BODY... 

           CAPT. SCOTT FIRES ANOTHER BRUTAL BURST INTO METZGER, 
           FINISHING HIM.

           THE REMAINING SS OFFICER RUNS FOR THE FRONT DOOR. 
           SCOTT SWINGS THE STEN AND PULLS THE TRIGGER TO FIRE, BUT THE 
           WEAPON’S ACTION CLICKS EMPTY. 

           AS THE SS OFFICER FLEES OUT OF THE TOBACCO SHOP, SCOTT 
           PITCHES THE SUB MACHINE GUN ASIDE AND DRAWS HIS .45 FROM 
           BENEATH HIS JACKET...

           EXT. TOBACCO SHOP - CONTINUOUS 

           SCOTT FALLS OUT INTO THE BACKSTREET AFTER THE FLEEING SS 
           OFFICER. 

           HE TAKES AIM, BUT HE’S TOO LATE. HE CAN’T GET A BEAD ON THE 
           OFFICER BEFORE HE DISAPPEARS AROUND A CORNER.

           Scott pauses, his heart pounding, fighting the tunnel vision, 
           trying to keep his head. 

           He lowers his pistol and looks up and down the street.

           An OLDER FRENCH COUPLE peers down at him from a window above 
           the street.

           A STREET SWEEPER cowers in a doorway.

           Scott knows the gunfire was heard by the entire block...

           INT. TOBACCO SHOP - SECONDS LATER

           Scott hurries back inside the tobacco shop. 

           What was an intimate family store is now a nightmarish 
           display of violence.

           Blood spatters the walls and pools on the floor.

           He glances at the contorted dead bodies of Metzger and the 
           other SS Officer.

           Capt. Scott steps through the empty shell casings into the 
           hallway, where Alain leans against a wall on the floor 
           holding Jasper in his arms.

           Unable to move, Alain wheezes horribly, his lungs filling 
           with fluid.   

           CAPT. SCOTT KNEELS AND RETRIEVES THE INTELLIGENCE MAP OUT OF 
           ALAIN’S APRON AND POCKETS IT. 

           Slowly, SCOTT RAISES HIS BROWNING .45 AT THE ELEVEN-YEAR-
           OLD’S HEAD...
           Jasper STARES AT THE MUZZLE OF SCOTT’S LOADED HANDGUN. 

           There is deafening beat of silence as Scott’s mind floods 
           with emotional torment...

           BUT CAPT. SCOTT DOESN’T PULL THE TRIGGER...

           Alain, unable to move, speaks with a thin whisper.

                                 ALAIN
                             (whispering)
                        If you’re not going to kill him...

           Scott looks at Alain. 

                                 ALAIN (CONT’D)
                        ...then take him with you.

           There is another silent beat as...

           Scott shakes his head, staring down his weapon site as he 
           tries to reason through his thoughts... 

           Alain swallows, painfully taking in tiny sips of air as the 
           life slips from his body.

                                 ALAIN (CONT’D)
                        Do you know what the Gestapo will 
                        do to him?

           Scott looks at the boy.

                                 ALAIN (CONT’D)
                        His aunt is hiding at an Abbey west 
                        of here...it’s on your way...

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                             (to Alain)
                        Shut your mouth.

                                 ALAIN
                        He’s just a boy...

           Frustration floods Scott as he tries to sort through the 
           knots inside his mind...

                                 ALAIN (CONT’D)
                        Take him...

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                        I can’t fucking take him! 

           Scott’s finger HOVERS ON THE PISTOL TRIGGER, BUT HE SIMPLY 
           CANNOT FIRE THE WEAPON...
           Alain’s gaze darts around the room as the corners of his 
           vision are encroached by darkness.

           Scott can see death slowly unlocking Alain’s expression. He 
           sees the mortal fear in his eyes as the man is forced to 
           surrender all he knows as certain, all the defining moments 
           of his life, and all that he loves. 

           Alain fights to stay conscious, to keep some control on what 
           will become, desperately needing to know that his child will 
           be safe...

           Capt. Scott LOWERS THE PISTOL.

           For an instant, Alain’s focus returns, finding Scott’s face. 
           He looks into Capt. Scott’s eyes...

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. TOWN SQUARE - MOMENTS LATER 

           Keeping his eyes to the ground, Scott quickly pulls Jasper 
           down the sidewalk trying to hide the blood spatter on his 
           stolen German uniform.

           In shock, Jasper stares blankly ahead, following as GERMAN 
           MILITARY VEHICLES race past toward the scene of the shooting.

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                             (to Jasper)
                        Don’t speak a word...

           Ahead in the town SQUARE, SCORES OF GERMAN SOLDIERS swarm the 
           area, coming their way. 

           They’ll be on them any second...

           Scott scans the block ahead and eyes an unattended GERMAN 
           MEDICAL CORE TRUCK parked outside a building.

           Scott motions to the truck...

                                 CAPT. SCOTT (CONT’D)
                             (to Jasper)
                        Get in the back.

           Jasper looks up at him. 

                                 CAPT. SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        Right now.
           INT. BACK OF MEDICAL TRUCK - MOMENTS LATER

           The interior walls of the insulated medical truck are lined 
           with BLOCK ICE AND SAWDUST.  

           Their breath is visible in the cold as Scott and Jasper HIDE 
           THEMSELVES behind a stack of LARGE CYLINDRICAL CANNISTERS.  

           They hear a DRIVER open up the cab of the truck and get 
           inside. 

           Seconds later, the ENGINE STARTS and the vehicle begins to 
           drive away with Scott and Jasper hidden inside.

           In the darkness, Scott looks at the boy.

           His young eyes are distant. His teeth chatter in the cold.

           Scott keeps his voice low but deathly firm...

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                        Do exactly what I say, exactly when 
                        I say it. You stop when I say to 
                        stop. You run when I say to run. If 
                        you fall behind, I will kill you.

           Jasper looks at him. Trauma haunts the boy’s eyes just 
           beneath the surface.

                                 CAPT. SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        Any questions?

           There is a beat as the truck rumbles down the street.

           Jasper looks at the RED GERMANIC LABELS on the metal 
           canisters.

                                 JASPER
                             (re: the canisters)
                        What is it?

           Scott glances around the truck.

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                        Blood.  

           Jasper looks around, realizing they are surrounded by 
           thousands of gallons of surplus human blood.

                                 CAPT. SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        They’re preparing for the 
                        invasion...

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. SERIES OF SHOTS - ALLIED STAGING AREA - SOUTHERN ENGLAND

           A SERIES OF HUMBLING SHOTS of the ALLIED FORCES RESTRICTED 
           AREA in their final preparations for Operation Overlord... 

           -A vast shot of Portsmouth Bay filled with hundreds of Naval 
           BATTLESHIPS, MINESWEEPERS, and PERSONNEL TRANSPORTS LOADED 
           WITH HIGGINS LANDING CRAFT...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. GENERAL LANCASTER’S OFFICE - ALLIED OPS CENTER - SAME 

           General Lancaster stares intensely at a large WALL MAP OF 
           NORMANDY as...

           Chief Warrant Officer Bartholomew enters and SALUTES 
           Lancaster...

                                 C.W.O. BARTHOLOMEW
                        You wanted to see me, sir?

                                 GENERAL LANCASTER
                        What the fuck is the status of 
                        Captain Scott and his unit?

                                 C.W.O. BARTHOLOMEW
                        Unfortunately, there isn’t anything 
                        new to report, sir. Just the 
                        initial distress signal from the 
                        glider pilot. Then nothing. They 
                        were supposed to have sent a radio 
                        ping when they reached their O.P., 
                        but that window passed a little 
                        over twelve hours ago, sir. 

                                 GENERAL LANCASTER
                        Well I need something more than 
                        that. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 GENERAL LANCASTER (CONT'D)
                        I’m briefing supreme Allied command 
                        at 07:00 and if I give them that 
                        weak shit they’ll scrub the pick-
                        up.

           Bartholomew gives the General a look...

                        Scrub the pick-up, sir?

                                 GENERAL LANCASTER
                        They were on the fence with this 
                        high of a risk mission in the first 
                        place. They don’t want any 
                        unnecessary attention drawn to the 
                        Overlord landing zones. If we don’t 
                        have some credible evidence that 
                        Scott’s mission is progressing, 
                        they’ll cancel the extraction team.

                                 C.W.O. BARTHOLOMEW
                        But they could be alive. We could 
                        have just lost contact is all...

                                 GENERAL LANCASTER
                        Then you dig deep and you figure 
                        out a way to prove it... 

           INT. BACK OF MEDICAL TRUCK - OCCUPIED NORMANDY - LATER

           With Capt. Scott and Jasper hidden behind the cargo, suddenly 
           the medical truck LURCHES TO A STOP.

           Capt. Scott puts his finger to his mouth signaling Jasper to 
           remain silent.

           Scott listens intently...

           They hear VOICES speaking German in the far distance outside 
           the truck.

           Scott draws his .45 from his coat and whispers to Jasper...

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                        Stay right behind me.

           EXT. ROAD - SECONDS LATER

           Rain falls on a rural dirt road on the outskirts of Caen. 

           A column of CIVILIAN AND MILITARY VEHICLES slow to a halt at 
           an ARMED CHECKPOINT AHEAD.
           The last vehicle in the column, Scott and Jasper climb out of 
           the back of the truck.

           Hiding from view, Scott peers around the back of the truck 
           and sees the checkpoint several hundred yards up the road. 

           He watches as GERMAN SOLDIERS search through a DELIVERY TRUCK 
           as they hold a FRENCH FARMER at gunpoint...

           Open hay fields spread out in both directions. 

           There is nowhere to run without being seen.

           The column of vehicles starts moving again, advancing toward 
           the checkpoint. 

           Their position will be exposed in seconds.

           Scott’s mind races, looking for a solution.

           Scott quickly motions to the ditch...

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                        Move.

           EXT. DITCH - CONTINUOUS

           Scott and Jasper dart across the road and down into the 
           muddy, half-flooded ditch.

           Slogging through shin-deep brown water, Scott sees the 
           opening of a narrow DRAINAGE PIPE running beneath the road.

           EXT/INT. DRAINAGE PIPE - SECONDS LATER

           Scott pulls the overgrown weeds away from the opening, then 
           in single file, with barely room to breathe, they both pull 
           themselves into the 24” diameter pipe.

           With Jasper in front, they slowly inch their way forward into 
           the pipe until they disappear from view.

           Soaking wet, Jasper shivers in the darkness. 

           Scott listens. 

           It’s clear by the silence no one has seen them.

           Scott whispers to Jasper...
                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                        The Abbey where your aunt is, how 
                        far is it?

                                 JASPER
                        Fifteen kilometers west of here.

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                        You’re certain of that number?

                                 JASPER
                        Yes. I’m good with distances. I’ve 
                        rode my bicycle there many times.

           Scott pauses, thinking...

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                        We’ll hold our position here. Sleep 
                        until dark...

                                 JASPER
                        I’m not tired.

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                        I don’t care if you’re tired or 
                        not. You’ll need energy to walk all 
                        night. Now shut your mouth, close 
                        your eyes, and go to sleep. 

           Jasper’s small cramped body shivers in the darkness. He tilts 
           his head and watches the rain fall in the small circle of 
           daylight at the pipe opening.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. TOBACCO SHOP - LATE AFTERNOON

           Bushnell stands over Metzger’s bloody body.

           Several other OFFICERS mill about in the background as well 
           as the SS Officer who fled the shooting.

           Bushnell takes a few steps down the back hallway and kneels, 
           examining Alain’s body.

           He turns to the surviving SS Officer who paces the floor 
           anxiously...

                                 BUSHNELL
                             (in German, subtitled)
                        Metzger shot this man?
                                 SS OFFICER
                        Yes. He’s the owner, along with the 
                        sister. We are looking for her now, 
                        questioning anyone who might know 
                        her whereabouts.

           Bushnell notices Jasper’s SMALL HANDPRINT in dried blood on 
           his father’s cheek where he held him for the last time. 

                                 BUSHNELL
                        And the boy?

                                 SS OFFICER
                        I don’t know.

                                 BUSHNELL
                        I see. Perhaps you had already fled 
                        at that point.

                                 SS OFFICER
                        I did not flee. I was in a 
                        tactically disadvantageous position 
                        and I chose to reposition myself. 

                                 BUSHNELL
                        Three armed men against one. How 
                        much tactical advantage do you 
                        require?

           The SS Officer remains silent.

           Bushnell chooses to change the topic.

                                 BUSHNELL (CONT’D)
                        The American...what direction did 
                        he come from?

           The SS Officer points down the back hallway.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. STORAGE ROOM - BACK OF TOBACCO SHOP - MOMENTS LATER

           Bushnell stands alone in the storage room, taking it in...

           Killed before he had the chance to destroy the evidence, the 
           INSTRUMENTS of Alain’s insurgency remain behind.

           Bushnell gazes at the THREAD WRAPPED AROUND THE MEASURING 
           PEGS ON THE WALL. 

           He looks at the MATHEMATICAL CIRCUMFERENCE SOLUTIONS WORKED 
           OUT ON PAPER.
           He looks at the SCALE RULER and the COLORED PENCILS used for 
           notating the map.

           The only thing missing is the map, and it’s clear by his 
           expression that Bushnell is comprehending the magnitude of 
           his discovery...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BRIEFING ROOM - GERMAN 352ND HEADQUARTERS - LATER

           A German military briefing room inside the headquarters of 
           the German 352nd.

           With a backdrop of red and black SWASTIKAS, Bushnell, dressed 
           in his combat uniform, addresses TWO UNITS OF HIS ELITE 
           GERMAN COMMANDOS. These men are not boyish recruits for the 
           Fatherland, these are seasoned specialists. 

           Their hardened faces look as if they are carved into the side 
           of a mountain as they stand at attention, listening to 
           Bushnell.

                                 BUSHNELL
                             (in German, Subtitled)
                        We know he came in an American 
                        glider last night. We know he met 
                        with a resistance leader in Caen 
                        this morning. We know he has killed 
                        at least two officers, and possibly 
                        a third soldier at the train 
                        station. And we now believe this 
                        man carries with him vital military 
                        intelligence, and is attempting to 
                        escape Normandy.

           Bushnell looks directly into the eyes of his men.

                                 BUSHNELL (CONT’D)
                        But he’s not going to escape. 
                        Because you and I, are not going to 
                        let him out. We will hunt from the 
                        land and we will hunt from the sky, 
                        and we will find him. I want the 
                        information he carries in my fist 
                        by this time tomorrow. That is not 
                        a best case scenario, that is an 
                        absolute order. Am I clear?

           The men answer in unison...
                                 BUSHNELL’S MEN
                        Yes, sir!

           EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

           Rain falls on the dark rural landscape.

           Lightning illuminates the distant sky as an armored GERMAN 
           HALF-TRACK TRANSPORT VEHICLE rumbles down the muddy road 
           toward Caen. 

           As the heavy vehicle passes over the road above we PAN DOWN 
           into the drainage pipe in the ditch below...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. DRAINAGE PIPE - SAME MOMENT

           We hear the rumbling sound of the passing Half-Track on the 
           road above... 

           Suddenly JASPER LURCHES VIOLENTLY AWAKE OUT OF A NIGHTMARE.

           In the darkness, the suffocating reality of the death of his 
           father comes back to him. 

           His teeth chatter as he tilts his head to look toward the 
           pipe opening, realizing it is now dark outside. 

           Then he hears Scott’s voice...

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                        Get up. It’s time.

           EXT. DITCH - MOMENTS LATER

           As thunder rumbles in the distance, Scott waits as Jasper 
           URINATES in the ditch.

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                        You can’t slow me down. You 
                        understand?

           Jasper doesn’t answer.

                                 JASPER
                        Why don’t you just leave.
                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                        What did you say?

           Jasper looks at Scott.

                                 JASPER
                        I don’t need you. I’ll make my own 
                        way.

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                        The only way I leave you here is 
                        with a bullet in your head. I made 
                        your father a promise. Now shut 
                        your mouth and walk.

           EXT. SERIES OF SHOTS - HOURS LATER - PASSAGE OF TIME

           -Silhouetted against a landscape of flickering lightning, 
           Scott and Jasper hike through the darkness on the high 
           ground, navigating the flooded fields...

           -Scott hikes through the dark wet woods with Jasper TRAILING 
           BEHIND HIM, trying to keep up. Scott turns and silently 
           motions for Jasper to speed up.

           -Scott trudges through shin deep mud as an exhausted Jasper 
           grows further in the distance. It’s clear by his angry 
           expression that Capt. Scott is growing more impatient with 
           Jasper’s progress...

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. TREELINE - AN HOUR LATER

           Capt. Scott walks west following a tree line. 

           After a moment he pauses and looks back over his shoulder.

           Despite his efforts, Jasper, soaked to the bone, has fallen 
           far behind.

           Scott checks his watch, then impatiently looks at the early 
           morning sky...

           As Jasper nears, Scott glares at the boy with anger. It’s 
           clear that the events of the last 36 hours have pushed him to 
           his wits end...
                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                        What did I tell you?

           The boy pauses, trying to catch his breath.

                                 JASPER
                        I’m sorry, I’m trying to move 
                        faster but...

           Scott cuts Jasper off...

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                        I don’t care if you’re trying and I 
                        sure as hell don’t care if you’re 
                        sorry. What I care about is in half 
                        an hour the sun is going to rise 
                        and we have still have five 
                        kilometers of open ground to 
                        cross...

                                 JASPER
                        Four.

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                        Excuse me?

           Jasper barks back at Scott defiantly...

                                 JASPER
                        You said five. We have four 
                        kilometers to go! I know the way 
                        better than you do! Now why don’t 
                        you just leave me the fuck alone!

           CAPT. SCOTT VIOLENTLY SEIZES THE LITTLE BOY BY THE COLLAR OF 
           HIS JACKET, NEARLY KNOCKING HIM OUT OF HIS SHOES... 

           Jaspers FACE RECOILS IN FEAR, WINCING, PREPARING TO BE HIT...

           Capt. Scott SUDDENLY STOPS HIMSELF. HE STARES AT THE SCARED 
           CHILD HE GRIPS BY THE THROAT. 

           SLOWLY, A LOOK OF SELF-REALIZATION rises in Scott’s 
           expression, as if he was suddenly seeing himself from an 
           outside perspective: A HARDENED COMBAT SOLDIER ABOUT TO BEAT 
           A CHILD.

           Scott, SHAMED BY HIS OWN ACTIONS, gently sets Jasper down and 
           lets go of his jacket.

           The boy crawls backward away from Capt. Scott, then gets to 
           his feet...
                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                        Wait...

           Jasper begins to back away, preparing to run...

                                 CAPT. SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        Please...

           As Jasper takes another step, THEY BOTH HEAR AN AUDIBLE 
           ‘CLICKING’ SOUND FROM THE GROUND BENEATH JASPER’S RIGHT 
           FOOT...

                                 CAPT. SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        STOP!

           Jasper FREEZES.

                                 CAPT. SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        Don’t move. Not one step. Don’t 
                        even shift your weight.

           Jasper stares at him.

                                 JASPER
                        What is it? 

           Scott approaches slowly, peering down at the muddy ground.

           Buried in the mud, Scott can see the CURVED METAL EDGE of a 
           live GERMAN TELLER MINE beneath Jasper’s right foot.

                                 JASPER (CONT’D)
                        What’s happening?

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                        Just don’t move...

           He looks Jasper in the eyes. He can see the panic building 
           inside the boy.

           Capt. Scott slowly drops to one knee, getting on the same eye 
           level as Jasper. 

                                 CAPT. SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        Look at me. You’re going to be 
                        okay... 

           Jasper’s whole body is trembling.

                                 JASPER
                        I don’t believe you. You’re going 
                        to leave and let me die...

           Scott looks at the crumbing child.
                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                        You’re standing on an anti-tank 
                        mine. If you die, I die. 

           Jasper looks at him...

                                 JASPER
                        So...if I lift up my foot, I could 
                        kill you right now.

           Scott absorbs the boy’s comment, and for the first time, 
           SCOTT OFFERS JASPER A HINT OF A SMILE...

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                        That’s correct. (pause) We’re in 
                        the same boat. I will make you a 
                        promise. I will not hurt you and I 
                        will not leave you. But you have to 
                        stop shaking.

                                 JASPER
                        I can’t... 

           Jasper’s trembling worsens and his panic grows.

                                 JASPER (CONT’D)
                        I want to run...

           Scott shakes his head.

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                        No. You cannot run. 

           The boy squeezes his eyes shut.

                                 CAPT. SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        You need to calm down.

           Jasper is trembling so badly his entire leg is starting to 
           shake.

                                 JASPER
                        I can’t!

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                        Then help me calm you down...

           Scott’s mind races...

                                 CAPT. SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        What would your dad do? If he was 
                        here...right now, what would he do?
                                 JASPER
                        He’d tell me a story...

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                        Okay...a story about what?

           Jasper trembles, taking a breath.

                                 JASPER
                        About something fun he did when he 
                        was my age...

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                        Okay...I’ll tell you a story. But 
                        you can’t move, okay?

           Jasper nods...

           Scott runs his hand through his hair and exhales...

                                 CAPT. SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        Okay...okay....when I was nine 
                        years old, my dad and I built a 
                        wooden canoe. It took all summer, 
                        bending the ribs, planing the wood. 
                        I remember that smell of cedar and 
                        varnish...

           As he speaks, SCOTT DRAWS HIS JUMP KNIFE FROM HIS BOOT AND 
           SLOWLY BEGINS TO DIG OUT THE MUDDY SOIL SURROUNDING JASPER’S 
           SMALL LEATHER SHOE.

                                 CAPT. SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        And in the fall, when it was done, 
                        he took me on a canoe trip... 

           The boy’s building panic is interrupted by a glimpse of 
           curiosity.

                                 JASPER
                        Just the two of you?

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                        Yeah.

                                 JASPER
                        Where?

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                        The Shenandoah River...

           Capt. Scott pauses and looks at Jasper. The boy has grown 
           calmer, listening. 
           WITH HIS BARE HANDS, PAINSTAKINGLY CAREFUL NOT TO DESTABILIZE 
           THE DEVICE, SCOTT SLOWLY RUNS HIS FINGERS ALONG THE CIRCULAR 
           EDGE OF THE MINE, LOCATING THE FUSE WELL...

                                 CAPT. SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        We drove upstream to Virginia, 
                        started in Luray on the south fork, 
                        and drifted our way back down...

                                 JASPER
                        For how long?

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                        Three days...

           UNABLE TO SEE PROPERLY, SCOTT REMOVES THE WATERPROOF CAP FROM 
           HIS PARATROOPER LIGHTER.

                                 CAPT. SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        It was October. All trees on the 
                        mountain sides were bright yellow 
                        and red... 

           SCOTT STRIKES THE LIGHTER FLINT AND THE FLAME COMES TO LIFE, 
           ILLUMINATING THE MUDDY DISC-SHAPED DEVICE IN FRONT OF HIM.

           Scott pauses for an instant remembering...

                                 CAPT. SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        He taught me a lot of things those 
                        three days. How to steer through 
                        the white water...

           SCOTT METICULOUSLY BRUSHES THE GRIT FROM THE FUSE HEAD, THEN 
           INSERTS THE TIP OF THE KNIFE INTO THE GROOVE ON THE MINE’S 
           FUSE PLUG. 

                                 CAPT. SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        He taught me how to build a fire 
                        when everything is wet... 

           SCOTT EXHALES, THEN GENTLY ATTEMPTS TO TURN THE FUSE PLUG 
           COUNTER-CLOCKWISE. 

                                 CAPT. SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        How to catch fish without bait...

           THE MINE’S DETONATOR FUSE DOESN’T BUDGE.

           SCOTT WIPES THE MOISTURE FROM HIS FOREHEAD AND TAKES A 
           BREATH. 

           THE INTENSE MEMORY OF HIS FATHER HANGS IN THE TREMOR OF 
           SCOTT’S VOICE.
                                 CAPT. SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        He used to say: it’s a father’s job 
                        to teach... 

           Unseen by Jasper, Capt. Scott fights back the emotion welling 
           in his eyes...

                                 CAPT. SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        But I liked it more when he just 
                        talked to me about stuff. Stuff he 
                        cared about. Stuff he was worried 
                        about. 

           THEN TRIES THE FUSE PLUG AGAIN, AND SLOWLY IT EASES FREE AND 
           BEGINS TO MOVE... 

                                 CAPT. SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        I remember every minute of those 
                        three days... 

           UNSEEN BY JASPER, A TEAR SILENTLY FALLS ONTO THE BLADE OF 
           SCOTT’S COMBAT KNIFE. 

                                 CAPT. SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        And when we pulled the canoe out of 
                        that river, he turned to me and 
                        said I was his best friend.

           SCOTT CAREFULLY THREADS THE FUSE CYLINDER OUT OF THE SIDE OF 
           THE MINE, THEN SLOWLY WITH STEADY HANDS, REMOVES THE 
           DETONATOR FUSE... 

                                 CAPT. SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        That was October, 1917. His AEF 
                        unit deployed to France one week 
                        later. 

                                 JASPER
                        He fought here?

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                        Yes he did. On this same soil. 

                                 JASPER
                        Did he make it back? 

           As the first light of day rises on the dark land, Scott looks 
           at Jasper.

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                        No. Not really.

           Jasper recognizes the loss in Scott’s face.
                                 CAPT. SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        Lift up your foot, son...

           Jasper lifts his foot. 

           NOTHING HAPPENS. THE MINE IS DISARMED. 

           Capt. Scott smiles... 

           WITHOUT WARNING, JASPER THROWS HIMSELF AT SCOTT, WRAPPING HIS 
           ARMS AROUND HIM.

           SCOTT, EXHAUSTED AND OVERWHELMED, CLOSES HIS EYES AND HUGS 
           HIM TIGHTLY AS THE LITTLE BOY BURIES HIS FACE IN HIS CHEST 
           AND BREAKS DOWN...

           Despite all that’s happened to Jasper, this is the first time 
           we’ve seen him cry, and like a broken levee, it all rushes 
           out... 

                                 JASPER
                             (crying)
                        It’s my fault...it’s all my 
                        fault...

           Capt. Scott holds him...

                                 JASPER (CONT’D)
                        He’s dead because of me! They were 
                        looking for me! 

           Jasper cries inconsolably...

                                 JASPER (CONT’D)
                        I killed him...I killed my dad.

           Embracing the boy, trying to fight back his own emotions, 
           Capt. Scott stares across the dark landscape toward the first 
           hue of daybreak on the grey horizon...

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                        No. Don’t you believe that. Not for 
                        one minute. It was war that killed 
                        him. That’s just what it does.

           EXT. VERANDA - ALLIED OPS CENTER - PORTSMOUTH, ENGLAND - DAWN

           Having not slept, General Lancaster drinks coffee on a 
           veranda outside the Allied Operations Center as the red sun 
           rises.
           Below in the harbor, seemingly endless NAVAL CREWS AND COMBAT 
           ENGINEERS work non-stop, preparing the Allied War Machine for 
           the largest amphibious combat operation in the history of 
           warfare.  

           C.W.O. Bartholomew approaches with a FILE FOLDER under his 
           arm and salutes...

                                 GENERAL LANCASTER
                        Tell me you have something...

                                 C.W.O. BARTHOLOMEW
                        I’ve been in the radio room all 
                        night. I have something, but it’s 
                        unconfirmed, sir... 

                                 GENERAL LANCASTER
                        The briefing is in twelve minutes, 
                        so anything is something at this 
                        point...

                                 C.W.O. BARTHOLOMEW
                        We intercepted a German radio 
                        transmission about an hour ago, 
                        indicating there could be a manhunt 
                        on for an American caught behind 
                        enemy lines. But it was vague...

                                 GENERAL LANCASTER
                        Why would they say that openly? It 
                        doesn’t make sense... 

                                 C.W.O. BARTHOLOMEW
                        That’s what we thought. And it was 
                        unusual, because it was a French 
                        civilian radio, calling on a German 
                        military frequency. 

                                 GENERAL LANCASTER
                        What did it say exactly?

                                 C.W.O. BARTHOLOMEW
                        The broadcaster gave coordinates 
                        for a location. He said that the 
                        American may be headed there.

           Lancaster pauses, absorbing the information...

                                 GENERAL LANCASTER
                        You think it could be the leak in 
                        the French intelligence unit?
                                 C.W.O. BARTHOLOMEW
                        Possible, sir. But if nothing else, 
                        it proves at least one of our men 
                        is still alive...

           EXT. CLOISTERED ABBEY - EARLY MORNING

           The rain has eased. 

           Shafts of morning sun break through the clouds, casting a 
           mosaic of shadow and light on the Normandy landscape.

           In the distance, A CHURCH BELL RINGS.

           Far below, past a winding RIVER, the BAROQUE SPIRES of a 
           beautiful 17TH CENTURY ABBEY rise above the tree tops.

           The Abbey’s ornately faceted stone walls and bell tower are 
           exquisite.

           CLOISTERED NUNS in robes work quietly on the grounds, picking 
           up storm debris from the garden flower beds.

           INT. CORRIDOR - ABBEY - SAME MOMENT

           We hear footsteps as we follow a NUN (60’s) carrying a 
           covered BASKET down a long stone corridor.

           The Nun reaches a private door to the rectory and knocks 
           quietly.

           There is a brief pause, then the door opens revealing 
           Jasper’s Aunt Vivienne.

           Vivienne’s long hair is pulled up and pinned. She wears a 
           cotton blouse, skirt, and leather boots. A GERMAN SUBMACHINE 
           GUN is slung on a strap over her shoulder. She is beautiful.

           The Nun hands Vivienne the basket.

                                 VIVIENNE
                             (in French)
                        Thank you.

           Remaining silent, the Nun nods and quietly turns, walking 
           back down the hall.
           INT. RECTORY - SECONDS LATER

           Vivienne closes the door and walks with the basket into the 
           rectory where 20 MORE MEMBERS OF THE FRENCH RESISTANCE have 
           made camp in a single room.

           THE WALLS ARE LINED WITH AN ARSENAL OF WEAPONS: CARBINE 
           RIFLES, MACHINE GUNS, GRENADES, AND OTHER VARIOUS LIGHT ARMS.

           Vivienne sets the basket on a long wooden table and removes 
           the cloth cover revealing EGGS, TWO QUARTS OF MILK, AND A 
           DOZEN LOAVES OF FRESHLY BAKED BREAD.

           Vivienne glances at JEAN, (21) a young French man daydreaming 
           by the window in the morning sun.

                                 VIVIENNE
                             (in French)
                        Jean... 

           The young man looks over at her.

                                 VIVIENNE (CONT’D)
                        Set the table.

           Jean stands up from the window and stretches, then lazily 
           walks over.

           With apathy, he retrieves a loaf of bread from the basket, 
           rips off the end, and takes a bite.

                                 JEAN
                             (in French)
                        What’s the point in that?

           Without hesitation, Vivienne RIPS THE BREAD OUT OF HIS FIST 
           and SHOVES A STACK OF TIN PLATES into his hands. 

                                 VIVIENNE
                        There are people across this 
                        continent who only wish to God they 
                        could sit down to share a meal 
                        together. So grow up and set the 
                        table.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. ABBEY CHURCH - LATER

           Vivienne enters the abbey church. 
           The morning sunlight defuses through the massive stained 
           glass windows, bathing the interior in an ETHEREAL VIOLET 
           LIGHT, befitting a house of God on Earth. 

           The carved oak pews, thirty-foot vaulted ceilings, and 
           towering Baroque columns are a humbling testament to the 
           beauty mankind is capable of creating.

           Vivienne’s boot steps echo through the empty church as she 
           walks alone down the aisle with her submachine gun slung over 
           her shoulder. 

           As she reaches the sanctuary, Vivienne kneels in the aisle.

           She looks up at the crucified body of Christ rendered in 
           stained glass high above the alter. 

           She lowers her head in prayer...

           When suddenly the door at the rear of the church opens and 
           HENRI,(40’s)another Resistance member calls to her...

                                 HENRI
                        Vivienne, your nephew is here...

           INT. RECTORY - MOMENTS LATER

           Vivienne rushes into the rectory.

           The instant Jasper sees his aunt, he rushes into her arms.

           Vivienne hugs him, smoothing the hair on his head.

           Then her eyes fall on Capt. Scott standing nearby.

           Scott is filthy. His clothes are torn and caked in mud. His 
           eyes and body are exhausted...yet it’s clear as Vivienne 
           looks at him for the first time, something SPARKS inside her.

                                 VIVIENNE
                             (to Scott in English)
                        Who are you?

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                        Captain Lowry Scott.

                                 VIVIENNE
                        You’re the contact Alain was 
                        waiting for...

           Vivienne glances around the room. 

           There is a palpable silence.
           All of the Resistance members have their eyes to the floor, 
           avoiding Vivienne’s gaze.

                                 VIVIENNE (CONT’D)
                        Where is Alain? 

           Scott is the only one who will look Vivienne in the eye.

                                 VIVIENNE (CONT’D)
                        My brother? Where is he?

           Scott slowly SHAKES HIS HEAD.

           Looking in her eyes, he sees the WAVE OF LOSS HIT HER.

           Unflinching, she fights back the crushing feeling inside her, 
           swallowing it.

           Vivienne glances down at Jasper in her arms.

                                 VIVIENNE (CONT’D)
                        You must be hungry. 

           She looks at Scott.

                                 VIVIENNE (CONT’D)
                        Both of you.

           Scott NODS, recognizing her strength.

                                 VIVIENNE (CONT’D)
                             (to both)
                        Go wash your hands.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. RECTORY - ABBEY - MOMENTS LATER

           Capt. Scott sits across the wooden table from Jasper.

           They both lean over plates eating voraciously.

           Lost in thought, Vivienne stands by the window looking out at 
           the treeline in the distance. 

           After a moment, she turns and gazes at Scott and Jasper 
           hunched over the table eating.

                                 VIVIENNE
                        We have more bread.

           She picks up the last loaf of bread and brings it to the 
           table.
           She tears it in half, splitting it between them.

           Vivienne sits down next to Jasper and leans affectionately 
           against him. 

           Jasper shovels the food into his mouth.

                                 VIVIENNE (CONT’D)
                        Slow down. Chew your food. 

           She sets a hard candy peppermint stick on the table in front 
           of Jasper.

                                 VIVIENNE (CONT’D)
                             (re: the candy )
                        Not until you’re done.

           Jasper lets out a small smile...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. SLEEPING ROOM - ABBEY - MOMENTS LATER

           Lead by Vivienne, Capt. Scott carries Jasper fast asleep in 
           his arms into a makeshift sleeping room in the back of the 
           Abbey.

           Scott lays the boy gently down on the bed as Vivienne removes 
           his shoes and pulls a wool blanket up under his chin.

           For a moment, Vivienne and Scott watch in silence as Jasper’s 
           small chest rises and falls with each breath. 

           Vivienne glances up at Scott, seeing in his eyes the 
           connection he feels toward Jasper...

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. COURTYARD - ABBEY - MOMENTS LATER

           Vivienne and Capt. Scott sit alone in the Abbey courtyard...

                                 VIVIENNE
                        My god he’s exhausted...

           Scott nods.

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                        It was a long night for him.

           There is a beat of silence as Vivienne looks at the late 
           afternoon sky. 
           Her voice tremors with emotion as she speaks...

                                 VIVIENNE
                        Did you see my brother killed?

           Scott nods.

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                        Yes.

           There is a beat.

                                 VIVIENNE
                        Did Jasper?

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                        He did.

           Vivienne pauses to breathe, trying to fight back the 
           suffocating sensation inside her.

           She looks at the late afternoon sky, trying to redirect her 
           thoughts... 

                                 VIVIENNE
                        It will be dusk soon. Do you have 
                        time to sleep?

           Scott shakes his head NO.

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                        I should go. 

           Vivienne nods.

                                 VIVIENNE
                        What do you have for a weapon?

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                        A Browning .45 with one magazine.

                                 VIVIENNE
                        Take a rifle. As many rounds as you 
                        like. And I’ll pack you something 
                        to eat.

           Scott nods a THANK YOU.

           Capt. Scott looks at Vivienne. 

           Her face is beautiful. He sees the strain of the tears she 
           fights back in her eyes.

           Scott starts to speak...
                                 VIVIENNE (CONT’D)
                             (cutting him off)
                        Please don’t ask me if I’m alright.

           Scott gives her a compassionate nod.

           EXT/INT. TOOL SHED - ABBEY - SAME MOMENT

           Unseen by others, Jean, the young Frenchman, slips through a 
           wooden door into the darkness of the Gardener’s shed at the 
           rear of the Abbey grounds.

           Alone in the darkness, Jean quickly uncovers A PORTABLE RADIO 
           TRANSMITTER carefully hidden beneath a stack of crates and 
           garden tools. 

           Quietly, he turns on the radio and begins to TRANSMIT IN 
           GERMAN...

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. ABBEY - MOMENTS LATER

           Outside the abbey the afternoon sun sinks on the horizon. 

           With a BACKPACK and a RIFLE over his shoulder, Capt. Scott 
           prepares to leave.

           On the steps of the abbey, Vivienne looks at him. 

           Jasper is not present.

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                        You’ll tell him goodbye for me?

                                 VIVIENNE
                        I feel like I should wake him. 
                        He’ll be upset.

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                        It’s better he rest.

                                 VIVIENNE
                        I don’t know why you risked it, but 
                        thank you for bringing him here. 

           Vivienne looks in Scott’s eyes, holding a moment too long, 
           glimpsing the broken man beneath the uniform.

           There is something so fierce yet disarming about her gaze, 
           and inside himself, he cannot help but feel attracted to her.
                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                        I...

           He stops himself, then glances at the sun sinking in the 
           western sky.

                                 CAPT. SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        I should go.

           She nods.

           As he turns to walk away she calls to him...

                                 VIVIENNE
                        Captain?

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                        Yes?

           Scott looks at her.

                                 VIVIENNE
                        His father died for that map. You 
                        get it where it needs to go. 

           INT. SLEEPING ROOM -  ABBEY - SAME MOMENT

           With the windows covered, Jasper sleeps on the makeshift bed 
           in a dark room.

           Vivienne sits nearby on a bench watching him sleep.

           Holding back the sadness inside her, Vivienne studies 
           Jasper’s young face: his mouth open slightly ajar, his eyes 
           closed and dreaming of a more peaceful place.

           As Jasper sleeps, Vivienne stands and parts the curtains 
           covering a small window...

           VIVIENNE’S P.O.V. THROUGH WINDOW: Vivienne peers out through 
           the small leaded glass window at the gardens in the rear of 
           the abbey. WHITE BLOSSOMS flutter off the fruit trees in the 
           afternoon breeze...

           As Vivienne starts to close the curtain she SUDDENLY NOTICES 
           JEAN emerge out of the Abbey Garden shed. 

           Unaware he has been seen, Jean quickly shuts the shed door 
           behind him, and cuts across the grounds and out of sight...  

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. GARDEN TOOL SHED - MOMENTS LATER

           Alone, Vivienne opens the wooden door to the garden shed.

           Her eyes scan the interior, noticing nothing out of the 
           ordinary...

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. WOODS - MOMENTS LATER

           The wind has picked up, blowing out of the west.

           Moving toward the sinking sun, Capt. Scott hikes alone 
           through the woods, paralleling a dirt road in the distance...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. RECTORY - ABBEY - MOMENTS LATER

           Using CIGARETTES as currency, Jean sits across the wooden 
           table from THREE OTHER YOUNG FRENCH FIGHTERS engrossed in a 
           game of POKER as...

           In the background, Vivienne enters the rectory carrying 
           SOMETHING UNSEEN and silently approaches the table from the 
           blind side...

           Seated at the table, Jean grins as he wins...

           But as he slides his hand forward to retrieve the CIGARETTES 
           he just won, the BLADE TIP OF A FRENCH BAYONET IS VIOLENTLY 
           DRIVEN THROUGH THE TOP OF JEAN’S OUTSTRETCHED HAND, PINNING 
           IT TO THE SURFACE OF THE WOODEN TABLE...

           Jean SHRIEKS as VIVIENNE PLANTS HER KNEE HARD IN THE CENTER 
           OF JEAN’S BACK, WRAPS THE TRANSMITTER CORD FROM THE HIDDEN 
           GERMAN RADIO AROUND JEAN’S NECK, AND PULLS TIGHT...

           Shocked, the THREE OTHER MEN BACK OFF as Vivienne chokes Jean 
           from behind...

                                 VIVIENNE
                             (in French)
                        You fucking traitor! 

           Jean’s face floods deep red as blood pools around his hand 
           pinned to the table...

                                 VIVIENNE (CONT’D)
                        How much time do we have!
           Jean tries to resist, but Vivienne pulls the cord harder...

                                 VIVIENNE (CONT’D)
                        How much time!

                                                           HARD CUT TO:

           EXT. WOODS - SAME MOMENT

           Thirty yards off the dirt road, Scott leans his rifle against 
           a tree and stops to take a COMPASS READING. 

           Red afternoon sunlight filters through the blowing leaves and 
           dances on the forest floor all around him.

           He notes the direction, then checks his watch.  

           WHEN SUDDENLY SCOTT HEARS SOMETHING...

           A LOW, RUMBLING SOUND RISES IN THE DISTANCE, GROWING LOUDER 
           AND LOUDER... 

           THE RUMBLING GROWS LOUDER, APPROACHING...

           Scott falls to one knee and camouflages himself in the 
           underbrush...

           Suddenly through the trees, Scott sees THREE GERMAN TIGER 
           TANKS ROARING UP THE DIRT ROAD.

           The tanks are immediately followed by TWO ARMORED TRANSPORT 
           VEHICLES carrying 30 HEAVILY-ARMED GERMAN COMMANDOS. 

           THEY ARE MOVING FAST, HEADED DIRECTLY FOR THE ABBEY... 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. VEGETABLE GARDEN - ABBEY - MOMENTS LATER

           In the Abbey’s vegetable garden, an elderly NUN (70’s) kneels 
           in her robes, tending a row of young tomato plants in 
           silence.

           Her aged hands move thoughtfully, pulling weed sprouts and 
           dead-heading dry blossoms...

           WHEN SUDDENLY, THE SOIL AROUND HER HANDS BEGINS TO VIBRATE.

           SHE LOOKS UP, HEARING THE HEAVY RUMBLE OF THE TANKS IN THE 
           DISTANCE...

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:
           INT. RECTORY - ABBEY - SECONDS LATER

           VIVIENNE and the other RESISTANCE MEMBERS SCRAMBLE TO GATHER 
           WEAPONS AND AMMUNITION...

           They LOCK AND LOAD as Vivienne, now in command since her 
           brother’s death, orders the fighters...

                                 VIVIENNE
                             (in French)
                        You know your positions. Two 
                        grenades per person. We hold them 
                        until we get the rest out the 
                        tunnel...

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. LEAD TIGER TANK - MOMENTS LATER

           In his combat uniform, Commander Bushnell stands in the open 
           hatch of the lead Tiger Tank advancing on the Abbey. 

           As they clear the woods, Bushnell ORDERS THE TANK TO STOP.

           The massive war machines halt on a dime, leaving a swell of 
           dust drifting around them.

           Bushnell raises a pair of BINOCULARS to his eyes...

                                                          QUICK CUT TO:

           POV SHOT THROUGH BINOCULARS: 

           Bushnell takes in the Abbey. 

           He sees a DOZEN ROBED NUNS scattering throughout the 
           grounds...

           Bushnell SHIFTS HIS VIEW and sees a GROUP OF THREE ARMED MEN 
           moving in formation across the court yard.

           Bushnell calls out to the TANK COMMANDERS as he peers through 
           the field glasses...

                                 BUSHNELL
                             (calling out, in German)
                        Three man rifle team on the left 
                        flank! Two hundred meters out 
                        behind the wall...

           BUSHNELL SHIFTS HIS VIEW TO THE BELL TOWER, WHERE HE SEES A 
           FLASH OF MOVEMENT... 
           BUSHNELL ADJUSTS THE FOCAL RING ON THE BINOCULARS AND SEES 
           TWO MEN IN THE TOP BELL TOWER, SCRAMBLING TO READY A MACHINE 
           GUN POSITION...

                                 BUSHNELL (CONT’D)
                             (calling out, in German)
                        Light machine gun in the tower...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. SLEEPING ROOM - ABBEY - SECONDS LATER

           Vivienne bursts through the door into the dark room where 
           Jasper lies fast asleep.

                                 VIVIENNE
                        Jasper! Wake up! Wake up!

           Jasper wakes, startled by her urgency ...

                                 VIVIENNE (CONT’D)
                        Put on your shoes! We have to move 
                        right now...

           IN THAT INSTANT, VIVIENNE’S VOICE IS DROWNED OUT BY THE HOWL 
           OF INCOMING ROUNDS...

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           EXT. BELL TOWER - SAME MOMENT

           THREE 88MM EXPLOSIVE SHELLS MOVING AT A 1000 METERS PER 
           SECOND PUNCH THROUGH THE MAGNIFICENT BAROQUE BELL TOWER.

           EXPLODING ON IMPACT, THE ROUNDS RIP APART THE TOP SECTION OF 
           THE SPIRE...

           THE FRENCH MACHINE GUNNERS IN THE TOWER ARE KILLED INSTANTLY.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. ABBEY WALL - SECONDS LATER

           Using the five-foot-high perimeter wall for cover, HALF A 
           DOZEN FRENCH FIGHTERS OPEN FIRE on the GERMAN POSITION... 

                                                           CUT BACK TO:
           EXT. TIGER TANK - SAME MOMENT

           As rounds hum past, TWO HUNTER TEAMS OF GERMAN COMMANDOS WAIT 
           SAFELY IN THE WINGS BEHIND THE TIGERS as...

           Bushnell yells again to the Tank Commanders...

                                 BUSHNELL
                        Adjust targets...

           THE TANKS ADJUST THEIR MAIN GUNS...

           In a deafening barrage, ALL THREE TIGERS FIRE THEIR CANNONS 
           IN UNISON, DECIMATING THE SECTION OF PERIMETER WALL THE 
           FRENCH FIGHTERS HIDE BEHIND... 

           The Fighters fall back to alternative positions as Bushnell 
           SIGNALS TO HIS MEN. 

           TWO HUNTER GROUPS OF GERMAN COMMANDOS FAN OUT AND ADVANCE ON 
           THE ABBEY.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CORRIDOR - SAME MOMENT

           Holding Jasper’s hand, with a submachine gun slung over her 
           shoulder, Vivienne follows SIX OTHER YOUNG FRENCH FIGHTERS 
           down a corridor into the Abbey church...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CHURCH - CONTINUOUS

           VIVIENNE AND THE OTHERS HURRY DOWN THE CENTER AISLE OF THE 
           CHURCH WHEN SUDDENLY...

           A TANK SHELL STRIKES THE VAULTED CEILING AND EXPLODES.

           THE BLAST CONCUSSION SHATTERS THE 300-YEAR-OLD STAINED GLASS 
           WINDOWS...

           VIVIENNE SCREAMS AND COVERS JASPER’S BODY AS FRAGMENTS OF 
           GLASS AND STONE SHOWER DOWN ON THE FLOOR.

           Vivienne calls out to the fighters further ahead...

                                 VIVIENNE
                             (yelling to the others)
                        Get to the tunnel!
           Drowning out her voice, ANOTHER EXPLOSIVE SHELL RIPS THROUGH 
           THE WALL OF THE CHURCH. 

           There is a MOMENT OF BLACKNESS...

           Vivienne’s EARS RING horribly.

           STUNNED BY THE BLAST, VIVIENNE STRAINS TO GET HER BEARINGS AS 
           DUST CLOUDS THE INTERIOR OF THE CHURCH.

           Jasper coughs and Vivienne covers his mouth with her neck 
           scarf, allowing him to breathe.

           As the dust begins to settle, she sees daylight drifting in 
           through a gaping hole in the church wall.

           THE BLOODY BODIES OF HER OTHER COMRADES LAY STREWN ACROSS THE 
           CHURCH PEWS AHEAD OF THEM. 

           MANY OF THEIR LIMBS HAVE BEEN HORRIFICALLY SEVERED BY THE 
           IMPACT OF THE BLAST. 

           THEIR DEAD FACES ARE CAKED GREY WITH DUST. 

           ALL SIX ARE DEAD...

                                 VIVIENNE (CONT’D)
                             (to herself)
                        My god...

           SUDDENLY VIVIENNE SEES SOMETHING MOVE FROM THE CORNER OF HER 
           EYE...

           THREE ARMED GERMAN COMMANDOS CLIMB THROUGH THE HOLE IN THE 
           WALL ENTERING THE CHURCH.

           WITHOUT HESITATION, VIVIENNE SHOVES JASPER DOWN BETWEEN TWO 
           PEWS, RAISES HER SUBMACHINE GUN, AND OPENS FIRE ON THE 
           COMMANDOS...

           IN A MERCILESS STREAM OF FULLY AUTOMATIC ROUNDS, VIVIENNE 
           CUTS DOWN ALL THREE GERMANS, FIRING UNTIL HER WEAPON BREAKS 
           EMPTY.

           WITHOUT MISSING A BEAT, SHE PULLS THE SPENT MAGAZINE FROM HER 
           WEAPON, PITCHES IT ASIDE, AND INSERTS A FULLY LOADED ONE FROM 
           HER SHOULDER BAG.

           SHE RACKS HER WEAPON ACTION, STEPS FORWARD AND FIRES MORE 
           ROUNDS INTO THE WOUNDED BODIES OF THE GERMANS, MAKING SURE 
           THEY ARE DEAD.

           Then she calls to Jasper...
                                 VIVIENNE (CONT’D)
                             (to Jasper)
                        Come on! Now!

           INT. CHURCH SACRISTY - MOMENTS LATER 

           Vivienne and Jasper run into the Sacristy room at the back  
           of the church and shut the door.

           The RELIGIOUS VESTMENTS hang in a wardrobe. 

           ARTICLES OF THE SACRAMENT lay out on preparation counters 
           nearby. 

           Vivienne GRABS AN EDGE OF THE HEAVY 8X10 RUG on the floor...

                                 VIVIENNE
                             (to Jasper)
                        Help me...

           Jasper grabs another edge of the thick rug and they roll it 
           back.

           Beneath the rug is a SMALL WOODEN TRAP DOOR IN THE FLOOR.

           VIVIENNE LIFTS THE TRAP DOOR REVEALING A LADDER LEADING DOWN 
           TO A TUNNEL SPACE BENEATH THE CHURCH... 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. ABBEY - SECONDS LATER

           THE TIGER TANKS ROLL THROUGH THE GATES OF THE ABBEY.

           THE TANKS SEPARATE AND SURROUND THE ABBEY GROUNDS, DRIVING 
           OVER THE GARDENS, DESTROYING FLOWER BEDS, STATUES, AND 
           FOUNTAINS IN THEIR VIOLENT PATH. 

           TWO FLEEING FRENCH FIGHTERS, CUT OFF FROM THE ESCAPE ROUTE, 
           FIRE THEIR WEAPONS IN VAIN AS THEY ARE CRUSHED BENEATH THE 
           TREADS OF THE MASSIVE MACHINES...

           INT. TUNNEL - SECONDS LATER

           On their hands and knees, Vivienne and Jasper crawl through 
           the narrow underground tunnel...

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. RECTORY - MOMENTS LATER

           Bushnell, flanked by several German Commandos, enters the 
           rectory.

           He peers around at the abandoned weapons and supplies.

           Bushnell steps to the window, picking up a woman’s HAIRBRUSH 
           Vivienne left behind. 

           He looks at Vivienne’s long hair held in the bristles. He 
           raises the brush to his nose, smelling perfume.

           A RANKING GERMAN COMMANDO enters the rectory and SALUTES HIM.

                                 BUSHNELL
                        What is your report?

                                 RANKING GERMAN COMMANDO 
                             (in German)
                        We’ve secured the perimeter, sir. 

                                 BUSHNELL
                        And the American?

                                 RANKING GERMAN COMMANDO
                        We haven’t found him yet, sir. But 
                        we’re still clearing the last 
                        building now.  

                                 BUSHNELL
                        Casualties?

                                 RANKING GERMAN COMMANDO
                        Sixteen dead insurgents. 

                                 BUSHNELL
                        And ours?

           The Commando pauses, then answers...

                                 RANKING GERMAN COMMANDO
                        We have three casualties, sir.

           Bushnell’s face tightens...

                                 BUSHNELL
                        Who?

                                 RANKING GERMAN COMMANDO
                             (confused)
                        Who, sir?...
                                 BUSHNELL
                        Yes...who. Which of my men have 
                        been killed? 

                                 RANKING GERMAN COMMANDO
                        Adler, Holzmann, and Oelberg, 
                        sir... 

           There is a beat as Bushnell’s face grows distant, picturing 
           the three young men in his mind.  

                                 BUSHNELL
                        What about the woman leader and her 
                        nephew?

                                 RANKING GERMAN COMMANDO
                        We haven’t found her either, sir. 
                        As you ordered, fire team two is 
                        sweeping the woods as we speak. 
                        But...perhaps she was never here...

           Bushnell tosses the HAIR BRUSH onto the table.

                                 BUSHNELL
                             (re: the brush, 
                              rhetorical)
                        Then who the fuck does that belong 
                        to?

           The Commando remains silent...

                                 BUSHNELL (CONT’D)
                        They’re here and they’re looking 
                        for a way out. Find them.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. TUNNEL - MOMENTS LATER

           Breathing hard, Vivienne and Jasper crawl through the 
           darkness.

           As they reach the end, the tunnel turns upward.

           Vivienne climbs up several wooden steps, then pushes at the 
           underside of a HATCH DOOR above her head...

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. ABBEY - SAME MOMENT

           A cloud of black smoke climbs into the sky as the majestic, 
           300 hundred-year-old Abbey burns in the late morning sun.

           The bell tower has collapsed.

           The gardens are decimated. 

           DEAD BODIES are strewn on the grounds.

           What was moments before a sanctuary of faith and refuge, is 
           now a place of death.

           EXT. NEARBY WOODS - SAME MOMENT

           Damp wind blows through the woods as the Abbey burns in the 
           distance.

           Thirty yards into the trees, a PATCH OF LEAVES COVERING THE 
           FOREST FLOOR LIFTS UPWARD, REVEALING A CAMOUFLAGED TRAP DOOR 
           IN THE GROUND.

           Vivienne emerges from the tunnel opening. 

           She is filthy and her knees are raw and bloody from crawling.

           Vivienne lays her weapon on the ground and crouches on her 
           knees, reaching down into the tunnel for Jasper’s hand.

           She grips her nephew’s wrist and pulls him up into the 
           daylight.

           But as she turns back, SHE REALIZES HER WEAPON IS NO LONGER 
           ON THE GROUND BESIDE HER.

           VIVIENNE LOOKS UP JUST AS A GERMAN BOOT KICKS HER HARD IN THE 
           RIBS, KNOCKING THE WIND OUT OF HER...

           Letting go of his wrist, Jasper slides back down into the 
           tunnel opening...

                                 VIVIENNE
                             (to Jasper)
                        Run!

           But another GERMAN COMMANDO seizes Jasper by the back of his 
           coat and pulls him out of the hole.

                                 VIVIENNE (CONT’D)
                        Don’t you touch him!
           VIVIENNE IS POUNDED BY ANOTHER BOOT TO THE STOMACH, SILENCING 
           HER.

           HER BODY FOLDS UP ON THE GROUND, GAGGING AND GASPING FOR 
           BREATH.

           A moment passes as she tries to take in air.

           She is surrounded by FOUR GERMAN COMMANDOS. 

           A stocky BLOND COMMANDO grips Jasper by his hair.

           All four men stare down at Vivienne’s hiked skirt, her 
           underwear and bare thighs.

           There is a beat of charged silence.

                                 BLOND COMMANDO
                             (to the others)
                        Turn her over...face down. Hold her 
                        arms...

           Suddenly A SHOT RINGS OUT in the distance... 

           A BULLET STRIKES THE BLOND COMMANDO IN THE TEETH, EXITING OUT 
           THE BASE OF HIS SKULL, KILLING HIM INSTANTLY.

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           A SECOND GERMAN COMMANDO IS STRUCK WITH A RIFLE ROUND DEAD IN 
           THE STERNUM, DROPPING HIM TO THE GROUND.

           THE REMAINING TWO COMMANDOS RAISE THEIR WEAPONS AND SCAN THE 
           TREES, TRYING TO FIND THEIR TARGET...

           Bushnell, standing outside the burning Abbey, HEARS THE RIFLE 
           SHOTS in the woods nearby...
           He yells to his men...

                                 BUSHNELL
                        The woods! Go! Go!

           EXT. WOODS - LESS THAN A SECOND LATER

           UNABLE TO LOCATE THE SHOOTER, THE LAST GERMAN COMMANDO 
           ATTEMPTS TO FALL BACK AND FIND COVER, ONLY TO TURN AND SEE 
           VIVIENNE, HOLDING ONE OF THE DEAD COMMANDO’S PISTOLS. 

           SHE FIRES FIVE QUICK SHOTS AT CLOSE RANGE INTO THE GERMAN’S 
           CHEST AND HEAD, DROPPING HIM.

           Vivienne and Jasper see Capt. Scott emerge from the trees 
           ahead. 

           She GRABS JASPER’S HAND AND RUNS toward him...

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. WOODS - MOMENTS LATER

           Capt. Scott, Vivienne, and Jasper race through the woods, 
           trying to put distance between them and Bushnell’s men at the 
           Abbey...

           EXT. TIGER TANK - SECONDS LATER

           A Tiger Tank crushes a path through a field of small trees as 
           it races through the forest landscape.

           Bushnell braces himself in the open tank hatch.

           Like a juggernaut, the huge machine drives over everything in 
           its path...
           After a moment the TANK HALTS.

           Bushnell scans the forest ahead, raising his BINOCULARS to 
           his eyes...

                                                          QUICK CUT TO:

           POV SHOT THROUGH BINOCULARS: half a mile ahead, Bushnell sees 
           a glimpse of Capt. Scott, Vivienne, and Jasper running down a 
           wooded embankment toward a rushing river in the distance...

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. EMBANKMENT - SECONDS LATER

           Vivienne and Capt. Scott help Jasper down the steep 
           embankment, when suddenly they hear the THUMP in the distance 
           of a TANK CANNON, and less than a second later the HOWL OF AN 
           INCOMING ROUND...

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                             (to Vivienne and Jasper)
                        Get down!

           All three of them hit the ground as a SHELL RIPS THROUGH THE 
           TREES ABOVE THEM AND VIOLENTLY EXPLODES, SHREDDING TREES AS 
           IF THEY WERE MATCHSTICKS...  

                                 CAPT. SCOTT (CONT’D)

           From the hatch, with his binoculars to his eyes, Bushnell

           Scott, Vivienne, and Jasper run through a marshy valley 
           toward the RIVER in the distance.
           They hear the howl of another INCOMING TANK ROUND...and take 
           cover as the shell hits the ground near them, showering them 
           with muddy debris...

                                                          CROSS CUT TO:

           EXT. TIGER TANK - SECONDS LATER

           A pale-eyed TANK COMMANDER, (40’s) stands in the secondary 
           tank hatch, peering out in the far distance.

           They watch Capt. Scott, Vivienne, and Jasper run for the 
           river. 

           The Tank Commander addresses Bushnell...

                                 TANK COMMANDER
                             (to Bushnell, in German)
                        The Tiger is too heavy to take into 
                        that marsh. And even if we could, 
                        the river is too deep in that 
                        location for us to cross. 

           Bushnell doesn’t respond.

                                 TANK COMMANDER (CONT’D)
                             (to Bushnell, in German)
                        Sir, if they make the river, we 
                        will lose them.

           Bushnell shakes his head.

                                 BUSHNELL
                        If the water is too deep for a 
                        tank, then the water is too deep 
                        for a little boy.

           Bushnell calls down into the tank...

                                 BUSHNELL (CONT’D)
                        Hand up my rifle!

           EXT. OPEN FIELD - SECONDS LATER

           Capt. Scott, Vivienne, and Jasper run across a stretch of 
           open wet ground toward the river’s edge...

                                                          CROSS CUT TO:
           EXT. TIGER TANK - SAME MOMENT

           Bushnell rests the barrel of his modified K98 MAUSER RIFLE on 
           the edge of the tank hatch. 

           The Tank Commander looks at him...

                                 TANK COMMANDER
                        That’s nearly a thousand meters, 
                        sir...

           Bushnell pauses, noting the light, left-to-right cross wind 
           rustling in the tree leaves. 

                                 BUSHNELL
                        Stop talking.

           Bushnell squints his left eye and peers through the 
           TELESCOPIC SCOPE with his right...

                                                          CROSS CUT TO:

           EXT. RIVER’S EDGE - SECONDS LATER

           Capt. Scott, Vivienne, and Jasper reach the river’s edge.

           A hardwood forest lies on the other side.

           The river is only twenty yards across, but the water is dark 
           and moves quickly.

           Vivienne eyes the rushing water.

                                 VIVIENNE
                        It’s too deep.

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                        We don’t have a choice. Come on...

           Capt. Scott grabs Jasper’s hand.

                                 CAPT. SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        Hold my hand.

           Jasper grabs his hand and the three wade into the cold 
           river...

                                                        QUICK CROSS CUT

           EXT. TIGER TANK - SAME MOMENT

           Bushnell peers down his rifle scope, breathing slowly...

                                                          CROSS CUT TO:

           EXT. RIVER - SECONDS LATER

           Within steps, the rushing water has already reached Jasper’s 
           chest.

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                             (to Jasper)
                        You’re going to have to get on my 
                        back!

           Jasper NODS, struggling to keep his balance.

           Scott reaches for him, about to lift Jasper onto his back, 
           WHEN SOMETHING CATCHES CAPT. SCOTT’S EYE AT THE EDGE OF THE 
           WOODS ACROSS THE RIVER.

           For a split second, Scott pauses...

           At the far treeline he sees A WHITE DOG. 

           The lone animal stands motionless, ghostlike, watching them 
           struggle in the river...

                                 CAPT. SCOTT (CONT’D)
                             (to himself)
                        What...

           SUDDENLY A HIGH VELOCITY BULLET PUNCHES INTO CAPT. SCOTT’S 
           STOMACH AND EXITS OUT HIS SIDE BENEATH HIS RIBS...

           Time seems to slow for an instant as a look of disbelief 
           fills Scott’s face.

           Bullet impact rushes through his body, but Scott’s gaze stays 
           on the White Dog across the river...

           THE ANIMAL’S EXPRESSION IS COMPLETELY UNMOVED, NOT EVEN 
           FLINCHING AS...

           CAPT. SCOTT LOSES HIS BALANCE AND IS SWEPT AWAY BY THE 
           POWERFUL CURRENT, UNINTENTIONALLY DRAGGING JASPER AND 
           VIVIENNE WITH HIM.

           Bushnell RACKS THE EMPTY CARTRIDGE out of his rifle as Capt. 
           Scott and the others are swept down river in the distance, 
           disappearing from view.

           Bushnell turns to the Tank Commander beside him.

                                 TANK COMMANDER
                        About a kilometer downstream the 
                        river forks in several directions.

           Bushnell Nods.

                                 BUSHNELL
                        One way or another, they all end at 
                        the sea. I want them found.

           EXT. RIVER - UNDERWATER - SECONDS LATER

           UNDERWATER, Capt. Scott fights for the surface as he’s 
           dragged through the river current.

           He hears the MUFFLED SCREAM of Vivienne somewhere out of his 
           vision...

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. RIVER SURFACE - CONTINUOUS

           Scott breaks the river surface and GASPS for air.

           He frantically scans his surroundings as the rushing water 
           pulls him downstream.

           The river is surrounded by deep forest on all sides.

           He hears Vivienne’s screaming...

                                 VIVIENNE
                        Jasper! Jasper!

           Scott turns and sees Vivienne upstream of him. 

           She shrieks with fear, unable to locate her nephew.

           Wounded, Capt. Scott takes a deep breath and dives beneath 
           the surface...

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. RIVER - UNDERWATER - CONTINUOUS

           Scott dives beneath the surface. 

           He peers around, but the moving water is so dense with 
           sediment from the rain, he can only see a few feet in front 
           of his face.

           Scott kick his legs, swimming deeper as roots and leaves 
           float by him.

           Out of air, he turns for the surface...

           Then Scott sees a glimpse of SMALL LEATHER SHOE drifting past 
           at the edge of his vision.

           Scott stretches out, reaching into the darkness, grasping...

           His hand finds the shoe, he feels the weight of the boy, and 
           pulls with all his strength until...

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. RIVER SURFACE - SECONDS LATER

           Scott breaks through the surface with Jasper in his arms. 

           Jasper COUGHS, SPITTING UP WATER from his stomach.

           As a trained paratrooper would, Scott cradles Jasper’s head 
           in his arms from behind, holding the boy’s chin above water 
           as they float downstream.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. RIVER BANK - DOWNSTREAM - AN HOUR LATER

           Dark clouds overtake the sky as the red sun sinks into the 
           horizon.

           Several kilometers downstream, Capt. Scott, Vivienne, and 
           Jasper drag themselves up a muddy river embankment.

           They hide themselves from view under a canopy of willow 
           trees.

           In the distance, they can hear GERMAN SEARCH PLANES 
           crisscrossing the sky.

           Leaning against the tree trunk, Capt. Scott winces in pain as 
           he pulls the SMALL MEDICAL PACK from the shoulder pocket of 
           his jump jacket. 
           He struggles to unsnap his jacket and check his wound...

           Vivienne kneels in the moss beside him.

                                 VIVIENNE
                        Let me.

           Vivienne gently pulls up his shirt and examines the entry 
           wound in the lower left side of his stomach.

           She is methodical. It’s clear she has done this before.

                                 VIVIENNE (CONT’D)
                        Turn on your side.

           Scott turns his body and Vivienne feels his lower back, 
           locating the exit wound. 

           She unzips the small medical pack and rips open a 
           SULFANILAMIDE ENVELOPE. 

           Jasper watches from a few feet away as Vivienne sprinkles the 
           WHITE SULPHUROUS POWDER on both sides of Scott’s wound. 

                                 VIVIENNE (CONT’D)
                        Can you sit up?

           Scott nods and slowly sits up.

           Vivienne tears open a packaged FIELD DRESSING and begins 
           wrapping his wound.

           They hear A SEARCH PLANE passing in the distance.

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                        Jasper, how far are we from the 
                        coast?

                                 JASPER
                        Ten...maybe eleven kilometers...

           Scott’s expression is serious and he absorbs the information.

           Capt. Scott can feel Jasper’s scared gaze as he watches him.

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                        I can walk that.

           Vivienne ties off the bandage and looks Scott in the eye. 

                                 VIVIENNE
                        No. You can’t and you know it.

           Scott returns her look.
                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                        I have to keep moving. My 
                        extraction window is from 0400-0600 
                        tomorrow morning. 

                                 VIVIENNE
                        They’re combing the area. We can’t 
                        go anywhere until dark.

           Suddenly, a DISTANT SOUND echoes through the woods. They stop 
           talking and listen.

           It sounds like a CELLO...

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. RIVER COTTAGE - MOMENTS LATER

           As twilight falls in the woods.

           Following the sound of the music, Scott, Vivienne, and Jasper 
           walk silently through the woods downstream.

           Scott moves slowly holding his wounded side.

           As they reach a clearing, they see a SMALL COTTAGE at the 
           river’s edge.

           On the PORCH...A SPRING-WOUND PHONOGRAPH PLAYS THE SARABANDE 
           MOVEMENT OF J.S. BACH’S CELLO SUITE#1 IN G MAJOR.

           The haunting cello music echoes through the woods. 

           An ELDERLY FRENCH COUPLE, both in their eighties, DANCE 
           TOGETHER IN THE OVERGROWN YARD. 

           The WHITE-HAIRED WOMAN moves slowly in her husband’s frail 
           arms. 

           The short, thin OLD MAN touches his forehead to his wife’s as 
           they sway together, safe in the melody of another time and 
           place. 

           As the music ends, the old man kisses her.

           Hiding in the darkening woods, Jasper touches Capt. Scott and 
           points at something...

           Scott and Vivienne follow Jasper’s sight line to a small 
           WOODEN ROW BOAT, tied up in the reeds at the river’s edge. 
           Scott motions to Vivienne and Jasper, and slowly the three 
           step back into the darkening woods, never noticed by the 
           elderly couple.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. WOODEN ROW BOAT - SEVERAL HOURS LATER - NIGHT

           Clouds pass over the moon.

           In the small wooden boat, Scott, Vivienne, and Jasper drift 
           silently down stream through the darkness.

           It has grown cold and Jasper sleeps curled up in the bottom 
           of the boat under Scott’s jump jacket.

           Capt. Scott shivers in the wooden seat. 

           Vivienne sits beside him. 

                                 VIVIENNE
                        I can smell the salt in air. We are 
                        to the sea.

           She looks at Scott’s pale face.

                                 VIVIENNE (CONT’D)
                        You’ve lost a lot of blood.

           Scott nods, gritting his teeth to keep them from chattering.

           Vivienne puts her arm around him, pulling him close.

           Scott closes his eyes, feeling the warmth of her...

           Vivienne offers a distant smile.

                                 VIVIENNE (CONT’D)
                        You know...you remind me of a crush 
                        I once had. A young man from Caen. 
                        I’d pass him in the afternoons on 
                        Rue Saint-Sauveur when I was 
                        finished at the shop. Sometimes I 
                        would follow him. His hands were 
                        always in his pockets and he needed 
                        a haircut, but he was beautiful 
                        like you. I would watch from across 
                        the street as he entered his 
                        building and wonder which window 
                        was his.
                        I imagined a life for us together. 
                        Conversations we’d someday have. 
                        The countries we’d see. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 VIVIENNE (CONT’D)
                        The sound of children that would 
                        fill the rooms of a house that 
                        would never exist. 

           Scott watches Vivienne’s face in the darkness as she speaks.

                                 VIVIENNE (CONT'D)
                        He was killed in the spring 
                        bombings of 1940. (pause) I never 
                        spoke a word to him. I never kissed 
                        him. 

           She rests her forehead against his neck.

                                 VIVIENNE (CONT’D)
                        I used to think that God watched 
                        over us. That he believed in us as 
                        we believed in him. That we were 
                        his children and he loved us... 

           There’s a beat of silence as they both look down at the 
           little boy sleeping at their feet.

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                        Now what do you think?

                                 VIVIENNE
                        I think he’s angry, because we’ve 
                        broken his heart.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. NIGHT SKY - MOMENTS LATER

           The heavens above are illuminated with millions of bright 
           stars, as far below a tiny boat drifts down a dark river with 
           a man, woman, and child...

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. WOODEN ROW BOAT - LATER

           With Jasper curled up at their feet, Capt. Scott and Vivienne 
           sleep in each others arms...

           WHEN SUDDENLY THE NIGHT SKY ABOVE THEM POPS WITH FOUR SMALL 
           RED EXPLOSIONS.

           Shadows shift over the landscape as BURNING MAGNESIUM 
           PARACHUTE FLARES DRIFT ACROSS THE SKY ILLUMINATING THE RIVER 
           LANDSCAPE IN VIBRANT RED...
           They have drifted into a GERMAN POSITION...  

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                        Get out! Now!

           ALL THREE BAIL OUT OF THE BOAT and swim for the river bank 
           as...

           A GERMAN MG34 MACHINE GUN NEST OPENS FIRE from the far side 
           of the river, arcing a stream of TRACER ROUNDS across the 
           dark water.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. RIVERBANK - SECONDS LATER

           Scott, Vivienne, and Jasper scramble up the river bank and  
           over the first rise, out of the reach of the machine gun nest 
           on the other side of the river.

           The parachute flares in the sky burn-out and instantaneously 
           the landscape falls into darkness.

           Close enough to hear the sea in the distance, the topography 
           has changed from forest to coastal poplar trees and dunes.

           Capt. Scott’s mind races as he grips his wound. 

           Blood soaks his wet jacket...

           They can hear the voices of German Soldiers shouting from the 
           far side of the river.

           Wincing in pain, Scott checks his compass, then he checks his 
           watch.

           He points westward into the dark dunes.

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                             (to Vivienne and Jasper)
                        The pick-up boat is two kilometers 
                        over those dunes. The countersign 
                        challenge is “BLUE”. The response 
                        is “MOON”. You’ve got thirty one 
                        minutes. 

           Vivienne looks Scott in the eye, understanding...

           Capt. Scott HANDS THE WATERPROOF INTELLIGENCE MAP to 
           Vivienne.
                                 CAPT. SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        If it comes to it, the Germans 
                        cannot lay eyes on that map. 

           Vivienne nods, understanding...

                                 CAPT. SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        I’ll buy you as much time as I can. 

           Vivienne hands Scott her shoulder satchel.

                                 VIVIENNE
                        There are two grenades and a 
                        Walther... 

           Jasper senses what is going on...

                                 JASPER
                             (to Capt. Scott)
                        No...wait...we’re not going without 
                        you.

           Scott kneels and looks at Jasper.

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                        Jasper, I’ll never make it there in 
                        time. The window is closing. 
                        They’ll take you and your aunt on 
                        to England.

           Capt. Scott pauses, then reaches into his shirt collar and 
           PULLS A SMALL CHAIN FROM AROUND HIS NECK. ON THE END OF THE 
           CHAIN IS A SMALL WORN SILVER PENDANT. 

           He hands it to Jasper. 

           Jasper looks at the ST. CHRISTOPHER PENDANT.

                                 CAPT. SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        I’ve had that for a long time. Now 
                        it’s yours.

           Jasper looks at him. 

           Tears well in his young eyes.

                                 JASPER
                        You’re going to die.

           Scott nods.

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                        Yes. I am.
           Scott offers a pained smile. 

                                 CAPT. SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        But you’re going to live.

           Vivienne tears up as she and Scott lock gazes... 

           THERE IS A MOMENT OF SILENT RECOGNITION BETWEEN THEM.

           A SECOND SORTIE OF PARACHUTE FLARES LAUNCH INTO THE SKY, 
           ILLUMINATING THE DARK LANDSCAPE ONCE AGAIN IN A BURNING RED 
           GLOW...

           For an instant, Vivienne touches Capt. Scott’s arm...

                                 CAPT. SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        Go.

           Without another word, Vivienne GRABS JASPER’S HAND AND THEY 
           RUN TOWARD THE SEA. 

           There is a beat as Scott WATCHES THEM DISAPPEAR OVER THE SAND 
           DUNE, THEN...

           Scott slowly LIFTS HIS SHIRT. HIS FIELD DRESSING HAS SLIPPED 
           OFF REVEALING THE BULLET HOLE IN HIS ABDOMEN.

           As a wave of pain induced nausea rushes through his body, 
           Scott fights to remain focused. 

           With his index finger, Scott pushes A BLOODY PIECE OF THE WET 
           FIELD BANDAGE INTO THE WOUND HOLE LIKE A PLUG.  

           In the distance he hears VOICES YELLING IN GERMAN, closing in 
           on his position.

           Suddenly up river, he hears the SOUND OF A MILITARY FREIGHT 
           TRAIN approaching in the distance. 

           He turns and looks toward the sound.

           As the airborne flares drift westward, Capt. Scott sees...

           A massive RAILROAD BRIDGE spanning high over the water 300 
           meters down river.

           It’s clear by his expression that Capt. Scott RECOGNIZES THE 
           DISTINCT ARCHED STONE PYLON STRUCTURE OF THE BRIDGE FROM THE 
           AERIAL RECONNAISSANCE PHOTOS FROM THE BRIEFING IN ENGLAND.

           The freight train races over the bridge sixty-feet above the 
           river, and continues up the coastline.

           Scott rises, his mind is racing... 
           He draws the WALTHER PISTOL from Vivienne’s satchel and FIRES 
           THREE SHOTS INTO THE SKY, intentionally revealing his 
           position to the nearby soldiers, then he runs for the bridge.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. MILITARY CAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Headlights cut through the early morning dark as Bushnell, 
           races in a convoy of several GERMAN MILIARY VEHICLES toward 
           Capt. Scott’s location. 

                                 BUSHNELL
                             (to the driver)
                        Faster. Drive!

           A STAFF OFFICER briefs Bushnell as they ride...

                                 STAFF OFFICER
                             (to Bushnell)
                        Sir, we’re pushing him into a 
                        bottle. He has nowhere to go...

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. RAILROAD BRIDGE EMBANKMENT - MOMENTS LATER

           In numbing pain, Scott fights his way up the blind side of 
           the overgrown railroad embankment toward the elevated bridge.

           In the distance he can hear GERMAN SHEPHERDS BARKING, picking 
           up his scent...

           As Scott reaches the top of the embankment, he drags himself 
           on his hands and knees toward a lighted GUARD HUT at the

           INT. GUARD HUT - BRIDGE - SAME MOMENT

           Inside the guard hut, TWO ARMED GERMAN SENTRIES listen to 
           their commanding officer’s orders over a military radio 
           headset...

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. GUARD HUT - BRIDGE - SECONDS LATER

           Fifteen meters away in the darkness, Capt. Scott lies on his 
           stomach, UNSCREWING THE HANDLE CAPS OFF THE TWO ‘POTATO-
           MASHER’ GRENADES from Vivienne’s satchel...

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. RIVER ROAD STAGING AREA - SECONDS LATER

           The convoy of military vehicles reaches the German staging 
           area near the river.

           Bushnell gets out the lead vehicle as DOZENS of his ELITE 
           GERMAN COMMANDOS climb down from transport trucks and 
           assemble in their hunter teams.

           A heavy set RANKING OFFICER on the scene approaches Bushnell 
           and salutes...

                                 RANKING OFFICER
                        Heil Hitler...

           Bushnell cuts him off...

                                 BUSHNELL
                        Where is he? 

           The Ranking Officer is slightly taken aback, but continues 
           talking...

                                 RANKING OFFICER
                        The perimeter is sealed off. It’s 
                        only a matter of time...

           Suddenly A VIOLENT EXPLOSION DETONATES in the far background 
           of the frame.

           EVERYONE TURNS AS THEY SEE THE BRIDGE GUARD HUT GO UP IN 
           FLAMES IN THE DISTANCE...

           A GERMAN COMMANDO yells from a distance...

                                 GERMAN COMMANDO
                             (from a distance)
                        The bridge! He’s on the Bridge...

                                 BUSHNELL
                             (to the Ranking Officer)
                        Listen to me. That man is carrying  
                        vital intelligence. Close the 
                        bridge off from both sides. Trap 
                        him. But do not kill him.
           EXT. RAILROAD BRIDGE - MOMENTS LATER

           The first light of dawn glows on the horizon.

           Capt. Scott, barely able to stand, limps his way along the 
           steel tracks toward the middle of the railroad bridge 
           viaduct.

           Fifty feet above the river, he reaches the center of the 
           bridge and SITS DOWN.

           Letting his feet hang over the edge, he holds pressure on his 
           stomach wound as he looks out over the beautiful landscape. 

           Down below he can see GERMAN FORCES SWARMING ON THE RIVER 
           BANKS.

           He peers left and right, noting Bushnell’s COMMANDOS closing 
           off his exits on both ends of the bridge.

           Advancing from both directions with their weapons raised, TWO 
           TEAMS OF 30 GERMAN COMMANDOS slowly make their way toward 
           Capt. Scott at the center of the bridge.

           Behind the infantry, TIGER TANKS pull into position on the 
           railroad embankments.

           There is no way out.

           The glow on the horizon grows as he checks his watch.

           Capt. Scott ejects the magazine from the Walther handgun and 
           checks for remaining ammunition. 

           He confirms what he already knows. The magazine is empty. 

           Scott is unarmed.

           Scott pauses for a moment, then TOSSES THE PISTOL OFF THE 
           BRIDGE, WATCHING IT FALL FIFTY FEET INTO THE RIVER BELOW.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. RAILROAD EMBANKMENT - SAME INSTANT

           Standing next to a tank at the top of the railroad 
           embankment, Bushnell watches Capt. Scott out on the bridge 
           through his BINOCULARS. 

           He SEES SCOTT DROP HIS WEAPON off the edge.
           Bushnell lowers his binoculars, thinking, CONSIDERING 
           SOMETHING IN REACTION TO WHAT HE HAS SEEN...

                                                           CUT BACK TO:

           EXT. RAILROAD BRIDGE - SECONDS LATER

           At thirty meters out onto the bridge, both German hunter 
           teams SUDDENLY HALT and HOLD THEIR POSITIONS.

           Looking at the first glimpse of the rising sun, Capt. Scott’s 
           eyes begin to grow heavy with blood loss...

           SUDDENLY HE HEARS BOOT STEPS approaching from down the 
           tracks.

           Capt. Scott lifts his head and sees Commander Bushnell 
           walking toward him on the bridge.

           Bushnell is alone. 

           He rests his hand cautiously on his holstered LUGER PISTOL as 
           he approaches Scott.

                                                          QUICK CUT TO:

           EXT. MULTIPLE SNIPER POSITIONS - SAME MOMENT

           Multiple GERMAN SNIPERS in various positions have Capt. Scott 
           dead-to-rights if he makes one wrong move...

                                                           CUT BACK TO:

           EXT. RAILROAD BRIDGE - SECONDS LATER

           As he nears, Bushnell calls out to Scott in English...

                                 BUSHNELL
                        Hello...

           Capt. Scott looks at the German Officer. 

                                 BUSHNELL (CONT’D)
                        I would like to talk with you, but 
                        I have to ask you to keep your 
                        hands visible, so my snipers don’t 
                        cut our conversation short...

           Scott’s face is slicked with cold sweat. He’s in bad shape.
                                 BUSHNELL (CONT’D)
                        What is your rank?

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                        Captain. 

                                 BUSHNELL
                        U.S. Airborne. Correct?

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                        Yes.

           More than A HUNDRED GERMAN SOLDIERS, SNIPERS, TANK CREWS, AND 
           OFFICERS watch from a distance as...

           BUSHNELL SITS DOWN ON THE EDGE OF THE BRIDGE A FEW FEET FROM 
           CAPT. SCOTT.

           They face the RISING SUN. 

           Looking at them from afar, in another time and place, they 
           could be two childhood friends tossing stones off a bridge.

           Bushnell glances at Scott’s blood soaked uniform as he holds 
           pressure on his belly.

                                 BUSHNELL
                             (re: the wound)
                        I thought I got a piece of you. I 
                        wasn’t sure. It was a long shot.

           Scott looks at Bushnell’s face.

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                        I don’t have what you want. It’s 
                        lost in the river.

           Bushnell examines his face.

                                 BUSHNELL
                        I imagined as much.

           EXT. SECLUDED BEACH - SAME MOMENT

           As the first light of day rises, Vivienne and Jasper run down 
           the last sand dune and look out at the sea.

           The water is shrouded in marine layer fog.

           The waves lap gently on the beach...
           Holding Jasper’s hand, Vivienne peers up the beach in both 
           directions, looking at the bluffs and landmarks, verifying 
           their position.

           There is a moment of doubt, where it appears as though no one 
           has come for them, then...

           SUDDENLY, FIFTY METERS OFF SHORE, JASPER SEES A FLASH OF 
           SIGNAL LIGHT...

           As he points, showing his aunt, we hear Bushnell’s voice 
           lapse in...

                                 BUSHNELL (V.O.)
                        Or the woman, perhaps she has it? 

                                                            CUT BACK TO

           EXT. VIADUCT RAILROAD BRIDGE - CENTER - SAME MOMENT

           Bushnell sits beside Capt. Scott at the center of the massive 
           bridge.

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                        I lost her in the river, too.

           Bushnell smiles and FISHES A PACK OF CIGARETTES out of his 
           uniform pocket.

           He offers one to Scott.

           Scott shakes his head.

                                 CAPT. SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        I quit when I went to jump school. 

           Bushnell smiles.

                                 BUSHNELL
                        That’s good. Very smart. I’d say 
                        you’ll live longer than me, but 
                        that might be a bit of a reach.

           Bushnell looks at the sunrise and lights a cigarette for 
           himself.

                                 BUSHNELL (CONT’D)
                        It’s the fifth of June. It’s my 
                        daughter’s birthday today. 

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                        How old?
                                 BUSHNELL
                        Ten. She’s ten years old. I haven’t 
                        see her in a year. (pause) And you? 
                        Do you have children?

           Scott looks at the river, reflecting the red sunrise as it 
           winds through the landscape at dawn.

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                        I have a boy.

           Bushnell nods...

                                 BUSHNELL
                        What’s that like? Being the father 
                        of boy...

           Scott stares into the rising sun.

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                        You have to learn as much as you 
                        teach.

           Bushnell is about to say something, when Scott interrupts 
           him...

                                 CAPT. SCOTT (CONT’D)
                        Do you happen to know what time it 
                        is?

           Bushnell checks his watch.

                                 BUSHNELL
                        Five minutes after six. 

           Bushnell knocks the ash off the tip of his cigarette. 

           He glances at the HUNDREDS OF GERMAN SOLDIERS and firepower 
           surrounding them...

                                 BUSHNELL (CONT’D)
                        Do you have a pending engagement?

           Disappearing into the fog, Vivienne and Jasper sit in the 
           center seat of a small Zodiac-like EXTRACTION RAFT, flanked 
           by SIX AMERICAN COMMANDOS, HEADED OUT SAFELY TO A SHIP AT 
           SEA...

           Bushnell is awaiting a response as Scott stares up the river 
           valley.

           IN THE FAR DISTANCE, BACKLIT BY THE RISING RED SUN, THREE 
           SHAPES APPEAR, FLYING JUST ABOVE THE WATER, GROWING LARGER BY 
           THE SECOND, COMING IN FAST...

                                 CAPT. SCOTT
                        Yeah. I do.

           EXT. RIVER VALLEY - SAME MOMENT

           RACING AT ATTACK SPEED ONLY 50 METERS ABOVE THE WATER, THREE 
           P-51 MUSTANGS LOADED WITH TWO 1000lb POUND BOMBS EACH, FLY IN 
           TIGHT FORMATION...

           INT. P-51 COCKPIT - LEAD FIGHTER - A SECOND LATER 

           As they approach, the PILOT of the lead fighter sees the 
           unexpected GERMAN INFANTRY and ARMOR PRESENCE on the bridge.

           Flying close enough to see each other’s facial expressions, 
           the LEAD MUSTANG PILOT MAKES A FIST WITH HIS HAND and signals 
           to the other two PILOTS positioned just off his wing tips...

           BUSHNELL SEES THE MUSTANGS COMING IN LOW AND SEPARATE INTO AN 
           AIR TO SURFACE ATTACK FORMATION. 

           ALL THREE MUSTANGS OPEN FIRE IN UNISON, BENDING RELENTLESS 
           STREAMS OF .50 CALIBER CANNON FIRE ACROSS THE TOP OF THE 
           BRIDGE...

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. VIADUCT RAILROAD BRIDGE  - CONTINUOUS

           EXPOSED, BUSHNELL’S SOLDIERS HAVE NOWHERE TO HIDE. THEY’RE 
           CUT TO RIBBONS BY THE MUSTANG’S BRUTAL CANNON FIRE.
           CHAOS SHREDS THEIR RANKS AS BUSHNELL’S MEN ARE DECIMATED BY 
           THE LETHAL PRECISION OF THE PILOTS. 

           OVERTAKEN WITH PANIC, THE SOLDIERS RUN FOR THE EMBANKMENTS ON 
           EITHER SIDE OF THE BRIDGE, TRAMPLING THEIR DEAD AS THEY 
           RETREAT. 

           THE PLANES SEPARATE, RISE, AND VECTOR IN DIFFERENT 
           DIRECTIONS.

           THE LEAD MUSTANG BANKS HARD AND RISES, RELEASING A ONE-
           THOUSAND POUND BOMB ABOVE THE WESTERN BRIDGE EMBANKMENT. 

           AS THE MUSTANGS CLIMB, THE BOMB STRIKES A TIGER TANK ON THE 
           EMBANKMENT, EXPLODING WITH INCREDIBLE FORCE, INCINERATING THE 
           TANK AND A SQUAD OF GERMAN SOLDIERS.

           But before Bushnell can fire, Scott, staring into the rising 
           sun, JUMPS FROM THE BRIDGE...

           CANNONS, STRAFING THE SCATTERED GERMAN POSITIONS ALONG THE 
           RIVERBANKS.

           THEN ALL THREE MUSTANGS CLIMB AND SEPARATE, PARCELLING OFF 
           THE BRIDGE...

           AS ALL THREE AIRCRAFT RELEASE THEIR BOMBS...

           THE SCENE AUDIO COMPLETELY DROPS OUT. 

           AS THE BOMBS FALL, ALL WE HEAR IN THE FOLLOWING SEQUENCE IS 
           THE BEATING OF A HUMAN HEART.

           AS THE WEAPONS DETONATE, SECTIONS OF THE BRIDGE VIOLENTLY 
           EXPLODE, BENDING STEEL, SHATTERING STONE, SENDING A POWERFUL 
           SHOCK WAVE ROCKING THE ENTIRE STRUCTURE...

           SCOTT’S BODY, IN SLOW MOTION, TUMBLES DOWNWARD AS THE BRIDGE 
           COLLAPSES IN FLAMES ALL AROUND HIM.

           AN INSTANT BEFORE CAPT. SCOTT HITS THE RIVER SURFACE...

           THE SOUND OF THE HEARTBEAT STOPS...

           AND WE SEE HIS BODY SILENTLY HIT THE WATER.

           EXT. BUSHNELL’S COUNTRY HOME - GERMANY - VERY SAME MOMENT 

           THE AUDIO REMAINS COMPLETELY SILENT AS WE SEE...

           A YOUNG GERMAN SOLDIER in uniform leads a BEAUTIFUL BLACK 
           HORSE down out of the transport trailer and walks the animal 
           toward...

           IDA (10), Bushnell’s daughter in a white birthday dress... 

           THOUGH WE CANNOT HEAR THE JOYOUS SOUNDS IDA MAKES, WE SEE HER 
           SCREAMING WITH EXCITEMENT, EYES WIDE, GRINNING IN THE MORNING 
           SUNLIGHT AS SHE ACCEPTS THE REINS OF THE HORSE FROM THE 
           SOLDIER...

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

           There is a long beat of silent blackness, then...

           SLOWLY, WE HEAR THE AUDIO RETURNING WITH THE RISING SOUND OF 
           THOUSANDS OF HUMAN VOICES, CHEERING IN CELEBRATION.  

           SUPER TITLE: MAY 8, 1945 - VICTORY IN EUROPE DAY

                                                               FADE TO:

           EXT. LONDON - MAY 8, 1945 - DAY

           A LONDON SQUARE is filled with THOUSANDS OF CHEERING 
           CIVILIANS... 

           GRINNING CHILDREN pile onto STATUES for a better view as...

           CROWDS line the streets waving VICTORY FLAGS, yelling out 
           their gratitude as... 
           PARADES OF ALLIED SOLDIERS in uniform march through the 
           streets, laughing and smiling at... 

           PRETTY LONDON GIRLS riding on the front of SHERMAN TANKS, 
           drinking champagne with the morning sun on their faces. 

           There is an overwhelming, collective sense of life...

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. VIVIENNE’S TOBACCO AND CANDY - SAME MOMENT

           A SMALL LONDON TOBACCO AND CANDY SHOP. 

           A PAINTED SIGN above the door reads:

                                VIVIENNE’S TOBACCO AND CANDY

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. VIVIENNE’S TOBACCO AND CANDY - SAME MOMENT

           The cheering crowds pass by outside the shop as...

           A SINGLE SHAFT OF SUNLIGHT passes through tapering crack in 
           the shop window curtain, falling across the OPEN HAND of 
           Jasper, sitting alone behind the counter of his Aunt 
           Vivienne’s shop.

           Lost in thought, Jasper stares at the silver St. Christopher 
           pendant in his open hand... 

           CLOSE ON PENDANT: ENGRAVED IN THE SOFT SILVER, IS THE WORN 
           IMAGE OF A MAN GRIPPING A CHILD IN HIS ARMS AS HE FIGHTS TO 
           CROSS THE CURRENT OF A FURIOUS RIVER... 

           Suddenly Jasper hears a man’s VOICE...

                                 CAPT. SCOTT (O.S.)
                        Hey kid, do you sell peppermint 
                        candy here?

           Jasper looks up and sees Capt. Scott, STANDING OUTSIDE THE 
           SCREEN DOOR OF THE SHOP. 

           Scott wears a BACK BRACE and holds a CANE. The left breast of 
           his DRESS UNIFORM is DECORATED WITH COMBAT RIBBONS AND A 
           MEDAL OF VALOR.

           Jasper cannot speak, as if he’s not sure if Scott is real or 
           imagined. 
           At that moment, Vivienne enters the room in a spring dress 
           from the back hallway. 

           As Vivienne sees Capt. Scott, she stops suddenly, the breath 
           stolen from her body. 

           Their gazes lock...

           There is a beat of silence, then without speaking a word, SHE 
           MOTIONS FOR HIM TO ENTER... 

           We hear the creaking sound of the screen door as Scott steps 
           inside. 

           And as the world outside celebrates the raw joy of being 
           alive...

           Vivienne, never breaking Scott’s gaze, rushes forward and 
           KISSES HIM. 

                                                          CUT TO BLACK.
