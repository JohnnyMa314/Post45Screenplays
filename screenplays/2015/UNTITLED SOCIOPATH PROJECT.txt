           FADE IN. 

           INT. A’LOURE RESTAURANT. SOHO. NIGHT.

           The SoHo dining scene is constantly fluctuating and this is 
           the “it” place of the moment. Absurdly overpriced and maybe 
           too stodgy for its own good, but the reviews are killer and 
           the reservations are murder. Honestly, who the fuck books a 
           table four months in advance?!

                                 READE
                        I know I have to stop trying to 
                        control everyone, it’s a bad shade 
                        on me. If only I could just take a 
                        breath and evaluate what I really 
                        need from the situation. 

           READE MCCARTHY, 32, isn’t one of those four-month-out types 
           if you’re wondering. He’d be humiliated if you even thought 
           that. No, he knows a guy. Not the maitre d’. Nor the owner. 
           He twice met the dude a married shareholder’s fucking, and 
           uses that as collateral for the best table in the house.

                                 READE (CONT’D)
                        But it’s difficult for me to just 
                        stand idly by and watch the drones 
                        I work with settle for less than 
                        what I would bargain for. 

           Reade is effortless. Glistening skin. Dark eyes. Sandy blonde 
           hair lifted in a delicate wave. Strangers glancing twice over 
           their shoulder to make sure he’s not a celebrity. 

                                 READE (CONT’D)
                        And yes, maybe that’s unfair to 
                        constantly appraise my colleagues 
                        next to me, but it’s a standard. 
                        It’s a standard, and though I’ve 
                        raised the bar, it can’t be too 
                        high for them. Can it?

           His fiancée, TASHA CAMDEN, 28, has the exotic looks most guys 
           drop jaws for, coupled with a girl-next-door humility. 

                                 READE (CONT’D)
                        Anybody who is talented at 
                        everything must be truly fucked up 
                        in the head. And that’s what makes 
                        us tragically unique. 

           Reade is suddenly aware he’s been ignored most of the date. 
                                 READE (CONT’D)
                        What is this? You’ve barely touched 
                        your risotto. 

                                 TASHA
                        What a treat! The illustrious Reade 
                        McCarthy expressed interest in me. 
                        In what I’m eating. 

                                 READE
                        Can’t I be curious? I’m allowed to 
                        be curious. I specifically brought 
                        you here because it’s a Wednesday, 
                        which I know is your cheat day. If 
                        anything I should be insulted! 
                        That’s incredibly thoughtful of me. 
                        And considerate, to track when you 
                        do and do not prefer to eat carbs.

                                 TASHA
                        Why do you talk like that?

                                 READE
                        Like what?

                                 TASHA
                             (snapping)
                        Like that. Sometimes I feel like 
                        I’m engaged to a walking thesaurus. 

                                 READE
                        A walking thesaurus with an eight 
                        inch cock and investment portfolio 
                        the “married-you” could retire on.

           Reade reaches for the Pinot Noir, obliging her with another 
           hefty pour. 

                                 READE (CONT’D)
                        Let’s get drunk and do something a 
                        little bad so we know what it’s 
                        like to behave. 

           She smirks. 

                                 TASHA
                        What contest in Hell did I win to 
                        deserve all of you? 

                                 READE
                        Come on. Help me finish this wine. 

                                 TASHA
                        Thirty minutes. Again.
                                 READE
                        Again?

                                 TASHA
                        You left me waiting thirty minutes. 
                        Again, Reade. Again. That’s why I’m 
                        angry with you. And that’s why I’ve 
                        lost my appetite. 

                                 READE
                        Tasha, you know how I can get. All 
                        the campaigning for this promotion 
                        has me frazzled.

                                 TASHA
                        If I hear this one more time--

                                 READE
                        I’m sorry, I only wanted to look my 
                        best for you. I caught a glimpse of 
                        my reflection leaving the office, 
                        and just had to go home and shower. 
                        My hair hasn’t been the same since 
                        my stylist moved to Bushwick, and, 
                        oh God, Brooklyn? It’s not like I 
                        can just drop everything to commute 
                        to that shithole for a cut. 

                                 TASHA
                        God forbid you find a strand out of 
                        place. 

                                 READE
                        I apologize. Profusely. I wish I 
                        wasn’t so weak. In lighter news, 
                        you have to try this day cream I 
                        found. Not yet FDA approved, and 
                        using salmon placenta to repair 
                        your tissue. Gives you the most 
                        astounding youthful glow. 

                                 TASHA
                             (beat)
                        Is this at your place?

                                 READE
                        Yes of course, babe, it’s the tiny 
                        green jar on my vanity. 

                                 TASHA
                        Let’s go. 
           INT. READE’S SOHO LOFT. BEDROOM. NIGHT.

           SLAP. SLAP. SLAP. Reade pulls tightly on Tasha’s hair as he 
           thrusts into her from behind. Sweat drips from his brow. He 
           feels his moist forehead. 

           A JAZZ PIANO VINYL plays on a gramophone in the background. 

           Without missing a beat, he turns to face the mirrored walls 
           on the opposite end of the bedroom and begins adjusting his 
           hair, re-volumizing it. 

           LATER IN THE NIGHT:

           Reade sleeps next to Tasha, both wearing satin night masks. 

           THE NEXT MORNING:

           Reade saunters through his bedroom wearing a clay face mask 
           with a bath towel wrapped around his lean, chiseled waist. 
           Tasha is still curled up beneath the covers, fast asleep. 

           He throws open his closet to reveal racks of color-sorted 
           suits and ties. 

           Reade carefully selects a charcoal gray suit and a sky blue 
           skinny necktie.

           IN HIS MASTER BATHROOM:

           Reade puts the final touches on his hair, now the flawless 
           wave we’re used to. He takes a dab of eye cream and gently 
           massages it on his lower eyelids. 

           Lastly, he dips his fingers into a TINY GREEN JAR, the day 
           cream he prior mentioned, and methodically moisturizes his 
           cheeks. He flashes a winning grin at himself. 

           INT. SUBWAY “Q” TRAIN. DAWN.

           It’s early morning. Earlier than most commuters even need to 
           think about being awake for work. But that’s Reade for you. A 
           proud insomniac.

           The station at this time of day is unsettling. Doesn’t quite 
           seem dangerous. Just empty. Lonely. 

           Reade, in his constant state of overdressed, looks fantastic 
           in the suit he elected to wear. He glances down at his cell 
           to check for any incoming e-mails, of course, to find none. 

           Far too early. 
           He drafts a motivational e-mail to himself:

                                       FROM: READE MCCARTHY. TO: READE MCCARTHY. 

                                         SUBJECT: EXCEED YOUR OWN EXPECTATIONS. 

           He selects DELAYED DELIVERY. And then presses SEND.

           Typing another e-mail for his future self:

                                           SUBJECT: BE STRONG. REMAIN VICTORIOUS. 

           Again, DELAYED DELIVERY. SEND.

           Someone SHUFFLES in the distance. Reade glances down to see a 
           strange MAN IN A TATTERED JACKET also waiting for the local. 

           Something about this strikes him as peculiar. Having been on 
           this routine for years, he’s admittedly unnerved to encounter 
           another person at this hour.

           The LIGHT from the approaching train peeks into the station. 
           Reade straightens, pocketing his phone. 

           Turning to THE STRANGER, Reade notices his atypical behavior: 
           The man scoots to the lip of the platform. Facing an oncoming 
           train, back to us, positioning his feet adjacent to the edge 
           of the yellow tile. Just inches from the drop to the tracks.

                                 READE
                             (suddenly concerned)
                        Hey, buddy--

           The train is closer. The LIGHT further covers the platform.

                                 READE (CONT’D)
                        Bro, you had one too many vodka 
                        tonics, back away from the edge. 
                        You don’t want to be just another 
                        New York statistic. 

           But he doesn’t. Instead, he leans further over the side. Arm 
           first, then neck, then head. Arching into the oncoming train.

           He’s fucking suicidal! Reade rushes towards him. 

                                 READE (CONT’D)
                        Sir? Hey-

           The Train SQUEALS into the station. Just seconds away. 

                                 READE (CONT’D)
                        Don’t. DON’T! Please. FOR THE LOVE 
                        OF GOD. IT’S NOT WORTH IT! 
           The stranger loses his footing...

                                 READE (CONT’D)
                        I’M BEGGING YOU!!

           CLUNK. CLUNK. The train rounds the corner and its HEADLIGHTS 
           temporarily blind Reade. 

           Almost afraid to open his eyes in the aftermath, he squints, 
           yet finds this stranger... still standing on the platform.  

           The man’s alive. One piece. Staring back at him? 

           Hard to tell. The flickering subway light shadows his face. 

           Reade tries to focus his gaze, study his features, but flash 
           blindness has greatly compromised his sight. 

           Nervous, he slinks back into the vacant SUBWAY CAR in front 
           of him. The doors close. He starts off. 

           That’s a fucking weird start to the day. 

           INT. BRYANT PARK OFFICE. READE’S CORNER. DAY.

           Doing pushups with his necktie flung over his shoulder, Reade 
           rises into, and drops from, frame. Again and again. 

           Pulling back, we see how impressive his corner office is. The 
           sunrise snakes its way through floor-to-ceiling windows. 

           EXT. BRYANT PARK. DAY.

           Like clockwork, Reade is the local coffee cart’s very first 
           customer of the day. The VENDOR hands him his beverage:

                                 COFFEE VENDOR
                        Medium soy latte. Splenda on the 
                        bottom. Extra shot. Upside-down.

           Reade clasps his hands together and “bows.”

                                 READE
                        Arigato. 

                                 COFFEE VENDOR
                        The Asian schtick is getting tired. 
                        I’m Puerto Rican. 

                                 READE
                        Did I ask for your life story?
           INT. BRYANT PARK OFFICE. DAY. 

           Later that morning, Reade tosses his empty latte cup in the 
           trash. Strutting down the hallway, he passes a blonde woman 
           with fake breasts pushed up to her neck. 

           This is VALERIE HANK, 38, a competing publicist at his firm. 

                                 VALERIE
                        Reade, those cups aren’t compost, 
                        you color blind cocksucker, they’re 
                        recyclable. 

                                 READE
                        You’re the expert, Val. Your tits 
                        are last month’s Tupperware. 

           INT. BRYANT PARK OFFICE. READE’S CORNER. DAY.

           With dark eyes focused at the monitor, Reade pounds out words 
           on his MacBook, further filling out a document.  

           BING. An e-mail pops up...

                                                        FROM: READE MCCARTHY.

                                                 EXCEED YOUR OWN EXPECTATIONS. 

           Reade smirks, absorbing the memo. Deletes the message. 

           BING. Another one from himself...

                                    WE ALL STARTED DYING THE MINUTE WE WERE BORN.

           Reade crooks an eyebrow. 

           The PHONE RINGS. 

                                 ASSISTANT (O.S.)
                             (answering)
                        Reade McCarthy’s office.

           BING. Another one...

                                          YOU SHOULD HAVE BEEN UNDER THAT TRAIN.

           A mousy brunette, his well-dressed assistant, DANIELLE, pops 
           through the door.

           BING. Another one...

                                                  BE STRONG. REMAIN VICTORIOUS.
                                 DANIELLE
                        I have...

                                 READE
                             (don’t give a shit)
                        No. 

           Reade deletes the unusual e-mails, and keeps typing. Danielle 
           returns to her desk. 

                                 DANIELLE (O.S.)
                        Sorry, he’s not available, may I 
                        have him return?

           BING... 

                                       YOUR ASSISTANT IS EVEN UGLIER WHEN SHE LIES.

           Can somebody be watching him? Concerned, he turns to briefly 
           glance out his window at streets of people below him.

                                 READE
                        Dani, who was that?

                                 DANIELLE
                             (hurrying back)
                        Aras Harris.

                                 READE 
                        Get him back please. 

           She hastily exits. We hear her dialing. 

                                 DANIELLE (O.S.)
                        Aras, I have Reade for you.
                             (then...)
                        Aras is on one! 

           Reade activates his earpiece. 

                                 READE
                        Guten Tag! You caught me working on 
                        the talking points for the carpet 
                        tonight, pal. 

           An awkward beat of silence. Reade’s icy exterior melts away. 

                                 READE (CONT’D)
                        Aras. Hey, buddy. Hey, it’s OK to 
                        cry. It’s me. Listen, I lost my dad 
                        when I was your age too. I did. And 
                        it ruined me for a while.

                                 READE (CONT’D)
                        Every single day I couldn’t help 
                        but think “I wish my dad was here.” 
                        You know? I wanted him to see what 
                        I’d become so he’d be proud of me. 
                        So goddamn proud. 

           He removes himself from his desk, crossing to the window.

                                 READE (CONT’D)
                        But you have to trust me when I say 
                        you’ll learn to live for those 
                        moments. Those moments when you 
                        look out at the world you created 
                        for yourself, and think “I did this 
                        for him. Something inside of me 
                        wouldn’t stop until I knew I’d made 
                        him happy.” And you. You, Aras. You 
                        have the drive already, but fuck, 
                        I’m so excited to see what’s next. 
                        You’ll really blow him away. 

           INT. BRYANT PARK OFFICE. READE’S CORNER. DAY. LATER.

           Reade hurries out of his office, closing the door behind him. 

                                 READE
                        Danielle, do you have Twitter?

                                 DANIELLE
                        I’m a 25 year old single girl from 
                        Astoria that loves food trucks. Of 
                        course I do. How else would I know 
                        where they park?

                                 READE
                        A simple “yes” would have made that 
                        less embarrassing. Can you find out 
                        how to get one of those blue checks 
                        by my name?

                                 DANIELLE
                        You want to be verified?

                                 READE
                        Just look into it, please. 

           As he leaves, he calls out over his shoulder:

                                 READE (CONT’D)
                        Early lunch. Hold my calls. 
           INT. SUBWAY “L” TRAIN. DAY.

           Reade stands on the platform for an L train to BROOKLYN. 

           INT. “L” TRAINCAR. DAY.

           Reade clutches the railing of the train with a handkerchief 
           gripped tightly in his right hand. 

           EXT. SUBWAY “L” STATION. BROOKLYN. DAY.

           Ascending the stairs, Reade extracts a small bottle of hand 
           sanitizer from his pocket to lather his palms. 

           EXT. BEDFORD AVENUE. DAY.

           Reade sneers at the BEARDED MUSICIANS and THIN HIPSTERS, who 
           noticeably are not at work mid-afternoon on a weekday. 

           INT. BROOKLYN APARTMENT. DAY. LATER.

           Reade, suit jacket off and tie undone, unpacks groceries into 
           a barren refrigerator: almond milk, avocados, Pinot Grigio.

           Behind him, a slim blonde woman appears, naked, likely seven 
           years his junior, and absolutely stunning. 

           This is NICOLETTE: unapologetically impulsive, in a constant 
           prescription drug-induced haze, and thus unpredictable.

           Her green eyes are locked in front of her, staring out, as if 
           she’s searching for something she misplaced. 

           Reade turns toward her, enjoys gawking at her firm, flawless 
           body, then rushes to close the blinds:

                                 READE
                        Jesus. Nik, we’re at street level.

                                 NICOLETTE
                        I’m a good person.

                                 READE
                        Nobody said you aren’t.

                                 NICOLETTE
                        Thousands of girls tear couples 
                        apart for all the wrong reasons. 
                        There isn’t a right reason to ruin 
                        a relationship, I know that.

                                 NICOLETTE (CONT'D)
                        And I’m a good person. But I don’t 
                        want to waste away here anymore.

                                 READE
                        Then don’t.

           Reade yanks a blanket off the couch to cover her. 

                                 NICOLETTE
                        I think I still love you. I might. 
                        I’m obsessed with you, I have been 
                        ever since the first day you looked 
                        in my eyes. Everyone else has come 
                        and gone. And you? You left for a 
                        while. But then you came back, and 
                        I don’t want you to leave again.

           She brushes back his hair, hopeful.

                                 NICOLETTE (CONT’D)
                        It’s just a ring. And a promise.

                                 READE
                        Give it some time.

                                 NICOLETTE
                        You’re lying to her. You’re engaged 
                        and you’re here with me. Everything 
                        is just a few whispered words, but 
                        I don‘t want that. I’m not afraid 
                        of people thinking less of us.  

           Reade moves away from her, grabs his jacket off the rack. 

                                 NICOLETTE (CONT’D)
                        No, you’re right. Let’s keep being 
                        dishonest. It’s much more exciting. 

                                 READE
                        You have no idea how any of this 
                        works. All I am right now is my 
                        reputation. It’s important to me.

                                 NICOLETTE
                        You mean your life with Tasha?

                                 READE
                        Among other things.

                                 NICOLETTE
                        It’s a lie.
                                 READE
                        Nicolette, that’s my job. My job is 
                        to maintain an image. It’s the only 
                        one I’ve got.   

                                 NICOLETTE
                        You’ll love the people we used to 
                        be, I promise you. You should be  
                        making love to me. Out there with 
                        me. Marrying me. I want that.

                                 READE
                        I don’t think you do.

           INT. BLS LIMOUSINE. NIGHT.

           A handsome (in a kind of ugly way) movie star fidgets in the 
           side seats of a limousine. 

           This is ARAS HARRIS, 27, an “overnight sensation” (despite 
           his nine year climb to the top) with dark flat-ironed hair, 
           sporting a vest and the skinniest jeans. 

           Next to him, Reade sits, fervently consumed by his phone. 

                                 ARAS
                        How much longer?

           His manager, ESTELLE STEK, 40, locks eyes with him across the 
           car. She’s a mildly attractive woman who substituted a family 
           for a lucrative career and perfectly sculpted face.  

                                 ESTELLE
                        Five minutes. If that. We’re only 
                        driving around the block until 
                        Camilla’s limousine hits the area. 
                        Press needs you at the same time.

           Aras subtly swigs his inhaler. Reade pats him on the knee.

                                 READE
                        Settle down, champ, everything’s 
                        under control. You need a line of 
                        Peruvian flake to loosen up?

                                 ARAS
                        You know I can’t if I have a show 
                        tomorrow, but I’ll bet you a bill 
                        that’s why Camilla’s not here.

                                 READE
                             (shrugging)
                        Usually makes her prompt. 
           Estelle’s iPhone lights up. She checks the memo.  

                                 ESTELLE
                        They’re pulling up to security, 
                        let’s head over.

           Noticing Aras’ tense demeanor, Reade slides closer.

                                 READE
                        You OK?

                                 ARAS
                        I just wish my Dad was here.

                                 READE
                        Aras, this is hard for you, I know.  
                        But those cheers are for you. Just 
                        like we dreamed of. They’re excited 
                        for you. Take tonight to enjoy what 
                        you deserve. All of that hard work. 
                        Not to mention, there are dozens of 
                        beautiful girls to enjoy here also.

           Aras smiles. Throws on a large pair of black Diesel shades.

                                 READE (CONT’D)
                        Don’t wear the glasses.

                                 ARAS
                        You’re not my stylist.

           EXT. ZIEGFELD THEATRE. NIGHT.

           Their limousine pulls to the curb of the historic Ziegfeld 
           Theatre. A pair of bright shoes step out onto the pavement. 
           Girls SCREAM. Cameras FLASH. 

           Aras loves every minute of it. 

           Aras lulls for a second, just absorbing it. Breathing it all 
           in. He struts to the press line where his leading lady, the 
           ravishing, thin, brunette beauty CAMILLA LAKE stands.

           Seeing him, Camilla throws her arms around his neck, kissing 
           him deeply on the lips. The CROWD goes wild.

                                 PHOTOGRAPHER
                        Are you two a thing?

                                 CAMILLA
                        A true lady doesn’t kiss and tell!

           Camilla giggles, indiscreetly brushing Aras’ arm.
                                 ANOTHER PHOTOGRAPHER
                        Hey Aras, why don’t you take off 
                        your shades?

                                 ARAS
                        Hey, why don’t you fuck yourself?

           The PAPARAZZI chuckle. As does Camilla, all flirt. 

                                 CAMILLA
                        Oh, Aras. You’re so edgy.

           Aras catches his manager’s disapproving reaction.  

                                 FIELD REPORTER
                        Aras, is it true that your father 
                        passed away last week?

                                 ARAS
                        Someone did their homework.

           Aras keeps at it, posing and smiling with Camilla. Seconds 
           later, Reade approaches and whispers in his ear:

                                 READE
                        We have to do some quick interviews 
                        with Entertainment Tonight, MTV and 
                        Buzzfeed. Then we head inside.

                                 ARAS
                        You tell them if anyone mentions my 
                        fucking Dad heads will roll. 

                                                       SMASH CUT TO ...

           INT. ELECTRIC ROOM - DREAM HOTEL. NIGHT.

           The after party! Hollywood bigwigs flown in on private jets, 
           routinely feigning to be as cultured as New Yorkers. Glamour. 
           Gossip. Open bar. Pushing the food around on their plates 
           instead of eating it. 

           Reade weaves his way through conversations with his fiancée, 
           Tasha, in a remarkable cocktail dress, on his arm. 

                                 TASHA
                        I’ve noticed you’re still having 
                        trouble sleeping.

                                 READE
                        You know me, Tasha, I’m an animal. 
                        I’m a Neanderthal in tune with his 
                        circadian rhythms. 
                                 TASHA
                        I just worry about you. It’s my job 
                        now as your future wife. I need you 
                        to take better care of yourself. 

                                 READE
                             (truly touched)
                        Babe.  

                                 TASHA
                        I’d probably be marrying a stock 
                        broker if it wasn’t for you. 

                                 READE
                        Don’t thank me just yet. Least not 
                        until I’m partner. 

           Tasha releases her grip on his arm. Twirls to the MUSIC. 

                                 TASHA
                        Dance with me!

                                 READE
                        I’d love to, but I’m technically 
                        supposed to be working right now, 
                        so no visible fun. 

                                 TASHA
                        Oh, come on, Reade. Please? For me? 
                        You’re always so gloom-and-doom and 
                        every-party’s-the-same, but these 
                        are so exciting to me. I never get 
                        to do this. And, as a guest here, I 
                        ask that you dance. With me.

           Reade takes Tasha closer, and they sweetly slow dance to the 
           JAZZ STANDARD echoing over the monitors. 

           The stuck-up CROWD around them barely parts to make room.

                                 READE
                        One year from now, let’s remember 
                        that this was the night we danced 
                        in the middle of a sea of strangers 
                        for the first time. 

                                 TASHA
                        How come?

                                 READE
                             (spinning her)
                        Because I want every moment with 
                        you to be special. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 READE (CONT'D)
                        And in a year, on our “waltz in a 
                        pocket of cranky strangers” 
                        anniversary, we’ll both look back 
                        at this and it will all seem so 
                        goddamn gorgeous. 

           INT. TAXI. NIGHT.

           Tasha stares out the window at the city lights passing her by 
           as their cab speeds through Union Square. Reade, on the other 
           hand, fumbles on his phone.  

           The middle-aged CABDRIVER notices Tasha’s adoring expression. 

                                 CABBIE
                        New to the city?

           She’s pulled from her trance. 

                                 TASHA
                        Me? Oh, God, no. I’ve lived on this 
                        island my whole life.  

                                 CABBIE
                        You just have that wonder in your 
                        eyes. Like you’ve never seen any of 
                        this before. 

                                 TASHA
                        Everything keeps changing so much, 
                        it’s like I haven’t. It gives me 
                        something new to look at. Something 
                        new to fall in love with.

           She pats Reade’s leg, who still doesn’t budge from his phone.

                                 TASHA (CONT’D)
                        My fiancé here is from California, 
                        but he’s rounding on year nine in 
                        the city. Just one more until he 
                        becomes official. 

           Tasha cracks up at her own joke, noticing he’s ignoring her. 

                                 TASHA (CONT’D)
                        Reade, we had a lovely evening why 
                        are you ruining it?

           ANGLE ON: Reade’s cell phone, as he scrolls through a series 
           of candid photos from a party on a social media site. 

           SCROLLING: Business suits drinking. Mingling. Laughing.
                                 READE
                        I can’t fucking believe it. 

           Rage burns behind his eyes. 

           ANOTHER PHOTO: we recognize ARAS among the nameless faces. 

                                 READE (CONT’D)
                        Sorry, it’s not you, babe, I just. 
                        I can’t believe it. 

           The taxi slows to a stop at a red light. 

           Reade FLINGS OPEN the vehicle door. 

                                 TASHA
                        Reade!

           He SLAMS it shut and leans in though the window.

                                 READE
                        I’m really sorry. I’ll see you back 
                        at my loft. There are some people I 
                        need to destroy. 

           EXT. UNION SQUARE. NEW YORK CITY. NIGHT.

           Reade hails another cab. Hops in, and barks directions.

           INT. UPPER WEST SIDE APARTMENT COMPLEX LOBBY. NIGHT.

           Reade confidently approaches the overworked DOORMAN thumbing 
           apathetically through an Entertainment Weekly at his desk. 

                                 READE
                        My name’s Donovan Spire. I’m here 
                        for the mixer at Valerie Hank’s 
                        condo, I was told to check in at 
                        the front desk. 

                                 DOORMAN
                        Last name again?

                                 READE
                        Spire. First name: Donovan. 
                        Technically the third by blood in 
                        my family, but I’m sure she doesn’t 
                        have that on your list. 
           INT. VALERIE’S UPPER WEST SIDE APARTMENT. MOMENTS LATER. 

           The apartment door gently opens, and Reade coolly pushes his 
           way through the crowd of INDUSTRY TYPES. His vaguely panicked 
           demeanor is replaced with an icy determination as he beelines 
           directly to VALERIE, a colleague from his firm (the one with 
           the stellar fake tits we remember from earlier).

           Noticing him, Valerie excuses herself from the conversation 
           she was having.

                                 VALERIE
                        Don’t cause a scene. 

                                 READE
                        Said the drama queen of the year. 

                                 VALERIE
                        I’m impressed you managed to find 
                        us, considering I made quite the 
                        effort to not invite you. 

                                 READE
                        You think there’s anything on this 
                        planet you can get away with that I 
                        won’t find out about?

                                 VALERIE
                        Well, practice makes perfect. 

           Reade pivots to catch eyes with Aras, in the corner, somberly 
           drinking a beer and chatting with a small group. 

                                 READE
                             (motioning to Aras)
                        Do you know who that is?

                                 VALERIE
                        Aras Harris.

                                 READE
                        My client. 

                                 VALERIE
                        Our client.

                                 READE
                        Spare me all the brainwash “we’re a 
                        team” bullshit, Valerie. He’s my 
                        client. So why the fuck is he in 
                        your apartment instead of his after 
                        party as the press schedule that I 
                        fucking prepared for him dictates?
                                 VALERIE
                        My guess is that Aras was sick of 
                        being carted around like your show 
                        pony and wanted a more intimate 
                        event to celebrate in without being 
                        gawked at for not grieving. 

           Something changes in Reade. We see it in his eyes. 

                                 READE
                        As the bigger person here, I refuse 
                        to stoop to your level. Let’s try  
                        something I like to call the 
                        “compliment sandwich.”

           He speaks articulately in a collected, but menacing, manner. 

                                 READE (CONT’D)
                        Compliment: Your view is gorgeous. 
                        Better than mine. You must be great 
                        at sucking your landlord’s cock. 
                        Criticism: Don’t fool yourself for 
                        a fucking second that I don’t know 
                        you’ve been organizing this party 
                        for the past month for no reason 
                        other than Barbara’s impending 
                        “retirement” and your misguided 
                        attempt to gain stake at the firm. 
                        That’s about as likely as Donovan 
                        Spire having any desire to soberly 
                        fuck you, whose name I dropped at 
                        the door tonight, knowing he’d be 
                        as far away as possible from that 
                        dry, pathetic pussy of yours that 
                        is only further proof that God has 
                        an impeccable sense of humor. I’d 
                        be worried that Aras accepted the 
                        invitation if I didn’t know for a 
                        fact that if anything like this 
                        happens again I will drag you by 
                        your hair onto 74th Street and slam 
                        your fucking teeth into the curb 
                        until your neck snaps. 

           Reade doesn’t break his gaze with Valerie. 

                                 READE (CONT’D)
                        And compliment: I admire that a 
                        woman of your age still has the 
                        flexibility to take photographs 
                        bending over in the mirror. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 READE (CONT’D)
                        It’s funny how easy these things 
                        are to locate when we forget to 
                        lock our MacBooks. And it’s that 
                        much easier to disseminate.  

           Beaming, Reade backs away, leaving Val stunned and violated. 

           Turning, he slugs a mixed-drink from a nearby serving tray, 
           gulping it down. Then swigs a separate vodka shot. 

           EXT. UPPER WEST SIDE. NIGHT.

           Reade paces on the street corner, impatiently waiting for a 
           taxicab not already occupied. 

           He POPS SOME PILLS and routinely swallows them dry. 

           Across the boulevard, he notices a familiar, shadowy figure: 
           THE STRANGER from the subway in his TATTERED LEATHER JACKET. 

                                 READE
                        You interested in me, fella?

           Reade, on a confidence high, screams out at the man.

                                 READE (CONT’D)
                        Who the hell are you?! If you’re 
                        following me you should know by now 
                        I’m an over-communicator. I don’t 
                        tolerate silence.  

           Sufficiently failing at flagging down a taxi, Reade gives up 
           and starts stumbling toward the MTA station. 

           He lights a cigarette. Stares down at it. 

           It’s blurry. He can’t seem to focus. 

                                 READE (CONT’D)
                        I might be a little drunk.

                                 THE STRANGER (O.S.)
                        Do you smoke because it’s classless 
                        or because it kills you faster than 
                        life can?  

           Reade turns around to retort, just in time to see the strange 
           man step forward into the streetlight... 

           And finds HIMSELF STARING BACK AT HIM wearing that beat-up 
           leather jacket. 

           A carbon copy. 
           Reade is stunned. 

           There’s a beat between the two. It’s awkward and unnerving.  

           Frightened, Reade hurries away down the sidewalk.

           But his doppelganger slowly pursues. 

           Reade pops another pill to calm his nerves. Looks behind him. 

           The mysterious man continues stalking, following closely just 
           as Reade descends stairs onto the subway platform. 

           INT. SUBWAY “C” TRAIN. NIGHT.

           Reade pushes into a well-populated subway train mere seconds 
           before the doors close. Startled, and trying to process what 
           exactly he just experienced.

           The train JOLTS forward. 

           Lights flicker as they speed through the underground. 

           Reade moves deeper inside, gripping the railing, and standing 
           near the interior doors between cars. Still paranoid. 

           Through the grimy windows, in the neighboring car, we notice 
           THE STRANGER standing, silently studying him.

           Reade feels the man’s eyes, but is too shaken to turn. 

           INT. SUBWAY “Q” TRAIN. DAY.

           The next day: Reade sits on the train in his morning commute. 
           Between stations, the graffitied walls pass by rapidly. 

           Exhaustion from a week’s worth of forgetting to sleep starts 
           taking a toll on him as he struggles to keep his eyes open.

           In his insomniac state he gazes before himself, eyes crossed, 
           at the paperwork in his lap. He doodles in big red letters:

           R - E - A - D - E. 

           Over and over again. Blurring together: READE. READE. READE. 
           READE. READE. READE. 

           The subway rolls to a stop. Reade looks up at the graffitied 
           wall opposite him, and in large red letters the word ERASE.
           EXT. BRYANT PARK. DAY.

           Like clockwork, Reade approaches the local coffee cart first 
           thing in the morning: 

                                 READE
                        The usual, Rico. 

                                 COFFEE VENDOR
                             (confused)
                        Another soy? 

                                 READE
                        Have I ever not ordered my latte in 
                        the time you’ve known me?

                                 COFFEE VENDOR
                        Was there something wrong with the 
                        other ones?

                                 READE
                        Have you ever known me to complain?

                                 COFFEE VENDOR
                        About the latte you ordered from me 
                        forty minutes ago? 

                                 READE
                        This is my first time here this 
                        morning.

                                 COFFEE VENDOR
                        Man, this is the third time you’ve 
                        bothered me today.

           INT. BRYANT PARK OFFICE. READE’S CORNER. DAY.

           Reade hangs his briefcase on the coat rack and examines his 
           office. The blinds already pulled. The TV already turned to 
           CNN for the morning news. 

           And a warm, half-empty latte perched on his desk to the left 
           of his open MacBook. 

           Reade picks up the phone, and dials the operator. 

                                 SECURITY GUARD (V.O.)
                        Extension 2-1-0-1. What can I do 
                        for you, sir?

                                 READE
                        Matt, has anybody else checked in 
                        at reception today?
                                 SECURITY GUARD (V.O.)
                        No, sir, you’re the only person 
                        who’s been in-office this morning.

                                 READE
                        Alright.

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        Everything OK?

                                 READE
                        I think I’m confusing myself. Just 
                        running on fumes this week. 

           He hangs up the receiver.

           LATER THAT MORNING, Reade completes his morning routine: wide 
           grip pushups with skinny tie flung over his shoulder.

           AN HOUR AFTER THAT, Reade finishes thumbing through this 
           week’s hardcopy of Variety.

           INT. BRYANT PARK OFFICE. MEN’S WASHROOM. DAY.

           Reade washes his face, towels off, and applies a light layer 
           of moisturizer. He smiles widely, checking his teeth, before 
           adjusting the length of his necktie. 

           INT. BRYANT PARK OFFICE. HALLWAY. DAY.

           Reade saunters down his firm’s hallway, noticing an unusually 
           grim environment. 

           Some of the ASSISTANTS whisper to each other, gossiping over 
           their computer screens. 

           Female JUNIOR PUBLICISTS whimper into tissues and dab their 
           runny mascara. 

           Reade passes an indulgent, luxurious office where a POLICEMAN 
           stands with an older woman bearing a stern, permanently sour 
           disposition etched on her face. 

           This is the firm’s CEO, BARBARA TRAVERS, 65. She notices him.

                                 BARBARA
                             (to the officer)
                        Excuse me for five.

           Barbara pounces on Reade, takes his arm in hers and leads him 
           down the hallway into his own office. 
                                 READE
                        Welcome back, Barbara. 

                                 BARBARA
                        Quite the welcome wagon, McCarthy. 

           INT. BRYANT PARK OFFICE. READE’S CORNER. DAY.

           Barbara shuts the door behind them. Reade leans on his desk.

                                 BARBARA
                        What do you know?

                                 READE
                             (stumped)
                        About?

                                 BARBARA
                        Middle Eastern politics. Developing 
                        nanotechnology.
                             (beat)
                        About last night, you fuckhead. 

                                 READE
                             (lying)
                        Well, Barb, I think the company was 
                        expertly represented and everyone 
                        had a smashing time.  

                                 BARBARA
                        Valerie Hank was found dead this 
                        morning. And as you might imagine, 
                        I’ve already had quite the shitty 
                        day because of it. 

           Reade smirks slightly. 

                                 READE
                        She cashed in her chips early?

                                 BARBARA
                        Are you fucking smiling?

                                 READE
                             (catching himself)
                        I’m sorry. That’s -- that’s 
                        inappropriate, right?

                                 BARBARA
                        This isn’t funny, Reade. Least of 
                        all for you. There are several 
                        witnesses that claim you and Val 
                        were in a heated argument. 
                                 READE
                        What else is new?

                                 BARBARA
                        Did you threaten her?

                                 READE
                        She’s always been threatened by me 
                        professionally. 

                                 BARBARA
                        Physically. 

                                 READE
                        No.

                                 BARBARA
                        She made it very clear to people 
                        that you threatened her. 

                                 READE
                        To who?

                                 BARBARA
                        Do you know anything about this?

                                 READE
                        No, I honestly know nothing. 

                                 BARBARA
                        Any alibi last night at all? Your 
                        fiancée? A friend? An Uber cabbie?

           Reade pauses to reflect. 

                                 READE
                        Oddly enough there was-- 

           Does he mention what he saw in the subway? That man. Himself?  

                                 READE (CONT’D)
                        No. No one. 

                                 BARBARA
                        You should remedy that. 

                                 READE
                        How am I being scrutinized here? 
                        Me. More so than any other person 
                        on this floor crying fake tears 
                        while side eyeing the available 
                        furniture in her office? 
                                 BARBARA
                        McCarthy, I can’t sincerely believe 
                        you would ever do something this 
                        stupid. I know what we pay you, and 
                        it’s not enough to buy your way out 
                        of it. As much as I valued Val, I 
                        value my retirement twice that 
                        amount. If I’m being polite. So get 
                        your story straight and let’s sweep 
                        this all under the rug so life, or 
                        ours at least, can go on, shall we? 

           Barbara opens Reade’s office door revealing the NYPD officer, 
           DETECTIVE ADAM STANLEY, 50s, is not too far out of earshot. 

           As Barbara shuffles out, Detective Stanley peeks in:

                                 DETECTIVE STANLEY
                        Mr. McCarthy, I’m Adam Stanley with 
                        the NYPD Detective Bureau. I’d love 
                        to borrow a moment of your time to 
                        collect your report of events last 
                        night. I understand you were at Ms. 
                        Hank’s residence...

                                 READE
                             (shaking his hand)
                        Sure, anything to help. I’m afraid 
                        I’m in a rush but let’s step in my 
                        office for a bit of privacy. It’s 
                        an image based industry, so I don’t 
                        want to needlessly raise red flags. 

                                                       SMASH CUT TO ...

           EXT. SOHO STREETS. EVENING.

           Reade practically skips down the sidewalk, dancing around, as 
           if hearing music while he struts. Grinning wildly.  

           He pauses at a BODEGA VENDOR, eying his flower arrangements.

                                 READE
                        I’ve got butterflies. Can you get 
                        me something romantic? Something 
                        vivid. Something lively. 

           INT. READE’S SOHO LOFT. NIGHT.

           Reade tiptoes inside carrying a gorgeous bouquet, tossing his 
           keys and wallet on the sofa before SLAMMING the door shut for 
           Tasha’s attention. She rushes in from his bedroom.
                                 TASHA
                        Goddammit Reade, you gave me a...

           But she can’t finish. Reade takes her hand and spins her into 
           a breathtaking waltz right there in the living room. 

                                 TASHA (CONT’D)
                        What has gotten into you?

                                 READE
                        Everything, babe. And yet nothing 
                        at all. Just realizing that life is 
                        too short. But not for all of us. 

                                 TASHA
                        You’re being awfully cute lately.

           Reade lunges in, lips locked, passionately undressing her.

           INT. READE’S SOHO LOFT. BEDROOM. NIGHT.

           Reade lies in bed, naked, near Tasha. His eyes studying the 
           ceiling tiles. His brow furrows, concerned suddenly. 

           INT. BRYANT PARK OFFICE. MEN’S WASHROOM. DAY.

           Reade applies a light layer of moisturizer. He smiles widely, 
           checking his teeth, before adjusting the length of his tie.  

           Reade bends to lace his shoe. The washroom door OPENS gently. 

                                 UNFAMILIAR MAN (O.S.)
                        Reade McCarthy?

           A pair of rustic brown Gucci Oxfords, identical to ones Reade 
           currently ties, step into view. 

           Slowly, Reade rises to greet the UNFAMILIAR MAN, allowing his 
           eyes to cascade over the fellow’s outfit.

           The man sports a slim-cut navy suit, similar in style to the 
           one on Reade, but with a gorgeous thread pattern enhanced by 
           a silver pocket square making quite the elegant combination.   

           His eyes flicker with envy at this newcomer’s finely creased 
           ivory shirt and cerulean accent tie, making Reade’s off-white 
           shirt pallid in comparison. 

           The tie clip. That stunning smile. His steel blue eyes.   

           And expertly coiffed walnut-colored hair lifted in a delicate 
           wave, parted just opposite as Reade’s. 
                                 UNFAMILIAR MAN (CONT’D)
                        Fantastic style. Just fantastic. If 
                        I didn’t know better, I’d say I was 
                        looking in a mirror. 

           Reade stiffens through competition as this charismatic, toned 
           and charming man extends his hand:

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        I’m Sebastian Ryan.

           Reade hesitates shaking it, but eventually obliges. 

                                 READE
                        Shit, that’s a good name. 

           The tension is palpable. But SEBASTIAN RYAN, 31, is at ease. 

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Pleasure to finally meet you, I’ve 
                        read and heard so many phenomenal 
                        things. I’m really looking forward 
                        to diving in and becoming part of 
                        the family. There’s a lot we can 
                        learn from each other’s practices, 
                        I’m sure. 

           Reade’s heart sinks. 

                                 SEBASTIAN (CONT’D)
                        I know nothing I do can replace 
                        Valerie Hanks, truly sorry about 
                        that loss, but working under the 
                        legendary Barbara Travers and 
                        beside you as an executive vice 
                        president, I’m positive we’ll 
                        accomplish great things for this 
                        firm. And continue exceeding our 
                        own expectations. Congratulations 
                        on everything. Truly. Your career 
                        has been remarkable up to now. 

                                 READE
                             (confused)
                        I’m sorry, I don’t mean to be 
                        caught so off guard. 

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Well, my first day is Monday, but I 
                        wanted to make sure I gave myself 
                        ample time to unpack everything and 
                        make the rounds before then.

           Reade is stricken silent. 
                                 READE
                        Excuse me, I’m afraid I’m late for 
                        a dial-in.

           Reade shuffles past him.  

           INT. BRYANT PARK OFFICE. READE’S CORNER. DAY.

           Reade sits at his desk, eyes glued to his MacBook screen with 
           anxiety, reading a lifestyles blog on: SEBASTIAN RYAN.

           He reopens a search engine, types in his name, and clicks on 
           Sebastian’s TWITTER page. His eyes squint in fury.

           ANGLE ON: the tiny blue check mark by his profile: VERIFIED!

           The phone RINGS. 

                                 DANIELLE (O.S.)
                        Reade McCarthy’s office.

           Danielle pops her head in. Reade raises a finger. 

                                 READE
                        I’m not here.

           Danielle nods and hurries back to her desk. 

                                 DANIELLE
                        I’m sorry, he’s not in the office, 
                        can I have him return?

           Reade, hearing this, POUNDS his desk in fury. 

                                 READE
                        GOD DAMMIT. Danielle? DANIELLE!

           Danielle, rushes back in.

                                 READE (CONT’D)
                        Never say that I’m not in. Or that 
                        I’m in a meeting. Or that I’m on a 
                        call. What did I tell you about 
                        being transparent? I promise I’ll 
                        fire you for it. Only unless it’s 
                        my fiancée. You understand?

                                 DANIELLE
                        Yes.

                                 READE
                        Do you?!
                                 DANIELLE
                        Yes.

                                 READE
                        Who was that?

                                 DANIELLE
                        Your fiancée. 

                                 READE
                        Well, then, good work.

           INT. BRYANT PARK OFFICE. READE’S CORNER. DAY. LATER.

           Reade sits reclined with his Macbook in his lap chatting on 
           the phone with Tasha, the two giggling, gossiping.  

                                 READE
                        I feel like the Hardy Boys. 

                                                         INTERCUT WITH:

           INT. TASHA’S HELL’S KITCHEN APARTMENT. DAY. CONTINUOUS.

           Tasha sits in her breakfast nook, laptop open on her dining 
           table, feasting on a bowl of berries. 

                                 TASHA
                             (snickering)
                        Well who puts their entire life on 
                        the internet like this for everyone 
                        to see? Oh God, Reade, check out 
                        this article on Huffington Post 
                        about his...

                                 READE
                        Wedding. Two steps ahead.

                                 TASHA
                        But his wife...

                                 READE
                        Total troll.

                                 TASHA
                        Be nice. She has some -- carefully 
                        selected Instagram filters, if you 
                        know what I mean.

                                 READE
                        You could park a car between those 
                        front teeth.
                                 TASHA
                        Reade!

                                 READE
                        Are we horrible people?

                                 TASHA
                        No, we’re not. Well, at least I’m 
                        not. And you should get along with 
                        the other boys at school. He has 
                        nothing to do with the promotion. 
                        So march into his office and play 
                        the game.

           INT. BRYANT PARK OFFICE. SEBASTIAN’S CORNER. DAY.

           Carrying two cups of coffee, Reade lingers in the doorway to 
           find Sebastian settling into Valerie’s, now-empty, office.

           Sebastian kneels, sifting through the half-dozen boxes that 
           are scattered across the floor. 

           Reade hesitates momentarily, but eventually steps inside. 

                                 READE
                        Careful, you don’t want to ruin the 
                        crease in those trousers. 

           Sebastian looks up, noticing him, and smirks.  

                                 READE (CONT’D)
                        I brought you a latte from the 
                        vendor downstairs. The best in 
                        Bryant Park.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Thank you, but I’m actually lactose 
                        intolerant...

                                 READE
                        A little birdie told me that. Don’t 
                        worry, made with almond milk.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Very thoughtful. 

                                 READE
                        Of course. Need a hand?

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        No, I’m fine. I’m just making sure 
                        everything’s accounted for. 
                                 READE
                        I have to admit, when we first met, 
                        I wasn’t thoroughly downloaded on 
                        your background. It’s really quite 
                        impressive. I’d love to grab drinks 
                        once you’re completely settled.

           Sebastian, preoccupied, digs around in another box. 

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        That would be fantastic. I’d love 
                        to know your war stories and would 
                        be happy to hear myself talk about 
                        battle wounds as well. 

                                 READE
                        We have quite the roster here. 

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Ah. “We.” Yes, you do. They do. 
                        “We” don’t. I don’t think there’s a 
                        word more damaging in the English 
                        language than “we.” It gives the 
                        false comfort that group mentality 
                        is successful. 

           Sebastian notices Reade’s curiosity, caught off guard:

                                 SEBASTIAN (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry, I don’t know where that 
                        came from. I respect the model you 
                        have here obviously...

                                 READE
                        No, I don’t disagree. It’s just not 
                        often I meet someone else here with 
                        that opinion. 

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Time is a luxury and life is short. 
                        I wouldn’t want mine to be shared 
                        with somebody else. We all started 
                        dying the minute we were born. And 
                        we’re the only species alive that 
                        knows it. 

           Suddenly Sebastian finds what he’s been looking for:

                                 SEBASTIAN (CONT’D) 
                        Here she is! My baby girl. 

           Sebastian hoists from a box a CLEAR CYLINDRICAL TROPHY that 
           he places delicately on the shelf beside his desk. 
           Reade salivates at the award. 

           His pupils narrow envious at the inscription...

           BEST PUBLICITY CAMPAIGN, MOTION PICTURE, 2015.

           Reade’s mouth goes dry. It gets hard for him to swallow.

           An awkward silence. 

           Suddenly, he thinks to himself: why aren’t you talking, it’s 
           been a long time since you’ve said anything. 

           Say something!

           Reade opens his mouth to mumble:

                                 READE
                        It’s been a long time since you’ve 
                        said anything.

           Shit. 

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        I’m sorry?

                                 READE
                        Oh. Sorry, I thought that was my 
                        inner monologue. 

           INT. SUBWAY “Q” TRAIN. DAY.

           On the train, Reade sits in a mood, scribbling in a moleskine 
           perched on his lap with big red letters. Over and over again. 
           Blurring together: ERASE. ERASE. ERASE. ERASE. ERASE. ERASE. 

           The doors swing open and a PLUMP SWEATY GIRL boards, wearing 
           booty shorts labeled “SOUL CYCLE” on her ass. Reade notices 
           and mumbles to himself:

                                 READE
                        Your shorts say “Soul Cycle” but 
                        your love handles say “failed my 
                        New Year Resolution.”

           The girl turns to him, jaw-dropped, offended.

                                 SOUL CYCLE GIRL
                        Excuse me?

                                 READE
                        Oh. Sorry, I thought that was my 
                        inner monologue. 
           INT. READE’S SOHO LOFT BUILDING. LOBBY. DAY.

           Reade extracts letters from his mailbox, carefully sifting 
           through the few parcels. 

           His iPhone RINGS, he glares at the home screen: OFFICE.

                                 READE
                             (answering)
                        Yes, Dani?

                                 DANIELLE (V.O.) 
                        Sorry to bother you, but Detective 
                        Stanley is calling...

                                 READE
                        Who? 

                                 DANIELLE (V.O.) 
                        Detective Stanley. The man that was 
                        investigating Val’s homicide.

                                 READE
                        Tell him I just stepped away.

                                 DANIELLE (V.O.) 
                        But he’s standing in front of me.

                                 READE
                        Well then, you’ve reached Reade 
                        McCarthy’s voice mail. We regret 
                        missing your call. Please leave 
                        your message after the beep.

           Reade hangs up furious (as visibly furious as is possible by 
           clenching the end call button with your thumb).

           Turning around, he notices Nicolette perched in a chair near 
           the security desk. She kindly waves. His heart skips a beat.

                                 READE (CONT’D)
                        Nik, what are you doing here?!

                                 NICOLETTE
                        You told me to meet you here.

                                 READE
                        Nicolette. Why would I tell you to 
                        meet me here?

                                 NICOLETTE
                        I don’t know Reade - I didn’t even 
                        know what HERE was when you called. 
           INT. SOHO COFFEE SHOP. DAY.

           Reade sits opposite Nicolette in a booth, arms-folded across 
           his chest, pouting, facing his latte on the table. 

                                 NICOLETTE
                        I want to go back to that resort 
                        upstate. Do you remember? We can 
                        get a couple of couples massages 
                        and have the taste of fermented 
                        grapes in our mouths dawn til dusk. 

                                 READE
                        That was a lavish weekend. 

                                 NICOLETTE
                        That entire summer was storybook. 
                        You came along and I told myself I 
                        wasn’t about to fall for another 
                        nine-to-five. But those eyes of 
                        yours won me over.  

           Reade hardly engages with her.

                                 NICOLETTE (CONT’D)
                        You’re distracted. Why are you so 
                        nervous? It’s embarrassing.

                                 READE
                        I’m not nervous.

                                 NICOLETTE
                        I know when you’re lying. What did 
                        you do that’s making you so upset?

                                 READE
                        I’m upset with you. You can’t show 
                        up on my doorstep, we established 
                        rules. A long time ago. And it 
                        makes me feel violated and angry. 

                                 NICOLETTE
                        You called me. 

                                 READE
                        I would remember if I picked up the 
                        phone to call you.  

                                 NICOLETTE
                        Let’s just hang out and have some 
                        fun. It’s you and I, remember? 
                        Reade and Nicolette. We’re the ones 
                        to beat. Best dressed. Best jokes. 
                        Best looking.  
           Reade doesn’t budge, just biding his time with her. 

                                 NICOLETTE (CONT’D)
                        Are you still seeing Dr. Norton?

                                 READE
                        That’s none of your business.

                                 NICOLETTE
                        I just wanted to congratulate you 
                        if you are, that would be your 
                        longest relationship to date. 

                                 READE
                        Why are you behaving this way?

                                 NICOLETTE
                        I love feeling sorry for myself. I 
                        think it’s my favorite thing to do. 
                        Second is drinking coffee.  

           She takes a sip of hers. 

                                 NICOLETTE (CONT’D)
                        Still not talking with your family?

                                 READE
                        Your parents abandoned you when you 
                        were fourteen, Nicolette, so please 
                        spare me the lecture on family.

                                 NICOLETTE
                        Family is connection. 

                                 READE
                        And when people die you lose that 
                        connection. Sometimes fathers get 
                        throat pain and six months later 
                        they’re in the ground. Sometimes 
                        mothers medicate so much they don’t 
                        realize coping with a loss turns 
                        into a death sentence. Sometimes, 
                        and here’s the real surprise, 
                        Nicolette, sometimes you have to 
                        know when it’s time to tune out, 
                        shut it off, and move on. Because 
                        that’s life. Right there. People 
                        die. People leave you. But you have 
                        to move on.

           Nicolette fumes, hurt.

                                 NICOLETTE
                        Your fangs are showing again.
           She removes herself, pulling a MANILA ENVELOPE from her purse 
           as she stands, showing it off: 

                                 NICOLETTE (CONT’D)
                        When you called, I thought it was 
                        because you knew about this. Maybe 
                        I was too scared to talk about it 
                        over the phone, but you are not a 
                        well-liked man. There are people 
                        out there that hate you. That are 
                        waiting to hurt you. And here I am, 
                        just asking for you to let me love 
                        me, and you refuse to.

           Upset, she goes, but just before she storms out the door:

                                 NICOLETTE (CONT’D)
                        Don’t tell me I didn’t try to help 
                        you, Reade.

           Reade watches her through the window. She tosses the envelope 
           in the trash. His curiosity is piqued. 

           He throws cash down and heads outside to the waste bin. 

           EXT. SOHO COFFEE SHOP. DAY.

           At the bottom of the grimy trash receptacle sits the envelope 
           Nicolette was carrying. Reade eyes it, anxious. 

           A HIPSTER tosses his protein shake atop the heap of garbage, 
           splattering it everywhere. The envelope is filthy now.

           Biting the bullet, Reade reaches to grab the envelope when...

                                 DANIELLE
                        Reade?

                                 READE
                             (seeing her)
                        DANIELLE!

                                 DANIELLE
                        What are you doing?

                                 READE
                        I thought I accidentally threw away 
                        my gym pass.

                                 DANIELLE
                        You keep that at the office, I saw 
                        it before I left. 
                                 READE
                        No, my guest pass. For my fiancée’s 
                        sister, coming into town next week. 

                                 DANIELLE
                        I thought Stacy lived Downtown.

                                 READE
                        Her older sister. 
                             (beat)
                        You’ve clearly never met her.

                                 DANIELLE
                        I’ll call to get another one.

                                 READE
                        That’d be great if you could handle 
                        it. Anyway, I’m off to the bodega 
                        to pick up some -- manila...

                                 DANIELLE
                        Manila?

                                 READE
                        Vanilla. Soy. For baking, it seems.  

                                 DANIELLE
                        Funny seeing you out. Looks like we 
                        both have a life out of the office.

           Reade bellows out a horrendous FAKE LAUGH. 

                                 READE
                        Alright, well, that’s enough. See 
                        you at work then.

           INT. READE’S SOHO LOFT BUILDING. LOBBY. NIGHT.

           Reade pushes through the revolving doors, instantly noticing 
           DETECTIVE ADAM STANLEY and his PARTNER exiting the elevator. 

           Reade turns away, shields his face, and immediately pops into 
           the stairwell, avoiding them, allowing them to pass. 

           INT. READE’S SOHO LOFT. NIGHT.

           Reade enters his loft, a bit out-of-breath from the upstairs 
           climb, to find Tasha quiet on the sofa, clearly shaken.

                                 READE
                        You look about as good as I feel. 
                                 TASHA
                        Reade, how could not tell me that 
                        Valerie was murdered?

                                 READE
                        It’s not really pillow talk. 

                                 TASHA
                        Two officers just came to your door 
                        asking for you.

                                 READE
                        What did you say?

                                 TASHA
                        I said you weren’t home, and that I 
                        didn’t know where you were. 

                                 READE
                        Why would you say that?

                                 TASHA
                        OK. Where were you?

           Reade backtracks, almost caught... 

                                 READE
                        A small Kappa Sigma alumni mixer in 
                        the East Village. But you’re right, 
                        I should have called if I wasn’t 
                        coming straight here. 

                                 TASHA
                        Val’s family has a lot of money, I 
                        don’t think they’re going to stop 
                        until they find out what happened.

                                 READE
                        Is that what they told you? 

                                 TASHA
                        I’m just worried they think you may 
                        be involved. 

                                 READE
                        That’s absurd, I was with you the 
                        whole night.

                                 TASHA
                        I can’t vouch for that!

                                 READE
                        But did you?
                                 TASHA
                        Yes, of course, I lied to them. Oh 
                        God, am I allowed to lie to them?! 
                        I don’t even know if you came home 
                        at all that night. 

                                 READE
                        I CAME HOME!

                                 TASHA
                        How can I ever be sure? You sneak 
                        in once I’m asleep and you sneak 
                        out before I wake up. And you’re so 
                        goddamn meticulous, I couldn’t find 
                        anything out of place on your 
                        vanity. You shouldn’t be so tidy!

                                 READE
                        How was she found dead?

                                 TASHA
                        What do you mean how?

                                 READE
                        I think she’s staged a suicide and 
                        is trying to take me out with her. 

                                 TASHA
                        That’s a disgusting thing to say. 

                                 READE
                        Is it that preposterous?!

                                 TASHA
                        Yes, people aren't going to shove a 
                        gun in their mouth just so they can 
                        punish you, that’s psychotic. 

           Tasha maneuvers past him to the door.  

                                 READE
                        Let’s just calm down, we shouldn’t 
                        end this night on a fight. 

                                 TASHA
                        No, I can’t. I don’t-- I don’t even 
                        know if I can trust you right now. 
                        I need to go home. 

                                 READE
                        The Metro is delayed. 

                                 TASHA
                        I’ll take a cab.
                                 READE
                        Babe-- 

                                 TASHA
                        It terrifies me that you don’t need 
                        anything. You might want something, 
                        but you don’t need it anymore.

                                 READE
                        I need you. 

                                 TASHA
                        I don’t believe you.   

           EXT. SOHO COFFE SHOP. NIGHT. LATER.

           Panicking and curious, Reade tears through the trash to get 
           to the manila envelope Nicolette discarded. 

           He rips the envelope open and pulls out several photographs. 

           The top one is recognizably THE STRANGER IN THE JACKET, his 
           doppelganger, standing on a street corner. 

           He squints to read the street signs, then hails a TAXI...

                                 READE
                        73rd and Riverside. 

           EXT. UPPER WEST SIDE. NIGHT. 

           Reade wanders the streets near the Hudson River, inspecting 
           the buildings around him, searching to identify the landing 
           where the photographs might have been snapped from.  

           In the distance, he notices the familiar jacket. It cloaks a 
           figure, slumped on a bench, face in palms. 

           Reade pursues. 

                                 READE
                        I need a word with you. 

           The figure sits up revealing that IT’S VALERIE, wearing the 
           stranger’s tattered jacket. 

           Reade freezes, face pale, seeing a ghost.

                                 READE (CONT’D)
                        Val?
                                 VALERIE
                             (fighting back tears)
                        The words that pour from your mouth 
                        before you die are the last energy 
                        you give to the world. And I didn’t 
                        even get mine. I couldn’t even see 
                        him coming. To beg for my life. 

           She lowers the leather hoodie, gruesomely displaying that the 
           back of her skull has been bashed in, bloody and beaten. 

                                 VALERIE (CONT’D)
                             (breaking down)
                        The coward didn’t have the balls to 
                        face me before he took that fucking 
                        brick to my brain. 

           Valerie turns, stripping herself of the jacket, and passing 
           it off to Reade, who meekly grabs. 

                                 VALERIE (CONT’D)
                        Death can’t erase things we’ve done 
                        that are unfair.

           Blood leaks from her nose, mixing with tears.

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. READE’S SOHO LOFT. BEDROOM. NIGHT.

           Reade jolts himself awake from his nightmare in a cold sweat. 
           He struggles to breathe, reaching next to him to seek comfort 
           in Tasha, only to remember she left hours earlier.

           He fumbles around in his nightstand, finding and extracting a 
           few pills, and swallowing them dry.

           EXT. SOHO COFFEE SHOP. THE NEXT MORNING. DAY.

           The next morning: we find Reade standing on the corner eyeing 
           the now-empty trash bin with grim disappointment. He’ll never 
           know what the contents of that folder contained. 

           Maybe, somehow, that will make things easier for him.

           INT. DR. NORTON’S CHELSEA OFFICE. EVENING.

           A handsome Irish man with side-parted salt-and-pepper hair, 
           crooked nose and chiseled jaw, sits in his chicly furnished 
           office opposite Reade on a leather couch. 
           This is DR. PHILIPE NORTON, 45, who is indeed Reade’s longest 
           relationship, observing him ringing his hands together.

                                 READE
                        Well, I’m certainly relieved you 
                        moved out of that filthy Gramercy 
                        space. The decor was ghastly. 

                                 DR. NORTON
                        It’s a surprise to see you.  

                                 READE
                        So I missed a few sessions.

                                 DR. NORTON
                        I haven’t been in the Gramercy 
                        office since last spring.

                                 READE
                        So I missed a lot of sessions. But 
                        I was always thinking about you on 
                        Thursday nights, Phil.

                                 DR. NORTON
                        It’s back, isn’t it?

           And, perhaps, for the first time, we see Reade vulnerable:

                                 READE
                        What?

                                 DR. NORTON
                        We only have fifty minutes together 
                        today, so I think we need to start 
                        there if it is. 

                                 READE
                        It feels like it is.

                                 DR. NORTON
                        Although it’s been a while, we can 
                        still revisit the work we’ve done. 
                        Tell me about your routine, do you 
                        find yourself under stress?

                                 READE
                        Things have never been better.

                                 DR. NORTON
                        How so?

                                 READE
                        Becoming a partner at my firm had a 
                        barrier to entry. Her name was Val.

                                 READE (CONT'D)
                        And that barrier no longer exists-- 
                        since Val left the company.

                                 DR. NORTON
                        Why did she leave?

                                 READE
                        Reasons beyond her control. 

                                 DR. NORTON
                        Have you been exercising your - 

                                 READE
                        I exercise every day. 

                                 DR. NORTON
                        - exercising your empathy. Like we 
                        had discussed.

                                 READE
                        Yes, and things were going so well. 
                        I proposed to Tasha. We’re finding 
                        the right time for her to move in.

                                 DR. NORTON
                        You still don’t live together?

                                 READE
                        Not so sure I should let her see 
                        the real me yet. But my clients 
                        love me, I’ve never been busier, 
                        the industry envies me... 

                                 DR. NORTON
                        And yet, your symptoms are back. 

           Reade falters, truly lost for words.

                                 READE
                        I just thought if I had everything 
                        I wanted I could get past this. 

                                 DR. NORTON
                        And I’m sure you can, but there is 
                        such a thing as self-handicapping. 
                        People with your background, your 
                        upbringing, tend to invent ways to 
                        tear themselves apart. They make 
                        deliberate, risky decisions, so if 
                        they fail later they have somewhere 
                        to place blame.  

           Reade scoffs, looks out the window. 
                                 DR. NORTON (CONT’D)
                        What do you think this could be 
                        stemming from?

                                 READE
                        I haven’t been sleeping. And I was 
                        overworked trying to prove myself 
                        over Val. And none of that seemed 
                        worth it to me. 
                             (beat)
                        And I thought about throwing myself 
                        in front of the subway one morning.  

           EXT. DR. NORTON’S CHELSEA OFFICE. EVENING.

           Reade shuffles through the gray revolving doors of the office 
           building, happening onto a HOMELESS WOMAN begging for change. 
           Sick, she COUGHS aggressively into her elbow. 

           Reade watches this woman, morbidly fascinated.

           INT. DEATH + COMPANY. EAST VILLAGE. EVENING.

           Sebastian slugs down a scotch neat, and raises two fingers to 
           the nearby COCKTAIL WAITRESS, signaling for another round (we 
           notice a few other empty glasses around his elbows).

           He winks across the booth at Reade who has barely made a dent 
           in the mixology cocktail he’s ordered. 

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        I came from a family of drinkers. 
                        You didn’t drink fast, you didn’t 
                        get a drink at all. 

           Sebastian blows out the SMALL CANDLE on their table.

                                 SEBASTIAN (CONT’D)
                        Just to be safe. 
                             (beat)
                        I’m incredibly flammable. I’m about 
                        80% alcohol, and 20% hairspray. 

           Sebastian snickers. Reade even smiles at the joke. 

                                 SEBASTIAN (CONT’D)
                        I’m glad we’re doing this.

                                 READE
                        I really am too. It’s great to have 
                        some new company. I wasn’t feeling 
                        too fresh for a while there.  
                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Try a douche.

                                 READE 
                        My point: I think I found him.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Well played, Reade! Well played! 

                                 READE
                        So, work aside, what do you find 
                        yourself doing?

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        I have a severe medical condition: 
                        wanderlust. Two bedrooms on Avenue 
                        A, and on weekends they sit empty. 
                        I pack a bag and put a thumb out. 
                        If I have the time of course.  

                                 READE
                        Where do you go?

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        I spin a globe and point a finger. 
                        How about you?

                                 READE
                        I let my fiancée have our weekends 
                        since my schedule monopolizes the 
                        week. She was a dancer when we met. 
                        Now she’s an instructor at a ballet 
                        academy, so we usually spend time 
                        at the theatre or art exhibitions. 

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        You can tell a lot about a man how 
                        he spends his weekends. 

                                 READE
                        I’d certainly like to travel more.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Reade, this holiday break, you have 
                        to visit Tulum. It’s just stunning. 
                        The cenotes are a must-see and if 
                        you’re in for adventure, find a 
                        cabdriver named Benzo and ask to 
                        see the jaguars.

                        I kid you not, he drove us fifteen 
                        minutes into the jungle at dusk, 
                        slaps a piece of fucking steak on 
                        the hood of his cab and within ten 
                        minutes a jaguar is there licking 
                        the juice off our windshield. I’ve 
                        never felt closer to death.

                                 READE
                        I’ve always wanted to go to Mexico.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        You spent ten minutes monologuing 
                        about your white collar OC family, 
                        and you never vacationed there?

           The subtle condescension stings Reade, but he keeps cool.

                                 READE
                        Well-- like I said, I wish I could 
                        travel more.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Last month I was in Italy, mind you 
                        I don’t speak a lick of Italian, 
                        but in Italy I meet this gorgeous 
                        woman at a party. I think she was a 
                        hair stylist. Green eyes, legs for 
                        days, didn’t know any English. We 
                        spent a week flirting, at least 
                        body language is universal, but I 
                        was getting frustrated. Only had a 
                        few days left, so I sit down on 
                        Google Translate and just spill 
                        everything, confessing my feelings, 
                        print the document-- that’s when I 
                        had her. May as well have been a 
                        goddamn John Keats poem. My Tinder 
                        game may be sub-par but my Google 
                        Translate game is on point. 

                                 READE
                        How long have you been married?

           Sebastian lulls, knowing Reade did a slight background check.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Nothing gets past you, huh?

                                 READE
                        Just curious. 
                                 SEBASTIAN
                        You have to be totally sure, Reade. 
                        I don’t know anything about Tasha-- 
                        that’s her name right, Tasha?

                                 READE
                        Yes.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        It seems that I also know how to 
                        use a search engine. I don’t know 
                        anything about your relationship 
                        with Tasha. But from my experience, 
                        we’re not just marrying them now. 
                        We’re marrying them in five years, 
                        ten years, thirty years-- when she 
                        changes jobs, copes with loss, 
                        regrets that she could have wound 
                        up with a better man. You know?

           Sebastian, having finished his drink, flags for another. 

                                 SEBASTIAN (CONT’D)
                        Things were rough, so Allison and I 
                        tried a bit of an arrangement. She 
                        traveled a lot too, and whatever we 
                        didn’t tell each other never made 
                        us weaker. Until the day it did. 
                        We’ve separated. A little over two 
                        months now. God, that’s strange to 
                        admit so candidly. Honestly, I was 
                        thrilled this job fell into my lap. 
                        It’s been a welcome distraction.

           Sebastian removes himself from the table. 

                                 SEBASTIAN (CONT’D)
                        You smoke?

                                 READE
                        Yes. You?

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Fuck off, cigarettes are welcoming 
                        a slow death. That Mexican jaguar 
                        was close enough. But two brunettes 
                        from the bar made a move to light 
                        up on the street, and it’s about 
                        time for Sebastian Ryan to try his 
                        luck, wouldn’t you say?

           Sebastian tosses his iPhone to Reade. 
                                 SEBASTIAN (CONT’D)
                        All I ask while I’m gone. There’s a 
                        number in my phone: JAGGER. Text 
                        him you’re at Death and Company, 
                        and request two “Olafs.” 

                                 READE
                        Jagger?

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Same exact coke-guy as Sir Michael 
                        Philip. Mick gets his blow from 
                        those vials. It’ll open your eyes.

                                 READE
                        Tonight?

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        It’s Wednesday. What else gets you 
                        through the rest of the week? 

           Reade obliges him with a menthol.  

                                 SEBASTIAN (CONT’D)
                        You really should quit, these will 
                        fucking kill you. 

           Sebastian pops the cigarette behind his ear and hurries off. 

           As requested, Reade scans through Sebastian’s iPhone contacts 
           and finds the JAGGER contact card.

           And noticing, just above it: JACKSON, NICOLETTE.

           His heart skips a beat. Reade whips out his own phone to pull 
           up the same contact and compare the phone numbers. 

           Identical. 

           Reade nervously begins to type another name “T-A-S-H-A” and 
           instantly CAMDEN, TASHA pops up. 

           His brow furrows in confusion. Then, he fills with rage.

           He fumbles with his pill container. Dry swallows a pill.

           EXT. DEATH + COMPANY. EAST VILLAGE STREETS. NIGHT.

           Reade’s dark eyes are locked in front of him in an apathetic, 
           icy gaze as he strides slowly away from the bar.
           Behind him, Sebastian quickly shoves his way through a sea of 
           people. We fast get a sense there was a confrontation between 
           the two of them that we may not have been privy to. 

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        You made a scene in front of those 
                        brunettes, Reade!

           Reade’s vacant eyes click back into focus at the sound of his 
           voice. And his demeanor shifts. He turns around to Sebastian, 
           now calm. Perhaps Reade wasn’t completely privy to it either. 

                                 READE
                        How do you know Nicolette Jackson?

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        I honestly have no idea who you’re 
                        talking about.

                                 READE
                        She’s in your phone. 

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        You are out of your fucking mind.

                                 READE
                        IT’S YOUR GOD DAMN PHONE.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        I’m working off Val’s old cell. 
                        I.T. left me her contacts. Maybe 
                        you should take it up with her. 

           Sebastian snickers at his own tasteless joke. 

                                 READE
                        Impossible. 

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Is it? Seems to me that Val was one 
                        tough, stealthy bitch. Wouldn’t be 
                        surprised if she was in places she 
                        shouldn’t have been.

                                 READE
                        I don’t believe you.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Did Val find your Achilles heel? 
                        What a shame she died before she 
                        could exploit it. 

           Reade nearly loses his temper, lunges into Sebastian to grab 
           him by his blazer lapels, but finds strength to refrain.
           A DRUNK SORORITY GIRL stumbles by:

                                 DRUNK CHICK
                        Take off your shirts and make out!

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Man, you West Coast gentlemen have 
                        a short fuse! Let’s just fight on 
                        the sidewalk and be as boorish as 
                        possible. It’s exciting people!

                                 READE
                        I promise you, that these have been 
                        a very trying few weeks. And there 
                        are certain things I am incredibly 
                        sensitive to. So please, if any of 
                        this was intentional, stop it now.  

           Meanwhile, the wasted Alpha Phi found TWO DRUNK FRIENDS:

                                 DRUNK GIRLS
                        Kiss! Kiss! Kiss!

                                 SEBASTIAN 
                        Reade, if you want to start a war, 
                        I’m happy to start one. If I wanted 
                        to fuck you, I would go deeper than 
                        a contact card. Your life’s online. 
                        Everyone’s is, and when we put it 
                        there, that gives anyone the right 
                        to extort it. Everyone wants to be 
                        a public figure, but nobody wants 
                        the repercussions.  

           Reade smirks, turns to walk away, tossing Sebastian’s iPhone 
           into the street traffic:

                                 SEBASTIAN (CONT’D)
                        You’re a fucking psychopath! I’m 
                        expensing that phone! And I’m 
                        fucking telling Barb!

           EXT. EAST VILLAGE STREETS. NIGHT. MOMENTS LATER.

           Reade storms aimlessly through the crowded streets, sneering 
           at the rowdy college-aged crowd that inadvertently makes him 
           feel out of place. 

           Across the street, Reade notices THE STRANGER, just parallel 
           to him, taking almost identical paces. 

           Reade lulls, briefly contemplating what to do, then follows, 
           darting across 1st Avenue. 
           Feeling his pursuit, the stranger begins sprinting, weaving 
           expertly in-and-out of oncoming pedestrian traffic. 

           Reade chases his doppelganger, frantic now. 

           The two men charge down the slick, steep stairs of...

           INT. A SEEDY ENGLISH ALE HOUSE. NIGHT.

           One right after the other, they SLAM through the pub’s door, 
           startling a group of TOURISTS at a window table.

           Reade tracks the stranger through the bar, watching him strut 
           with that tattered leather hoodie concealing his face. 

           Just steps behind, Reade follows the stranger between young, 
           LOUD PATRONS and directly through the door of...

           THE FILTHY, PISS-STAINED MEN’S WASHROOM.

           PITCH BLACK. Behind him, he CLOSES THE DOOR. And FLIPS ON the 
           harsh, fluorescent lights. 

           Only to discover he’s in there alone.

           Reade catches his breath and tries to collect his thoughts.

           He steals a long glimpse of himself in the grimy sink mirror, 
           the man he’s become, how old he suddenly looks, and his eyes 
           well with tears that, soon enough, escape. 

                                 READE
                             (crying)
                        I’m broken. I’m fucking broken. I’m 
                        fucking empty.

           Reade wipes his cheeks. A shaky hand reaches inside his coat 
           pocket to pull out the pills he needs as a crutch.

           He unscrews the top, and looks back at his reflection.

           Suddenly behind him: in the mirror, he sees THE STRANGER, the 
           carbon copy of himself, smugly observing.

                                 THE STRANGER
                        If they don’t work, then what’s the 
                        point of taking them?

           Reade nods and obediently spills the pill bottle’s contents 
           entirely down the sink drain. 
                                 READE
                        I’m a good person. I may have hated 
                        Val, but I didn’t hurt her. 
                             (searching)
                        Did I? You’re the only one that can 
                        clear my name. You’re my alibi. I’m 
                        not a violent man.

           After the pills CLINK down the drain, Reade turns to face his 
           familiar-faced counterpart, both noticeably uneasy.

                                 READE (CONT’D)
                        How can this be possible?

                                 THE STRANGER
                        I don’t have that answer.

                                 READE
                        You look exactly like me.

                                 THE STRANGER
                        I can see that.

           INT. READE’S SOHO LOFT. NIGHT.

           The door of Reade’s loft slowly opens and Reade shuffles into 
           his living room, flipping the lights. Hauntingly SILENT.

           Steps behind, THE STRANGER follows Reade inside, crossing the 
           threshold of his loft, entering his life, invited in, though 
           Reade is visibly apprehensive.

                                 READE
                        Can I get you anything? Something 
                        to drink?

                                 THE STRANGER
                        I don’t.

           The stranger closes the door behind him, absorbing this room 
           and the environment he’s entered. 

                                 THE STRANGER (CONT’D)
                             (admiring the loft)
                        This is incredible.

                                 READE
                        It’s nothing.

                                 THE STRANGER
                        This is nothing like nothing. 

           Reade, still on edge, keeps his distance from the stranger. 
                                 THE STRANGER (CONT’D)
                        You’re afraid.

                                 READE
                        I have just invited a complete and 
                        potentially dangerous stranger into 
                        my home in the middle of the night 
                        and am not totally sure why.
                             (beat)
                        So, yes, I’m a little afraid.

                                 THE STRANGER
                        I probably have more reason to be 
                        afraid of you.

                                 READE
                        Where - how - do we begin?

                                 THE STRANGER
                        Rip the bandage off. 

                                 READE
                        Why were you following me?

                                 THE STRANGER
                        Wouldn’t you have done the same?

                                 READE
                        Yes.

                                 THE STRANGER
                        Wouldn’t you have been curious?

           Reade gets intimately close to the stranger, lingering just 
           inches from his face. Examining him, he smoothly traces his 
           fingertips over a mole behind the stranger’s ear. 

           He then gestures to the same mole behind his own: 

                                 READE
                        This is outrageous. 

           Reade rolls up his shirtsleeves revealing a HIDEOUS SCAR that 
           traces the width of his INNER ARM.

                                 READE (CONT’D)
                        I was twenty. Hopped a fence and 
                        came down on an exposed nail. 

           The stranger removes his jacket, boasting the IDENTICAL SCAR 
           on his own arm. Reade suddenly floods with fear. 

                                 READE (CONT’D)
                        What’s your name?
                                 THE STRANGER
                        What’s your name?

                                 READE
                        Reade McCarthy. What’s yours?

                                 THE STRANGER
                        Does that really matter? Aren’t you 
                        more curious where I came from?

                                 READE
                        Where did you come from?

                                 THE STRANGER
                        And how I found you.

                                 READE
                        How did you find me?

                                 THE STRANGER 
                        Pure chance. I’m from a disgusting, 
                        east-of-nowhere, California suburb 
                        called Blythe. And one day I notice 
                        a man. A man that, I think, looks a 
                        little like me. A man who seems to 
                        have it all at his fingertips. I 
                        mean, he snaps his fingers: roof 
                        over his head. Snaps his fingers: 
                        beautiful girl. Snaps his fingers: 
                        perfect job. It was like a warped 
                        game God was playing: how someone 
                        so similar to me could have 
                        everything I craved.

           A profound stillness, then:

                                 THE STRANGER (CONT’D)
                        Some us aren’t born the lucky ones. 
                        Some of us can only fantasize. And 
                        I came here in search of that man. 
                        To find the man that I deserved to 
                        be. Instead, he found me.

           INT. READE’S SOHO LOFT. BATHROOM. DAY.

           Reade stands in his mirror, naked, somberly staring at his 
           own reflection. Considering his own mortality. 

           INT. NEDERLANDER THEATRE. NIGHT. 

           Reade sits in a sharp gray suit, well put-together as we’re 
           used to, beside Tasha in aisle seats of the packed theatre. 
           On the stage, Reade’s client Aras is performing an emotional 
           scene with a BRITISH MOVIE STAR taking her stab at Broadway, 
           which will either prove to be Tony Awards bait or fodder for 
           the critics to universally pan. 

           Time will tell. And as this is only the seventh preview, that 
           has yet to be determined. 

                                 BRITISH STAR
                        I can’t believe I let you do this 
                        to me, every single time, I let you 
                        treat me like I’m this second rate 
                        person in your life.

           But Aras isn’t fucking bad:

                                 ARAS
                        You wanna know what you are? You’re 
                        alone. And you’re delusional. You 
                        have to be the most delusional 
                        person I have ever met. That’s your 
                        fetish, you blur the lines between 
                        reality and fantasy, until none of 
                        this even exists to you anywhere. 
                        You say you love me, but you bend 
                        over for any man with power just 
                        because you think it gets you 
                        closer to the real life you want. 
                        Even though you know they’re lying. 
                        Even though you know it makes you 
                        feel good to have the attention. 
                        And you come home, shrug, kiss our 
                        daughter, and tell me it was just a 
                        business dinner. So, yes, you’re 
                        second rate to me.

           INT. NEDERLANDER THEATRE. BACKSTAGE. NIGHT.

           A bottle of champagne POPS, bringing us into a celebration in 
           Aras’ dingy, though still faded-glamorous, dressing room. 

                                 READE
                        Happy two weeks until opening! You 
                        are revolutionary in this, Aras. 
                        You’ve really got it. That work is 
                        genius. No more thinking small. 
                        You’re gonna be huge. I think you 
                        can get a Tony nod. 

           Tasha gently caresses Reade’s arm as he pours her a glass of 
           bubbly, perhaps the first affection since their argument. 
                                 TASHA
                        Reade, bite your tongue. Don’t jinx 
                        him. That’s worse than saying “The 
                        Scottish Play” in the theatre.

                                 ARAS
                        Thank you, Tasha. 

                                 TASHA
                        He’s just a silly suit who knows 
                        nothing about superstition. 
                             (under her breath:)
                        Although I don’t disagree. 

           Aras notices his DIRECTOR meander by the open dressing room 
           door, gesturing to him as he passes. 

                                 ARAS
                        Back in five. I have notes. 

           As Aras removes himself from the conversation, Tasha removes 
           the shoes from her feet, arching them in a stretch.

                                 TASHA
                        I miss my comfortable Pradas. How 
                        could we have left them in Miami?
                             (then laughing:)
                        I can’t believe I’m lamenting the 
                        loss of my comfortable Pradas. 
                             (off Reade’s silence:)
                        You seem distracted. Everything OK?

           A KNOCK on the doorframe catches Reade and Tasha’s eyes.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Oh, well, hello stranger.

           Sebastian stands there with a shit-eating grin on his face. 

                                 SEBASTIAN (CONT’D)
                        I thought I’d find Aras in here, he 
                        was quite spectacular tonight.

                                 READE
                        He’s in notes. 

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Aren’t you going to announce me to 
                        your fiancée? 
                             (extending a hand)
                        Tasha is it?
                                 TASHA
                             (accepting it)
                        It is.   

                                 READE
                        This is Sebastian.

                                 TASHA
                        Ah, I’ve heard all about you...

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Some might say I’m his new partner 
                        in crime. 

                                 READE
                        Some might say it’s a coincidence 
                        running into you tonight. I myself 
                        say it’s like a knife in the back.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        I thought I should support. Aras is 
                        technically our client. 
                             (aside to Tasha:)
                        We have a team vision at our firm. 
                             (back to Reade:)
                        Just doing my due diligence to move 
                        that process along. 

           EXT. W HOTEL NEW YORK. NIGHT.

           Sebastian, Aras and Aras’ co-star hop out of a taxi and make 
           their way through the revolving hotel doors. Sebastian keeps 
           Aras close, an arm around his shoulder, engaged in a chat.

           Behind them, Reade and Tasha exit a second cab. Reade takes a 
           deep breath, soothing his anger as he watches the two getting 
           chummy. He extracts the pill bottle from his blazer, opens it 
           only to remember he has none left: empty. 

           Tasha links her arm in his. Smiles sweetly up at him, making 
           Reade feel better briefly, and they follow everyone inside. 

           INT. WHISKEY BLUE. W HOTEL. NIGHT.

           The sleek crimson overhead lights make all of the SEXY LOCALS 
           and ARTIST-TYPES populating this bar seem far more desirable. 
           Reade and Tasha also turn some heads in the crowd. 

           They approach a corner table where Sebastian stands near Aras 
           and a few other ACTORS from his play. As they inch in, bodies 
           part, revealing Nicolette among the seated pretty faces.
           Reade stops in his tracks, his heart skipping at the sight of 
           her. Tasha notices the drastic demeanor shift. 

           Nicolette catches Reade’s eyes and waves, smiling. Sebastian 
           smirks at the deed. A challenge accepted, and job well done. 

           Reade pulls Tasha away and closer to the bar.

                                 READE
                        Let’s grab a drink.

           LATER THAT NIGHT: Tasha has taken the dance floor with other 
           girls, cradling her uncomfortable heels in her hands as they 
           groove and laugh. 

           Elsewhere, Reade sits at the bar sulking. Nicolette taps him. 

                                 NICOLETTE
                        Well, I guess we all have our nasty 
                        little secrets don’t we?

                                 READE
                        Why are you punishing me?

                                 NICOLETTE
                        Relax, Reade. What, a cute guy asks 
                        me to join him at a bar, and I have 
                        to turn him down? You were the one 
                        that begged me to move on.

                                 READE
                        Sebastian’s still married.

           She CHUCKLES under her breath, a low, hoarse laugh.

                                 NICOLETTE
                        Never stopped any man before.

                                 READE
                        Niki, I need to know what was in 
                        that folder. Back at the diner.

                                 NICOLETTE
                        You never looked?

                                 READE
                        I don’t tend to humor people that 
                        threaten me. 

                                 NICOLETTE
                        What if I told you it was nothing, 
                        Reade? What if I told you I was 
                        paid, just to make you sweat that 
                        there might be something? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 NICOLETTE (CONT'D)
                        But there was nothing. And I agreed 
                        because it made me laugh. There’s 
                        nothing funnier to me than a good 
                        revenge joke.  

           She moves in closer to him.

                                 NICOLETTE (CONT’D)
                        Would you believe me if that’s what 
                        I told you? You think you’re sweet 
                        now, and you’re trustworthy, but 
                        even if you’ve changed, that won’t 
                        change your past. And that’s what 
                        really scares you.

                                 READE
                        I’m sorry that I hurt you. But I’ve 
                        tried every day to make up for it. 
                        To take care of you.

                                 NICOLETTE
                        I don’t need you to take care of me 
                        anymore.  

                                 READE
                        Now who’s joking?

                                 NICOLETTE
                        It was something. In the envelope. 

                                 READE
                        STOP WITH YOUR FUCKING MIND GAMES.

           A few people turn in their direction, including Tasha, on the 
           dance floor, now uneasy.

                                 NICOLETTE
                        Everyone can go back to their own 
                        miserable conversations now.

                                 READE
                        Just promise me this stops here. I 
                        love Tasha and she doesn’t deserve 
                        to be a casualty.

                                 NICOLETTE
                        You didn’t even fight for me.

                                 READE
                        Promise me.

                                 NICOLETTE
                        That’s what love is.  
                                 READE
                        Promise me.

                                 NICOLETTE
                        I promise. 

           Tasha, visibly unsettled, yet still feigning elegance, moves 
           back to the bar. Nicolette returns to her dirty martini.

                                 READE
                        You looked great out on the floor.

                                 TASHA
                        We should get going.

                                 READE
                        How come?

                                 TASHA
                        I don’t know the woman sitting next 
                        to you, but I feel as if she walked 
                        through that door like a hurricane 
                        set on destruction, and I don’t 
                        want to be surrounded by your 
                        colleagues when I find out why.

           Nicolette slowly pivots in her stool to Tasha, pulling on a 
           different expression.

                                 NICOLETTE
                        I’m so sorry! I must have given you 
                        the wrong impression but we’re just 
                        old friends. We haven’t seen each 
                        other in years and wanted to catch 
                        up. He was talking me through a guy 
                        problem. Hope you don’t mind.

                                 TASHA 
                        Reade, it’s getting late.

                                 NICOLETTE
                        Problem Guy and I didn’t end well. 
                        I carried his baby for four months, 
                        and, well, you probably don’t know 
                        the toll it takes on a gal when 
                        you’re asked to get rid of it. And 
                        then he got rid of me as soon as he 
                        realized that I didn’t fit into the 
                        press release of his life he’d been 
                        writing for himself.

           A rigid beat between the three.
                                 NICOLETTE (CONT’D)
                        It was a girl. Problem Guy asked me 
                        never to tell him. But I guess I’m 
                        just not that big of a person.

           Confused, misty-eyed, Tasha runs off, carrying heels in hand.

           Reade turns to Nicolette, seething, hatred in his eyes. 

                                 NICOLETTE (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry, you know I’ve never been 
                        good at keeping promises. 

           INT. W HOTEL NEW YORK. LOBBY. NIGHT.

           Reade pursues Tasha, who careens through the lobby failing to 
           fight back her tears. 

                                 READE
                        Will you please, for a minute, stop 
                        and let me explain?

                                 TASHA
                        OK. Explain.

           Tasha turns as she absorbs a stray tear in the palm she wipes 
           across her cheek. But he’s speechless. 

                                 READE
                        We should do this at home. This has 
                        been a difficult few weeks for us. 
                        I don’t want to be inarticulate. 

                                 TASHA
                        Oh my God. Reade, she’s why you’re 
                        so preoccupied all the time. 

                                 READE
                        No.

                                 TASHA
                        Do you love her?

                                 READE
                        Of course not, I love you!

                                 TASHA
                        Do you fuck her?

                                 READE
                        Tasha, that goddamn guy in there 
                        orchestrated this. He’s involving 
                        himself in our lives to ruin them.

                        To pit us against each other, and 
                        we can’t let him win! 

                                 TASHA
                        Do you fuck her?

                                 READE
                        I promise you, I don’t. 

                                 TASHA
                        Then who is she?

                                 READE
                        She’s before I met you. A friend 
                        introduced us at a mixer. We were 
                        in love, but it faded. She lost 
                        herself in drugs. I left her. I 
                        found you. Then she calls me one 
                        day telling me shes having a baby. 
                        I didn’t believe her at first.  

                                 TASHA
                        Oh my God.

                                 READE
                        By then she was poisoning herself 
                        with methamphetamines. Threatened 
                        me daily, but I swore I would take 
                        care of her if she’d let me. She 
                        lives in Bushwick, in an apartment 
                        I pay for.

                                 TASHA
                        You keep her in Bushwick?

                                 READE
                        It was meant to be temporary, but 
                        after the baby she never bounced 
                        back. And I felt bad. 

                                 TASHA
                        Oh, you felt bad?

                                 READE
                        Yes. And I made sure she survived. 
                        That’s empathy. And that’s how I 
                        know I’m not psychotic. 

                                 TASHA
                        How could you ask that of a woman?

                                 READE
                        That girl fucking scares me, Tasha! 
                        And what kind of story is that? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 READE (CONT'D)
                        How would that make me look? To tie 
                        my life to a lunatic like her?

                                 TASHA
                        That's sick. You're fucking sick. 
                        And it's horrifying to me that I 
                        don't think you realize just how 
                        sick you are.

           She turns to leave, but he grips her hand.

                                 TASHA (CONT’D)
                        Don’t. 

                                 READE
                        Tasha, please, I love you.  

                                 TASHA
                        You love me? You can’t even come to 
                        my apartment without hesitating. 
                        Every time I ask you have to weigh 
                        whether or not the commute is worth 
                        getting laid. You love me? I hear 
                        it in your voice. And you can kiss 
                        me like it’s real. But then the 
                        next moment it’s like nothing ever 
                        happened and I’m just Reade’s plus-
                        one again.

           Tasha breaks free of his grasp.

                                 TASHA (CONT’D)
                        I think you need a girl who treats 
                        you like the extraordinary person 
                        you want to be. And that’s not me. 
                        I’m just a teacher. I’m suburban. 
                        But I love that about myself. I’m 
                        ordinary because you mean something 
                        to me. I settled down. I realized 
                        what I wanted to live for. And you 
                        don’t know yet. You hate everything 
                        you can’t control in your life, so 
                        you don’t love anything. The 
                        uncontrollable things make you know 
                        you’re alive. I like being unhappy. 
                        And I like being ordinary. I like 
                        being stressed. I like being 
                        heartbroken. It reminds me that 
                        everything changes. 

                                 READE
                        Tasha.
                                 TASHA
                        Thirty minutes.

                                 READE
                        What?

                                 TASHA
                        Thirty minutes. Please just give me 
                        thirty minutes this week to collect 
                        my things from your place.

           She smiles sweetly at Reade, perhaps the last time she ever 
           sees him:

                                 TASHA (CONT’D)
                        Life can be cruel, but there should 
                        be people in it who make you happy. 
                        You need to find a way to live for 
                        those people. And if not, then you 
                        need to remember it’s the only life 
                        you’ve got. And those people can’t 
                        stand around and watch you do this 
                        to yourself.

           INT. SUBWAY “Q” TRAIN. NIGHT.

           Reade rides the rails home. With tears in his eyes, he stares 
           blankly, studying text on graffitied walls through windows as 
           they pass: ERASE. ERASE. ERASE.

           EXT. SOHO STREETS. NIGHT.

           Reade stumbles by a local bodega. He lulls, leaning against a 
           wall, lowering his hands to support himself on his knees, and 
           begins to aggressively HYPERVENTILATE, crying.

                                 READE
                             (heaving)
                        What do I do?

           A FRAT BOY wanders out of the shop carrying a pack of beer.

                                 FRAT BOY
                        You’re really freaking me out, bro. 

                                 READE
                             (catching his breath)
                        I’m sorry -- I -- don’t know what 
                        has -- gotten into -- me.
           Reade whips out his cell and dials a number. He tries to move 
           at the same pace he was moments before, but his feet drag as 
           if trudging though quicksand.

           A MALE VOICE answers the other end:

                                 CRAIG (V.O.)
                        Hello?

                        Yes. God, how are you?

                                 CRAIG (V.O.)
                        I’m alright.

                                 READE
                        I’m not. Can I swing by for a beer?

                                 CRAIG (V.O.)
                        Uh -- no.

                                 READE
                        I’m just a few stops away.

                                 CRAIG (V.O.)
                        I live in Smithtown.

                                 READE
                        You live on Long Island?

                                 CRAIG (V.O.)
                        For a year now.

                                 READE
                        That’s absurd.

                                 CRAIG (V.O.)
                        It’s not. I’ve lived here since I 
                        married Ashleigh last spring.

                                 READE
                        I don’t remember that wedding.

                                 CRAIG (V.O.)
                        You weren’t invited, Reade. You and 
                        I haven’t talked in two years.
                                 READE
                        It’s been two months, maybe. 

                                 CRAIG (V.O.)
                        No, it’s been two years. You wrote 
                        me off at a business dinner when I 
                        wouldn’t eat oysters because the 
                        texture freaked me out. You called 
                        me provincial. 

                                 READE
                        I’d remember something like that.

           The line goes dead.

                                 READE (CONT’D)
                        Hello?

           Reade looks down at his now lifeless phone, livid, and turns 
           to a BAG LADY on a blanket in a doorway near him.

                                 READE (CONT’D)
                        Why is it so hard to maintain a 
                        long-term friendship in this God 
                        forsaken city?!

                                 BAG LADY
                        You’re really freaking me out, man.

           INT. BRYANT PARK OFFICE. ELEVATOR. DAY.

           Reade rides the lift up to his office, his hair less perfect 
           than we’re accustomed.

           INT. BRYANT PARK OFFICE. HALLWAY. DAY.

           Reade tromps down the hall, fiddling with his mobile. 

                                 READE
                             (incensed)
                        Danielle, I can’t pull up any of my 
                        e-mails on this phone, it’s saying 
                        my password expired.

                                 DANIELLE
                        Barbara requested to see you. 

           INT. BRYANT PARK OFFICE. READE’S CORNER. DAY.

           Ignoring her, Reade slips into his office, hanging his jacket 
           on the rack, and noticing his laptop missing off his desk.
                                 READE
                        Where’s my computer?

           Danielle pokes her head in, meekly.

                                 DANIELLE
                        I think that’s why Barbara’s asked 
                        to see you.

           INT. BRYANT PARK OFFICE. BARBARA’S CORNER OFFICE. DAY.

           Reade storms into Barbara’s office, clearly in the process of 
           rehearsing his grievances for Sebastian. But she’s not alone, 
           mid-conversation with Detective Adam Stanley. 

                                 BARBARA
                        McCarthy, come in. Take a seat. 

           Detective Stanley stands, all smiles, shaking Reade’s hand, 
           though a lingering suspicion behind his eyes:

                                 DETECTIVE STANLEY
                        Mr. McCarthy, it’s very nice to see 
                        you again. 

                                 READE
                        Likewise, Detective... 

                                 DETECTIVE STANLEY
                        Stanley. Adam Stanley. 

                                 READE
                        I remember. I’m sorry that we kept 
                        missing each other. 

                                 DETECTIVE STANLEY
                        And I’m sorry I had to surprise you 
                        at the office like this, but well-- 
                        if you’re being avoided you gotta 
                        do what you can. 

           Barbara exits her office, shutting the door behind her. 

           Reade, nervously, sits as requested. The conversation almost 
           happens as a blur to him. 

           QUICK CUT: a manila envelope is thrown on the table.

           QUICK CUT: the envelope is opened and photographs extracted.

           QUICK CUT: nude (selfie) photographs of Val lie on the table. 
                                 DETECTIVE STANLEY (CONT’D)
                        I trust you’ll handle our chat with 
                        full discretion. 

           Reade can hardly breathe.

                                 DETECTIVE STANLEY (CONT’D)
                        By the look on your face, I’d guess 
                        these photographs matter to you.

                                 READE
                        Do I need an attorney? 

                                 DETECTIVE STANLEY
                        I’m not here to incriminate you.

                                 READE
                        What are you looking for?

                                 DETECTIVE STANLEY
                        We received these in an unmarked 
                        envelope. Checking your company’s 
                        server, we verified the images are 
                        identical to photographs on two 
                        hard drives: Val’s. And yours. 

                                 READE
                        Now why would that be?

                                 DETECTIVE STANLEY
                        That’s my question for you.

                                 READE
                        Am I being detained?

                                 DETECTIVE STANLEY
                        I just want to better understand 
                        your relationship.

           Reade glances down again at the photographs of Val, naked, in 
           compromising positions before her mirror. 

                                 DETECTIVE STANLEY (CONT’D)
                        We need to evaluate all scenarios 
                        for this investigation. From what 
                        I’m told, you two had no interest 
                        in each other. But if you were, in 
                        fact, an “item” one motive may be 
                        ‘scorned lover seeks revenge.’  

                                 READE
                        If we were fucking, that would tie 
                        me to her? That’s reason?
                                 DETECTIVE STANLEY
                        The easiest one. 

                                 READE
                        I stole these. Off of her laptop-- 
                        to leak, to humiliate her with.

           Reade leans in, confiding in him.

                                 READE (CONT’D)
                        I think I’m being extorted. They’re 
                        trying to force me into admitting 
                        fault for a crime I didn’t commit.  

           But Detective Stanley isn’t sure how to answer.

                                 READE (CONT’D)
                        Look, I’m cooperating with you. I’m 
                        honest with you. And I can assure 
                        you, there’s nothing I’m guilty for 
                        other than not respecting that 
                        bitch professionally, and last I 
                        checked that isn’t a crime unless 
                        you want to arrest thousands of 
                        white collar New Yorkers every day.

                                 DETECTIVE STANLEY
                        Regrettably, we can’t arrest people 
                        for being assholes. Though I admire 
                        your candidness. In one breath 
                        endorsing blackmail that benefits 
                        you, the next, victimizing yourself 
                        when it doesn’t. 

           Stanley, almost morbidly amused, scribbles in the notepad on 
           his lap. Then SLAMS it shut.

                                 DETECTIVE STANLEY (CONT’D)
                        I’d like full access to your files. 
                        I find it polite to seek permission 
                        rather than take by force. I’m sure 
                        with your reputation we’ll find no 
                        connection to her strangling, so 
                        you’ll have to forgive us for this 
                        temporary intrusion.  

           Reade hesitates, then nods slightly.

                                 DETECTIVE STANLEY (CONT’D)
                        Is that a yes?

                                 READE
                        Yes. Anything you want, I just need 
                        this to be over with.
           Detective Stanley crosses to the door, opening it to reveal 
           Barbara in its frame (clearly eavesdropping).

                                 DETECTIVE STANLEY
                        Until next time.

           Stanley saunters down the hall as Barbara enters the office, 
           closing the door behind her. 

                                 BARBARA
                        You were sexually harassing Val?!

                                 READE
                             (defensive)
                        I only intended to. 

                                 BARBARA
                        I think we both know this is more 
                        than a blemish on your reputation. 
                        I can't have you representing the 
                        firm with this cloud over you. 

                                 READE
                             (realizing)
                        Sebastian.

                                 BARBARA
                        McCarthy, I wanted you for this but 
                        it seems fate wants something else. 

                                 READE
                        If I have to report to Sebastian, 
                        then I quit. 

                                 BARBARA
                        You can’t. You’re under contract. 
                        Don’t give me an excuse to take 
                        anything you have left.  

           INT. DR. NORTON’S CHELSEA OFFICE. EVENING.

           Dr. Norton leans into his usual puffy, leather chair studying 
           Reade as he angrily paces around the room.

                                 DR. NORTON
                        Your no-show fees are really going 
                        to tally up.

           Reade ignores him, continues pacing... 
                                 DR. NORTON (CONT’D)
                        When I said you didn’t have to lie 
                        down, I didn’t mean to suggest do 
                        the exact opposite.  

                                 READE
                        Do you think I’m losing my mind?

                                 DR. NORTON
                        Let’s sit and talk this through.

                                 READE
                        Or could this guy ACTUALLY be smart 
                        enough to be doing this? Trying to 
                        drive me insane. Is anyone that 
                        expert at mind games? I mean, I 
                        thought I was good at mind games, 
                        but this is a fucking checkmate. 

           Reade points to a framed portrait leaning against the wall.

                                 READE (CONT’D)
                        What is that?

                                 DR. NORTON
                        A Banksy print.

                                 READE
                        On the floor.

                                 DR. NORTON
                        I haven’t had time to hang it up.

                                 READE
                        Phil, how can you respect my mental 
                        health when you don’t even respect 
                        the feng shui of your own office?

                                 DR. NORTON
                        I’m sorry...

                                 READE 
                        I met a man that looks EXACTLY like 
                        me, Phil, like, the resemblance is 
                        frightening. I’d see him around 
                        town, and maybe I was pretending he 
                        didn’t exist at first, but we came 
                        face-to-face one night and-- God, 
                        that sounds crazy right? That 
                        there’s an exact clone of yourself 
                        out there that you bump into on the 
                        street? In this city, nonetheless, 
                        where you can get mugged and nobody 
                        stops to help.
                                 DR. NORTON
                        Are you taking your medications?

                                 READE  
                             (hesitant)
                        It wasn’t working. I thought I’d be 
                        better off without pills, you know, 
                        get chemically imbalanced again to 
                        remember what balanced is like.

                                 DR. NORTON
                        I really fear that your behavior is 
                        becoming dangerously antisocial. If 
                        you stopped taking them... 

                                 READE
                        BUT WHAT’S THE POINT?! Nothing has 
                        ever worked. Pills don’t fucking 
                        erase shame: how worthless I feel. 
                        How lonely I am keeping this to 
                        myself, trying to spare the people 
                        I love agony that they can’t fix 
                        me. How humiliating it is seeing 
                        disgust on the faces of people I do 
                        tell. We have tried everything, and 
                        it’s failed. So why keep doing this 
                        to myself? I'm already reminded 
                        every day I’m not one of the normal 
                        ones, when it’s all I want to be.  

           He quiets down, regretting his emotional outburst.

                                 READE (CONT’D)
                             (lying)
                        I’m still on the drugs. I was just 
                        kidding. Thought you’d laugh. 

           EXT. CHELSEA STREETS. NIGHT.

           Reade wanders through Chelsea to clear his noisy mind. Behind 
           him, he hears an ENGINE PURRING.

           Turning, he notices an UNMARKED CAR crawling down the street. 
           Stalking him. Predatory. The car, a block away, pulls to the 
           curb, turns off its headlights, and lulls.

           Intimidated, Reade hurries away, but soon senses the vehicle 
           BEHIND HIM, following. He scampers around the street corner. 

           Once out of sight he breaks into a sprint, notices a towncar, 
           flings open its door, and hops in the backseat... 
           INT. TOWNCAR. CHELSEA STREETS. NIGHT.

           Reade startles the YOUNG UBER DRIVER at the wheel.

                                 DRIVER
                        Woah. The fuck! Who are you?!

           The UNMARKED CAR passes them, speeding down the street.

                                 READE
                        Follow that car!

                                 DRIVER
                        What?

                                 READE
                        Follow that car!

                                 DRIVER
                        I don’t even fucking know you.

                                 READE
                        Is that a “U” on your windshield? A 
                        pink mustache on the dashboard? I’m 
                        hiring you to FOLLOW THAT CAR. 

                                 DRIVER
                        It doesn’t work like that, you have 
                        to request me on your -- 

           Reade flings twenties at him.

                                 READE
                        FOLLOW THE GODDAMN CAR! 

           EXT. TOWNCAR. CHELSEA STREETS. NIGHT. MOMENTS LATER. 

           On the sidewalk, having just been kicked out of the towncar, 
           Reade grimaces at the driver: 

                                 READE
                             (daggers in his eyes)
                        I have never hated anyone as much 
                        as I hate you right now.  

           Reade SLAMS the door shut, and the driver zooms off. 

           INT. READE’S SOHO LOFT. NIGHT.

           Reade stumbles into his loft, hits the lights and immediately 
           sees the glimmer off a PAIR OF KEYS set on the counter. 
           He approaches, lingers his hand over them: TASHA’S SET, left 
           behind for him. Reade struggles to swallow his emptiness. 

           IN HIS BEDROOM:

           Though subtle, Reade tracks her items missing here and there. 
           Arts magazines off the nightstand. Gillian Flynn novels from 
           the bookshelf. Foreign films from the entertainment unit.

           IN THE CLOSET:

           Empty hangers on Tasha’s side of their closet taunt him, the 
           shell of a once lived-in domain.

           On the closet floor, Reade notices an OLD CARDBOARD BOX.

           BACK IN HIS BEDROOM:

           Reade sits on his bed sifting through items from the BOX: 

           A FRAMED PICTURE of a YOUNGER READE with his PARENTS. 

           A beat-up billfold with his CALIFORNIA ID.

           And a TATTERED LEATHER JACKET.

           MINUTES LATER:

           Reade storms around the room, on cell, talking with Tasha. 

                                 TASHA (V.O.)
                        Why are you panicking?

                                 READE
                        Where did you find it?

                                 TASHA (V.O.)
                        That box was in your closet, Reade, 
                        just shoved in the back. I’ve never 
                        seen it before, so I pulled it out 
                        for you to look through.

           Reade contemplates the tattered leather jacket, staring up at 
           him from his bed next to the old family photograph.

                                 TASHA (V.O.)
                        Reade?

           He’s quiet.

                                 TASHA (V.O.)
                        Reade...
                                 READE
                        Yes?

                                 TASHA (V.O.)
                        Who are the people in that photo?

           BANG. BANG. BANG. Three knocks at his front door.

                                 READE
                        I gotta run.  

           INT. READE’S SOHO LOFT BUILDING. HALLWAY. NIGHT.

           Reade peeks out his door, opening it slowly, finding nobody. 
           Curious, he steps out into the shadowy hallway:

                                 THE STRANGER (O.S.)
                        It’s only me.

           Reade JUMPS, startled at the sight of THE STRANGER dimly lit 
           on the other end of the corridor.

                                 READE
                        Christ, stop sneaking up on me like 
                        that. Lurking’s weird, man.

                                 THE STRANGER
                        I know how we can help each other.

           EXT. READE’S SOHO LOFT. NIGHT. MOMENTS LATER. 

           The stranger pushes into the loft, directly into the kitchen. 
           Pulling out a tumbler glass, filling it with scotch, offering 
           the neat cocktail to Reade... 

                                 THE STRANGER
                        Drink.

           Reade, frazzled, accepts.  

                                 THE STRANGER (CONT’D)
                        What’s it like to be wanted?

                                 READE
                        What?

                                 THE STRANGER
                        To be wanted. How does it feel?

                                 READE
                        I don’t really remember.
                                 THE STRANGER 
                        And I never knew. My folks couldn’t 
                        afford to have me. Hated me for it. 
                        Nasty. Verbally abusive. Raised me 
                        to be elite. I think they expected 
                        me to save them. They had absurd 
                        standards and punished me when I 
                        didn’t live up to them. Starved me.  
                             (motioning to his arm:)
                        Scarred me.

           The stranger paces, excited.

                                 THE STRANGER (CONT’D)
                        You see, Reade, you were created by 
                        wealth and power, and I created by 
                        poverty and despair. We’ll never 
                        know that other half. Unless we 
                        switched places.

                                 READE
                        What?

                                 THE STRANGER
                        Maybe I’m fucking with you. 
                             (motioning to his glass:)
                        Drink.

           Reade obeys. 

                                 THE STRANGER (CONT’D)
                        I’ve been learning from you, Reade. 
                        Living vicariously through you. And 
                        that man is taking everything away. 
                        He’s breaking you apart. 
                             (mischievous)
                        Erase him. 

                                 READE
                        Sebastian?

                                 THE STRANGER
                        Look at us. Fucking identical. It’s 
                        a gift. Be your own alibi. You can 
                        use our likeness to literally get 
                        away with murder and erase him for 
                        good. Once he goes away this will 
                        all be over. 

           The stranger moves in closer, has it all thought out.
                                 THE STRANGER (CONT’D)
                        You can be in two places at once. 
                        On one side of town: Reade McCarthy 
                        is spotted arguing with a loose 
                        cannon blonde in a well-populated 
                        restaurant. On the other: Sebastian 
                        has a careless, tragic accident. 
                        You can lure him in, he trusts you. 
                        Something clean. Slipped from the 
                        subway platform. Fell off his fire 
                        escape. Liquor tends to make even 
                        the best of men clumsy. Or maybe it 
                        was intentional? Leaving behind one 
                        simple note about how the emotional 
                        strain of his divorce was just too 
                        much for him to stomach.

                                 READE
                        You’re evil.

                                 THE STRANGER
                        I’m a necessary evil. Sometimes you 
                        need to listen to the devil on your 
                        shoulder. 

           Reade doesn’t match the stranger’s eyes, just stares before 
           him in serious concentration. 

                                 READE
                        And why put yourself at risk?

                                 THE STRANGER
                        I’ve nothing to lose and everything 
                        to gain.

                                 READE
                        Gain...?

                                 THE STRANGER
                        The other piece of you. 
                             (beat)
                        That double life you’ve lived and 
                        threw away. I can be the “you” with 
                        Nicolette. I get to know what it’s 
                        like to feel wanted with things you 
                        no longer want. And you silence her 
                        by giving her what she won’t get: a 
                        life with you. Think how successful 
                        you’ll be with two of you. Working 
                        together to craft a perfect image. 
                        Your perfect life. 
                             (hopeful)
                        Let me share that life with you.  
           INT. READE’S SOHO LOFT. BEDROOM. NIGHT.

           Reade lies awake in bed, studying the ceiling tiles.   

           INT. READE’S SOHO LOFT. BATHROOM. DAY.

           The next morning, Reade stands in his shower allowing water 
           to cascade over him, lost in thought. 

           He lathers seaweed shampoo in his palms, and brings his hands 
           to his thick, healthy locks. 

           Rinsing, he notices a few strands of hair in the water. 

           Concerned, he gently runs his hands across his scalp and more 
           strands appear on his fingertips. 

           Panicking, Reade bolts out of the shower, naked and dripping 
           wet, a puddle forming at his feet. He catches his reflection 
           in the mirror and sees the hair falling out of his head. 

           Losing his mind infuriated, he punches the mirror. The vanity 
           SHATTERS into a dozen pieces. His knuckles bleed. 

           Reade grabs a sharp shard of glass.

           Punishing himself, he raises the shard to the HIDEOUS SCAR on 
           his forearm and cuts it deeply along the tissue.  

           To feel something. Searching for a release.

           Reade closes his eyes breathing through the pain, opens them, 
           and finds the mirror back intact. 

           The glass unbroken.

           His hair, damp, yet still attached to his head.

           His hands clean and unwounded.

           We see it in his eyes: nothing physically wrong.  

           INT. BRYANT PARK OFFICE. READE’S CORNER. DAY.

           Reade sits at his desk, numb, staring vapidly at his mobile.

           His phone suddenly begins VIBRATING. Startled, he answers and 
           speaks with the HOSTESS on the other end:

                                 READE
                        This is Reade.
                                 HOSTESS (V.O.)
                        Good afternoon! May I please speak 
                        with Mr. McCarthy?

                                 READE 
                        You already are.

                                 HOSTESS (V.O.)
                        Calling to confirm your reservation 
                        with us. Tonight at A’Loure. 9:30. 

                                 READE
                        9:30?

                                 HOSTESS (V.O.)
                        9:30. Tonight.

                                 READE
                        Yes, that’s correct. Actually, may 
                        I request a different table?

                                 HOSTESS
                        Certainly.

                                 READE
                        The busy one, by the window in the 
                        main dining room, please.  

           INT. BRYANT PARK OFFICE. HALLWAY. DAY. MOMENTS LATER.

           Reade slinks out of his office and toward Sebastian’s end of 
           the hall, swallowing his pride.

           Sebastian, with adorable faux spectacles on, stares fervently 
           at his computer, typing an e-mail. Reade pokes his head in:

                                 READE
                        Let’s start over.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        With...?

           INT. HORNS NIGHTCLUB. MEATPACKING DISTRICT. NIGHT.

           A POUNDING BASS provides the backbeat for hundreds of sweaty, 
           pulsating bodies belonging to YOUNG NEW YORKERS thriving to a 
           POP-TECHNO rhythm (and each other).  

           IN THE BATHROOM:

           Reade and Sebastian stand cramped in a stall doing KEY-BUMPS. 
           Inhaling the vile’s powder, Reade’s eyes widen. 
                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Didn’t I tell you?

                                 READE
                             (smiling)
                        Fuck.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        JAGGER!!

           BACK AT THE BAR:

           Moments later, our dynamic duo pound down two tequila shots, 
           grimacing at the taste.

                                 SEBASTIAN (CONT’D)  
                        Was that top shelf?

           They take extra swigs of beer to offset the flavor. 

                                 READE
                        I know I owe you an apology for how 
                        I’ve been treating you.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        I’m not innocent either. I really 
                        regret inviting that woman to Aras’ 
                        play. I should’ve left it alone, 
                        knowing it bothered you so much.

                                 READE
                        We’re pretty terrible.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        But think how powerful we will be 
                        once we combine our evil.  

           Sebastian ogles a gorgeous redheaded BUSINESS SKIRT strutting 
           past them balancing three drinks.

                                 SEBASTIAN (CONT’D)
                             (shamelessly)
                        For us? We don’t need to be drunk 
                        to let you take advantage.

           The redhead turns (at first disgusted) and GIGGLES to herself 
           as she approaches a table with two BANKER DOUCHEBAGS.

                                 SEBASTIAN (CONT’D)
                        Oh, God, investment bankers.

                                 READE
                        Total sociopaths.
                                 SEBASTIAN
                        These finance guys have all lost 
                        touch with reality.  

           The redhead sets the drinks down, quickly gossips about them, 
           and all three pivot to size up our boys.

           After a beat, the business skirt’s male colleagues approach.

                                 BANKER BRO
                        My girl just mentioned how much you 
                        were admiring her, so I figured I’d 
                        introduce myself since you clearly 
                        think I have great taste.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Didn’t know she was taken.

                                 BANKER BRAH
                        What firm are you with?

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Duality PR. 

           The bankers look at one another, and BURST into laughter.

                                 BANKER BRO
                        Public relations!

                                 BANKER BRAH
                        Brah, these guys trying to mack on 
                        Amanda are publicists?!

                                 BANKER BRO
                        I thought straight publicists were 
                        just a myth.

                                 BANKER BRAH
                        Like the recession.

                                 BANKER BRO
                        Those women got ya castrated?

                                 BANKER BRAH
                        You piss sitting down?

                                 READE
                        That’s enough.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Don’t you have hookers to buy and 
                        illegitimate children to father?
                                 BANKER BRO
                        Sorry, my girl’s into men that make 
                        real cash. Not the spare change you 
                        peasants blow each other for in the 
                        Dust Bowl. 

                                 BANKER BRAH
                        Bush league.

           Blood boiling and red faced, Sebastian launches his fist into 
           the chiseled jaw of the redhead’s boyfriend. 

           Sebastian recoils in pain, clenching his hand:

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Goddamn that hurts!

           The banker retaliates, knocking Sebastian to the ground.

           Reade swings at the second bro, getting a few hits in before 
           taking a hard blow to his own face. Disoriented, he holds up 
           his hands non-confrontational: 

                                 READE
                        I didn’t even want to be here.

           The second banker jabs him in the stomach, knocking the wind 
           out of Reade. Then another, relentlessly wailing on him.

           Nothing at all glamorous about this fight, our boys get their 
           asses handed to them. 

           The MUSIC grinds to a halt as SECURITY GUARDS beeline through 
           drunk spectators. Gaining footing, Reade yanks Sebastian to 
           his feet and the two flee, scurrying through a side door. 

           EXT. MEATPACKING DISTRICT. NEW YORK CITY. NIGHT.

           Reade and Sebastian dart through the streets, slowing as soon 
           as they notice they’ve advanced a few blocks without a trail.

           They lock into each other’s eyes, leaning on knees, catching 
           their breath, bruised faces, hurt egos, blood-stained noses. 
           And they CRACK UP, defeated. 

           Something about the chaos bonded them inadvertently. 

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        I really thought we were gonna win.

                                 READE
                        That was nothing like the movies. 
           Reade notices Sebastian is BAREFOOT. 

                                 READE (CONT’D)
                        What happened to your shoes?

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        They slipped off.

                                 READE
                        They slipped off?

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        They were slip-ons.

                                 READE
                        Why are you wearing slip-on loafers 
                        at all?

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Bloomies had a great sale. 

                                 READE
                        You’re a grown man, wear laces.

           Sebastian stumbles embarrassingly intoxicated along the edge 
           of the sidewalk. Reade notices the lights of a SPEEDING TAXI 
           barreling toward them. We notice his eyes, contemplating how 
           easy it would be to bump him into traffic.  

           But Sebastian slips off the curb on his own...

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Woah.

           ...and lurches himself back to safety seconds before the cab 
           blasts past, HONKING, enraged. 

                                 READE
                        I should get home.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Don’t let those douchebags ruin our 
                        night. My divorce is finalized in a 
                        few days, we’re a few stops from my 
                        loft, and I need a nightcap. 
                             (vulnerable)
                        Please?

           INT. SEBASTIAN’S LES APARTMENT. NIGHT.

           Reade follows Sebastian into his apartment, immediately taken 
           by its sleek design and charming furniture, and breathing a 
           sigh of relief at its modest size.
                                 SEBASTIAN
                        I know it’s a little tight, but it 
                        feels like all I need since I’m on 
                        the road so much. 

           Sebastian opens the balcony door, STREET NOISE flooding into 
           the apartment, to show off the terrace. 

                                 SEBASTIAN (CONT’D)
                        What a gorgeous view though, right?

           Sebastian shuffles to the bar cart to fetch drinks as Reade 
           sneaks out to admire the balcony. 

           Reade considers the scene: the low railings, a sharp drop to 
           the street below, his bar cart’s convenient proximity to the 
           terrace. All plausible evidence for an accident.

           Sebastian returns, handing him a beverage:

                                 SEBASTIAN (CONT’D) 
                        Tequila soda.

                                 READE
                             (sipping)
                        This is just tequila.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Tequila flavored soda.  

           Reade clocks Sebastian’s hefty gulps. With each he grows more 
           inebriated. Eyes red. Off balanced. Slurred words. 

                                 READE
                        I hear that congratulations are in 
                        order soon. 

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        For who?

                                 READE
                        For you.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        For what?

                                 READE
                        For partner?

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Are you serious?
                                 READE
                        I wanted to be the bigger person 
                        and commend you since... 

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        This is the first I’m hearing it. 
                        PARTNER?! And you-- you’re not.

                                 READE
                        No, just you. Lucky me. Because of 
                        the Val fiasco, the timing doesn’t 
                        feel quite right.  

           As Sebastian gloats Reade maintains composure, turning to the 
           living room bookshelf, distracting himself. He spies the time 
           on an analog clock: 10:45 PM.

           Amongst the paperbacks he notices a CLEAR CYLINDRICAL TROPHY.

           The same award Sebastian unpacked in his office. 

                                 READE (CONT’D)
                        You took your award home from work?

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        I have two.

           Reade’s eyes narrow envious at the inscription...

           BEST PUBLICITY CAMPAIGN, MOTION PICTURE, 2013.

                                 SEBASTIAN (CONT’D)
                        Don’t know why I keep them really. 
                        Such a joke of a campaign. It’s 
                        like they give them away to anyone 
                        remotely talented. 

           Reade fumes, clutching knuckles into a fist, but manages the 
           strength to refrain and decides to politely leave.

                                 READE
                        Drink water, you’re head’s gonna be 
                        pounding tomorrow. I’m taking off.

           Sebastian leans on the arm of his sofa, beaming. 

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Man, do you realize how unstoppable 
                        I am? Reade McCarthy couldn’t crack 
                        the pressures at work and lost his 
                        promotion to me.  

           And that’s the last fucking straw.
           READE SNAPS: grabbing the large trophy and hurling it across 
           the room, expertly connecting it with Sebastian’s head.  

           Sebastian’s neck snaps back as he falls, dazed, to the floor.

           Reade rushes to Sebastian’s side, teeth clenched, eyes glazed 
           over in rage, grabs the award off the hardwood, and pounds it 
           furiously into his skull. Blood delicately mists his cheeks.

           Sebastian SPUTTERS, gasping for air. His MUFFLED SCREAMS lost 
           in ambient STREET NOISE drifting through still-open balcony 
           doors. His nose SNAPS. Jaw CRUNCHES. CHOKING on fluid.

                                 READE
                        You can take the things I love away 
                        from me, but you can’t have what I 
                        spent my life to develop: my wants, 
                        my desires, my tastes, my EMOTIONS, 
                        my EXPERIENCES, MY NAME. 

           Reade stares down at a lifeless, unrecognizable face.

                                 READE (CONT’D)
                        Imitation isn’t the fucking same.

           And suddenly snapping back into the moment, he discerns the 
           crime he just committed was not, at all, clean.

                                 READE (CONT’D)
                        Oh my God. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. This 
                        is disgusting it’s under my nails. 

           EXT. LOWER EAST SIDE STREETS. NEW YORK CITY. NIGHT.

           Reade hurries down the sidewalk, failing miserably at looking 
           casual as he hunts for a taxi. He spots the reflection of red 
           and blue FLICKERING LIGHTS from a police car on the pavement 
           before him, approaching from behind.

           Reade removes himself from the street, to cut across...

           TOMPKINS SQUARE PARK.

           The familiar sound of a car door SLAMMING SHUT doesn’t escape 
           Reade. Glancing over his shoulder, Reade senses a FIGURE just 
           a few yards behind, now shadowing him.

           Unnerved, he breaks into a light jog. The figure seems to be 
           mimicking his pace, jogging as well.

           Startled, Reade breaks into a sprint through the shady park, 
           pops out the other side, and dashes down the next street. 
           FOOTSTEPS scurry across pavement, CHASING HIM, audible in the 
           distance as he flees. MEN begin SHOUTING, though Reade cannot 
           hear them over the sound of his heart POUNDING in his chest. 

           Bright beams from their flashlights dance upon the ground. 

           Reade turns on a dime, careens between buildings down a dank 
           alleyway. At the end of the alley: a locked gate. Trapped. 

           Reade ascends the fence and flings his body over, feeling the 
           graze of a flashlight on his cheek as he falls. 

           He lands with a graceless THUD, knocking the wind out of him, 
           but with no time to lose, Reade continues limping away. 

           Reade peeks over his shoulder once more, only to find nobody 
           is actually there. 

           The alleyway is completely empty.

           INT. READE’S SOHO LOFT. NIGHT.

           Reade stumbles into his loft, hits the lights and immediately 
           finds his apartment in shambles. Drawers are open, furniture 
           overturned, items carelessly tossed aside.

           Was he robbed? No. On closer inspection it looks like someone 
           wanted something specific. 

           IN HIS BEDROOM:

           Reade learns the same chaotic fate met his beloved belongings 
           there. Clothes on the floor. Papers strewn about. 

           IN HIS MASTER BATHROOM:

           Shattered glass on the tile. His prized products maliciously 
           destroyed. Reade bends to find a TINY GREEN JAR in pieces, 
           the day cream he was so fond of now a glob on the ground.

                                 READE
                        What kind of savage...

           Standing, taped to the mirror, he spots a BUSINESS CARD.

           Very clearly, it advertises the W HOTEL in MIDTOWN, with the 
           words “COME	  FIND	  ME” scribbled upon its white background. 

           INT. W HOTEL NEW YORK. LOBBY. NIGHT.

           Reade marches through the lobby to the FRONT DESK CLERK. 
                                 DESK CLERK
                        Good evening sir, welcome back, how 
                        can I help tonight?

                                 READE
                        I’m afraid I misplaced my room key.  

                                 DESK CLERK
                        Not a problem. Name on the room?

                                 READE
                             (showing identification)
                        Reade McCarthy.  

           The desk clerk’s fingers RATTLE along his keyboard.  

                                 DESK CLERK
                             (hushed now)
                        Yes. McCarthy. We’ve been trying to 
                        reach you. Your party was given its 
                        final warning before we’re asked to 
                        evict you from the premises. All of 
                        the shouting from the room has been 
                        making our other guests here a bit 
                        uncomfortable.

                                 READE
                        Party? Who has access to the room?

                                 DESK CLERK
                        Ms. Tasha Camden is also listed on 
                        your reservation. Is that correct?

                                 READE
                        Tasha Camden, that’s--

                                 DESK CLERK
                        She’s been the point of contact for 
                        us. Is that correct?

                                 READE
                        Yes, that’s correct.

           INT. W HOTEL NEW YORK. HALLWAY. NIGHT.

           Reade hovers his hand over the door, about to insert the key. 

           A “PRIVACY PLEASE” sign hangs on the handle, and from inside, 
           programs from the TELEVISION are blaring.
           INT. W HOTEL NEW YORK. SUITE. NIGHT.

           Reade quietly opens the door, stepping into what looks like a 
           war zone that hasn’t been cleaned in weeks. He kicks a REMOTE 
           at his feet, which he grasps to power off the television. 

           Flipping the lights, Reade’s eyes divert to a FEMALE FIGURE 
           splayed across the bed. The white hotel sheets stained red, 
           and a limp hand dangles over the mattress.  

           Reade’s eyes moisten, cupping a hand to his mouth:

                                 READE
                        Oh my God. Tasha?

           He moves closer, saltwater stinging his cheeks, reaching for 
           the lifeless hand. And, at his touch, the body stirs.

                                 READE (CONT’D)
                             (startled)
                        Jesus Christ!

           A sickening low, HOARSE LAUGH resonates, and the FIGURE perks 
           up revealing Nicolette. Not dead, just deeply inebriated.

                                 NICOLETTE
                        I spilled my damn Merlot.

           Nicolette pulls a (now-empty) bottle from under the sheets. 

                                 NICOLETTE (CONT’D)
                        Took you long enough.

                                 READE
                        What are you doing here?

                                 NICOLETTE
                        You thought you’d cut me off and I 
                        would just let you? What am I gonna 
                        do, get a job? I have no skills!

                                 READE
                        You can’t stay here.

                                 NICOLETTE
                        Yes I can. I have been. You haven’t 
                        even noticed, self-absorbed prick. 

           Nicolette sits up, pulling wine stained sheets to conceal her 
           half-naked body.
                                 NICOLETTE (CONT’D)
                        I changed my mind tonight. Thought 
                        if I couldn’t have you I didn’t 
                        want anything anymore. And they’d 
                        find me here: bruised, bloody, and 
                        naked. In a hotel room, littered 
                        with your possessions. 

           Reade notices she collected his belongings, strewn around the 
           suite as part of her setup. 

                                 NICOLETTE (CONT’D)
                        Surely, they’d lock up the man with 
                        prints everywhere and card on file. 
                        But why should I sacrifice myself 
                        just because you didn’t want me the 
                        way I wanted you? So mark my words: 
                        I will always have that power over 
                        you. I know your dirtiest secrets. 
                        What those labels on your pill 
                        bottles mean. The real reason you 
                        visit that doctor. You think lying 
                        about having dead parents gets you 
                        sympathy? Makes you relatable? 
                        Untraceable? I know all things that 
                        break you down. I have everything.
                        Privacy is just a myth you used to 
                        know. Your precious contacts, your 
                        passwords, the incriminating photos 
                        off your computer. Wasn’t that a 
                        clever touch? One click, and I let 
                        everybody see the real you.

           Nicolette begins HACKING, clears her throat.

                                 NICOLETTE (CONT’D)
                        This was all just a game: to see if 
                        I could actually control the man 
                        who would never relinquish control. 
                             (beaming)
                        And don’t ever forget that I can.

           Reade dumps the contents of his wallet onto the bed.

                                 READE
                        Take it all. I have nothing left. 

           Reade flings his wallet aside and notices, in the doorway of 
           the suite’s bathroom: THE STRANGER.

                                 READE (CONT’D) 
                        You’re in on this together? You’re 
                        conspiring against me?!
           The mysterious man doesn’t respond. 

                                 READE (CONT’D)
                        I trusted you, and you abandoned me 
                        in my GOD DAMN HOUR OF NEED? 

           Nicolette glances around, suddenly fearful.

                                 NICOLETTE
                        Reade, who are you talking to?

                                 READE
                        I KILLED THAT MAN BECAUSE OF YOU!

                                 NICOLETTE
                        Stop, you’re scaring me. 

           The hotel phone RINGS vigorously, likely due to the shouting.

                                 READE
                             (to Nicolette)
                        I hope I never speak to you again. 
                        I promise you, if I do, those will 
                        be your last words. 

           INT. W HOTEL NEW YORK. HALLWAY. NIGHT.

           Reade storms down the hallway to the elevator. Behind him, he 
           sees THE STRANGER slowly walking, ominously pacing.

           INT. W HOTEL NEW YORK. LOBBY. NIGHT.

           Reade hurries out of the lift into the lobby and, even there, 
           THE STRANGER appears, a few yards behind. Slowly approaching.

           EXT. MIDTOWN STREETS. NIGHT.

           Reade maneuvers through crowds, sprinting now, every so often 
           glancing over his shoulder to see THE STRANGER walking at the 
           same pace, still close behind, inescapable. 

           INT. SUBWAY “5” TRAIN. NIGHT.

           Reade runs down the station stairs, out of breath, broken and 
           alone. The shadow of THE STRANGER lurking as a distant trail. 
           A train SQUEALS into the station, and Reade scoots to the lip 
           of the platform: faces the incoming train, positions his feet 
           at the edge, and bends his body into the train’s trajectory. 
                                 THE STRANGER (O.S.)
                        You think this solves everything?

           Hearing him, Reade recoils just as the train speeds in.

                                 THE STRANGER (CONT’D)
                        Nothing can ever erase who you are. 

                                 READE
                        I am a strong person. I am stronger 
                        than you. I can overcome you.

                                 THE STRANGER
                        You’re a prisoner in your own body. 
                        How can you escape me when I’m that 
                        thing inside your head? Keeping you 
                        up at night. I’m all your twisted 
                        dreams. The ghost of you before you 
                        had anything. Once everything falls 
                        apart. Your broken past will always 
                        be a part of you.

                                 READE
                        STOP IT!! ENOUGH!!

           Reade SCREAMS at the top of his lungs, clenching fists to his 
           ears, trying to tune him out, but the stranger just CACKLES. 

                                 THE STRANGER
                        THERE HE IS! Let Manhattan finally 
                        hear him. The real Reade McCarthy. 

           Reade grabs the stranger by the shoulders and flings his body 
           against a subway pillar. The man GUFFAWS, amused.

                                 THE STRANGER (CONT’D)
                        You’ll only ever be that worthless 
                        loser from Blythe. Slobbering over 
                        venomous words. Smoking cigarettes 
                        like a filthy vagrant. You deserve 
                        nothing.

           Reade throws him on the ground, bringing fists into the man’s 
           face repeatedly, who in turn LAUGHS, continuing to taunt him.

           Reade squeezes his eyes shut trying to assuage his noisy mind 
           and, upon opening them, finds THE STRANGER: again, vanished. 

           Left in his wake is nothing but the cracked platform concrete 
           and Reade’s swollen, purple, broken fist. 

           A group of TOURISTS form a circle around him, filming the odd 
           commotion on their SMARTPHONES, whispering to each other.
           Reade peels himself off the ground, trying to shield his face 
           as he tears away from the scene. 

           INT. READE’S SOHO LOFT. BEDROOM. DAY.

           We’re unsure what day it is. Reade lays naked atop his covers 
           staring blankly at the ceiling, numb to his ALARM blaring.

           INT. BRYANT PARK OFFICE. HALLWAY. DAY.

           Reade wanders down the hallway, suit disheveled, hair a total 
           mess, eyes crimson, hand bandaged. His cheeks visibly bruised 
           from the recent brawl with those mean investment bankers.

           Barbara turns the corner, GASPING at the sight of him as she 
           ambles out of her office:

                                 BARBARA
                        Jesus. You look like shit, I didn’t 
                        think that was possible.

           Behind her, Sebastian peeks his head out of the office door. 

           His face is also still scratched from that bar fight. 

           Reade’s eyes widen in horror.

                                 READE
                        This is my fucking nightmare.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Reade. You OK?

                                 READE
                        You’re, but...

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        What?

                                 READE
                        That night back at your place, and-- 
                        you’re alive?

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Barely. I had a wicked hangover for 
                        days. But, wasn’t anything a little 
                        coconut water couldn’t fix. You did 
                        leave my balcony door open, though. 
                        Caught a bit of a cough...

           A somber beat as Reade catches Barbara’s concerned glance.
                                 READE
                        I’m done.

                                 BARBARA
                        McCarthy, I think it’s time you and 
                        I discussed a brief sabbatical.

                                 READE
                        No. I quit. Come after me. Sue me. 
                        I can’t care anymore.

           INT. MANHATTAN BALLET SCHOOL. DAY. 

           Reade peers through the pane windows on a door of a rehearsal 
           room where Tasha works, studying a dozen BALLET STUDENTS in a 
           glorious routine she’s choreographed. 

           He’s enamored by her: How her eyes moisten as she watches the 
           inspired performance. How she gently taps her thighs in tempo 
           with the music. How Tasha seems, almost, at the happiest he’s 
           remembered ever seeing her.

           The dancers finish and Tasha stands, addressing them with, at 
           first passionate APPLAUSE, then a few notes, before releasing 
           them for the afternoon. The door opens and students file out, 
           molding paths around Reade. He catches Tasha’s eyes. 

           MOMENTS LATER:

           The class has vacated, and our two estranged lovers connect.

                                 TASHA
                        It’s really great to see you.
                             (sadly)
                        It’s been weeks, without a word. I 
                        know that I shouldn’t have expected 
                        a call, but I guess I kind of hoped 
                        you were thinking about me... 

                                 READE
                        I was trying to figure out how to 
                        fix things with us. And-- myself.

           Building the courage within himself:

                                 READE (CONT’D)
                        I need you to know how much I love 
                        you. I wanted the world so I’d have 
                        something to give you. To deserve 
                        you, even with all the worst parts 
                        of me. 

           He nervously, genuinely, confesses...
                                 READE (CONT’D)
                        I’m not pure. I’m not pedigree. I’m 
                        a product of dysfunction. I lied 
                        about who I am. About my parents. 
                        About that abusive piece of my past 
                        I hoped to never introduce you to. 
                        I thought shedding that old Reade, 
                        creating a better identity, would 
                        heal me. I thought if I could hide 
                        the truth, be larger-than-life, 
                        that nobody would ever notice. It 
                        was an obsession: moving forward so 
                        I never had to look back at this 
                        struggle I’ve fought my whole life.

           He gestures to his temples, and it all makes sense to her.

                                 READE (CONT’D)
                        I kept quiet about it because I was 
                        worried if I opened my mouth you’d 
                        scream so loud it would shatter the 
                        world we created. I thought I could 
                        overcome it myself: pretend I was 
                        well enough, go without medication. 
                        I wanted to give you the normal 
                        life you deserved. And I’m sorry I 
                        can’t ever give you that. 

           Reade takes her hands in his.

                                 READE (CONT’D)
                        I didn’t tell you because I didn’t 
                        want that to be the reason you left 
                        me. And I didn’t tell you because I 
                        didn’t want that to be the reason 
                        you stayed. 

           Tasha stands silently with him, in the moment.

           SUPER: SOME TIME HAS PASSED...

           INT. DR. NORTON’S CHELSEA OFFICE. DAY.

           Reade sits on Dr. Norton’s leather couch, exhibiting an air 
           of confidence and relief about him. 

                                 DR. NORTON
                        But you’re still on the regiment?

                                 READE
                        New drugs. Same concerns.
                                 DR. NORTON
                        And they’re working?

                                 READE
                        The first couple weeks it was still 
                        there. In slow motion. But, now, it 
                        seems like they are.

                                 DR. NORTON
                        Good.

                                 READE
                        Phil, will I ever get better?

                                 DR. NORTON
                        There’s a classic quote: that some 
                        people have a 2 AM personality and 
                        a 2 PM one. 

                                 READE
                        So, one is the monster and one is 
                        the man?

                                 DR. NORTON
                        But only a few are brave enough to 
                        get treatment for it. 

                                 READE
                        Monsters under the bed aren’t real. 
                        But monsters in your head convince 
                        you they’re not real either.

                                 DR. NORTON
                        Tell your story. Help someone else 
                        understand other people are living 
                        with this. Just like they are. 

           INT. READE’S SOHO LOFT. DAY.

           A landline telephone RINGS (yes a landline, who thought those 
           even still existed?), yet Reade answers proudly. 

                                 READE

           Pulling back, we notice heaps of boxes stacked throughout the 
           loft, behind Reade’s makeshift home office, and TASHA combing 
           through them. She’s finally moved in. 

                                 READE (CONT’D)
                        Aras! I’ve been calling you all day 
                        you talented fuck. Congratulations!
                             (proudly:)
                                 (MORE)
                                 READE (CONT’D)
                        Remember, I told you first! No more 
                        thinking small. You’re a star. Tony 
                        Nominee, Aras Harris. I could get 
                        used to pitching you that way... 
                        Almost as used to pitching you as 
                        Tony Winner, Aras Harris. 

                                 TASHA
                        Reade, don’t jinx him.

           She bends to shout into the phone, Aras still on the line.

                                 TASHA (CONT’D)
                        Don’t listen! He’s a silly suit who 
                        knows nothing about superstition. 

                                 READE
                        Love you, Aras. Go celebrate. We’ll 
                        talk tomorrow. 

           Reade hangs up. Tasha kisses him on the cheek sweetly. 

           The PHONE RINGS again.

           INT. NYPD POLICE STATION. ADAM STANLEY’S OFFICE. DAY.

           Detective Stanley sits behind his desk, brow furrowed. 

                                 DETECTIVE STANLEY
                        Reade McCarthy?

                                 READE
                        Speaking.

                                 DETECTIVE STANLEY
                        Detective Adam Stanley, with NYPD. 
                        Thrilled to say an eyewitness came 
                        forward in our investigation of Ms. 
                        Valerie Hanks’ homicide. We’d like 
                        for you to come to the station for 
                        a quick lineup.

                                 READE
                        A lineup?
                                 DETECTIVE STANLEY
                        You’ve seen them on TV. Let’s clear 
                        your name for good, make sure we’re 
                        fingering the right guy, you know? 

           Reade’s heart sinks in his chest, suddenly unsure.

                                 DETECTIVE STANLEY (CONT’D)
                        You know?

                                 READE
                        Yes... I know. When and where?

           INT. NYPD POLICE STATION. 20TH PRECINCT. DAY.

           Reade stands in the lineup among an array of different shaped 
           and sized POTENTIAL CRIMINALS, bearing a #6 on his chest.

                                 DETECTIVE STANLEY (O.S.)
                        Number four, please step forward. 
                        Thank you. Number five, please step 
                        forward. Thank you. And number six, 
                        please step forward. 

           Regretting why he volunteered to come down to the station, he 
           obeys, and steps closer to the one-way mirror. 

                                 DETECTIVE STANLEY (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Thank you. And number seven... 

           EXT. NYPD POLICE STATION. 20TH PRECINCT. DAY. LATER.

           Reade and Detective Stanley speak on the sidewalk. We aren’t 
           able to hear what they’re talking about, but Stanley shaking 
           Reade’s hand may be all we need to know.

           Reade wanders off from the police station and an overwhelming 
           sensation of relief rushes over him. He tears up. 

           Half a block away, though, he notices a familiar, smug face.

                                 READE
                        I thought you didn’t smoke.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Another example of one of the many 
                        lies I’ve told you. 

           It’s Sebastian, flicking a cigarette into the gutter. 
                                 SEBASTIAN (CONT’D)
                        I like you, Reade. I sincerely miss 
                        you around the office.

                                 READE
                        Go fuck yourself.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        I do, and enjoy it quite regularly. 

           Suddenly realizing:

                                 READE
                        You were the eyewitness?

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Of course not. I’m too close to the 
                        crime. But you can forever thank me 
                        and the blonde that was once yours. 
                             (beat)
                        Have a nice life, you deserve it.     

           They part ways. Then...

                                 READE
                        Wait. But did I do it?

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Life is cruel, and people die every 
                        day. It just happens.  

                                 READE
                        But did I do it?

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Well, I guess, now nobody will ever 
                        know who really did. 

           Sebastian separates, leaving Reade to linger alone collecting  
           his thoughts. Stunned and confused, he decides to let him go, 
           turning in the opposite direction. 

           Two similar men, their minds and bodies growing distant from 
           one another for good.
