           SMASH UP ON...

           EXT. SHANNON HOUSE - DAY (ESTABLISHING)

           Red brick.  Green roof.  Distinct storybook charm in a quiet 
           working class neighborhood. 

           SAXOPHONE MUSIC can be heard within.

           Clutching a BABY DOLL to her chest, pigtailed adorable CLARE 
           SHANNON (5), barrels out the front door.  All spirit and 
           energy.

           She retrieves her PINK TRICYCLE from the yard, tosses her 
           doll in the basket, and hops on, ready for an adventure.

                                 CLARE
                        Momma!  How far can I go?!

           Her mother, JOHANNA SHANNON (30s) appears in the doorway.  
           Barefoot.  Casual.  An easy smile.

                                 JOHANNA
                        Not too far.  Just down the street 
                        and back.

                                 CLARE
                        Awww.

           Next door, MRS. DE LUCA (50s), a tough independent old bird, 
           looks up from weeding her flower bed.

                                 MRS. DE LUCA
                        I’ll keep an eye on her, Jo!

           Johanna nods and turns back to the house.  As she goes, we 
           catch a glimpse, the faintest flash, of a heaviness.  A 
           sorrow fathoms deep.

           But she disappears inside before we can ponder it further.

           And WE RETURN TO--

           CLARE 

           Pedalling down the driveway and out to the sidewalk.  High on  *
           the deliciousness of her imagination. 

           EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD SIDEWALK - DAY (LATER)

           TRING TRING!  Clare’s tricycle plows through fallen leaves. 

           TRING TRING!  Clare hits a bump and bounces high in the seat,  *
           but that doesn’t slow her. 

           If anything, she pedals harder.  Faster. 

           She comes to the end of the street, U-TURNS, and races back.
           Faster.  Faster.

           TRING TRING! She takes a sharp turn and intentionally 
           CRASHES into the front lawn of the--

           EXT. SHANNON HOUSE - DAY

           Uninjured and thoroughly pleased with herself, Clare snatches  *
           her BABY DOLL out of the bike basket and waves to Mrs. De 
           Luca.

                                 CLARE
                        Mrs. Luca!  I crashed!  Did you see 
                        it?!

                                 MRS. DE LUCA
                        It was excellent, honey!

           She claps merrily as Clare skips inside.

           INT. SHANNON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Neat.  Eclectic.  As charming on the inside as it is on the 
           outside.  Welcome to a home where artists dwell.

           With a SAXOPHONE to his lips, recklessly handsome LOUIS 
           SHANNON (30s), the quintessential jazz musician, looks up 
           with a smile when Clare tumbles in. 

                                 CLARE
                        Daddy, I crashed and it was cool 
                        beans!

           Louis plays a JAUNTY LITTLE TUNE in acknowledgment and Clare 
           scampers off.  Daddy’s little girl.

           INT. SHANNON HOUSE - STAIRS - DAY

           Breathless and red-cheeked, Clare pounds up. 

                                 CLARE
                        Momma!

           INT. SHANNON HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - DAY

           Clare runs in and looks around.

                                 CLARE
                        Momma?

           But it’s empty and Clare promptly trots out.  Enthusiasm 
           still high.
           INT. SHANNON HOUSE - STUDIO - DAY

           Oils, chalk, and paint litter every surface.  SKETCHES crowd 
           the wall, but they’re turbulent.  Dark.  A hint of 
           instability evident in the swirling chaotic lines.

           Clare peers in, excitement waning. 

                                 CLARE
                        Momma?  Where are you?!

           INT. SHANNON HOUSE - ATTIC STAIRWELL - DAY

           Clare stands at the bottom.  A gaping chasm of blackness 
           looms above her.  She’s scared - no, terrified - to ascend, 
           but--

                                 CLARE
                        Momma?

           Clutching her doll close, she makes her way up.  Step by 
           tremulous step.  But it’s already beginning to dawn on her 
           child’s mind... 

           Something’s not quite right.

           INT. SHANNON HOUSE - ATTIC - DAY

           Clare enters and looks around.  Beyond a few boxes, a table, 
           and a TOPPLED OVER CHAIR, there’s nothing in here.

                                 CLARE
                        Momma?

           CREAK above her.  Clare looks up.  A tight GASP. 

           HER DOLL CLATTERS TO THE FLOOR. 

           INT. SHANNON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Clare’s SCREAM drifts down from above.  

                                 LOUIS 
                        Clare?! 

           No answer.  He drops his sax and runs out.

           INT. SHANNON HOUSE - ATTIC - DAY

           Louis hurries in and kneels in front of his daughter who just 
           stares upward.  Eyes wide and unblinking.

                                 LOUIS
                        Hey.  Hey, big girl.  What’s wrong?  
                        Did a spider getcha?
           But Clare can’t answer.  Can’t move.  All she can do is 
           stare.  Alarmed, Louis follows her gaze and whirls to see-- 

           JOHANNA SWINGING FROM A NOOSE TIED TO A BEAM.  

           Her limbs are limp.  Her face hidden by a fall of dark hair. 

           And she’s very, very dead.

                                 LOUIS (CONT’D)
                           (stunned)
                        Jo?  Baby?

           He races to cut her down.

           BUT WE STAY ON -- CLARE as she continues to stare. 
           Irreparably broken.  Innocence shattered.

           Off this, WE SMASH BLACK.

                                “TWELVE YEARS LATER”

           EXT. SHANNON HOUSE - DAY

           Clare’s PINK TRICYCLE, now rusted and bleached out, still 
           lays on its side in the muddy, OVERGROWN FRONT YARD. 

           The house has likewise fallen into disrepair.  A SPREADING 
           SEA OF JUNK spills off the porch and flows toward the street.

           RUSTY PILES OF SCRAP METAL loom.  

           ALUMINUM CANS overflow garbage bins and bags.  

           Bearded, hunched, and graying, Louis Shannon limps down the 
           front steps and climbs into his busted out truck.  

           The years haven’t been kind.  These days, he’s the 
           neighborhood picker/junker.  A grouch and a nuisance.  The 
           guy everyone laughs at behind his back.

           With effort, he settles in behind the wheel and the engine 
           sputters to life. 

           INT. SHANNON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Filled with scavenged odds and ends, it hasn’t been properly 
           cleaned in a decade.  It’s dark.  Oppressive.  A prison.

           MAX, a ridiculously fat tabby with a TINKLING BELL ON HIS 
           COLLAR, mews his way up the stairs and into-- 

           INT. SHANNON HOUSE - CLARE’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Meticulously neat vintage flair.  A talent for design evident 
           in the carefully selected discount pieces.  A ceiling fan 
           whirls lazily.
           Wearing oversized dark clothing - her camouflage and armor -  
           CLARE SHANNON (17) stands at the window grimly watching her 
           father drive off.  

           The exuberant little daredevil she once was is a long 
           forgotten memory.  There’s a sadness to her now.  Deep and 
           enduring.  She’s tough but insecure.

           Content to disappear and happiest when no one notices her at 
           all.  The problem is that people ALWAYS notice.  

           Max nudges at her ankles.  She picks him up and sighs. 

           Welcome to fucking Monday.

           INT. SHANNON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           With a backpack thrown over her shoulder, Clare retrieves 
           several sprung RAT TRAPS along with their stiff, unlucky 
           occupants, as she heads to the door. 

           EXT. SHANNON HOUSE - DAY

           Disgusted, but used to it, Clare dumps the traps into a 
           garbage can and drags it to the curb.

           Next door, Mrs. De Luca waves through her kitchen window.  

                                 MRS. DE LUCA 
                        Smile, honey!  You’re young!

           With effort, Clare smiles and waves back.  But the moment she 
           turns, the smile fades.  She hella hates her life.

           EXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - DAY

           Beneath a cold, gray sky, Clare coasts downhill on her 
           hipster bike, the nicest thing she owns.

           EXT. RAILROAD CROSSING - DAY

           Clare waits behind a line of cars as a TRAIN thunders by.  As 
           soon as it passes, CAUTION LIGHTS go dim, the BOOM GATE 
           rises, and she crosses into the affluent part of town.

           EXT. UPSCALE NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

           Stately homes line the street.  Clare drinks each one in as 
           she passes, envious of the implied stability within.

           But she stops when she sees--

           HER FATHER’S TRUCK PARKED CURBSIDE. 
           Just beyond it, Louis diligently PICKS THROUGH VARIOUS 
           TRASHCANS and RECYCLE BINS.

           Embarrassed, Clare quickly scans the area -- the coast is 
           clear.  She might still have time to avert disaster.  

           She hurries over to him.

                                 CLARE
                        Dad!

           Louis glances up and grunts.  The tenderness between them has 
           vanished.  These days, she’s the parent and he’s the 
           recalcitrant teenager.

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        What’re you doing?

                                 LOUIS
                        What’s it look like?

           Out of the corner of her eye, Clare catches sight of a CAR 
           FILLED WITH TEENAGE POPULARS approaching.  She tenses and 
           tries to hurry things along.

                                 CLARE
                        Dad, come on.  It’s gonna rain.  
                        Look.

                                 LOUIS
                        But I got a good feeling.

                                 CLARE
                        The house is full of your good 
                        feelings and most of them smell 
                        terrible.

           Suddenly, THE CAR ACCELERATES with DARCIE CHAPMAN (17), 
           reigning queen bee hella bitch, at the wheel. 

           Her bestie, out and proud TYLER DUNLOP (17) hangs out the 
           shotgun window, brandishing a venti frap.  

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        Watch out!

           And Tyler THROWS THE FRAP.  Clare ducks but--

           KA-WHAP!  THE DRINK NAILS LOUIS RIGHT IN THE CHEST.  Iced 
           caramel SPLASHES ALL OVER HIS SHIRT and PANTS.

           Populars WHOOP and LAUGH.

                                 TYLER
                        Bulls-eye, bitches!

                                 CLARE
                           (after them)
                        Assholes!  Douchebag assholes!
           Seated in the backseat, PAUL MIDDLEBROOK (17) just shakes his 
           head and wraps an arm around his girlfriend, BETH.  

           He’s casually good looking.  Effortlessly smart.  The guy all 
           the clever girls crush on.  

           And Clare’s got it bad.  

           He, however, barely even knows she’s alive.

           Still cheering, the Populars drive off.  

           Clare turns back to Louis and tries to wipe the guck off his 
           clothing, but he pushes her away.

                                 LOUIS
                        I got it!

                                 CLARE
                        Dad--

                                 LOUIS
                        Don’t you have somewhere to be?  Go 
                        on.  Get outta here! 

           Frustrated, Clare rides off.  

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY

           Welcome to hell.  Teeming with TEENS.  Bubble-gum and 
           cellphones.  Pimples and laughter.  Texting and ‘tude.

           Clare carefully weaves her way through the crush of bodies, 
           trying not to make eye contact with anyone, but she still 
           catches sight of-- 

           STUDENTS GIGGLING and WHISPERING about her.  And worst of 
           all, a few sympathetic looks from TEACHERS.  

           Hanging her head, she joins her two best friends at their 
           lockers.  

           JUNE ACOSTA (17) is the sweetest of the three and a good 
           hundred pounds overweight.  

           MEREDITH MCNARIN (17) is the gutsy, flat chested pragmatic 
           one.  She’s brazen and unfiltered.  Thank you, ADHD.  

           June shows Clare her cellphone.  On it, is a short video of 
           Tyler NAILING LOUIS WITH HIS DRINK. 

                                 JUNE
                        Did you see this?  Darcie just sent 
                        it out to like, everyone.  

                                 MEREDITH
                        Clitwit.  

           The BELL RINGS.  
           Companionably, the girls link arms and head to class.

           EXT. HART ESTATE - DAY

           A recent fire has reduced this multi-million dollar mansion 
           to a burned out shell.  Only the barest hint of its former 
           grandeur remains.  

           And it’s also a crime scene.  

           POLICE LINE DO NOT CROSS TAPE snaps in the wind.  It’s eerie 
           here.  Grim.  Remnants of an unspeakable act hang heavy.  An 
           unspoken presence.  Ominous.  Sinister.

           Black clad and clearly trespassing, a YOUNG MAN picks his way 
           through the debris.  With a flashlight, he combs through the 
           water-drenched ruins, meticulously searching every charred 
           corner.

           Meet RYAN JOHNS (18).  Beneath his dark hoodie, he’s intense 
           and driven.  Humorless and haunted.  Hardened by tragedy and 
           singular purpose.

           HEADLIGHTS approach as Louis pulls up to the main gates.  

           Ryan ducks behind a crumbling pillar, grabs a METAL PIPE, and 
           holds it close.  Ready to use it if he has to. 

           EXT. HART ESTATE - OUTSIDE THE MAIN GATES - DAY

           A half dozen DUMPSTERS overflow with BLACKENED ODDS AND ENDS. 

           Whistling, Louis sifts through this Scrapper/Picker paradise.  

           A GLINT OF SILVER at the bottom catches his eye.  He reaches 
           in, digs deep, and discovers-- 

           A SMALL SILVER MUSIC BOX. 

           It’s filthy, but heavy.  Ornate.  Expensive.  He wipes off a 
           layer of soot revealing the inscription:

                                     WISH UPON

           He wonders over this.  Clearly, he’s found something 
           valuable.   Hot damn!

           He tucks The Box under his arm and hurries back to his truck 
           with the rest of his loot.  Ryan chases after him.

                                 RYAN
                        Hey!  Hey!

                                 LOUIS
                        Mind your business, pal!  Finders 
                        keepers!

           He hops into his truck and squeals off. 
           Pissed, Ryan watches him go.  

           HIS POV -- Louis’ LICENSE PLATE.  

           Ryan commits it to memory.  

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL - ART ROOM - DAY

           Filled with paint.  Brushes.  Welcome to the one place Clare 
           truly fits in.  The one place she feels comfortable.

           She busily sketches away while MIKE STANLEY (30s, hip, pony-
           tailed, adored by his students) nods approvingly at her 
           drawing.  

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL - MATH CLASS - DAY

           Clare sits in the back and tries not to stare at Paul who 
           chats with a FRIEND a few rows ahead of her.

           Frustrated for even daring to hope, she turns her attentions 
           back to her homework.

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - DAY

           Loud and crowded.  Clare, June, and Meredith search in vain 
           for a place to sit.  

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Hey, Clare!

           Clare turns to see Darcie sitting at a nearby table with her 
           minions -- Tyler, Paul, and Beth among them.  

                                 DARCIE
                        Saw your dad shopping this morning.  
                        Is that where you got that sweater?

                                 TYLER
                           (daps with Darcie)
                        Fi-yah!

                                 JUNE
                           (whispers to Clare)
                        So extra.

           Meredith jumps to Clare’s defense.

                                 MEREDITH
                           (to Darcie)
                        Did it take you all morning to come 
                        up with that, Proactive? 

                                 DARCIE
                        Why are you talking to me, 
                        Adderall?
                                 MEREDITH
                        Because I pity the less fortunate, 
                        Thalidomide.

           Darcie just rolls her eyes and turns back to her friends.

                                 DARCIE
                        I almost feel bad for them.  I 
                        mean, what’s it like being 
                        completely and totally irrelevant?

           Clare simmers.  Today’s the day.  The day when she’s had 
           friggin’ enough.  Done with the bullshit, she marches up to 
           Darcie.

                                 JUNE
                           (whispers)
                        Clare, don’t!

                                 MEREDITH
                        Do!  Drop her like a red-headed 
                        baby fresh out the v--

           June clamps her hand over Meredith’s mouth. 

                                 CLARE
                           (to Darcie)
                        In a few years, you’ll find out.

           Ooohs from the Populars.  

           The cafeteria goes dead silent.  

           Meredith and June are so thrilled they might just shit. 

                                 DARCIE
                        Find out what, winner?

                                 CLARE
                        What it’s like to be completely and 
                        totally irrelevant. 

           Darcie’s mouth works, but nothing comes out.  This is her 
           world and no one ever talks to her that way.  Ev. Ver.  She 
           rises.

                                 DARCIE
                        What?

                                 CLARE
                        Do you want me to spell it? 

           Darcie just blinks.  Still trying to understand this 
           unexpected insubordination.

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        I-N space--

           And KA-WHAP! Darcie SLAPS Clare.  Right across the face. 

           Without missing a beat--
           KA-WHAP! Clare slaps her right back.  

           And DARCIE CHARGES CLARE. 

           In the next instant, the two are PUNCHING and PULLING EACH 
           OTHER’S HAIR.  Students swarm. 

           Clare gives as good as she gets before TEACHERS finally pull 
           them apart.

           INT. DE LUCA HOUSE - KITCHEN - EVENING

           Cozy and comforting.  Pouting over milk and cookies, Clare 
           accepts an ice pack from Mrs. De Luca and places it on her 
           bruised cheek.  Mrs. De Luca just looks on sympathetically.

                                 MRS. DE LUCA
                        I wish I knew how to help you.  In 
                        my day, I think people were a 
                        little nicer to each other.  You 
                        always look like you’re going to 
                        war.

                                 CLARE 
                        Most of the time, that’s exactly 
                        what it feels like.

                                 MRS. DE LUCA
                        You know what you need?  

                                 CLARE
                        Don’t say it.

                                 MRS. DE LUCA
                        A nice boy. 

                                 CLARE
                        You said it.

                                 MRS. DE LUCA
                        There has to be at least one you 
                        like.

                                 CLARE
                        There isn’t.

                                 MRS. DE LUCA
                        Not even one?

                                 CLARE
                        No.

                                 MRS. DE LUCA
                        Is there a nice girl?

                                 CLARE
                        No!
                                 MRS. DE LUCA
                        That’s nothing to be ashamed of.  I 
                        think it’s wonderful.  Young people 
                        are so free these days.

                                 CLARE
                        There’s a boy... Sorta.

                                 MRS. DE LUCA
                        And?

                                 CLARE
                        I think he said hi to me once.

                                 MRS. DE LUCA
                        That’s something.

                                 CLARE
                        In the fifth grade.

           Mrs. De Luca lets that settle.

                                 MRS. DE LUCA
                        Maybe you could try to change up 
                        your look a little bit.

                                 CLARE
                        What’s wrong with my look?

                                 MRS. DE LUCA
                        Well...

           To be honest would be unkind, so--

                                 MRS. DE LUCA (CONT’D)
                        You know, I have all of these cute 
                        little dresses from when I was in 
                        my twenties.  They’re yours if you 
                        want them.  A dress and some color 
                        never hurt anyone.  They might even 
                        cheer you up.

           Doubtful.  Clare just sighs, the weight of the universe on 
           her narrow shoulders.

                                 MRS. DE LUCA (CONT’D)
                        Things really do get easier.  
                        You’ll grow up, get your own place, 
                        and these awkward years... It’ll be 
                        like they never happened.

           Off Clare, resigned, miserable, not buyin’ what she’s 
           sellin’...

           INT. SHANNON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - EVENING

           Louis snores on the cramped sofa.  Sitting on the end table, 
           is a PHOTOGRAPH OF THE SHANNON FAMILY before Jo’s suicide.  
           Clare glances at it as she sets out a fast food dinner for 
           her father, her longing’s palpable. 

                                 LOUIS
                           (rouses, grunts)
                        What’s that green stuff?

                                 CLARE
                        Salad, dad.  Eat it.  Or don’t.  
                        Who knows?  The scurv might be in 
                        next year.

                                 LOUIS
                        School called.

                                 CLARE
                        And?

                                 LOUIS
                        They said you got into a fight. 

                                 CLARE
                        So?

                                 LOUIS
                        Did you?

                                 CLARE
                        Maybe.  Are you mad?

                                 LOUIS
                        No.  Did you win?

                                 CLARE
                        Do I ever?

           Even Louis doesn’t have an answer for that.  After a moment, 
           he reaches out.  Makes a rare attempt to be fatherly.

                                 LOUIS
                        Got somethin’ for you.  Put it on 
                        your bed.

                                 CLARE
                        I thought we talked about this.  
                        Your space.  My space--

                                 LOUIS
                           (bristles)
                        If you don’t like it, give it back.  
                        I got it at a nice place.  Just 
                        tryin’ to do somethin’ nice is all.  
                        Consider it an early birthday 
                        present.

           With a sigh, Clare heads upstairs.
           INT. SHANNON HOUSE - CLARE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Clare enters to find THE MUSIC BOX sitting on her 
           immaculately made bed. 

           She grimaces at it.  She doesn’t like junk.  Or dirty things.  
           Especially not in her sanctuary.  Aggravated, she picks it up 
           and brushes off the soot.  

           An INSCRIPTION on the lid catches her attention.

                                 CLARE
                            ‘Lay thy hands upon me. 
                            Close thy eyes and wish. 
                         Seven wishes will I grant thee, 
                            If thou remembers this. 

                             Keep me in the darkness
                             Hide me from the sun. 
                           Abandon, lose, or open me,
                            And all will be undone.’

           She shakes The Box.  Nothing can be heard within.

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        Yeah, right.

           Over it, she tosses The Box aside.  In the next moment--

           Her CELLPHONE BLIPS.  INCOMING TEXT FROM MEREDITH. 

           Meredith: U ok?

           Clare:  :)

           Meredith: Chk Darcie’s INSTGRM.  BTCH MAJ!

           Frowning, Clare goes over to her computer and CLICKS over to 
           DARCIE’S INSTAGRAM PAGE.

           INSERT - COMPUTER

           FOOTAGE OF CLARE AND DARCIE’S FIGHT plays on a GIF loop.

           BACK TO SCENE

           Defeated, Clare sighs and wanders into the bathroom.  A hot 
           bath looms.

           (LATER)

           Wrapped in a bathrobe, Clare emerges from the bathroom and 
           THUMP!  She stubs her toe.

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        Ow!

           She looks down to see what she stubbed it on and--

           It’s THE MUSIC BOX.
           That’s odd.  She could’ve sworn she left it on her bed.

           Or maybe she didn’t.

           Whatever.  With her foot, she shoves it beneath the dust 
           ruffle.

           NIGHT

           Dressed for bed, Clare paces as she brushes her teeth, but 
           her gaze is constantly drawn back to--

           THE BOX

           Sitting primly beneath the bed.  It’s oddly seductive.  
           Beckoning.  She can’t take her eyes off of it.

           (LATER)

           Clare sits at her computer, absently clicking through 
           websites.  Then she notices--

           THE BOX

           Reflected in the screen.  Her gaze locks onto it.  She 
           regards it for a long, long time, then--

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        Why not?

           She retrieves The Box and turns it over, wondering over its 
           intricate inlay.

           Then she sets it down, tentatively places both hands atop it, 
           and closes her eyes.

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        I wish... I wish Darcie Chapman 
                        would just leave me the hell alone.  

           She rolls her eyes - God, she can’t even believe she did that 
           - and shoves The Box underneath the bed.

           Then she lays back.  A moment of reflection.  Rough day.  Her 
           breath hitches, but she refuses to let any tears fall.

           EXT. SHANNON HOUSE - THAT NIGHT

           Darkness.  A bright moon overhead. 

           INT. SHANNON HOUSE - CLARE’S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

           Clare sleeps deeply.  All is eerily silent except for a 
           steady DRIP... DRIP... DRIP... coming from her bathroom sink.

           Beneath her bed, THE MUSIC BOX just sits.  Unremarkable.  
           Deceptively innocuous.  But then--
           A SPIDER CREEPS IN FROM A CRACK IN THE WINDOW.

           A CENTIPEDE SCURRIES OUT OF A HOLE IN THE FLOORBOARDS.

           COCKROACHES SKITTER IN FROM UNDERNEATH THE DOOR.

           TOGETHER, THIS PARADE OF LOW CREATURES CONVERGES ON THE BOX.  
           Inexplicably drawn to it.  Servants of something sinister.  

           But an exhausted Clare doesn’t notice.  She just sleeps on.

           EXT. SHANNON HOUSE - MORNING

           A perfect sunrise on the horizon.  

           INT. SHANNON HOUSE - CLARE’S BEDROOM - MORNING

           CLARE’S ALARM SPARKS TO LIFE.  It’s 6:00am.  Clare’s eyes 
           open, but she doesn’t move.  Sooo not looking forward to 
           starting her day.   

           INT. RYAN’S CAR (PARKED) - DAY

           Inconspicuously parked around the corner from the Shannon 
           house.  Ryan sits behind the wheel, gaze locked on the home.

           HIS POV -- Downcast as always, Clare hops onto her bike and 
           rides off.  He curiously watches her go.

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY

           Dreading the ridicule that’s sure to come, Clare enters 
           apprehensively and looks around.  

           For a moment, she’s confused.  

           Then perplexed.

           Then positively fucking FLUMMOXED. 

           Students huddle in groups.  Gossiping and texting, everyone’s 
           distracted.  No one seems to notice Clare at all.  It’s like 
           yesterday’s fight never happened.

           Bewildered, Clare joins June and Meredith at their lockers.  

                                 CLARE
                        What’s going on?

                                 JUNE
                        You haven’t heard?

                                 CLARE
                        Heard what?

                        known as Darcie Chapman, got 
                        pinched last night.

                                 CLARE
                        For what?

           Meredith holds up her cellphone and the three girls grin.

           CLICK.

           INT. SHANNON HOUSE - CLARE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           MATCH CUT TO -- THE SELIFE on MEREDITH’S INSTAGRAM PAGE.

           Clad in cute pjs, Clare sits at her desk, grinning at it. 

           Then she TYPES INTO THE COMMENTS SECTION.  #bestdayever!

           After a thought, she CLICKS OVER TO PAUL’S INSTAGRAM ACCOUNT.  

           She scrolls through PHOTOS OF PAUL WITH BETH and studies 
           them.  In every single one, they look young, happy, in love.

           She then goes to her bed, pulls The Box out from underneath, 
           and regards it curiously.  She’s not a believer yet, but--

                                 CLARE
                        You def have my attention, lucky 
                        box. 
           She notices INITIALS carved onto the side.  AG.  

           Interesting.  

           She considers flipping open the latch, but-- 

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        Not gonna jinx it.

           Instead, she neatly sets The Box down in front of her, places 
           both hands atop it, and closes her eyes.

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        My second wish is that Paul 
                        Middlebrook would fall madly in 
                        love with me.

           Once again, a roll of the eyes.  An embarrassed smile.  

           But hey, you can’t blame a girl for trying.  

           She shoves The Box back under the bed.  A dust ruffle hides 
           it from sight.

           (LATE NIGHT)

           The witching hour.  Clare sleeps.  Lost in a perfect dream.

           WE PULL DOWN beneath the bed and, after a moment--

           THE MUSIC BOX OPENS!

           A soft, haunting MELODY begins to play.

           MEOWRRRR! Alarmed, Max HISSES, leaps off the bed, and books 
           it out of the room in a hurry. 

           A moment passes.  Outside, AN AGONIZED FELINE YOWL can be 
           heard and--

           Clare wakes abruptly.  She sits up.  

           CLICK. The Box closes and goes silent.  

           She looks around, uncertain of what woke her.  She notices 
           the empty depression in the bed where Max slept.

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        Max?!

           No answer.  

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        Stupid cat.

           Unconcerned, she rolls over and drops back off to sleep 
           almost instantly.
           INT. SHANNON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NEXT MORNING

           Clare picks her way down the stairs.  Louis munches on 
           breakfast in front of the tv. 

                                 CLARE
                        Max?  Max, where are you?!

           But there’s no answer.  No Max.

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        Dad, have you seen Max?

                                 LOUIS
                        I never see Max.  He’s always in 
                        your room.

                                 CLARE
                        Well, I can’t find him.

                                 LOUIS
                           (unconcerned)
                        He’s probably sowin’ his wild oats.

                                 CLARE
                        He’s neutered.  No oats to sow.

                                 LOUIS
                        Can’t blame a guy for tryin’. 

                                 CLARE
                        Or the ladies for being 
                        disappointed.

           She snags a sprung rat trap and ducks out.

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL - ART ROOM - DAY

           CLOSE ON -- CLARE’S SKETCHBOOK.  Beneath Clare’s steady hand,  *
           The Box takes form.  A masterful study in charcoal lines and 
           shadows.

                                 MR. STANLEY
                        All right, class.  Listen up!  
                        Listen up!

           Clare looks up to see Mr. Stanley and Ryan standing at the 
           front of the room.

                                 MR. STANLEY (CONT’D)
                        This is Ryan Johns.  He just 
                        transferred in from Westridge.  I’m 
                        sure you’ll all make him feel 
                        welcome.  But for those of you who 
                        plan on making his life hell, 
                        please do so outside of my 
                        classroom.  Thank you.
                           (to Ryan)
                        Have a seat.
           Ryan sits and tries to make eye contact with Clare, but she 
           returns to her sketchbook.    

           EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - DAY

           Clare, June, and Meredith pick at their lunches.  Both Clare 
           and Meredith study the table full of Populars.  These days, 
           Tyler holds court, laughing at the center of the group.

           Clare’s gaze lingers on Paul and Beth.  At first, neither 
           seems to notice her, but then--

           PAUL LOOKS HER WAY AND WINKS.

           Say.  WHAT?!

           Clare’s so stunned, she snorts coke through her nose.  

                                 MEREDITH
                        That was special.  

                                 JUNE
                           (re: Ryan)
                        Hey, Clare.  You know that guy?

                                 CLARE
                        What guy?

           Clare looks over to see--

           RYAN 

           SITTING IN A CORNER BY HIMSELF and staring unabashedly at 
           her.  It’s intense.  Unnerving. 

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        He’s in my art class.  Transfer.

                                 JUNE
                        Why’s he staring at you like he 
                        wants to Amber Alert you?

                                 MEREDITH
                        He could Amber Alert me any day of 
                        the week.  And twice on Sunday. 

                                 CLARE
                        Shhh! 

                                 JUNE
                           (to Meredith)
                        I swear, the dramz and your mouth 
                        have an unholy union.  Like Peanut 
                        Butter and Ketchup.

                                 CLARE
                        Or barbecued snot.  Truth.
                                 MEREDITH
                           (cheerfully undeterred)
                        He’s, like, no-carbs-for-life hot.  
                        Like have-his-triplets-without-an-
                        epidural hot.  Like wax-my-crack-
                        right-now hot.

                                 JUNE
                        I think he looks like he steals. 

                                 MEREDITH
                           (scoffs)
                        Like that’s a bad thing.

           Clare just shakes her head and surreptitiously turns her 
           attentions back to Paul and Beth.

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY

           Clare SLAMS HER LOCKER CLOSED and--

                                 PAUL
                        S’up?

           Paul stands on the other side.  

           Startled, Clare yelps and DROPS HER BOOKS. 

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        My bad.  Sorry.

           He’s quick to help her pick them up.  Clare, however, is 
           struck stupid.  

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        Clare, right?

                                 CLARE
                        Yeah... Erghm.

           Wow.  That wasn’t even English.

           But Paul doesn’t seem to notice that her IQ is plummeting by 
           the second.

                                 PAUL
                        I’m Paul.

                                 CLARE
                        Right.  I know.  We have History 
                        together.

                                 PAUL
                           (genuinely surprised)
                        Yeah?

                                 CLARE
                        And Pre-Cal.  And English.  I uh... 
                        I sit right behind you.
                                 PAUL
                        You on your way to class?

                                 CLARE
                        I... No.

                                 PAUL
                        You what?

                                 CLARE
                        I... Yes.

           Oh, dear Christ.

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        I mean I’m on my way to the 
                        library.  In school suspension.

                                 PAUL
                        Right.  Cuz you went straight beast 
                        mode on Darcie Chapman.  

                                 CLARE
                        Well, she started it.

                                 PAUL
                        And you finished it.

                                 CLARE
                        I did?

                                 PAUL
                        Yeah.  Go you, Tyson.  And between 
                        the two of us, she’s had something 
                        like that coming for years.  Can I 
                        walk with you?

           She tries not to blush.  Ermagawd!

                                 CLARE
                        Sure.

           The ONE MINUTE BELL RINGS.

                        Let’s bounce.

           He casually throws an arm around her as they head to the 
           library.  As they go, Clare passes Meredith and June whose 
           mouths drop.  

           Ermagawd!

           Clare doesn’t see Ryan watching her from a short distance 
           away.  She’s much too happy.  Grinning like an idiot on cloud 
           frigging nine. 
           EXT. SHANNON HOUSE - BACKYARD - THAT EVENING

           Clare’s glow from earlier has faded.  Concerned, she picks 
           her way through the overgrowth. 

                                 CLARE
                        Max?!  MAX!

           And then she sees--

           MAX’S COLLAR on the ground by the porch.  Blood stains the 
           BELL.  

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        Max?!

           Clare pulls her cellphone and shines the light through the 
           lattice work.  A black chasm gapes.  

           Steeling herself, she drops to her knees.  Squeezes through.

           INT. BENEATH THE SHANNON HOUSE - EVENING

           Guided by the light of her cellphone, Clare creeps through 
           garbage and mulch a foot deep. 

                                 CLARE
                        Max?!

           SKITTERING behind her.  She WHIRLS.  

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        Max?

           But it’s not Max.  It’s RATS.  

           Ugh.  

           She shudders and presses on.  But then her gaze falls onto--

           A SMEAR OF REDNESS on the leaves.  

           Dreading what she’s going to find, she creeps toward it.

           MORE BLOOD SURROUNDS HER.  

           And just ahead of her, is a HUMP.  

           A still, unmoving hump.

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                           (whispers)
                        Max?

           Her CELLPHONE LIGHT SETTLES ON THE HUMP.  

           She takes one look and SCREAMS.
           EXT. SHANNON HOUSE - BACKYARD - NIGHT

           CHUCK.  CHUCK.  CHUCK.  A lonely shovel strikes dirt.  

           PULL BACK TO REVEAL -- Louis digging a small grave.  

           A stoic Clare lingers nearby.  At her feet is a SHOE BOX 
           containing Max’s remains.  

                                 LOUIS
                        That should do it, I guess.

           Clare gently places the shoebox into the hole.  A moment, 
           then--

                                 LOUIS (CONT’D)
                        Should we say something?

                                 CLARE
                        No.

           Resigned, he begins to refill the hole.

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        What do you think happened to him?

                                 LOUIS
                        Rats probably. 

           Clare’s lower lip trembles, but she bites back her tears.

           This big girl don’t cry.

           INT. SHANNON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Louis dozes while Clare looks around the room.  

           It’s gross in here.  Oppressive.  Miserable.  

           Aggravated, she grabs some CURTAIN RODS and drags them 
           outside.  Intent on throwing a few things away. 

           EXT. SHANNON HOUSE - NIGHT

           Clare sets the rods out by the fence.

                                 LOUIS (O.S.)
                        Hey!  What the hell you doin’?! 

           Clare turns to see her father glaring at her from the porch.

                                 CLARE
                        Clearing some space.

                                 LOUIS
                        Bring ‘em back in.  
                                 CLARE
                        No.

                                 LOUIS
                        I’m gonna use those.

                                 CLARE
                        For what?

           Louis marches out to the fence.

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        Dad, seriously?  You can’t throw 
                        anything away?  Not even for me?

           He grabs the rods and carries them back into the house.

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        What would mom say?
                           (still no answer)
                        Dad!  DAD?!

           Louis slams the door behind him leaving Clare fuming where 
           she stands.  This isn’t the first time they’ve had this 
           argument.  Probably won’t be the last.  

           BUT THEN AN IDEA SPARKS and she hurries back inside. 

           INT. SHANNON HOUSE - CLARE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Clare yanks The Music Box out from underneath the bed.  She 
           still doesn’t really believe, but--

                                 CLARE
                        Why not?

           She places her hands on The Box and closes her eyes.

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        Come on, lucky box.  For my third 
                        wish, I wish...

           And we FADE TO...

           INT. SHANNON HOUSE - CLARE’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Sleeping comfortably, Clare rouses.  For a moment, she just 
           listens, uncertain of what woke her. 

           But then she hears activity - HONKING and VOICES outside.  

           She rolls over and peers down into the front yard.  Her 
           breath catches and she races out.  
           INT. SHANNON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Clare throws open the front door and GAPES at the GARAGE SALE 
           IN PROGRESS.  PILES OF JUNK glut the lawn and dozens of 
           SHOPPERS claim items and pay up.

           Reinvigorated and damn near cheerful, Louis catcalls at a 
           makeshift register.

                                 LOUIS
                        Make me an offer!  Everything must 
                        go!  Everything must go!  No 
                        offer’s too low!  Don’t be shy!

           He catches sight of Clare, still in her pajamas, staring at 
           him.  Floored.

                                 LOUIS (CONT’D)
                        Clare!  Put some clothes on, girl!  
                        I need help out here!

           Biting back a wave of emotion, Clare nods.

                                 CLARE
                        Just a second!

           She closes the door and slumps against it.  Overwhelmed.  
           There’s no doubt about it, HER WISH JUST CAME TRUE.  She runs 
           back upstairs.

           INT. SHANNON HOUSE - CLARE’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Reverently and a little awestruck, Clare picks up The Music 
           Box and wonders over it, studying it intently. 

                                 CLARE
                           (whispers)
                        How is this possible? 

           Suddenly, a SPIDER CRAWLS OVER HER FINGERS. 

           Clare stifles a SCREAM and DROPS THE BOX. 

           It falls onto its side and IMMEDIATELY RIGHTS ITSELF with a 
           resounding THUMP!  

           Then it just sits there.  

           Silent.  

           Waiting.

           Holy.  Friggin’.  Shitballs.

           Frozen and freaked out, Clare doesn’t move. 

           SOMETHING SUPERNATURAL IS CLEARLY AT WORK HERE.
                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                           (whispers)
                        What just happened?

           She crouches down in front of The Box.  

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        What are you?

           But there’s no movement.  No answer.

           Clare regards The Box for a long moment.  Her fingertips 
           flutter towards the LATCH AND SHE SLOWLY BEGINS TO OPEN IT-- 

                                 LOUIS (O.S.)
                        CLARE!

           Startled, her hand falls away and she looks out the window. 
           Louis waves up at her. 

                                 LOUIS (CONT’D)
                        Hurry up!  We got money to make! 
                        Get down here, kiddo!

                                 CLARE
                        Coming!

           She returns to The Box and her gaze falls onto its 
           inscription.

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        Abandon, lose or open me and all 
                        will be undone.

           No way.  She can’t do that.  Not yet.  

           Instead, she shoves The Box back underneath her bed and 
           begins to get dressed. 

           EXT. SHANNON HOUSE - DAY

           Welcome to the Garage Sale of the Century!  

           Clare stands in front of a plastic tub accepting wads of cash 
           as Louis’ clutter dwindles by the second.

           She sells her old BABY DOLL to a WOMAN and her DAUGHTER.  

           A moment later, Mrs. De Luca presents her with a few KNICK-
           KNACKS.

                                 CLARE
                        Your money’s no good here.  Take 
                        whatever you want.  Better yet, 
                        take two.  Or ten.

                                 MRS. DE LUCA
                        So happy for you, sweetheart.  This 
                        is long overdue.  
           She and Clare share a laugh.  

           In the b.g., Ryan moves through the crowd, picking through 
           the junk, and STUDYING LOUIS AND CLARE out of the corner of 
           his eye.  

           Sensing this, Clare glances in his direction, but a BOY (9) 
           shoves a ratty SAXOPHONE CASE into her face.  

                                 BOY
                        How much?

                                 CLARE
                        How about five--

                                 LOUIS (O.S.)
                        Wait!

           Louis rushes over and grabs the case. 

                                 LOUIS (CONT’D)
                        Sorry, son.  This is the one thing.  
                        The one thing that’s not for sale. 

           Disappointed, the Boy sulks off and Louis hides the case 
           under the table.

                                 LOUIS (CONT’D)
                           (to Clare)
                        Don’t let anyone touch it, ‘kay?

                                 CLARE
                        But you haven’t played in since mom-

                                 LOUIS
                        Never say never. 

           He looks around.  Almost as thrilled as she is.

                                 LOUIS (CONT’D)
                        Well?  Whaddaya think?

                                 CLARE
                        I think this is incredible.  

                                 LOUIS
                        High five.

                                 CLARE
                        Dad, no.  No one does that anymore.  
                        It’s like reading a book or 
                        something.

                                 LOUIS
                        What?  Don’t leave me hang--

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Excuse me?
           They turn to see a WOMAN (early 30s) holding an OLD PAINTING. 
           This is KATE, an artsy, easy beauty, and Louis is smitten on 
           sight.

                                 LOUIS
                        Hi.  Can I help you?

           Newly animated, he moves away.  Clare watches him go.  

           Totes adorbs.

           INT. SHANNON HOME - LIVING ROOM - EVENING

           Blessedly, beautifully empty.  THE JUNK IS GONE. 

           Clare cradles a tub of money on the couch.  Louis cradles his 
           sax case.  Both just look around.  Neither can believe the 
           home’s transformation.  It’s startling.  Emotional.

                                 LOUIS
                        Well?

                                 CLARE
                        It even smells different.  You did 
                        good.

                                 LOUIS
                        How good?

                                 CLARE
                        Like two thousand three hundred and 
                        sixty two dollars good. 

                                 LOUIS
                        What should we buy first?

                                 CLARE
                        Exterminator.

                                 LOUIS
                        I was thinking  pizza.

           A moment.  Then--

                                 CLARE
                        That lady seemed nice.  

                                 LOUIS
                        What lady?

                                 CLARE
                        Dad, come on.  Did you get her 
                        name?

                                 LOUIS
                        Katherine Stern.
                                 CLARE
                        You get her number?
                           (off his look)
                        Why not?

                                 LOUIS
                           (shrugs, embarrassed)
                        It’s been a long time.  I never was 
                        very good at that kind of stuff. 

                                 CLARE
                        Next time.

                                 LOUIS
                        Yeah.  
                           (beat)
                        Oh, while I was cleaning, I found 
                        something that I thought you might 
                        like.  It’s upstairs. 
                           (off her dubious look)
                        Your space.  My space.  I know. 
                        Just trust me.

           Off his wink--

           INT. SHANNON HOUSE - CLARE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Clare enters and gasps when she sees A PILE OF HER MOTHER’S 
           DRAWINGS sitting on her bed.

           Breathless, she takes a seat and touches them with trembling 
           fingertips.  Here’s a window into the soul of a woman she 
           never really got a chance to know. 

           She drinks each one in.  Some are dark and violent.  But 
           others are bright.  Colorful.  Happy.

           Louis appears in the doorway. 

                                 CLARE
                           (hard to talk)
                        I forgot... I forgot how good mom 
                        was.  

                                 LOUIS
                        That was her thing.  Went to school 
                        for it and everything.  Anyway, I 
                        put them away awhile back cause I 
                        thought you might want them.  Then 
                        I forgot where I put them.  It’s a 
                        miracle the mice didn’t crap all 
                        over them.

                                 CLARE
                        They’re all so... happy.

                                 LOUIS
                        And so was she. 
                           (a touch of sorrow)
                        Until she wasn’t.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 LOUIS (CONT'D)
                           (pause)
                        Anyway, I’ll leave you to it. 

           Louis departs and Clare sorts through a few more sketches.  

           She lands on a heartwrenchingly sweet WATERCOLOR OF A YOUNG 
           CLARE in her father’s arms.  

           And then it begins.

           SAXOPHONE MUSIC.  

           Tremulous jazz drifts up from downstairs.  Its been more than 
           a decade since Louis has played and his technique is rusty, 
           but the passion’s still there.  That raw talent.  The soul.

           Bit by bit, Louis finds his long lost groove. 

           And Clare begins to cry happy/sad tears.  But mostly happy. 
           Years of misery suddenly lifted off her narrow shoulders.  

           We’re watching the rebirth of Clare Shannon. 

           A girl who is beginning to realize fates can change.  That 
           miracles do happen.  And it’s all thanks to--

           THE MUSIC BOX

           She pulls it out and holds it close.  Rocking it.  Resting 
           her cheek against it.

                                 CLARE
                           (whispers)
                        I believe.

           HER ALLEGIANCE TO THE BOX IS SEALED.

           EXT. RYAN’S HOUSE - NIGHT (ESTABLISHING)

           A modest little place set far back from the road.

           INT. RYAN’S HOUSE - BASEMENT APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Dark.  Neat.  Furnished with only the basics. 

           WE PAN OVER -- A SERIES OF GRUESOME PHOTOGRAPHS AND NEWSPAPER 
           ARTICLES THUMB-TACKED TO THE WALL.  

           All of them feature the victims of FREAK ACCIDENTS, 
           SPONTANEOUS AILMENTS, and VIOLENT DEATHS.

           Grim-faced, Ryan studies this terrifying chronicle.  

           It’s his waking nightmare.  His obsession.  

           He tacks a PHOTOGRAPH OF LOUIS AND CLARE to the end.  
           Clearly, in this accursed, unholy sequence of events-- 
           THEY’RE NEXT.

           EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - DAY

           Clare coasts downhill.  Roses blossom in her cheeks.  She 
           looks happy.  Free.

           Our little daredevil is back. 

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY

           A glowing Clare joins June and Meredith at their lockers. 

           Meredith scrutinizes her.

                                 MEREDITH
                        You look different.  What’s up?

                                 CLARE
                        Nothing’s up.

                                 MEREDITH
                        Something’s up.

                                 CLARE
                           (to June)
                        What’s she talking about?

                                 JUNE
                        You look happy.  You’re never 
                        happy.

                                 CLARE
                        Yes, I am. 

                                 JUNE
                        Nope.  Never.

                                 MEREDITH
                        Maybe once.  Like at my birthday 
                        party in the second grade.  But not 
                        since then. 
                           (a mischievous whisper)
                        Did someone peep your precious?

                                 CLARE
                        What?  No!

                                 MEREDITH
                        Who was it?

                                 CLARE
                        No one!

                                 MEREDITH
                        More than one?
                                 CLARE
                        Ew!

                                 MEREDITH
                        You let someone all up in your 
                        naughty business!  Who buttered 
                        your biscuit?  Tell!

                                 CLARE
                        Just stop, okay?  Moment of 
                        silence, please!

                                 MEREDITH
                        For what?

                                 CLARE
                        My brain, cuz you just killed it.

                                 MEREDITH
                        You’re welcome.

                                 JUNE
                        Well, something happened, Clare.  
                        We’re your friends.  You can tell 
                        us anything.  Well, you can tell me
                        anything. 

           Clare hesitates.  Should she tell them?  She considers this, 
           but--

           THE BELL RINGS.

                                 CLARE
                        You wouldn’t believe me if I told 
                        you.

           Nope.  Today’s not the day.  

           Meredith slams her locker and they book it to class.

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL - ART ROOM - DAY

           Impressed, Mr. Stanley studies Clare’s sketch of The Box.

                                 MR. STANLEY
                        Very nice.  What’s this?

                                 CLARE
                        Just something my dad got me.

           He leans closer to study it.  INTERCUT WITH...

           INT. SHANNON HOUSE - CLARE’S BEDROOM - DAY

           BENEATH CLARE’S BED -- THE BOX OPENS.  

           HAUNTING MUSIC begins to play.
           INT. HIGH SCHOOL - ART ROOM - DAY

           CLOSE ON -- CLARE’S SKETCH.  

           Suddenly, BLOOD DROPLETS SPLATTER THE PAPER.

                                 CLARE
                           (alarmed)
                        Mr.  Stanley?  You okay?

           Mr. Stanley staggers.  His NOSE HAS BEGUN TO BLEED, NO GUSH, 
           from both nostrils.  He tries to speak and can’t.

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        Mr. Stanley!

           He TOPPLES OVER and HITS THE GROUND.

           HIS FEET DRUM.

           HIS MOUTH FOAMS.

           Students gather and gasp.

           Ryan races over and turns Mr. Stanley onto his side.

                                 RYAN
                        Someone call 911!

           Horror-struck, Clare backs away.  

           INT. SHANNON HOUSE - CLARE’S BEDROOM - DAY

           THE MUSIC BOX closes and slips into silence.  

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY

           Clare watches EMTs wheel Mr. Stanley down the hallway.  
           Judging by the grim expressions on their faces, it doesn’t 
           look good.

           An arm wraps around Clare’s shoulders.  She turns to see--

           PAUL

           Just offering comfort. 

           Something real and sweet blossoming between them.

           INT. SHANNON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Clare enters to find Louis practicing and he sounds pretty 
           damn fantastic.  He PLAYS THAT JAUNTY LITTLE TUNE in 
           greeting, but she doesn’t smile.
                                 LOUIS
                        You all right, kiddo?

                                 CLARE
                        Yeah, just... Mr. Stanley had a 
                        stroke today.  Like, maj.  Right in 
                        the middle of class.

                                 LOUIS
                        I heard.  He okay?

                                 CLARE
                        I don’t know.  It looked really 
                        bad.

           She shrugs off her unease.

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        You sound amazing.

                                 LOUIS
                        Too bad I only have an audience of 
                        one, hunh?

           Clare considers this.  

           Yeah, it is too bad. 

           She pulls out her sketchbook and flips through it as Louis 
           resumes practicing.  She lands on--

           HER DRAWING OF THE MUSIC BOX now streaked with Mr. Stanley’s 
           blood.

           She shudders and turns the page.

                                 CLARE
                           (after a thought)
                        Hey, dad.  That Box you got me.

                                 LOUIS
                        What about it?

                                 CLARE
                        Where’d you get it?

                                 LOUIS
                        Found it.  Picked it up in a 
                        dumpster outside this fancy place 
                        up on Old Mill Road.  Why?

                                 CLARE
                        No reason.  Just curious.

           And she trots upstairs.  She’s got some wishing to do. 
           INT. SHANNON HOUSE - CLARE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Clare yanks out the Music Box out from underneath her bed,  
           places both hands atop of it, and closes her eyes. 

                                 CLARE
                        My fourth wish is...

           EXT. OLD MILL ROAD - NEXT DAY 

           A winding, tree-line private road. 

           Clare pedals up towards the remains of the Hart estate.

           EXT. HART ESTATE - DAY

           Clare surveys the area.  The dumpsters are gone and the 
           debris cleared away.  No clues to be found.  

           Disappointed, she turns to go and--

                                 VOICE
                        S’up?

           She gasps in surprise when she sees Ryan leaning against his 
           car behind her.

                                 CLARE
                           (uncertain)
                        Um... Hi?

                                 RYAN
                        I’m in your art class.  You want to 
                        know what happened here?

                                 CLARE
                        I... Wait, did you follow me up 
                        here?

                                 RYAN
                        The owner of this house was a man 
                        named Lawrence Hart.  For most of 
                        his life, he was an underemployed 
                        alcoholic.  And then, one day, 
                        everything changed.  He won the 
                        lotto, married a beautiful woman, 
                        started a successful company, and 
                        had a baby girl. Out of nowhere, 
                        this nobody became a somebody. 

                                 CLARE
                           (off-balanced)
                        Okay.  And I should care 
                        because...?

                                 RYAN
                        One by one, people around him -- 
                        friends, family, people he cared 
                        about -- started dying.

                                 RYAN (CONT'D)
                        Freak accidents mostly.  A falling 
                        pane of glass decapitated his wife.  
                        His daughter choked on a-- 

                                 CLARE
                        What’s wrong with you?  Why are you 
                        telling me this?

                                 RYAN
                        Because Mr. Hart owned the same 
                        silver Music Box your father stole 
                        from here a week ago.

           Clare’s mouth goes dry.  Her next words are a whisper.

                                 CLARE
                        How do you know that?  

                                 RYAN
                        Because I saw him do it.  He stole 
                        something he can’t control.  He’s 
                        in danger.  And so are you.  

                                 CLARE
                        I don’t... I don’t know what you’re 
                        talking about.

           Freaked out, she hops onto her bike and pedals off.

                                 RYAN
                        I’m just trying to help!  Clare, 
                        wait!  CLARE!

           But Clare doesn’t turn.  She just keeps pedalling.

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL - LIBRARY - DAY

           Clare flops down in front of one of the computers and pulls 
           up a GOOGLE SEARCH.  She types in. 

           “HART OLD MILL ROAD’  

           And presses ENTER.  

           THOUSANDS OF RESULTS POP UP.  

           Clare clicks on a PHOTOGRAPH OF LAWRENCE HART (late 40s).  A 
           soft, sweet looking man.  Warm smile.  Kind.

           But in the background, on a low shelf, SITS THE MUSIC BOX.
           Clare doubletakes when she sees it.  

           There’s absolutely no doubt.  It’s HER BOX.  

           Clare has no idea what to make of this.

           Noise behind her.  She turns to see--

           RYAN WATCHING HER from the other side of the room. 
           Uncomfortably, Clare grabs her things and hustles out.

           INT. SHANNON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Clare keys in.

                                 LOUIS (O.S.)
                        Clare!  Up here!  Come quick, I 
                        need your help!

           Clare hurries upstairs.

           INT. SHANNON HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - DAY

           Clare enters to find Louis wearing wrinkled slacks and a 
           ratty old undershirt.  In a state of borderline panic. 

                                 CLARE
                        What’s going on?

           He points to the bed.  Laid out on it are dress shirts and 
           ties that haven’t seen the light of day in a decade.  They’re 
           wrinkled.  Frayed.  Moth-eaten.  Pathetic.

           And Louis knows it.  

           But when Clare sees this, she relaxes knowingly.  Everything 
           is going according to plan... 

           Er, wish.

           Louis holds a tie up against a few shirts. 

                                 LOUIS
                        This one or that one?

                                 CLARE
                        Neither one.  I’ll help you find 
                        something.  You want to tell me 
                        what’s going on?

                                 LOUIS
                        You’re never gonna believe this.

                                 CLARE
                        Try me.

           He goes into the bathroom and begins to shave.  Clare moves 
           over to the closet and rifles through a dismal selection of 
           clothes.

                                 LOUIS
                        You remember Marty?

                                 CLARE
                        No.
                                 LOUIS 
                        Course not.  You wouldn’t.  You 
                        were just a kid the last time you 
                        saw him and your mother couldn’t 
                        stand him.  I used to jam with 
                        Marty back in the day.  Marty.  
                        Karl.  Jazz Man Pete.  An hour ago, 
                        outta the blue, guess who called?

                                 CLARE
                        Marty who I don’t remember?

                                 LOUIS 
                        Marty who you don’t remember says 
                        he’s in town.  Got a gig at this 
                        reception downtown, but get this. 
                        His sax girl, Brenda something or 
                        other, is a no show so he asks me 
                        if I would be available?  I mean, 
                        the timing. It’s unbelievable.  
                        It’s been more than ten years.  I 
                        told him I was rusty, but--

                                 CLARE
                        You’ll be great.  Can I come?

                                 LOUIS 
                        Are you kiddin’?  You gotta come.  
                        Invite friends if you want. 

           And then Clare sees it.  AN OLD DRY CLEANING BAG tucked deep 
           within the closet depths.  She pulls it out, rips away the 
           plastic, and ta da!  SHIRTS untouched by time or critters.

                                 CLARE
                        Found it!

           A moment later, Louis emerges from the bathroom, freshly 
           shaved.  Hair combed.  He not only looks human, but handsome.  

           Clare doubletakes. 

                                 LOUIS
                        What do you think?

                                 CLARE
                           (means it)
                        You look really nice. 

           She hands him a shirt and tie. 

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        Wear these.  

                                 LOUIS
                        Well, hurry up.  Get dressed.

                                 CLARE
                        I don’t have anything to wear.

           But then she reconsiders.  Hmmm.  Maybe she does.
           INT. DE LUCA HOUSE - BEDROOM - EVENING

           Mrs. De Luca stands back to admire her work. 

                                 MRS. DE LUCA
                        Look at you!

           PULL BACK TO REVEAL -- CLARE.  Transformed and gorgeous.  Her 
           oversized flannel and jeans have been replaced by a short, 
           sassy vintage dress.  

                                 MRS. DE LUCA (CONT’D)
                        Well?  Say something.  What do you 
                        think?

                                 CLARE
                        I look... Good?

                                 MRS. DE LUCA
                        You look like a million bucks!  
                        Give it a twirl!  Work it, sister! 

           Embarrassed, Clare spins.  The skirt flares. 

                                 MRS. DE LUCA (CONT’D)
                        See?  A cute dress.  A little 
                        color.  Was I right or was I right? 

                                 CLARE
                        You were right.

           HONKING outside.  Mrs. De Luca embraces her. 

                                 MRS. DE LUCA
                        Have fun tonight.  You deserve it. 

           PRELAP -- JAZZ.

           INT. RECEPTION HALL - NIGHT

           A fancy shmancy place crowded with WELL DRESSED PATRONS. 

           ON STAGE -- Louis rocks out with his BANDMATES.  And he’s in 
           his element.  Bopping his head to the rhythm.  Happier than 
           we’ve ever seen him.

           COUPLES groove it up on the dance floor.  Meredith and June 
           swish and sway to the beat.  

                                 JUNE
                           (to Clare)
                        Can I say something that might, 
                        like, make you really 
                        uncomfortable?!

                                 MEREDITH
                        I totally know what you’re gonna 
                        say!
                                 JUNE
                        Your dad is, like, serious 
                        hotsauce!

                                 MEREDITH
                        He’s sriracha sauce!  

                                 JUNE
                        He can get it--

                                 MEREDITH
                        --twice on Sunday!

           Before Clare’s brain explodes where she stands, a YOUNG MAN -- 
           earnest, harmless -- offers her his hand.  

                                 YOUNG MAN
                        Do you dance?

                                 CLARE
                        No, I--

                                 JUNE
                        Yes, she does!

           June gives Clare a shove and the next thing Clare knows, 
           she’s being whirled out onto the dance floor. 

           EXT. SHANNON HOUSE - BACKYARD - NIGHT

           Dressed entirely in black with a knapsack draped over his 
           back, Ryan hops the fence.  Keeping low, he hustles over to 
           the back-door, jimmies the lock open, and enters the house.

           INT. SHANNON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Ryan looks around.  He briefly picks up the SHANNON FAMILY 
           PHOTO on the end table and studies it.  

           Then he hurries to the stairwell.  

           His search for The Music Box has begun.

           INT. RECEPTION HALL - NIGHT

           Clare dances, really getting the hang of it.  Letting go.  
           Having fun. 

           Beside her, June and Meredith have also found PARTNERS who 
           spin them around.  A good time is being held by all.

           And then Clare sees a WOMAN standing by the buffet table.  
           Her profile looks familiar.  

           IT’S KATE!  

           Clare can barely contain herself. 
           She gestures excitedly to Louis and manages to catch his 
           attention.  She mouths. ‘It’s Kate!’ and points to the 
           buffet. 

           Without breaking his musical stride, Louis looks. 

           Clare mouths.  ‘Talk to her!  Get her number!  Please?!’

           Louis nods.  This time, he’s going to make it happen.

           INT. SHANNON HOUSE - LOUIS’ BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Ryan frantically searches the room -- through dresser 
           drawers, under the mattress, in the closet -- but he comes up 
           empty.  

           Shit!

           INT. RECEPTION HALL - NIGHT

           The band is on break.  Clare searches the crowd for her 
           father. 

           CLARE’S POV -- Louis stands in a quiet corner flirting with 
           Kate Stern who flirts right back.  

           And who could blame her? 

           Newly cleaned up with a sax on his shoulder, Louis looks 
           downright dashing.

           June and Meredith approach and flank Clare.  The three 
           observe in silence for a moment.

                                 JUNE
                        Your dad is so gonna get some 
                        later.

                                 MEREDITH
                        Like some serious boomchicka waa
                        waa.  You cool with that?

           Clare doesn’t answer.  She’s more than cool with it.  Life is 
           working itself out.  

           INT. SHANNON HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Frustrated beyond reason, Ryan slams the cabinets closed.  
           Still no sign of The Box.  Time’s ticking away and he’s 
           getting desperate.  

           But then he realizes, there’s one last place left to search.
           INT. SHANNON HOUSE - CLARE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Ryan throws open the door, looks around, and his search 
           resumes in earnest.

           INT. RECEPTION HALL - NIGHT

           Most of the paying patrons are gone, but it doesn’t matter.  

           JAZZ MAN PETE tears it up on the piano for the WAITSTAFF, 
           JANITORS, and remaining band members.

           Clare and Louis jam to the beat.  This is father/daughter 
           bonding time.  A rare thing.  Sweet.  Precious.  Fun.

           The final note is played and Louis dips Clare.  She giggles.  
           Adores him.  

           It’s great to have him back.

           INT. SHANNON HOUSE - CLARE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Ryan slams Clare’s last dresser drawer shut.

                                 RYAN
                        Shit!

           He takes a seat on Clare’s bed and takes a moment to compose 
           himself.  Clearly, he’s missing something.  Then he notices-- 

           A ROACH SKITTERING ACROSS THE FLOOR.  It disappears beneath 
           the floorboards.

           Eureka!  Ryan drops to his hands and knees and SHINES HIS 
           FLASHLIGHT INTO THE CRACKS.  He knows where The Box is.

           INT. LOUIS’ TRUCK (MOVING) - NIGHT

           A content Louis drives.  Clare rides shotgun. 

                                 LOUIS
                        Did you and your friends have a 
                        good time?

                                 CLARE
                        Yeah.  Did you have fun?

                                 LOUIS
                        Best night I’ve had in awhile. 
                        Marty even said we might make it a 
                        regular thing. 

           Clare glances knowingly at him.

                                 CLARE
                        You get her number this time?
                                 LOUIS
                        I did. 

                                 CLARE
                        You gonna call her?  Ask her out?

                                 LOUIS
                        You better believe it.  She’s a 
                        lucky lady.  Who’d pass up all this 
                        hotness right here?

           Clare snorts laughter.  With a brand new attitude, her dad is 
           pretty much the shit.  

           They pull into the driveway of the Shannon house.

           INT. SHANNON HOUSE - CLARE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Ryan looks up from the floorboards he’s set aside as 
           HEADLIGHTS FROM LOUIS’ TRUCK BLAST IN.  

           Shit!  Outta time.  

           Hastily, he reaches in and tries to pull The Box out, but--

           SNAP! 

           Wincing, he pulls his hand out revealing a SPRUNG RAT TRAP 
           DANGLING FROM THE END OF HIS NOW BROKEN MIDDLE FINGER.

                                 RYAN
                           (hisses)
                        Dammit!

           Undeterred, he reaches back in and attempts to pull The Box 
           out with his good hand.

           INT. SHANNON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Louis and Clare enter and look around.  Louis frowns.

                                 LOUIS
                        You hear that?

                                 CLARE
                        What?

           She follows him into the kitchen.

           INT. SHANNON HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           The back-door gapes open and the wind KNOCKS IT STEADILY 
           AGAINST THE WALL.  

           THUMP... THUMP... THUMP...  

           Louis quickly closes it.
                                 LOUIS
                           (perplexed)
                        Hunh.  Thought I locked it.  Guess 
                        I didn’t.

           With sudden realization, a panicked Clare runs out.

           INT. SHANNON HOUSE - CLARE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Ryan heaves and strains, but THE BOX WON’T BUDGE.  It’s 
           suddenly as HEAVY AS AN ANVIL.

           INT. SHANNON HOUSE - STAIRS - NIGHT

           Clare hurries up.

           INT. SHANNON HOUSE - CLARE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Clare’s FOOTSTEPS APPROACH.  Ryan’s outta time.

           As quickly as he can, he returns the boards, the rug, and the 
           chair to their places.

           The doorknob turns.  Clare’s right outside.

           Clutching his injured finger to his chest, Ryan looks around 
           for an escape route. 

           EXT. SHANNON HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Clare throws her bedroom door open and--

           INT. SHANNON HOUSE - CLARE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           THE ROOM’S EMPTY.  

           All appears to be as she left it except for--

           CURTAINS BILLOWING IN THE OPEN WINDOW. 

           Frowning, Clare moves over and peers out, but nothing seems 
           to be amiss.  Satisfied, she closes the window.  Locks it.

           She never sees--

           RYAN 

           Hiding on the first story roof, just out of sight.

           CLARE

           Retreats back into her room and pulls the rug aside.  She 
           peers beneath the floorboards.  
           Her Music Box is safe and sound.  

           She lets out a long sigh.  Relieved, she pulls it out.  

           This time, The Box goes willingly -- its normal weight 
           restored. 

           Clare holds it close, resting her cheek upon it, as the night 
           gets on.  

           EXT. SHANNON HOUSE - THE NEXT DAY

           A perfect day dawns. 

           INT. SHANNON HOUSE - CLARE’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Clare models another one of Mrs. De Luca’s dresses in the 
           mirror.  This is a change for her.  

           She looks stylish.  Young.  Hip.  It makes her uncomfortable, 
           but it’s also thrilling.  Then, out of nowhere--

           THE MUSIC BOX BEGINS TO PLAY.

                                 CLARE
                        What the hell?

           She drops to her knees and pulls aside the floorboards.

           INT. DE LUCA HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

           Humming to herself, Mrs. De Luca rinses out the sink.  

           She switches on the garbage disposal.  

           SOMETHING METAL RATTLES within.  

           She switches it off and peers inside.

           INT. SHANNON HOUSE - CLARE’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Clare kneels in front of The Box.

                                 CLARE
                           (whispers)
                        What’s going on?  What’s wrong with 
                        you?

           But there’s no answer beyond that strange haunting melody.

           INT. DE LUCA HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

           Mrs. De Luca sticks her hand into the drain to clear the 
           clog.  Abruptly--
           WHIRRRRRRRR! THE DISPOSAL REVS TO LIFE!

           Mrs. De Luca SCREAMS.

           INT. SHANNON HOUSE - CLARE’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Clare hears the scream, but it’s distant.  Unfocused.  

           After a few moments, THE BOX GOES SILENT.

           Clare studies it for a second.

           Hunh?  That was friggin’ weird.

           With nothing else to do, she returns The Box to its hiding 
           place underneath the floorboards.

           EXT. SHANNON HOUSE - DAY

           Still puzzled by The Box’s activity, Clare hops onto her bike 
           and throws a glance over to Mrs. De Luca’s kitchen window.  
           But it’s deserted.  No sign of Mrs. De Luca.

           She shrugs it off.  It’s probably nothing.

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY

           In fine spirits, Clare laughs it up with June and Meredith.

           With Tyler leading the way (a new Queen Bee has ascended), 
           the Populars pass by.  

           But Tyler STOPS and DOUBLE-TAKES Clare’s new outfit.

                                 TYLER
                        I have three words.

           Clare tenses, bracing for insult.

                                 TYLER (CONT’D)
                        YASSSS!  Lurve (love)! And fi-yah!

           These are Tyler’s highest compliments and Clare can’t help 
           it.  She grins.

                                 CLARE
                        Thanks.

                                 MEREDITH
                           (whispers, betrayed)
                        Seriously?

                                 TYLER
                           (to Clare)
                        You’re trying.  I like.  Werk dat!
           And he parades off.  Paul lingers for a moment. 

                                 PAUL
                        You do look really nice.

           He returns to his friends and Clare turns back to her own.  
           They’re not happy with her.

                                 JUNE
                        Um.  Rewind.  What just happened?

                                 CLARE
                        Nothing.

                                 MEREDITH
                        Something.  What is wrong with you?

                                 CLARE
                        What are you talking about?  He was 
                        being nice so I was being nice 
                        back.

                                 MEREDITH
                        But he’s never nice to you.  Or me.  
                        Or June. 

                                 CLARE
                        Well, I just... I mean... What was 
                        I supposed to say?  Die, bitch, 
                        die?

                                 MEREDITH & JUNE
                           (after a thought)
                        YES!

           The BELL RINGS.

                                 CLARE
                        Whatever.

                                 MEREDITH
                        Don’t minimize.  And America’s Most 
                        Wanted wants to talk to you. 

           Meredith and June stomp off.

           Stung, Clare looks after them.  Then--

                                 RYAN
                        Clare?

           Clare turns to see Ryan behind her.  He hides his bandaged 
           hand beneath his books.  He smiles.  Trying his best to be 
           approachable.  Non-threatening.

                                 CLARE
                        What?

                                 RYAN
                        We didn’t get off on the right 
                        foot.  That’s probably my fault.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 RYAN (CONT'D)
                        I’m not so good at... You know.  
                        This stuff.

                                 CLARE
                        What stuff?  Being normal stuff?

                                 RYAN
                        Something like that.  Look, Clare.  
                        I’m not trying to scare you, but I 
                        know you have--

                                 CLARE
                        You don’t know anything.

                                 RYAN
                           (re: her clothes)
                        I know what’s going on with you.  I 
                        know your dad gave you the Music 
                        Box.  And I get it.  But the first 
                        one’s always free. 

                                 CLARE
                        The first what?

                                 RYAN
                        Wish.  But after that, someone pays 
                        the price.  You don’t want that.  
                        Believe me.  You don’t.  You have 
                        to get rid of it!

                                 CLARE
                        I don’t know what you’re talking 
                        about!

           The ONE MINUTE BELL RINGS.

                                 RYAN
                        You will.  

                                 CLARE
                        I gotta get to class.

           She tries to storm past him, but he grabs her arm.

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        GET OFF!

           Embarrassed, he releases her and tries to keep cool.

                                 RYAN
                        Has it played for you yet?

                                 CLARE
                        So what if it has?

                                 RYAN
                           (sadly)
                        That’s how you know.  

                                 CLARE
                        For Godssake, know what?
                                 RYAN
                        That’s how you know the debt’s been 
                        paid.

           Uncomprehending, Clare hurries away.

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - DAY

           Clare chats it up with Paul.  Tyler saunters over. 

                                 TYLER
                           (to Clare)
                        Can I just do one thing?

                                 CLARE
                        Sure.

           Tyler whips out a brush and begins to style Clare’s hair.  
           He’s got mad skillz.  Bewildered, she just submits to it.  
           Then she glances over and sees--

           MEREDITH

           Who watches the entire affair and pretends to vomit into her 
           textbook. June nudges her.  Be nice.

           Clare sighs.

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - DAY

           Rocking her brand new hair do compliments of Tyler, Clare 
           prepares to join June and Meredith, but Paul and Tyler wave 
           her over to the popular table.

           Torn, Clare hesitates.  She motions June and Meredith over, 
           too, but Meredith FLIPS HER THE HAPPY FINGER.

           Hurt, Clare joins the Populars.

           Pissed and betrayed, Meredith turns to June.

                                 MEREDITH
                        Did that just happen? 

                                 JUNE
                        It soo just happened.

                                 MEREDITH
                        Fi-yah my flat ass.

           Clare settles in beside Paul and smiles, fitting in for the 
           first time in her life.

           And it’s glorious.

           Across the way, Ryan watches this.  He’s pained.  The Box 
           clearly has its claws deep in her.
           INT. SHANNON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - EVENING

           Clare enters to find Louis sitting on the couch, staring at 
           nothing.  He perks up when he sees her. 

                                 LOUIS
                        How was school, kiddo?

           Clare hesitates.  She’s never said this before.

                                 CLARE
                        Good.  It was actually really, 
                        really good. 
                           (then)
                        What’s wrong?

                                 LOUIS
                        Nothin’.  It’s just... It’s stupid.  

           She scrutinizes him for a beat.

                                 CLARE
                        She hasn’t returned your call?

                                 LOUIS
                           (embarrassed)
                        I dunno what happened.  Maybe I 
                        said the wrong thing and screwed 
                        up.  I just... I don’t know.

           And he looks damn miserable about it.

                                 CLARE
                        She’ll call.

                                 LOUIS
                        You think?

                                 CLARE
                        I know.  Just trust me.

           Off her certain smile--

           INT. SHANNON HOUSE - CLARE’S BEDROOM - EVENING

           Clare kneels before The Box.

                                 CLARE
                        Three wishes left.

           She closes her eyes and places both hands on The Box.

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        For my fifth wish... I want my dad 
                        and Kate to fall in love.  He 
                        deserves to be happy.

           A moment, then--
           THE PHONE RINGS downstairs.

           Clare grins.

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                           (whispers)
                        Thank you.

           INT. SHANNON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - EVENING

           Louis is on the phone and his mood has improved considerably. 

                                 LOUIS
                        Friday?  Sure... Sure, I’m around 
                        on Friday.

           Clare appears on the stairs.  He winks at her and mouths, 
           ‘It’s Kate!’ Clare nods.  Of course it is.  Hells yeah.

           EXT. SHANNON HOUSE - A FEW DAYS LATER

           Clare glances over at the De Luca kitchen window.  It’s still 
           deserted.  No sign of Mrs. De Luca.

           Clare frowns.  This is distinctly abnormal.  

           EXT. DE LUCA HOUSE - DAY

           Clare KNOCKS on the front door.

                                 CLARE
                        Mrs. De Luca?  It’s Clare.  Are you 
                        home?

           No answer.  

           Clare makes her way around to the back.

           EXT. DE LUCA HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAY

           Clare KNOCKS on the back-door.  No answer. 

           And then SHE SMELLS IT.

           A FOUL ODOR.

           She winces and covers her nose with her hand.

                                 CLARE
                           (sotto)
                        Please don’t be dead.

           She retrieves a HIDE-A-KEY from a flower pot and, dreading 
           what she’s going to find, she enters the home.
           INT. DE LUCA HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           The smell is even worse in here.  Clare tries not to gag.

                                 CLARE
                        Mrs. De Luca?
                           (whispers)
                        Please be okay.  Please be okay.  
                        Please be okay.

           Hoping against hope, she rounds the corner and follows the 
           smell into the--

           INT. DE LUCA HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

           And she stops.  Stunned.  SCREAMS.

           CLARE’S POV -- Mrs. De Luca is slumped against the kitchen 
           sink.  Stiff. 

           ONE ARM WEDGED DEEP INTO THE DISPOSAL WHERE SHE BLED OUT.

           Her mouth is still open wide.  Frozen in a silent, agonized 
           scream.

           INT. SHANNON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - EVENING

           A shell-shocked Clare accepts a mug of hot chocolate from 
           Louis.  The flashing lights of COP CARS and LOCAL NEWS VANS 
           throw shadows.

                                 LOUIS
                           (at a loss)
                        I’m sorry you had to see that.

                                 CLARE
                        What do they think happened to her?

                                 LOUIS
                        Freak accident.  Medical examiner 
                        said he’s never seen anything like 
                        it before.

                                 CLARE
                        Do they know when it happened?

                                 LOUIS
                        A few days ago.

           Clare stifles a sob.  Louis moves to embrace her, but the 
           PHONE RINGS.  Louis picks it up.

                                 LOUIS (CONT’D)
                        Hello?...
                           (to Clare)
                        For you.

           He hands her the phone.  
                                 CLARE
                           (into phone)
                        Hello?

                                 RYAN (O.S.)
                           (filtered)
                        Clare?

                                 CLARE
                        Who is this?

                                 RYAN (O.S.)
                           (filtered)
                        You know who this is.  Remember 
                        what I told you?  You have to get 
                        rid of it, Clare.  You have to--

           CLICK.  Clare slams the phone down.  DIAL TONE.  

                                 LOUIS
                        Who was it?

                                 CLARE
                        No one.  Just a kid from school.
                           (a moment)
                        That box you got me. 

                                 LOUIS
                        What about it?

                                 CLARE
                        I don’t think I want it anymore.

           Off this...

           EXT. SHANNON HOUSE - NIGHT

           A determined Clare marches outside with The Box in her arms.   *
           She rips the lid off a trashcan and prepares to throw The Box 
           inside, but she stops when she hears--

           SAXOPHONE MUSIC drifting out of the home.  Lonely.  Lovely.

           She hesitates.  Her gaze falls onto The Box’s inscription.

                                 CLARE
                        ‘Abandon, lose, or open me and all 
                        will be undone.’

           Shit.  She’s torn.

           INT. SHANNON HOUSE - CLARE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Clare stares at The Box on the floor.  

           She can’t give it up.  

           Not yet.
           Suddenly, The Box lid opens with a sinister CREAK.

                                 CLARE
                           (breathless)
                        What are you doing?

           MUSIC BEGINS TO PLAY.  

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        No!  Don’t!  Don’t!

           The twisted, haunting melody fills the room.

           Panicked, Clare SLAMS THE LID SHUT.  

           The MUSIC CUTS OUT.

           Frantically, Clare looks around the room and grabs socks and 
           stockings.

           She TIES THEM AROUND THE MUSIC BOX, trying to make it 
           impossible for it to open.

           She secures the final knot and sits back to study her work.  

           The Box is covered in A MISHMASH OF CLUMSY KNOTS.

           Satisfied, she returns it to its hiding place beneath the 
           floorboards. 

           Then she grabs her pillows and blankets and books it out of 
           there in a hurry.  Secure or not, there’s no way in hell 
           she’s sleeping in there tonight.

           INT. SHANNON HOUSE - STUDIO - NIGHT

           Within a nest of blankets on the floor, Clare tosses and 
           turns.  Unable to get comfortable.  

           Haunted by a guilty conscience, sleep is a long way away. 

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY

           Clare practically sleepwalks through.  She looks beaten.  
           Exhausted.  Ahead of her--

           JUNE AND MEREDITH giggle at their lockers.  

           Clare waves to them.  

           June waves back.  Openly hostile, Meredith doesn’t.

           Crushed, Clare turns away and nearly bumps into--

           RYAN!  

           He reaches out.  She sidesteps around him.
                                 RYAN
                        Clare, I know what you’re going 
                        through.  Let me help.

                                 CLARE
                        Don’t.  Just don’t!

           And she hurries away.

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL - LIBRARY - DAY

           Troubled, Clare types in a new google search.

           “LAWRENCE HART FREAK ACCIDENT”

           She clicks ENTER and thousands of results pop up.

           She begins to scroll through them.  Various headlines catch 
           her eye. 

           “HART GARDENER IMPALED IN FREAK FALL...”

           “NATALIA HART BEHEADED IN BIZARRE ACCIDENT...”

           “CHILD CHOKES IN NURSERY DAYS AFTER MOTHER’S DEATH...”

           Horrified, Clare gapes at this.  Then--

           THUMP! beside her.  

           She jumps and looks up.  

           But it’s just PAUL.  Cute and casual.  

                                 PAUL
                        S’up?

           Clare quickly CLICKS OVER TO ANOTHER SCREEN before he can see 
           what she’s looking at.

                                 CLARE
                        Nothing.

                                 PAUL
                        Can I ask you something or is now a 
                        bad time? 

                                 CLARE
                        No.  Now’s...um.  Now’s a great 
                        time.

                                 PAUL
                           (too fast)
                        Cause-I-can-ask-you-out-later-if 
                        you-promise-to-say-yes.

           Clare blinks.  It takes her a moment to realize--
                                 CLARE
                        Did you just ask me out?

                                 PAUL
                        I did, but badly.  Sooo badly.  I 
                        have swag, I swear I do.  It just 
                        goes away when I’m nervous.

                                 CLARE
                        You’re nervous?

                                 PAUL
                        Well, yeah.  Course.

           And that’s just plain adorable.  Clare has no words.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                        Wow, I am sucking at this, aren’t 
                        I?  Awk.  Ward.  Let’s try again.
                           (deep breath)
                        Carnival’s in town this weekend.  A 
                        bunch of us are heading out there 
                        Saturday and I thought you might 
                        want to come.  Be my date.  It’ll 
                        be fun. 

           A long moment.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                           (prompts)
                        Sooo?

                                 CLARE
                        Sorry.  Sorry.  Yes. 

                                 PAUL
                           (relieved)
                        Great.  So I’ll pick you up.  Say 
                        Saturday afternoon?  And I’ll have 
                        my swag back by then.  Maybe.  
                        Don’t count on it.

           He heads off.  She should be happy, but isn’t quite.  Torn, 
           she watches him go.

           INT. HARDWARE STORE - DAY

           Looking drawn and miserable, Clare studies a long line of 
           chains and padlocks. 

           INT. SHANNON HOUSE - CLARE’S BEDROOM - EVENING

           Clare finishes wrapping The Box in heavy chains and secures 
           the massive PADLOCK. 

                                 CLARE
                        Try opening now, you little shit.
           INT. SHANNON HOUSE - STUDIO - LATE NIGHT

           Clare sits up.  Wide awake.  Can’t sleep.  The weight of 
           keeping The Box is taking a visible toll on her psyche.

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL - CAFETERIA - DAY

           Clare tries to engage with the Populars, but can’t quite 
           manage it.  

           At a table across the way, Meredith and June exchange 
           concerned looks.  Something’s clearly up with their friend.  

           INT. SHANNON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - EVENING

           Clare watches Louis talk avidly on the phone.  He mouths to 
           her, “It’s Kate” and looks genuinely happy.  She tries to 
           smile back, but it’s forced.  Difficult. 

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY

           At the far end of the hallway, Clare watches June and 
           Meredith talk.  She waits until Meredith has moved away 
           before tentatively approaching June.

                                 CLARE
                        Can I talk to you?

           INT. ACOSTA HOUSE - JUNE’S BEDROOM - DAY

           June studies a morose, dazed Clare.  After a moment, Meredith 
           enters and stops, betrayed.  

                                 MEREDITH
                        What’s she doing here?

                                 JUNE
                        Bitch much?  I invited her.

                                 MEREDITH
                        Why?

                                 JUNE
                        Because she wanted to talk to us 
                        about something important.

                                 MEREDITH
                        Why doesn’t she just talk to her 
                        cool new friends.  Fi-yah!

                                 JUNE
                        Behave or bounce.

                                 MEREDITH
                        I’ll behave-ish.
           Meredith takes a seat and glares at Clare.

                                 MEREDITH (CONT’D)
                        Talk, traitor.  Your loyal friends 
                        are listening.

           Clare debates a moment.  She takes a deep breath and begins.

           (LATER)

           Clare has finished her tale.  June and Meredith just blink at 
           her.  A long silence ensues.

                                 CLARE
                        What?  You guys believe me, right?

           No one answers.

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        Say something.

                                 MEREDITH
                        Did your brain just exit your body?

                                 JUNE
                        Bitch much?!

                                 MEREDITH
                        But everything she just said is 
                        batshit crazy.  Clare, have you 
                        ever heard of coincidence?  Let’s 
                        look at this logically.  First 
                        wish.  What was it?

                                 CLARE
                        That Darcie would leave me the hell 
                        alone and she did!

                                 MEREDITH
                        Cause she got pinched for being a 
                        dumbshit!  That has nothing to do 
                        with you.  Second wish?

                                 CLARE
                        That Paul Middlebrook would fall 
                        madly in love with me. 

                                 JUNE
                        Clare, you have a date to a 
                        carnival that everyone’s going to 
                        including us. 

                                 MEREDITH
                        Yeah.  It’s not like you’re getting 
                        married and trying to decide who 
                        not to invite.  It’s not like 
                        you’re paying a mortgage.  It’s not 
                        like you’re trying to send your 
                        slacker kids off to an Ivy League 
                        they don’t want to go to.  It’s not-
                                 JUNE
                        Shut.  Up.

                                 CLARE
                        But he started talking to me the 
                        day after I wished it.  The very 
                        next day!  The same day I found my 
                        cat ripped to pieces beneath my 
                        porch!

                                 MEREDITH
                        Coincidence!  Third wish?

                                 CLARE
                        That my dad would clean the house.

                                 MEREDITH
                        And let me guess, he did?

                                 CLARE
                        Out of the blue.  Just happened.  
                        He had this big garage sale and got 
                        rid of everything.  A day before 
                        that I tried to throw away a 
                        curtain rod and he bit my head off. 

                                 JUNE
                        Maybe he just figured it was time. 

                                 CLARE
                        But only after I wished it.  And 
                        then Mr. Stanley had that stroke 
                        right in front of me! 

                                 MEREDITH
                        Coincidence!  Four?

                                 CLARE
                        That my dad would get a gig.  And 
                        he did.  A friend of his who hasn’t 
                        called in years, called him out of 
                        the blue.  I mean, this is more 
                        than just coincidence!  

                                 JUNE
                        Clare, I don’t think so. 

                                 MEREDITH
                        You want to know what I think?

                                 CLARE
                        Dazzle.

                                 MEREDITH
                        I think you’re a selfish bowl of 
                        bitchsauce.  

                                 CLARE
                        Excuse me?
                                 MEREDITH
                        Even if I did believe you, which I 
                        don’t, if I had seven wishes, I’d 
                        cure cancer or wish for world 
                        peace.  Hell, you’re supposed to be 
                        my best friend.  You’ve used up 
                        four whole wishes and you didn’t 
                        wish for me to grow some boobies or 
                        for June to lose fifty pounds? 

                                 JUNE
                        I’d wish for more wishes.

                                 CLARE
                        I don’t think it works that way.  I 
                        mean, hell, if I believed this was 
                        real in the beginning and would’ve 
                        wished for my mom to...

                                 JUNE
                           (gently)
                        To what, Clare?

                                 CLARE
                        Nothing.  Nevermind.  I just... I 
                        don’t think I should be wishing 
                        anymore.  

                                 MEREDITH
                        Selfish.  Bitchsauce.  Truth.

                                 CLARE
                        Sorry.  But Mrs. De Luca died and--

                                 MEREDITH
                        Old ladies die all the time.  
                        That’s what happens when you’re 
                        old. You die!

                                 CLARE
                        Not like this.  And you didn’t see 
                        her.  And I wished again, but...

                                 JUNE
                        But?

           Clare knuckles away frustrated tears.

                                 CLARE
                        I think... I think something else 
                        bad might happen to someone I 
                        really care about.

                                 MEREDITH
                        Like who?  

                                 JUNE
                        Like us?

           Clare nods.
                                 JUNE (CONT’D)
                        So not cool!

                                 MEREDITH
                        Oh, come on!  You’re paranoid!

                                 JUNE
                        Well... Can we see The Box?

           Off Clare deliberating--

           INT. SHANNON HOUSE - CLARE’S BEDROOM - EVENING

           Clare, Meredith, and June study the Music Box at their feet.

                                 MEREDITH
                           (skeptically)
                        This is it?

           She kicks it.  THUMP!

                                 CLARE
                        Don’t!

                                 MEREDITH
                        Sorry.

                                 JUNE
                        What’s the combo?

                                 CLARE
                        My birthday.

                                 MEREDITH
                        So let’s open it.

                                 CLARE
                        I don’t think that’s a good idea. 

                                 MEREDITH
                        Why not?  What could happen?

                                 JUNE
                        Shut up, Meredith.  She’s scared of 
                        it and you are extra today!

           Meredith flops down in front of The Box and begins to work 
           the combo.   Clare tenses.  June also looks uneasy.  Meredith 
           glances up.

                                 MEREDITH
                        Quit it!  You guys are freaking me 
                        out!  There’s nothing to be worried 
                        about!

           She opens the lock and chains fall away.  Then she takes a 
           deep breath, begins BEGINS TO LIFT THE BOX’S LATCH and--

           BRRRRRRINNNGGGG!!!! HER CELLPHONE SPARKS TO LIFE!  
           Meredith practically jumps out of her skin.  Annoyed, she 
           pulls out her phone.

                                 MEREDITH (CONT’D)
                           (into cell)
                        Hello?... Hey, mom.  I’m at Clare’s 
                        house... Yeah, I know.  Something 
                        came up.

           While Meredith talks, Clare quietly returns The Box to its 
           place beneath the floorboards. 

                                 MEREDITH (CONT’D)
                        Okay!  Fine, bye!

           Aggravated, Meredith hangs up and looks around.

                                 MEREDITH (CONT’D)
                           (to Clare)
                        What’d you do with it? 

                                 CLARE
                        I changed my mind. 

                                 MEREDITH
                        You’re seriously not going to let 
                        me open it?

                                 CLARE
                        Sorry. 

                                 MEREDITH
                        Wow.  Just wow.  I can’t even... I 
                        can’t even deal.  June, you’re 
                        taking me home, right?
                           (off June’s nod)
                        I’ll be in the car.  And just 
                        between us, you look terrible, 
                        Clare.  Like asscheese on a moldy 
                        cracker.  Truth.

                                 JUNE
                        Meredith!

                                 MEREDITH
                        Just sayin’. 

           She exits in a huff.  A sympathetic June turns to Clare. 

                                 JUNE
                        I think you should just throw it 
                        away.

                                 CLARE
                        Can’t.

                                 JUNE
                        Why not?
                                 CLARE
                        Cause it says if you get rid of it, 
                        everything will ‘be undone.’  It’s 
                        stupid, I know, I just can’t toss 
                        it yet.  

                                 JUNE
                        So what are you going to do?

           Off Clare -- She has no idea.

           INT. SHANNON HOUSE - STUDIO - NIGHT

           Brow furrowed, Clare tries to get comfortable on the floor.  
           Louis KNOCKS briefly and sticks his head in.

                                 LOUIS
                        Hey.  Everything all right?

                                 CLARE
                           (light)
                        Sure.  Why wouldn’t it be?

           Louis cocks a brow.  Sleeping on the floor ain’t normal.

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        My back.  My back’s been bugging me 
                        a lot lately.

                                 LOUIS
                           (doesn’t buy it)
                        You’d tell me if something was--

                                 CLARE
                        -wrong?  Sure.

           Louis lets it go.  No point in pushing her.

                                 LOUIS
                        Funeral’s on Saturday if you still 
                        want to go.

           She nods.  A moment, then--

                                 CLARE
                        How’s Kate?

                                 LOUIS
                        She’s good.  We’re good.  That’s 
                        not weird for you, is it? 

                                 CLARE
                        It’s not weird for me at all. 
                        Night, dad.

                                 LOUIS
                        Night.

           Louis closes the door as he departs.  Clare just sighs. 
           INT. SHANNON HOUSE - CLARE’S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

           WE PUSH IN ON -- THE MUSIC BOX.  Still padlocked and wrapped 
           in chains beneath the floor.

           A moment passes.

           Then THE PADLOCK’S DIAL BEGINS TO SPIN.  

           CLICK... CLICK... CLICK... KA-CHINK!

           THE PADLOCK SPRINGS OPEN.  CHAINS SLIDE AWAY.

           INT. SHANNON HOUSE - STUDIO - MORNING

           Clare wakes and right away, she senses something’s off.  
           Strange.  Abruptly, she sits up and sees--

           THE PADLOCK ON THE FLOOR BESIDE HER PILLOW.

           Clare jams her hand into her mouth to stifle a scream.  

           It’s like The Box said in no uncertain terms -- 

           Don’t fuck with me.

           And Clare runs out.

           EXT. CHURCH - DAY (ESTABLISHING)

           A quaint little place.

           Dressed in their Sunday best, Clare and Louis head inside.

           INT. CHURCH - DAY

           Mostly empty.  

           Clare and Louis sit quietly, waiting for the funeral service 
           to begin.

           Noise at the back of the church.  Clare turns to see--

           Ryan enter and take a seat.  He nods to her.  

           After a moment, she nods solemnly back.  

           INT. SHANNON HOUSE - CLARE’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Numb, Clare just sits on her bed staring at nothing and she’s 
           been like this for hours.

           She looks exhausted.  Diminished.  Wearing thin.

           KNOCK KNOCK. Clare doesn’t move. 
           KNOCK KNOCK. Still nothing from Clare. 

           After a moment, Louis enters.

                                 LOUIS
                        Clare?  Hey, kiddo. 

           Concerned, Louis rubs her back.  Clare’s lackluster gaze 
           shifts towards him.

                                 LOUIS (CONT’D)
                        Someone’s here to see you.

                                 CLARE
                        I don’t want to see him.

                                 LOUIS
                        I think you might.

                                 CLARE
                        Dad, no!  I--

                                 LOUIS
                        He brought flowers.

           Off Clare’s bewilderment--

           INT. SHANNON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Clare enters to find--

           PAUL.

           He rises and presents her with a daisy bouquet. 

                                 PAUL
                        You didn’t forget our date, did 
                        you?

                                 CLARE
                           (yes)
                        No.

                                 PAUL
                        It kinda looks like you did.

                                 CLARE
                        I didn’t.  I just don’t think I 
                        should go.

                                 PAUL
                        Why not?  Your dad’s cool with it.  
                        He likes me.

                                 LOUIS (O.S.)
                           (from the next room)
                        As long as you keep your hands to 
                        yourself!
           Despite everything she’s been through in the last 24 hours, 
           Clare almost smiles.

                                 PAUL
                        Come out with me.  It’ll be fun, I 
                        swear.

           Torn, Clare deliberates.  Then--

           PRE-LAP -- SCREAMS.  

           The happy kind.

           EXT. CARNIVAL - ROLLERCOASTER - NIGHT

           With Paul beside her, Clare HOLLERS as a rollercoaster twists 
           and turns her. 

           INT. CARNIVAL - FUNHOUSE - NIGHT

           Clare and Paul take a selfie of their distorted reflections.

           EXT. CARNIVAL - BOOTHS - NIGHT

           Paul wins Clare a ridiculously huge, fluorescent green, 
           stuffed DOG.  He hands it to her.

           Ermagawd!

           She never sees Ryan keeping a close, protective eye on her 
           from a distance.

           EXT. CARNIVAL - FOOD TRUCKS - NIGHT

           Carrying her giant green dog, Clare waits off to the side 
           while Paul buys cotton candy.  

           Meredith and June approach.

                                 MEREDITH
                        Oh my gawd, can you believe it? 
                        June and I are still alive.  No 
                        one’s been killed by a little wish 
                        box.  Go figure.

                                 JUNE
                        Ignore her.  Rainbow Not-So-
                        Bright’s phone fell out during a 
                        ride and they won’t get for her 
                        until tomorrow.

                                 MEREDITH
                        Like I don’t have people to call!  
                                 JUNE
                        You have two people to call.  Me 
                        and Clare.  And we’re right here.  
                        We get it.  We understand.

                                 MEREDITH
                        Whatev.  You know how sometimes you 
                        forget to put on your panties and 
                        you feel like you’re missing 
                        something for the rest day?

                                 CLARE
                        No.

                                 JUNE
                        Absolutely not.

                                 MEREDITH
                        Oh come on, it happens to everyone.

                                 JUNE
                        Not me.

                                 MEREDITH
                        Well, use your imagination cuz
                        that’s how I feel.  Like my cooch
                        is out and catching breezes. 
                        #vagcold.  I need my phone.  
                        Period!

           June just rolls her eyes.

                                 JUNE
                           (to Clare)
                        You okay?

                                 CLARE
                           (nods)
                        Trying to forget about everything.

           Paul returns with cotton candy.

                                 JUNE
                        Have fun, Clare.

           And she drags Meredith away.  The perfect date resumes.

           EXT. CARNIVAL - FERRIS WHEEL - NIGHT

           The place all great dates must end.  Paul and Clare ride up 
           with the green dog between them.

           Clare’s mood has improved considerably; the Music Box is a 
           million mental miles away.  

           They hit the apex and drink in a spectacular panoramic view.

           A moment. 

           Clare catches Paul looking at her.  
                                 CLARE
                        What?

                                 PAUL
                        I was trying to think of something 
                        dope to say before I kissed you.
                           (pause, then a laugh)
                        That wasn’t it.

           A moment and THEY KISS.  It’s one of those kisses.  Her 
           first.  Long.  Chaste.  Sweet.  Bliss.

           EXT. CARNIVAL - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           Paul’s car is parked in a semi-secluded area near the trees.

           INT. PAUL’S CAR (PARKED) - NIGHT

           Clare and Paul make out in the backseat.  It’s getting hot 
           and heavy.  He’s really into it, but she’s not.  She pulls 
           away.

                                 CLARE
                        Stop.

                                 PAUL
                        What?  What’s wrong?  

                                 CLARE
                        Nothing, it’s just--

           And Paul moves in again, trying to kiss her.

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        Paul, quit!

                                 PAUL
                        But I love you!

           Whafuck!?  Those words hang in the air and they sound 
           absolutely crazy.  And Paul knows it.  But he can’t help 
           himself.

                                 PAUL (CONT’D)
                           (sheepish)
                        I do.  I love you.  I think about 
                        you all the time.  I can’t stop 
                        thinking about you.  I think... I 
                        think I want to marry you. 
                           (off her incredulous look)
                        What?

                                 CLARE
                        You don’t think that’s like, beyond 
                        effed up?

                                 PAUL
                        No.
                                 CLARE
                        I’ve been in the same class as you 
                        for years and we’ve never spoken 
                        once.  Not before a few weeks ago 
                        and now you want to marry me.

                                 PAUL
                        Yes.  Because I’m in love with you.

                                 CLARE
                        Stop saying that!

                                 PAUL
                        I can’t help how I feel.  Don’t you 
                        love me?

                                 CLARE
                        Are you kidding?  No!

                                 PAUL
                        You will.  And in the meantime, I 
                        have enough love for us both.

           Dear God, he sounds like a moron.  And she’s beginning to 
           like him a whole lot less.

                                 CLARE
                        Take me home.

                                 PAUL
                        Oh, come on, Clare.

           He moves in again.

                                 CLARE
                        I said, no!  Take me home!  

           But this time, he’s on top of her.  Aggressive.  Scary.  

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        Get off, Paul!  Get--

           WFFFT! The CAR ROCKS as AIR SUDDENLY DEFLATES FROM A POPPED 
           TIRE.

                                 PAUL
                        What the hell?

           Paul jumps out of the car.  Clare straightens up her clothes 
           and follows.

           EXT. CARNIVAL - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           With a switchblade in hand, Ryan casually moves around to the 
           other side of Paul’s car.

                                 PAUL
                        What the fuck you think you’re 
                        doin’, man?
                                 RYAN
                        I was just about to ask you the 
                        same thing.  No means no, 
                        goatprick.

           And he PLUNGES THE KNIFE INTO ANOTHER TIRE.  WFFFT!

                                 PAUL
                        Hey!  You can’t do that!

                                 RYAN
                        Just did.  Two down.  Two to go.  
                        Unless you plan on stopping me.

           Intimidated, Paul hesitates.

                                 RYAN (CONT’D)
                        Didn’t think so.

           WFFFTF!  WFFFFT! Ryan deflates Paul’s last two tires, then 
           to Clare--

                                 RYAN (CONT’D)
                        Looks like you need a ride.

           Clare hurries over to Ryan.

                                 PAUL
                        Clare?

                                 RYAN
                        Dude, take a hint and bounce out.

           Fuck it. Paul gets back into his car and pulls out on four 
           flat tires.  A sorry sight.

           A moment.  Ryan and Clare just study each other.

                                 CLARE
                        You were--

                                 RYAN
                        Following you?  Yeah.

                                 CLARE
                        Why?

                                 RYAN
                        Thought you might need me.  I’m 
                        just trying to help.  That’s all 
                        I’ve been trying to do from the 
                        beginning.  Just help.

                                 CLARE
                        Thanks, but--

           Both turn when they hear SCREAMING.

           Carnival PATRONS surge towards the gates.  
           Something BIG just happened.

           Dreading what she might find, Clare follows the crowd.

                                 RYAN
                           (after her)
                        Clare?!

           But she doesn’t hear.  She thinks she might know exactly 
           what’s happening.

           EXT. CARNIVAL - RESTRICTED AREA - NIGHT

           SKELETAL ROLLERCOASTER TRACKS spiral and twist into the 
           night.

           SECURITY GUARDS try to keep the crowd at bay, but Clare slips 
           through the SECURITY GATE and cautiously approaches EMTs who 
           cluster around a BODY.

           Off to the side, Security Officers comfort a weepy hysterical 
           June.  

                                 JUNE
                        She was just... She was just trying 
                        to get her phone!

           June spots Clare.

                                 JUNE (CONT’D)
                           (points)
                        It’s her!  It’s her fault!  She 
                        knew this would happen!  It’s her 
                        fault!

                                 SECURITY GUARD #1
                           (to Clare)
                        Hey!  You’re not supposed to be 
                        here!

           Security moves towards Clare, but Clare’s frozen.  Rooted to 
           the spot.  She has to see what happened.

           HER POV -- An EMT moves aside revealing--

           MEREDITH

           Clearly dead.  Eyes wide.  

           BODY TWISTED.  Limbs askew.  A gruesome high impact fatality.

                                 CLARE
                           (a whisper)
                        No.

                                 RYAN
                        Come on, Clare.  Come on, let’s go.

           And Ryan gently pulls her away.
           INT. COFFEESHOP - NIGHT

           Ryan and Clare sit at a backbooth, sharing a pot of coffee. 
           He pours Clare a cup.  

           She takes it with shaky hands.  Tears flow freely.  
           Overwhelmed by guilt, she just can’t make them stop.

           He regards her sympathetically.

                                 RYAN
                        You have to get rid of it.

                                 CLARE
                        I know.  I know.

                                 RYAN
                        But?

                                 CLARE
                           (beat, embarrassed)
                        It was just really nice to be 
                        normal.  
                           (then)
                        I’m so stupid.

                                 RYAN
                        You’re not stupid.

                                 CLARE
                        People are dead because of me.  My 
                        best friend is dead because of me.

                                 RYAN
                        People are dead because The Box is 
                        evil.

                                 CLARE
                        I could’ve wished for world peace 
                        or a cure for cancer or--

                                 RYAN
                        It doesn’t work that way, Clare.  
                        The Box chooses its owner and 
                        tempts them.  It feeds on their 
                        insecurities.  Their selfishness.  
                        It can’t do good without doing 
                        harm.  That’s its nature.

                                 CLARE
                        And the thing I wanted most of all, 
                        I never got to wish for.

                                 RYAN
                        What thing?
                           (then he realizes)
                        Your mom?

                                 CLARE
                        I never go to say good-bye.
                           (pause)
                                 (MORE)
                                 CLARE (CONT'D)
                        I didn’t mean for any of this to 
                        happen.

                                 RYAN
                        No one ever does.

                                 CLARE
                           (a moment)
                        What is it?  Where’d it come from?

           Ryan rises and tosses a few bills on the table. 

                                 RYAN
                        Come with me.

                                 CLARE
                        Where are we going?

                                 RYAN
                        My place.  There’s something you 
                        need to see.

           He offers his hand.  She takes it and notes his broken 
           finger.

                                 CLARE
                        What happened?

                                 RYAN
                        Your rat trap.  Clever.

                                 CLARE
                        So someone did try to break in the 
                        other night.  It was you!
                           (then)
                        You tried to take The Box?

                                 RYAN
                        Tried.  It wouldn’t let me.

           They exit.

           INT. RYAN’S HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT

           Clare follows Ryan over to his wall of PHOTOGRAPHS.  
           Overwhelmed, she gapes at this sinister menagerie.  

                                 RYAN
                        From what I can tell, this all 
                        started in 1918 with a young woman 
                        named Annabeth Gilles.  She lost 
                        her entire family to the influenza 
                        epidemic.

                                 CLARE
                           (sotto)
                        AG.  Annabeth Gilles.
                                 RYAN
                        She was studying to be a nun at the 
                        time.  Convinced that God had 
                        abandoned her, she went into the 
                        woods with the only thing she had 
                        of value, a silver music box.  For 
                        seven days and seven nights she 
                        prayed and offered her soul to the 
                        darkness.  On the seventh night, 
                        something came to her.  It took up 
                        residence in The Box and a pact was 
                        struck.  One wish for every day of 
                        prayer.  Annabeth Gilles married 
                        Harold Grayson in 1921 and had two
                        children.  

           He points to a PHOTO OF A WELL DRESSED BUT UNSMILING FAMILY.  
           A rigid, stern-faced ANNABETH GILLES (20s) sits with the 
           MUSIC BOX in her lap.

                                 RYAN (CONT’D)
                        They were exceedingly wealthy, but 
                        haunted by tragedies.  The family 
                        milk cow was found ripped to 
                        pieces. 

           He points to a PHOTO of a YOUNG WOMAN, pretty.  Smiling.

                                 RYAN (CONT’D)
                        Their maid was trampled by a horse 
                        and she lost both legs.

           He comes to a PHOTO of a CHILD.

                                 RYAN (CONT’D)
                        Her youngest drowned in a bath.  

           And finally, a CRIME SCENE PHOTOGRAPH OF ANNABETH taken 
           postmortem.  She’s crouched in a corner.  Fetal position.  
           HANDS OUTSTRETCHED AS THOUGH PUSHING SOMETHING AWAY.

           Her eyes and mouth are wide open.  She was screaming when she 
           died.  And THE BOX IS JUST A FEW FEET AWAY.

                                 RYAN (CONT’D)
                        This is Annabeth a few years later.
                        She died from a massive heart 
                        attack.  It basically exploded in 
                        her chest.  But I think it was 
                        something more.  I think whatever’s 
                        in that Box came to take its last 
                        payment.

                                 CLARE
                        Which was?

                                 RYAN
                        Her soul.

           Ryan points to a PHOTO of a handsome GI.
                                 RYAN (CONT’D)
                        In 1944, a soldier named Arthur 
                        Sands brought The Box back to 
                        America at the end of the second 
                        world war.  This is him a year 
                        later.

           He nods to a PHOTO of the same GI, crouched in a corner, in 
           the same position as Annabeth Gilles.  Dead.

           And Ryan comes to another pair of PHOTOS.  One features a 
           BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN WEARING A MISS DELAWARE CROWN. 

                                 RYAN (CONT’D)
                        In 1962, Edwina Haggard was just an 
                        overweight country girl with a 
                        dream.  In 1963, she became Mrs. 
                        Delaware.  She was found in her 
                        apartment closet in 1964.

           Wincing, Clare turns away from a PHOTO of EDWINA, dead in her 
           closet, mouth open.  Screaming for eternity. 

           They come to another PHOTO CLUSTER.  A handsome MAN IN A 
           WHEELCHAIR holds prominence.

                                 RYAN (CONT’D)
                        Daniel Johns.  Long distance ski 
                        champ paralyzed from the waist 
                        down.  One day, he just got up and 
                        started walking.  Doctors said it 
                        was a miracle.  It wasn’t.  It was 
                        The Box.  He married.  Had two 
                        sons.  I survived.  My older 
                        brother didn’t.

                                 CLARE
                        Daniel Johns was your father?

                                 RYAN
                        This is all his research.  My 
                        brother died.  Freak accident on a 
                        playground.  He broke his neck.  
                        Not long after, my mother was 
                        impaled.  Two knitting needles 
                        right through the chest.  And then 
                        whatever’s in The Box came for my 
                        father. 

           He points to a PHOTO OF DANIEL JOHNS.  In the same position 
           as the rest.

                                 RYAN (CONT’D)
                        I found his files a few years ago.  
                        Found Lawrence Hart on my own.  I 
                        think he must have known what was 
                        coming for him because he tried to 
                        burn down the house.

           Clare studies a PHOTO OF LAWRENCE HART in the fetal position 
           but CHARRED.  BLACKENED.
                                 RYAN (CONT’D)
                        But he wasn’t hard to find if you 
                        know what to look for.  Anyone down 
                        on their luck who hits a winning 
                        streak.  Like Lawrence Hart.  Like 
                        my dad.  Like you.  And your Music 
                        Box isn’t the only one.  

           He points to another line of PHOTOGRAPHS featuring PEOPLE 
           FROM ACROSS THE GLOBE - China, Africa, Brazil.  

           All are in the same position.  Fetal.  Hands outstretched.  
           Screaming.  Various different vessels - boxes, jars, oil 
           lamps - in front of them.

                                 CLARE
                        What is it?

                                 RYAN
                        There are dark things in this 
                        world, Clare.  Evil things that 
                        exist somewhere between the living 
                        and the dead.  Demons.  Shedu.  
                        Jinn.  The Belial.  They shun the 
                        light and embrace darkness.  But 
                        the thing they want most of all is 
                        the thing most sacred to all of us.

           Clare thinks about this.

                                 CLARE
                        Our souls.

                                 RYAN
                        The wishes are The Box’s greatest 
                        manipulation.  Its unholy bargain.  
                        One day, after the final wish is 
                        granted, it’ll claim your soul.  
                        It’s time to let go.

           Clare nods.  This time, she’s ready.

           INT/EXT. RYAN’S CAR - LATE NIGHT

           With Clare in the passenger seat, Ryan pulls up to the 
           Shannon House and parks.

                                 RYAN
                        You ready?

                                 CLARE
                           (nods)
                        How do we, you know, destroy it?

                                 RYAN
                        Well, burning didn’t work for 
                        Lawrence Hart.  I say, we dig a 
                        hole.  Bury it so deep that no one 
                        will ever find it.
           Clare lets that settle.  Sounds like a plan to her.  Then, 
           embarassed--

                                 CLARE
                        About what happened earlier with 
                        Paul, thanks, but I wished... I 
                        wished for him to like me.  

                                 RYAN
                        I’m not judging the fact that you 
                        have a thing for douchebags. 

                                 CLARE
                        He’s not... Well, yeah, he kinda 
                        is.  He didn’t know I was alive 
                        before a few weeks ago.

                                 RYAN
                        Why would you want to be with 
                        someone like that anyway?

           Their eyes meet.  This moment, suspended in time, could 
           possibly develop into a lot more.  

           And they both know it.

                                 RYAN (CONT’D)
                        Come on.  

           They get out.

           INT. SHANNON HOUSE - CLARE’S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

           Together, Ryan and Clare pull away the floorboards and peer 
           down into the hidden space, but...

           THE BOX IS GONE!

           Stunned, Clare just gapes. 

                                 RYAN
                        Where is it?

                                 CLARE
                        I don’t... I don’t know.

           Briefly, they search the room -- under the bed, in the 
           closet, etc... -- but they come up empty.

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        It’s not here.

           She tries to process this.

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        What does that mean?
                                 RYAN
                        It chooses its owner carefully. 
                        Maybe... Maybe it knew we were 
                        coming.  Maybe someone broke in and 
                        stole it.  Maybe it’s done with 
                        you.

                                 CLARE
                        Does that mean that it’s over?

                                 RYAN
                           (thinks)
                        I guess so.

           Relieved, Clare embraces him.

                                 CLARE
                        Now what?

                                 RYAN
                        You move on with your life and I 
                        try to track it down again.  It’ll 
                        turn up.  
                           (grim)
                        It always does. 

                                 CLARE
                        Thank you.

           A moment.  Their eyes meet.  Heat.  He moves in for a kiss, 
           but stops himself.

                                 RYAN
                        I shouldn’t.  It’s not fair.  
                        You’ve had a pretty messed up day. 

                                 CLARE
                        Yeah.

           Another moment.  Their eyes meet again.  This time, there’s 
           no pulling away.  No guilt.  Just a kiss.  Simple.  Sweet.  

           A perfect end to the nightmare.

           EXT. SHANNON HOUSE - A FEW DAYS LATER

           A garbage truck rumbles by.  

           Welcome to Monday.  A new week without The Box has begun.

           INT. SHANNON HOUSE - CLARE’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Dressed for school, Clare stands in front of her mirror.  She  *
           takes a deep breath.  Uncertain of what may come, but ready 
           to face it head on. 
           INT. SHANNON HOUSE - STAIRS - DAY

           Clare heads down and looks around.

                                 CLARE
                        Dad?!

           No answer.  He’s not home.  Odd.  Then--

           SCRIT... SCRIT... SCRIT... Clare jumps as a RAT SKITTERS BY.  

           She watches it go.  What the hell?  

           IT’S THE FIRST SIGN. 

           THINGS ARE GOING BACK TO THE WAY THEY WERE BEFORE SHE GOT THE 
           BOX.

           EXT. UPSCALE NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

           Clare coasts downhill and squints at something ahead of her. 
           Her mouth drops.

           CLARE’S POV -- Her father’s RED TRUCK is parked curbside.  
           And just beyond it, Louis digs through trash bins. 

           Crushed, Clare pulls up beside him.  

           HIS AWFUL HOARDING HABIT HAS RETURNED.

                                 CLARE
                        Dad?  What’re you doing?

                                 LOUIS
                        I said you could stay home for a 
                        few days.  No one expects you to be 
                        at school after what happened.

                                 CLARE
                        What are you doing?!

                                 LOUIS
                           (shrugs)
                        I gotta good feeling.

                                 CLARE
                        But... But I thought we were done 
                        with this!

                                 LOUIS
                        Calm down!  A couple little things 
                        won’t hurt anyone.

           Clare struggles to understand this.  She never sees the CAR 
           filled with Populars creeping up behind them.

                                 CLARE
                        What’s wrong with you?!  Did 
                        something happen?
                                 LOUIS
                        Yeah, something happened.  I lost 
                        my gig.  Kate dumped me.  I--

           And then a massive SODA HURTLES towards them. 

                                 LOUIS (CONT’D)
                        Watch out!

           Too late. 

           The SODA FINDS ITS TARGET AND CLARE IS DRENCHED IN ORANGE 
           CRUSH.  And guess who’s at the wheel?

           It’s DARCIE.

                                 DARCIE
                        That’s right!  I’m back, bitch!

                                 TYLER
                        Fi-yah!  Cute stunt you pulled on 
                        my boy Saturday!  Tires are 
                        expensive, ho!

           Whooping the Populars drive away.  In the backseat, Paul 
           wraps his arm around Beth.  Clearly, they’re back together.

           Shocked, Clare just stands there dripping, trying to fully 
           comprehend this new reality. 

                                 CLARE
                           (sotto)
                        ‘Abandon, lose, or open me and all 
                        will be undone.’

           Shit!

                                 LOUIS
                        Clare?

                                 CLARE
                           (stammers)
                        I’m fine.  It’s fine.  I’m just 
                        gonna go home and change.  I’m 
                        fine.

           But she’s not fine.  

           Not by a long shot.

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY

           Now wearing her dowdy old clothes, Clare cautiously moves 
           through.  

           The Populars pass by - Darcie, Tyler, Paul, and Beth.  They 
           giggle at her.
                                 DARCIE
                        About the soda, sorry not sorry.

                                 PAUL
                        We all thought it was an 
                        improvement.

           Cut, Clare’s struck speechless.

                                 DARCIE
                           (to friends)
                        Look, she’s got nothing clever to 
                        say.  Probably because she lost her 
                        back-up.  

                                 TYLER
                        Traj.  
                           (after a thought)
                        Ish.

                                 DARCIE
                        Darwin just got real.

           Pleased with themselves, Darcie and friends saunter off.

           Clare withers against the onslaught of ridicule.  

           SHE’S A TARGET ONCE AGAIN.

           Students point and giggle at her.  The ORANGE CRUSH INCIDENT 
           plays on every cellphone.

           And Clare crumbles.  After a few weeks of normal, she’s back 
           to being a human punching bag.

           And it’s devastating.

           Then she spots June down the hall near a MEMORIAL FOR 
           MEREDITH cluttered with cards, candles, and stuffed animals.   *
           June glares at her and she realizes--

                                 CLARE
                           (a whisper)
                        It was you.

           She marches over.

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        You stole it, didn’t you?!  

           A hush falls.  Everyone turns to look.

                                 JUNE
                           (hisses)
                        You saw what it did to Meredith! 
                        I’m trying to help you!

                                 CLARE
                        Give it back!  GIVE IT BACK!
           She charges June, but before she makes contact, Ryan wraps an  *
           arm around her middle and pulls her back.

                                 RYAN
                        Clare?!  What the hell is wrong 
                        with you?!

                                 CLARE
                        It was her!  She stole it!  She’s 
                        supposed to be my friend!

                                 JUNE
                        I am your friend!  
                           (pointed)
                        And so was Meredith!

                                 RYAN
                        Clare, calm down!  I thought we 
                        were done with this?!

           Yeah, she thought so, too. Shaking, Clare backs away and 
           hurries off.

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL - GIRL’S BATHROOM - DAY

           Hyperventilating, Clare slams into a stall and slumps on the 
           ground.  She’s crying.  Shaking.  

           In the midst of an epic panic attack.

                                 CLARE
                        I can’t do this.

           She takes deep breaths.

           Bit by bit, she calms.  A new resolve surfaces.  

           SHE HAS TO GET THE MUSIC BOX BACK.

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY

           Newly energized, Clare hurries through.  Ryan intercepts her.

                                 RYAN
                        Where are you going?

                                 CLARE
                        Just leave me alone!

           She runs out of the building.

           EXT. STREET - DAY

           Clouds gather.  A storm is on the way.  

           On her bike, Clare zooms downhill.
           EXT. ACOSTA HOUSE - DAY

           A determined Clare sneaks around to the living room window.

           INT. ACOSTA HOUSE - STAIRWELL - DAY

           Clare runs up.

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL - CLASSROOM - DAY

           Frowning, June notices Clare’s empty seat.  She considers 
           this.  Suddenly alarmed, she raises her hand.

           INT. ACOSTA HOUSE - JUNE’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Clare barges in and begins her search for the Music Box. 

           She picks through June’s closet.

           Underneath her bed.

           Through her dresser drawers.

           And comes up empty.

                                 CLARE
                        Dammit, June!  Where is it?

           She kicks her search into high gear.  

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        Come on!

           She wipes sweat off her forehead and tries to think.  Then 
           she notices--

           A LOOSE PANEL IN THE WALL.

           She races over and moves it aside.

           It’s filled with comforters.  

           She digs through them and pulls out--

           THE BOX!  

           Victorious, Clare tucks it under her arm and goes to the 
           door. 

           INT. ACOSTA HOUSE - STAIRWELL - DAY

           As Clare emerges from the bedroom, she runs right into June.   *
           The two girls face off.
                                 JUNE
                        What is wrong with you?!

                                 CLARE
                        It’s mine.  Get out of my way!

                                 JUNE
                        Clare--

                                 CLARE
                        MOVE!

           June grabs The Box.  At the top of the stairs, she and Clare 
           wrestle viciously over it.  For a moment, it appears that 
           June has the upperhand, but then Clare shoves her.  Hard.  

           AND JUNE GOES TUMBLING BACKWARDS DOWN THE STEPS. 

           She hits the floor with a LOUD CRACK as SEVERAL BONES SNAP.

           Horrified, Clare studies her unmoving friend at the bottom of  *
           the stairwell.  Then--

           Fuck it.  Fully succumbing to The Box’s spell, Clare steps 
           over her and darts out.

           EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - DAY

           Balancing The Box on the handlebars, Clare pedals furiously 
           through the pouring rain.

           INT. ACOSTA HOUSE - ENTRY - DAY

           Ryan enters to find June on the floor.  He quickly checks her  *
           pulse.  She’s still alive.  He pulls out his cellphone.

                                 RYAN
                        June?  You’re gonna be okay.

           He dials 911.

           EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - DAY

           Clare zooms towards home.

           She doesn’t see Ryan’s car gaining behind her.

           INT/EXT. RYAN’S CAR (MOVING) - DAY

           Ryan pulls up beside Clare.

                                 RYAN
                        Clare!
                                 CLARE
                        Go away!

                                 RYAN
                        You can’t keep it!  You know that!  
                        You have to get rid of it!

                                 CLARE
                        I can’t!

                                 RYAN
                        Why not?

                                 CLARE
                        I’m not ready yet!

                                 RYAN
                        You’ll never be ready!  No one’s 
                        ever ready!

                                 CLARE
                        I can figure this out!  I can fix 
                        this!  I need more time.  JUST 
                        LEAVE ME ALONE!

           She SWERVES HARD AND FALLS TO THE GROUND.

           EXT. STREET - DAY

           Aggravated to the point of irrationality, Clare struggles to 
           return The Box to the basket.  Ryan parks behind her and gets 
           out.

                                 RYAN
                        Clare!  Please?!

                                 CLARE
                        No!  I have one more thing I have 
                        to do!  One more thing I need to 
                        do!

                                 RYAN
                        Do you hear yourself right now?  
                        You can’t control it!  It’s 
                        controlling you.

                                 CLARE
                        GO AWAY!  

           Not playing around, she places BOTH HANDS ON THE BOX and 
           GLARES AT HIM.  He freezes.

                                 RYAN
                        What are you doing?

                                 CLARE
                        I have two wishes left!  Go away or 
                        I’ll use one on you, I swear!
           Raising his hands, Ryan backs off.  Clare scoops The Box up 
           and pedals away as fast as she can go.

           INT. SHANNON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Drenched to the bone, Clare enters to find Louis practicing 
           his sax.   He’s invigorated.  Restored.

                                 LOUIS
                        Hey, kiddo.  You were-- 

           He takes a good look at her.  

                                 LOUIS (CONT’D)
                        What the hell happened to you?

                                 CLARE
                        Nothing.  Just... I’m fine.

                                 LOUIS
                        Guess who got his gig back?

           Clare marvels at this.  Damn, The Box works fast.

           WITH THE BOX NEWLY RETURNED TO HER, ALL OF HER FORMER WISHES 
           HAVE BEEN RESTORED.

                                 CLARE
                        Great.  Congratulations.

           And her gaze falls onto--

           THE SHANNON FAMILY PHOTO pre-Jo’s suicide.  

           A moment as Clare takes this in.  She’s ready.  

                                 LOUIS
                        Clare?

                                 CLARE
                        It’s nothing.

           She hurries up the stairs and SLAMS her bedroom door.

           INT. SHANNON HOUSE - CLARE’S BEDROOM - DAY

           An agitated Clare paces around The Box. 

                                 CLARE
                           (sotto)
                        Two wishes left.  Two wishes.  Two 
                        wishes.  I can figure this out.

           Finally, she kneels before The Box and places both hands atop 
           it.  She closes her eyes.

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        For my sixth wish, I wish...
           INT. SHANNON HOUSE - CLARE’S BEDROOM - DAY

           CLOSE ON -- A peacefully sleeping Clare.  

           Someone tries to nudge her awake, but Clare buries her head 
           beneath the pillows.

                                 CLARE
                           (mumbles)
                        No.

                                 FEMALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        Come on, kiddo.  You really want to 
                        sleep your birthday away?

           A beat.  Birthday?  Hunh?  

           Clare peers cautiously out from under her pillow and sees--

           JOHANNA SHANNON seated on her bed.  Lovely.  An easy smile.  

           Clare’s mouth drops.

                                 CLARE
                        MOMMA?!

           She sits up and embraces her.  Holds her close.  Tight.  Like 
           she’ll never let go.  

           She doesn’t want to cry, but dammit, tears come anyway.  

           HER GREATEST WISH HAS JUST COME TRUE.

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        Momma, I missed you so much. 

                                 JOHANNA
                           (bewildered)
                        You missed me?  

                                 CLARE
                        Yeah, I--

                                 VOICES
                        HAPPY BIRTHDAY!

           In the next moment, the TWINS (5), a girl and a boy, never 
           without the other, tumble in like human tornadoes.  They 
           pounce on Clare’s bed.

                                 TWIN 1
                        We got you cake!

                                 TWIN 2
                        And presents!

           Gobsmacked, Clare tries to keep it together.  

           In a world where her mother never died, she has siblings.  
           It’s a delightful and unexpected treat.

           Johanna hustles them out the door.

                                 JOHANNA
                        Quiet!  Out!
                           (then to Clare)
                        Get dressed and come downstairs, 
                        kiddo.  Chop chop.

           She exits with a smile and Clare’s left alone to look around 
           her room.  

           THE DECOR IS NOTICEABLY WARMER.

           FAMILY PHOTOS pepper the walls, interspersed with plenty of 
           SCHOOL PICTURES of CLARE’S FRIENDS.  

           Clare gapes at this.  She has friends?

           She smiles to herself.  She’s never been so happy in her 
           life.  But then she remembers--

           THE BOX.

           She crouches down and pulls up the floorboards, revealing--

           THE BOX

           In its usual hiding place.  As calm an innocuous as ever.

           Clare studies it for a long, long time. 

           INT. SHANNON HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

           Love, light, and laughter.  Clare’s overwhelmed with the 
           perfection of it all.  

           Presents crowd the table.  The Twins amuse themselves by 
           batting around Clare’s birthday balloons. 

           Johanna and Clare flip through one of Clare’s sketchbooks.  
           They land on--

           A SKETCH OF PAUL

                                 JOHANNA
                        Oh, I like this one.  You two have 
                        plans for tonight?

           Before Clare can answer, Louis enters carrying a BIRTHDAY 
           CAKE topped with candles.

                                 LOUIS
                        Here it is!

           AND HE LOOKS GREAT.  Happy.  Easy.  A content family man. 
           Spared a devastating tragedy he never let himself go.
           The twins CHEER.

                                 TWINS
                        Can we sing?

           Johanna takes the cake as he fumbles out his sax.

                                 LOUIS
                        Now, you can sing.

           The Twins belt out Happy Birthday with their father.  

           Clare just basks in the glow of the candles.  The wonder of 
           this life.  Of what could and should have been.

           Finally, the tune ends.

                                 LOUIS (CONT’D)
                        Happy birthday, kiddo.

                                 JOHANNA
                        Make a wish.

           Clare leans in and prepares to blow, but she stops when she 
           hears--

           THE BOX’S TWISTED MELODY.  It’s faint, but ominous.  
           Deliberate. 

           Clare’s face goes ashen.

                                 CLARE
                           (a whisper)
                        No...

               She runs out. 

                                 LOUIS
                           (after her)
                        Clare?!

           INT. SHANNON HOUSE - CLARE’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Clare rips the floorboards aside and drags The Box into the 
           light.  It continues to play its HAUNTING MELODY.

                                 CLARE
                        Stop it!  Stop!  IT’S TOO SOON!

           Above her, THE CEILING FAN WHIPS AROUND.  Then--

           PLOP! A SCREW detaches and falls to the ground, but Clare 
           doesn’t notice.

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        I said, STOP IT!

           A moment later, Louis enters.  
                                 LOUIS
                        Clare, what’s wrong?

                                 CLARE
                        Go away!

           Concerned, Louis closes the door and steps farther into the 
           room -- directly below the ceiling fan.

                                 LOUIS
                        Clare?

                                 CLARE
                           (to herself)
                        It’s happening too soon.  It’s too 
                        soon!  STOP IT!

           PLOP! Another SCREW COMES LOOSE.

           The FAN SAGS on its mount.

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                           (to The Box)
                        Please!  I need more time.  I just 
                        wanted to say good-bye.

           PLOP! Another SCREW FALLS.  The fan drops a precarious inch. 

                                 LOUIS
                        Clare, come on.  You’re scaring 
                        your mother.

           He places a hand on her shoulder.  She turns and--

           -- IN SLOW MOTION --

           PLOP!  The FINAL SCREW FALLS AND ROLLS AWAY.

           Then the FAN PLUMMETS, BLADES WHIRRING, RIGHT BEHIND LOUIS.

           Clare realizes what’s about to happen a milisecond before it 
           does.  She opens her mouth to scream.  But before she can--

           THE CIRCLING BLADES CONNECT WITH LOUIS’ HEAD.

           BLOOD FLIES AND SPLASHES CLARE’S FACE.

           The FAN CRASHES TO THE GROUND.

           LOUIS’ TWITCHING BODY HITS A MERE SECOND LATER.

           AND THE BOX GOES SILENT.

           -- RESUME NORMAL SPEED --

           Stunned and shaking, Clare looks around.  

           There’s BLOOD EVERYWHERE.  ON HER FACE.  HER HANDS.  POOLING 
           BENEATH LOUIS’ BODY.
           For a second, she’s frozen in the nightmarish scene.  Too 
           shocked to even breathe.  Then--

                                 JOHANNA (O.S.)
                        Clare?!  What’s going on up there?  
                        What was that noise?  Clare?

           Footsteps can be heard coming up the steps and Clare snaps 
           back to herself.

                                 CLARE
                        It’s nothing!

                                 JOHANNA (O.S.)
                        What was that crash?  What 
                        happened?

                                 CLARE
                        It’s fine, mom!
                           (to herself)
                        One wish left.

           Trembling and biting back tears, she grabs The Box and places 
           both hands on it.

                                 JOHANNA (O.S.)
                        Clare, honey?

                                 CLARE
                        My last wish is to go back.  Back 
                        to the beginning.  Back to the day 
                        I got you.  I wish to go back.

           The Box trembles.  Furious.

                                 JOHANNA (O.S.)
                        Clare?

           The DOOR KNOB begins to turn.  Johanna’s on the verge of 
           entering.

                                 CLARE
                           (soft)
                        Bye, momma.
                           (to The Box)
                        I WISH TO GO BACK RIGHT NOW!

           There’s A BRIGHT FLASH OF LIGHT AND WE SMASH TO--

           EXT. SHANNON HOUSE - EARLY MORNING

           AND WE’RE BACK TO WHERE WE STARTED.

           Clare’s PINK TRICYCLE, rusted and bleached out, lays on its 
           side in the muddy, OVERGROWN FRONT YARD.  

           A SPREADING SEA OF JUNK spills off the porch and flows toward 
           the street.
           After a moment, Louis limps down the front steps and climbs 
           into his busted out truck.  With effort, he settles in behind 
           the wheel and the engine sputters to life. 

           INT. SHANNON HOUSE - STAIRS - DAY

           WE FOLLOW - MAX up the stairs and into--

           INT. SHANNON HOUSE - CLARE’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Clare sleeps deeply.  MAX pounces on her and she wakes with a 
           start.

                                 CLARE
                           (confused, then)
                        Max?  MAX!

           She embraces him and looks around.  

           HER ROOM HAS BEEN RESTORED.  No blood on the wall and floors.  

           Clare rolls out of bed and checks beneath the floorboards.

           No Music Box.

           Then she looks out the window.  Louis’ truck is gone. 

           She hurriedly grabs her clothes.

           There might still be time to fix everything.  To avert 
           disaster.

           INT. SHANNON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Clare races downstairs.  

           The living room is still a hoarded out nightmare.  But this 
           isn’t half as bad as the alternative.  

           She ignores the dead rat in a trap and exits in a hurry.

           EXT. SHANNON HOUSE - DAY

           Clare hops onto her bike and rips outta there.  

           Next door, MRS. DE LUCA WAVES TO CLARE.  Not dead at all.   

           Relieved, Clare waves back.  

           EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - DAY

           Clare zooms down the street.  She pulls out her cellphone.  
           Clicks MEREDITH’S NUMBER.  A moment, then--
                                 CLARE
                        Meredith?!  Hi!  

                                 MEREDITH (O.S.)
                           (filtered)
                        I’m not awake.  I’m sleeping.  What 
                        do you want?

                                 CLARE
                        Nothing.  Just hi.  It’s good to 
                        hear your voice.

                                 MEREDITH (O.S.)
                           (filtered)
                        Seriously?  Aliens haven’t invaded?  
                        You don’t need a kidney?  Or a 
                        ride?  I’m still sleeping. Bye.

           CLICK.  DIAL TONE.  Typical Meredith. Clare smiles and keeps  *
           pedalling.  Determined to stop her father from ever getting 
           The Music Box.

           EXT. RAILROAD CROSSING - DAY

           Clare charges across.  Cheeks flushed.  Breathing hard.  

           On a mission.

           EXT. UPSCALE NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY

           Clare spots Louis’ truck and just beyond it, she sees her 
           father digging through TRASH CANS and RECYCLE BINS.

           Louis is back to his old self.  Unkempt and pathetic.  But 
           Clare could give a damn.  He’s alive.

                                 CLARE
                        Dad!

           She jumps off her bike and embraces him.  Relieved.

                                 LOUIS
                        What the hell you doin’?

                                 CLARE
                        Nothing.  

           Out of the corner of her eye, Clare catches sight of a CAR 
           FILLED WITH TEENAGE POPULARS approaching.  She tenses and 
           thinks hard. 

           Has does she change everything?  Then--

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        Can I help?

           Louis looks up with surprise.
                                 LOUIS
                        You don’t have to be at school?

                                 CLARE
                        I have time.  

                                 LOUIS
                           (pleased)
                        Toss your bike in the back then.

           He and Clare move around to the side of his truck.  

           Darcie drives by.  Tyler hangs out the shotgun side 
           brandishing his frappucino.

           And Clare confronts them head on.  She spreads her arms wide 
           and gestures to her chest.  The perfect target.

           Right here, assholes.

           Tyler makes a face and slips back inside Darcie’s car.  The 
           thrill is clearly gone.  They pass by without incident.

           Clare throws Paul a cursory glance, but he doesn’t notice her 
           and she’s perfectly fine with that.

           She jumps into the truck.

           EXT. HART ESTATE - DAY

           POLICE LINE DO NOT CROSS TAPE snaps in the wind.  Ryan picks 
           his way through the debris, meticulously searching every 
           charred corner.

           HEADLIGHTS approach as Louis’ truck pulls up to the main 
           gates.  

           Ryan quickly ducks behind a crumbling pillar, grabs a METAL 
           PIPE, and holds it close.  

           EXT. HART ESTATE - OUTSIDE THE MAIN GATES - DAY

           A half dozen DUMPSTERS overflow with BLACKENED ODDS AND ENDS. 

           Clare hops out of the truck with Louis and goes straight to 
           the dumpsters.

                                 CLARE
                        I’ll look over here!

           Louis nods and begins to search through a pile of JUNK 
           beneath a tree.

           Clare goes to the dumpster and peers in.  She digs beneath 
           some news papers and finds--

           THE MUSIC BOX.  
                                     WISH UPON
           For a moment, she’s torn.  TEMPTED.  

           She could keep it, but... She glances into the skeletal 
           remains of the home and sees A SILHOUETTE moving in the 
           darkness.  It’s Ryan. 

           Clare cautiously makes her way over.

           EXT. HART ESTATE - DAY

           Ryan withdraws deeper into the ruins.  Clare approaches.  
           Within moments, just a crumbling pillar separates them.  For 
           a moment, they simply stand there divided by stone, then--

                                 CLARE
                        Ryan Johns?

           Startled, he looks up.  How the hell does she know his name?

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        I know this is gonna sound crazy, 
                        but I know what you’re looking for. 
                        And it’s in that dumpster right 
                        over there.

           She hesitates.  She’d like to say more, but--

                                 LOUIS (O.S.)
                        Clare?  You find anything?

                                 CLARE
                        Yeah!

           She grabs some curtain rods and brings them over to her 
           father.

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                           (to Louis)
                        Whaddaya think?

                                 LOUIS
                        I could do something with these. 

           Thrilled, he takes them and tosses them in the back of his 
           truck.  He pulls Clare’s bike off with a smile. 

                                 LOUIS (CONT’D)
                        You always were my good luck charm.   
                        You should come with me more.

                                 CLARE
                        Maybe I will.  

           She glances back at Ryan who’s still hidden in the shadows.

                                 CLARE (CONT’D)
                        Well, I better get to school.
           She hops onto her bike and he gets into his truck.  He HONKS 
           cheerfully at her as they go their separate ways.

           A moment later, Ryan emerges from his hiding place and goes 
           to the dumpster.  He peers in and sees...

           THE MUSIC BOX.  

           Off Ryan, just taking this in.  A lifelong quest has just 
           come to an end. 

           INT. RYAN’S CAR (MOVING) - DAY

           Ryan drives.  The Box sits in his passengerseat.

           He comes to a STOP SIGN and stops.

           Beside him, Clare pulls up on her bike.  Satisfied, Clare 
           views The Box in Ryan’s passengerseat.

           Mission Accomplished.

           Ryan pulls out.

           Clare watches him go.  Then, suddenly--

           THE BOX OPENS.  A TWISTED MELODY DRIFTS OUT.

           Ryan frowns at this.  Doesn’t know what it means.  And drives 
           on.

           EXT. INTERSECTION - DAY

           Clare smiles to herself.  She did it.  She beat The Box.  She 
           won.

           A bright and brilliant future lays ahead and she’s ready for 
           it.

           She takes a deep breath, pushes off and--

           HONKING.

           BRAKES SQUEAL.

           Clare looks up.

           A MOVING TRUCK SWERVES, NARROWLY AVOIDING HER, but then--

           A COMPACT SLAMS INTO HER.

           CRUSHING HER BETWEEN BOTH CARS.

           It’s fast.

           Painless.
           Fatal.

           Horrible.

           But unlike the other dead owners of The Box, Clare dies with 
           a slight smile on her face.  Her soul is still her own.

           Despite her death, she won.

           She saved her soul.

           INT. RYAN’S CAR (MOVING) - DAY

           Beside Ryan, The Box GOES SILENT.

           PAYMENT FOR CLARE’S FINAL WISH HAS BEEN COLLECTED.

           And we FADE TO...

           EXT. FIELD - EVENING

           CHUCK!  CHUCK!  CHUCK!  Hot and sweaty, Ryan finishes digging  *
           a deep hole.  He prepares to place The Music Box inside and 
           hesitates. 

           He tries again, but the sun winks off The Box.  It’s 
           beautiful.  He’s enthralled.

           He shakes it off and tries for the third time... And stops.  
           He just can’t do it.

           INT. RYAN’S HOUSE - BASEMENT APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Ryan studies The Box sitting on his table.  His expression is 
           grim.  Haunted.  Conflicted.

                                 RYAN
                           (soft)
                        ‘Lay thy hands upon me. 
                        Close thy eyes and wish. 
                        Seven wishes will I grant thee, 
                        If thou remembers this. 

                        Keep me in the darkness, 
                        Hide me from the sun. 
                        Abandon, lose, or open me,
                        And all will be undone.’

           He considers this.  

           Then slowly, hating himself for doing it, but unable to stop, 
           he places his hands on The Box, closes his eyes and--

                                 RYAN (CONT’D)
                        I wish...

           Off this, we... SMASH BLACK.
