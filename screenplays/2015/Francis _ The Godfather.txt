                        I believe in this picture.  

                                                              FADE IN:

           INT. ROBERT EVANS’ OFFICE - DAY

           CU ON PETER BART, a well-dressed film executive in his 
           30s, eyes ablaze with the ecstasy of the pitch.  

                                 BART
                        This picture could make us a fortune.  

           SUPER: “Peter Bart, V.P. Production, Paramount Pictures -- 
           1970”

           As he speaks, the CLOSE ANGLE begins to loosen until over 
           the shoulder of ANOTHER MAN listening.  

                                 BART (CONT’D)
                        It’s not about “groundbreaking cinema.”  
                        Or “saying something.”  Or art.  
                               (reassuringly)
                        It’s not art, Bob.  It’s simply netting a 
                        fuck-ton a’ cash exploiting man’s age-old 
                        lust for blood.  Roman gladiators eight 
                        times a day with buttered popcorn, and 
                        we’re the only Colosseum in town.  Nobody 
                        else can even see it!  Had lunch with 
                        Wells and Calley at Warners, told ‘em we 
                        optioned The Godfather, ya know what they 
                        did?  Those two bastards, they smiled at 
                        me.  Laughed.  I sat behind my corned 
                        beef like a fool.  Then I said to my 
                        analyst, “For revenge, and a green-light, 
                        I gotta see Bob Evans.”  

           REVEAL: The man Bart’s speaking to -- ROBERT EVANS, 40, a 
           gorgeous and powerful man behind a desk, with a voice so 
           silky it makes even blinding rage sound seductive.   

           SUPER: “Robert Evans, Senior V.P. Worldwide Production, 
           Paramount Pictures” 

                                 EVANS
                        Evans likes what you’re spittin’.  He 
                        hears “fuck-ton ‘a cash” and his beard 
                        grows.  Look at the book sales, there’s 
                        no question The Godfather’s got legs; big 
                        hairy, chiseled Italian ones.  But who’s 
                        the man to direct it?  That’s Evans’ 
                        quagmire.  

                                 BART
                        I have a suggestion--

                                 EVANS
                        Please, not another Jew, Peter.  Our 
                        people don’t understand the dagos.

                        Marty Ritt directed The Brotherhood with 
                        Kirk Douglas; it looked like a blind man 
                        conducting a Bris.  The only box office 
                        near that thing was Douglas’s trailer.  I 
                        hear he was bangin’ em’ two at a time.
                               (then)
                        No, this may be just a cheap gangster 
                        pic, but I want the audience to smell the 
                        spaghetti.  WOPs only.  

                                 BART
                        Alright.  How ‘bout Francis Coppola?

                                 EVANS
                               (rubbing his eyes)
                        Ugh, Coppola again. We been through this.

                                 BART
                        I know, Bob.  Hear me out--

                                 EVANS
                               (an idea)
                        Just a minute, “Evans light bulb.”  Let’s 
                        get some exercise.  

           EXT. THE PARAMOUNT LOT - MOMENTS LATER

           Evans and Bart puff cigars as they stroll, Evans sporting 
           giant sunglasses and a fabulous coat over his shoulders.  
           A SECURITY GUARD follows close behind in a golf cart.

           BY-PASSERS acknowledge Evans with bowed heads, as if he 
           were king.  

                                 EVANS
                        You see the reverence?  Evans is the air 
                        they breathe.  

           Bart inadvertently coughs out smoke.  

                                 EVANS (CONT’D)
                        Two years ago, this lot was in the 
                        crapper.  It’d be parking and Thai 
                        handjob joints if not for me.  What I’m 
                        saying is...
                               (stops, removes sunglasses)
                        ...I’m fucking Moses, Peter.  Moses.  I 
                        parted the Red Sea with Rosemary’s Baby 
                        and soon I’ll cross the desert on Love 
                        Story.  The Godfather could be the 
                        promised land.  And you want me to give 
                        it to some fat greaseball who cut his 
                        teeth directing skin flicks.   

                                 BART
                        He’s done five features; all on time and 
                        budget.  

                                 EVANS
                        All shit.  The Rain People?  You’re A Big 
                        Boy Now?  You better fuckin’ believe I 
                        am, kid.

                                 EVANS (CONT'D)
                        Big enough to know a hack when I see one.  
                               (pointing to his head)
                        You want a pearl from Evans’ treasure 
                        trove, here goes -- “A good director is 
                        key to a film’s success.”  
                               (tapping Bart’s forehead)
                        Put it in here, lock it up, don’t let 
                        anyone see it.  

           They walk for a beat, Evans reconsidering.  Then, SIGHING:

                                 EVANS (CONT’D)
                        How many directors have turned us down 
                        now?

                                 BART
                        Twelve.  They’re all booked and/or don’t 
                        want to “glorify the mafia.”  Coppola’s 
                        the only Italian left.  And he needs us a 
                        helluva lot worse than we need him.     

           EXT. AMERICAN ZOETROPE / FOLSOM ST., SAN FRANCISCO - DAY - EST.

           A converted warehouse, currently being emptied by a TEAM 
           of REPOSSESSORS loading expensive furniture into a truck.  

           CLOSE ON: The front door, which was clearly pulled open 
           through a now-ripped “Notice of Default”.   

                                 COPPOLA (PRE-LAP)
                        I am not directing that movie.  I don’t 
                        care if we are broke.  

           INT. AMERICAN ZOETROPE / BULLPEN - CONTINUOUS

           Inside the lavish facility, WORKERS repossess nearly 
           everything not nailed down.  Walking through the madness 
           are FRANCIS FORD COPPOLA (31, hairy, gregarious, on a rant) 
           and GEORGE LUCAS (26, flannel-clad, dry and soft-spoken).

                                 COPPOLA
                        I won’t sell myself to some faceless suit 
                        who thinks Art is the guy who built his 
                        pool-house.  

           He stops at a large wine rack, looks to see if the 
           workers are watching.

                                 COPPOLA (CONT’D)
                        I need vino.  

           He grabs a bottle and begins working a corkscrew.

                                 LUCAS
                               (alarmed)
                        Wait, is that... expensive?

                                 COPPOLA
                        The ‘34.  Twelve hundred bucks I’ve been 
                        saving for a special occasion.
           Two workers pass him hauling off a gorgeous painting.

                                 COPPOLA (CONT’D)
                        The Lichtenstein.  
                               (pops the cork)
                        It’ll have to do.  

           He drinks, then offers it to Lucas.  Lucas blanches and 
           sips from a straw in his bottle of YooHoo.   

           SUPER: “Francis Ford Coppola and George Lucas --            
           San Francisco, California”

                                 LUCAS
                               (re: the wine bottle)
                        Ya know, returning that alone woulda’ 
                        kept Arri off our backs another month.  

           Coppola rolls his eyes and walks away, Lucas following.

                                 COPPOLA
                        Zoetrope isn’t about equipment.  

                                 LUCAS
                        A film studio.  Perish the thought. 

                                 COPPOLA
                        We answer to no one.

                                 LUCAS
                        Except the bank.  

                                 COPPOLA
                        This is an oasis!

                                 LUCAS
                        From responsibility.

                                 COPPOLA
                        From Hollywood!  From the major studios!  
                        Something that’s never been tried before.  
                        A paradise where filmmakers can be 
                        inspired by beautiful art, sipping thirty-
                        five year old chablis as we bring forth 
                        our films, George.  Pure and unfettered.  

                                 LUCAS
                        And how will that work without cameras, 
                        Francis?  

                                 COPPOLA
                               (defensive)
                        You wouldn’t have shot THX but for the 
                        principles this company was founded on.

           Coppola pulls a framed sketch off the wall and smuggles 
           it under his coat.  
                                 LUCAS
                        I won’t have anywhere to edit it if you 
                        don’t meet Bob Evans.  None of our 
                        “unfettered films” have made any money 
                        yet.  You’re half a million in debt.  

           The frame stowed, Coppola takes another long pull off the 
           wine bottle and heads for the front door.  

                                 COPPOLA
                        Have you even read The Godfather?  It’s 
                        sensational, salacious, common smut!  

                                 LUCAS
                        One good crowd pleaser will swing you 
                        outta hock.  

                                 COPPOLA
                               (still ranting)
                        The oldest brother, uh... Sonny, has a 
                        mistress.  Entire chapters are devoted to 
                        how gargantuan her twat is.  

                                 LUCAS
                               (sighs)
                        I worry about your drinking.

                                 COPPOLA
                        It’s in the book!  That’s why they’re so 
                        hot for each other.  He’s hung like a 
                        horse and she could give birth to one.  

           Nearly to the exit, a WORKER steps in front of them, 
           eyeing the frame under Coppola’s coat.  

                                 WORKER
                        Um, sir?  

                                 COPPOLA
                        ... Yes?  

           They stare each other down until:

                                 LUCAS
                        Give him the sketch.  

           Coppola petulantly hands over the frame.  The worker leaves. 

                                 COPPOLA
                        I don’t want to make crap.     

                                 LUCAS
                                (re: the sketch)
                        Francis, today it’s the Warhol.  Tomorrow 
                        it’s the lease.  Then your house. 
                               (pauses)
                        This isn’t an offer you can refuse.  

           Coppola sighs, and takes another swig.
           INT. ROBERT EVANS’ WAITING ROOM - DAY

           Coppola sits, quietly rehearsing what he’ll say to Evans.  

                                 COPPOLA
                        Mr. Evans, I am honored and grateful that 
                        you invited me here... to discuss...
                               (shakes his head, again)
                        Mr. Evans, I am honored and grateful...  

           A SECRETARY watches (creeped out) when the INTERCOM BUZZES.  

                                 EVANS (ON INTERCOM)
                        Send him in.  

           INT. ROBERT EVANS’ OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Evans sits in a leather chair. On a sofa, Peter Bart is 
           beside AL RUDDY (30, tall and dark; but a sweet guy).  A 
           sad wooden chair faces them.  Coppola enters meekly. 

                                 EVANS
                        How ya doin’, fella?

                                 COPPOLA
                        Mr. Evans, hi... I am honored and... 
                        grateful that-- 

                                 EVANS
                        --Super.  Great.  Sit down.

                                 COPPOLA
                        --Okay.  

           Coppola squeezes his large frame into the small chair.  
           They sit silently for a beat, Evans sizing Coppola up.  

                                 EVANS
                        I understand you’re Italian. 

                                 COPPOLA
                        Yes, yes I am... I am indeed--  

                                 EVANS
                        So are the characters in The Godfather.  

                                 COPPOLA
                        Right.  Right--

                                 EVANS
                        You probably have a lot in common.  

                                 COPPOLA
                        Well, Italian immigrants came from all 
                        walks--

                                 EVANS
                        Good, I wanna smell the spaghetti.  And 
                        your little filmmakers’ Xanadu in San 
                        Francisco, your... impregnable celluloid 
                        wet dream, Evans heard it’s in trouble.   
                                 COPPOLA
                        Some cash-flow issues, nothing we can’t--

                                 EVANS
                        Well, you’re in luck, my friend.  This 
                        place was in the crapper when Evans took 
                        over.  Then came a little film called 
                        Rosemary’s Baby, baby.  Maybe you heard 
                        of it.

                                 COPPOLA
                        Sure, I love Polanski.

                                 EVANS
                        That piss-ant Pollock owes it all to me.  
                        So will you.  

           Evans glares, expectantly.  Coppola, eventually:

                                 COPPOLA
                        Thank you.  

                                 EVANS
                        You’re welcome.  
                               (pointing)
                        This is Albert Ruddy, your producer.  
                        He’ll help you make this cheap and broad.  
                        Shake his hand.  

                                 RUDDY
                        Call me Al.  Pleasure to meet you.

                                 COPPOLA
                        Likewise.  Uh...
                               (massaging his temples)
                        Look, no offense, I was hoping I’d get 
                        some input on the producer and crew.

                                 EVANS
                        Of course, you will, Francis.  Of course, 
                        you will.  But with Al, I already saved 
                        you the trouble.  He’s produced five 
                        seasons of Hogan’s Heroes.  Ali and I 
                        watch it in bed.  Dynamite show.   

                                 COPPOLA
                        I’m sure it is, but television’s a very 
                        different medium--

                                 EVANS
                        Why?  ‘cuz it’s a smaller screen?  You 
                        saying Al’s no good?

                                 COPPOLA
                        I don’t know Al.

                                 EVANS
                        You just shook his hand.  Whaddya want 
                        him to jerk off in a cup.  You can run 
                        some tests.  
           Evans, Bart, and Ruddy all LAUGH, Coppola wilting.  

                                 EVANS (CONT’D)
                               (moving on, subject closed)
                        Any thoughts on cast?

                                 COPPOLA
                        Some.  For Michael, I really wanna dig 
                        around Broadway, ya know?  New York.  
                        Someone dark, antiestablishment; a 
                        brooder, not a classic movie star.   

                                 EVANS
                        Evans loves that.  Loves it.  What do you 
                        think of Ryan O’Neal?  

                                 COPPOLA
                        Ryan O’Neal?

                                 EVANS
                        Let me tell you, working with him is its 
                        own Love Story.  He’s terrific.  

                                 COPPOLA
                        Yeah, but as the son of a Sicilian 
                        Kingpin?  
                               (off Evan’s outraged silence)
                        I just mean, he’s a little WASPy.  

                                 RUDDY
                        Actually, I agree with Francis there.  
                               (on Coppola’s relief)
                        I’m thinking Robert Redford. 

           Coppola bites his tongue, not off to a good start with Ruddy.

                                 EVANS
                        Oooh, love Bob.  Love Bob! Strong jaw.  
                        Could crush baseballs with that jaw.
                               (to Coppola)
                        Definitely test ‘em both.  How about the 
                        Don?

                                 COPPOLA
                        Uh... well, the guy has to be bigger than 
                        life; like, the best actor in the world.  
                        So, I say Marlon Brando.  

                                 EVANS
                        Ahh, Brando’s divine.  But will we buy 
                        him as an Italian?

                                 BART
                        We bought him as Mexican in Viva Zapata.

                                 EVANS
                        But playing a Latin is easy.  I did it in 
                        The Sun Also Rises.  You coat your 
                        forehead in Vasoline and hunch.  Much 
                        trickier to get inside an Italian.  
                        Unless, of course, that Italian’s Sophia 
                        Loren and you’re Evans.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 EVANS (CONT'D)
                               (a reminiscent laugh)
                        Like God himself cupping your balls.  
                               (to Coppola)
                        Just a thought, what about George C. 
                        Scott?  He has darker features and he’s 
                        wonderful.  Have you seen Patton?

                                 COPPOLA
                        I wrote Patton.  

                                 EVANS
                        What?  

                                 COPPOLA
                        I wrote Patton.  The screenplay.  

                                 EVANS
                        Ha!  You’re a prankster.  Evans can tell.  

                                 COPPOLA
                        No, I wrote it.  I did.

                                 EVANS
                        I don’t think so, buster.  It was awesome.

                                 RUDDY
                        He did write Patton, Bob.  

           Evans looks to Bart, who nods.

                          EVANS
                                                     COPPOLA
           NO...!!!
                                            I did, I did.  

                                 EVANS
                        Why didn’t Scott tell me?  Fuck him, he’s 
                        on the shit list.  And we’re in great 
                        hands, gentlemen!  This is our man!  
                        C’mon, let’s take the press photo.  
                               (calling outside)
                        Vivian!
                                (back to Coppola)
                        We’re gonna make it hand over fist, kid!

                                 COPPOLA
                        Yeah, it’ll be good though, right?

                                 EVANS
                        Sure.  What’s gooder than green?  

           The secretary shows a PHOTOGRAPHER in.  Evans, Ruddy, and 
           Bart move behind Evans’ desk, in the chaos of posing.  

           ANGLE ON: Coppola, still in the chair, staring ahead, 
           awash in the depression of what he’s just signed on for.  

                                 EVANS (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        C’mon, where’s Francis?  We’re not taking 
                        the picture without Francis.  
           MOMENTS LATER: A FLASH POP washes over the four men; all 
           smiles but for Coppola.  FREEZE FRAME:

           IN THE STANDS, MARIO PUZO (50s, glasses, schlubby yet

                        I got twelve hundred bones on him.  

           REVEAL: Coppola sitting beside him, perturbed as he reads 
           a battered screenplay.

                                 COPPOLA
                        So... Mario, I’m a little put off here.

                        This is your adaptation, but it doesn’t 
                        read like your book.

                        know where you can get a good horse head.
                               (tearing up his stubs)
                        What you were asking?

           Coppola holds up the script as Puzo sits.

                                 PUZO
                        Ruddy told me to start with a sex scene.  
                        He wants The Sundance Kid to play Michael.

                                 COPPOLA
                        And how do you feel about that?

                                 PUZO
                        Rich.  See, I had to let Paramount Jew me 
                        over when I sold the rights ‘cuz I needed 
                        whatever I could get to square some 
                        maniac bookies.  So, I took fifteen over 
                        eighty the film ever got made; fucked 
                        like a snake in a lawnmower.  But with 
                        the script, I held out for a hundred K.  
                        Alls I had to do was set it present day, 
                        in any city but New York.  To make 
                        filming cheaper.  

                                 COPPOLA
                        And you don’t feel like...

                                 PUZO
                        ... Like what?  A sellout?

           Coppola blushes (“Yeah”), then listens with growing horror.  

                                 PUZO (CONT’D)
                        Francis, when I sat down to write The 
                        Godfather I was forty-six years old.  I’d 
                        published three novels straight from the 
                        heart and for those efforts, I had 
                        exactly fourteen hundred dollars to my 
                        name.  Flat broke with five kids.  My 
                        whole goal with that dime-store ass-wipe 
                        was to write whatever’d move more copies 
                        than the fuckin’ Bible, and that’s what I 
                        did.  So, what’d I sell out?  The 
                        Godfather ain’t art.  Neither is this 
                        backlot B-movie you’re shooting.  Sorry, 
                        kid.  It don’t mean shit.   

           Coppola tears his eyes away, looks down at the screenplay.

                                 COPPOLA (PRE-LAP)
                        He did the whole thing for money.  

           INT. COPPOLA RESIDENCE (SAN FRANCISCO) / KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Coppola dries dishes beside his pregnant wife, ELEANOR; 
           30, an understated, granola-type beauty.  She washes.  
                                 COPPOLA
                               (outraged)
                        Three years of his life, four-hundred and 
                        fifty pages, none of which reflect 
                        anything he actually wants to say.

                                 ELEANOR
                        Some people lose themselves in their 
                        obligations.  

           Coppola gestures to the dining room where sons GIO (7) and 
           ROMAN (5) draw with Lucas; all three equally engrossed. 

                                 COPPOLA
                        Think I know how he feels. 

           Eleanor CLANGS a plate sharply, shooting him a look.

                                 ELEANOR
                        You’re scared a man with his talent could 
                        so readily capitulate.  

                                 COPPOLA
                        Yes, and I don’t want to direct a film 
                        with no context; that’s just an olive-oil 
                        shoot-‘em-up.  I’ll become the “goombah” 
                        director.  Italians’ll throw cannoli at 
                        our house, if we get to keep it.

                                 ELEANOR
                        Don’t worry about the house right now.  
                        If you want the film to have an 
                        undertone, pick one.

                        But the author himself admits there’s 
                        nothing under the surface.  

                                 ELEANOR
                        Find something to connect with and 
                        rewrite the script.  Make it your own.

                        What could I possibly connect with--?  

           Eleanor shuts the faucet; frustrated, tired and pregnant.

                                 ELEANOR
                        I don’t know, Francis, figure it out.  
                        Get high or something, okay?  My feet and 
                        my back are killing me, I can’t run in

           EXT. COPPOLA BACKYARD - LATER

           Coppola takes an impossibly long drag off a joint as 
           several NEIGHBORHOOD KIDS run in through a gate to join 
           Gio and Roman in their treehouse across the yard.  

                                 COPPOLA
                               (mid-drag)
                        You boys behave now.  

           Beside him, a disapproving Lucas fans away smoke.  

                                 LUCAS
                        You’re a heck of a role model.

                                 COPPOLA
                               (scoffs)
                        That hurts.  How many cars have you 
                        crashed now?   
                                (then, bitching)
                        And Ruddy, this TV producer they’ve 
                        saddled me with.  Probably wants to set 
                        the film in Mayberry.  

                                 LUCAS
                        Give the guy a chance.

                                 COPPOLA
                        Why should I have to!

                                 LUCAS
                        Bob Crane as The Don.  I’m just sayin’.  

           They watch Gio (the oldest) playacting in a cape and 
           crown, lording over two “guards” holding Roman before him.

                                 GIO
                        Roman, you’re my brother and I love you, 
                        but you took sides against your King.  So 
                        you must die. 

                                 ROMAN
                        I didn’t know, Gio.  I swear I didn’t!

           Gio gives the guard a solemn nod and he raises his wooden 
           sword for the kill, young Roman SCREAMING, truly scared.  

                                 ROMAN (CONT’D)
                        STOP IT!  NO!... DAD!!!

                        Gio!  Let your brother keep his head.     

           Lucas chuckles as Gio begrudgingly orders Roman’s release.   
                                 LUCAS
                        Power hungry, that one.  Where do you 
                        think he gets it?

                                 COPPOLA
                        I don’t want power, George.  Just 
                        control.  Over my life.  My work.

                                 LUCAS
                        Isn’t that how it starts?  I just want to 
                        protect my wife.  My kids.  Please my 
                        shareholders.  Ensure my race flourishes.  
                        I’ll only drop the bomb once.  To stop 
                        the Red Threat.

                                 COPPOLA
                               (playing along)
                        ‘Cuz if my loved ones get any ideas, I’ll 
                        have to kill them too.  

           They both laugh.  

                                 LUCAS
                        It’s the force of the galaxy.  Starts out 
                        making things better.  Ends up making ‘em 
                        worse.  

           Coppola’s eyes narrow, recognizing they’re onto 
           something.  He stands and stubs out the joint.  

                                 COPPOLA
                        Yeah.  I gotta write.  Watch the kids.  

                                 LUCAS
                        I’m not your wet nurse!  

                                 COPPOLA
                        Yeah, you are.  Shut up. 

           Coppola heads for the house, calling back.  

                                 COPPOLA (CONT’D)
                        “Force of the galaxy,” huh?  I think you 
                        got a little contact high there, brother.  

           Lucas’ smile drops.  He takes deep breaths, paranoid.  

           EXT. SFO AIRPORT / RUNWAY - DAY

           A 737 takes off from San Francisco...

           INT. AIRPLANE - DAY - MONTAGE

           Coppola in a window seat; a large binder, Scotch Tape, 
           and a copy of The Godfather on his tray.  Over this... 

           WE HEAR a PRE-LAP phone convo between him and Puzo.
                                 COPPOLA (PRE-LAP)
                        Mario.  Listen, you said your book 
                        doesn’t mean shit.  I know how to change 
                        that and make it art.    

                                 PUZO (PRE-LAP)
                        You do?...  Marone’, I miss being young.

           Coppola pulls chunks of pages out of the book, writes 
           notes on others and tapes them into the binder.  

                                 COPPOLA (PRE-LAP)
                        We strip out all but the immediate 
                        family.  It’s about a father who sought 
                        power to escape the same corruption his 
                        own sons end up proliferating.  It’s this 
                        country.  

           Numbered pages are taped to the plane’s wall, seats, etc., 
           as Coppola scribbles scenes furiously on a legal pad.  

                                 COPPOLA (PRE-LAP) (CONT’D)
                        It’s our ascension; the dream come full 
                        circle.  I mean, we could really hold a 
                        mirror up to the hypocrisy.     

           Coppola startles as the plane TOUCHES DOWN.  He gathers 
           the mess of paper sprawled before him, renewed in purpose.  

           INT. JFK TERMINAL / PUZO’S OFFICE (LA) - DAY - INTERCUT

           THE REST OF THE PHONE CALL -- Coppola on a pay phone in

                        Rip off the blinders and just blow minds.  
                        It could be epic.  
                                (off the silence)
                        Are you there?

                                 PUZO (ON PHONE)
                        Yeah.  I’m just afraid the fans might 
                        miss Lucy Mancini’s giant cleft.

                               (off Puzo’s silence)
                        I know this’ll mean starting from 
                        scratch, but I’d like your help.  

                                 PUZO (ON PHONE)
                        I don’t know, your odds ‘a pullin’ this 
                        off are shit, sport. 
                               (considers, then)
                        But I’ll take the action.   

           Coppola hangs up, satisfied.  REVEAL: Approaching is FRED 
           ROOS; 35, gold cross pendant, flashy dresser, life of the 
           party Moe Green type.

                        You find me a “Michael”?

           They head for the exit, Roos with his arm around Coppola.

                                 FRED ROOS
                        Ho!-- Wait’ll you see the moves on the

           The marquee reads, “Does A Tiger Wear A Necktie?”

           The play in progress as Coppola and Roos squeeze noisily 
           past OTHER PATRONS and sit.

           Opatoshu’s “Dr. Werner”.  NOTE: Pacino is FUCKING AWESOME!   

                                 PACINO (AS BICKHAM)
                        'finally, out of a clear blue sky, he 
                        says, "You wanna see a picture of my wife 
                        and kid?"  I think, maybe he's recognized 
                        me, for Chrissakes.  He pulls out this 
                        picture, see?  You know what it was?  A 
                        picture of some whorey lookin' blonde and 
                        a baby sittin' on her lap.  A baby boy, 
                        only it's a trick shot, see, like you'd 
                        buy on 42nd Street, the photographer has 
                        dubbed in a... a yango about that long!  
                        I don't know what's happenin’!  I think 
                        it's gonna be a picture of me or 
                        somethin’! 
                               (hysterically)
                        I hit him.  I hit him hard.  He goes flat 
                        on his ass.  I get down on top of him, 
                        and I hit him! 
                               (beats the desk)
                        I hit him and I hit him! 
                               (softly)
                        Then, everything's quiet all of a sudden. 
                        I look down at him. I look down at this 
                        barber who's my father.  I look down at 
                        him... and I know just what I been 
                        waitin' for all my life. 

           ANGLE ON: Coppola in the audience, smiling at Roos, like 
           they both just witnessed the Second Coming!   
           EXT. TURTLE POND (CENTRAL PARK, NYC) - LATER THAT NIGHT

           Coppola emerges from the shadows.  He swallows nervously.  
           It’s late and the CHARACTERS around are sketchy.  

           Among them on a nearby bench sits AL PACINO (30, anxious, 
           shaggy-haired and scruffy, dressed like he’s homeless), 
           smoking and drinking from a paper bag.  Coppola approaches.

                                 COPPOLA
                        Al, hello--

                                 PACINO
                               (stands up, startled)
                        Whoa, who the fuck are you? 

                                 COPPOLA
                        It’s Francis Coppola.
                               (Pacino’s still freaked)
                        Fred Roos said you wanted to meet here.  

                                 PACINO
                        Oh yeah, Fred.  Sorry, place gets me 
                        panicky this late.  

                                 COPPOLA
                        Let’s go somewhere else.

           They begin a cautious stroll, side by side.  

                                 PACINO
                        No, I love walking in the park, 
                        especially now.  

           He jumps again when a JOGGER runs out from under a tree.  

                                 PACINO (CONT’D)
                        Every ten yards or so, there’s a little 
                        play in progress.    
                               (points to a bench)
                        I once saw a man lie down on that bench 
                        and die.  

                                 COPPOLA
                        Jesus Christ.

                                 PACINO
                        Yeah, well, he mighta’ been sleeping.
                               (points to some bushes)
                        Back there, this one guy fellated another 
                        in exchange for half a burger.  No 
                        cheese.  It’s not Ibsen, but it’s real, 
                        ya know.  Theater of the human condition.  

                                 COPPOLA
                        So, uh, saw your show tonight.  You were 
                        wonderful.  

                                 PACINO
                        Now I’m getting fellated.  
                                 COPPOLA
                               (chuckles awkwardly)
                        I guess Fred gave you a book earlier this 
                        week.  The Godfather?  Did you read it?  

           Pacino stops and points to a splotch of muddy grass.

                                 PACINO
                        See that mud puddle.  That’s where I was 
                        born.   

                                 COPPOLA
                        No shit?

                                 PACINO
                        Yeah.  
                               (then)
                        Actually, I have no idea.  My mother 
                        never said.  Probably a hospital.  What I 
                        meant was, I’m from the earth.  The 
                        streets.  I grew up in Hell’s Kitchen.  I 
                        got dirt under my nails.  Crotch rash.   
                               (re: his clothes)
                        I look like this.  And the fellow in the 
                        book, Michael, he’s a star.  
                               (re: their surroundings)
                        He’s out of this world, the real world, 
                        very quickly.  And I can’t play that.  
                        I’m not Dean or Peck or Newman or Wayne.  
                        I’m little fish, pig pond.  Ya see?

                                 COPPOLA
                        But you understand the anger of being 
                        trapped here, the allure of rising above.  
                        I don’t want Michael’s ascent to be easy.  
                        I want this world pulling at him, never 
                        letting his feet all the way off the 
                        ground. And that I believe you can play.

           Pacino didn’t expect this.  He starts walking, paranoia 
           getting the best of him.  

                                 PACINO
                        I’m tellin’ you, they won’t want me.  

                                 COPPOLA
                        Al--

                                 PACINO
                        They’ll want a face.  

                                 COPPOLA
                        Don’t you want to do films?

                                 PACINO
                        The right part, sure.  You talk to 
                        Redford yet?  He’s great, and that jaw...

                                 COPPOLA
                        Just come in and test, Al.  

           Coppola takes his shoulders, stopping him. 
                                 COPPOLA (CONT’D)
                        Let me worry what “they” want.  

           Pacino’s aware of the intimacy; two men in the park.

                                 PACINO
                        You’re not gonna offer me half a burger, 
                        are you?

           Coppola smiles, let’s go, and offers his hand.  

                                 COPPOLA
                        Trust?

           Pacino considers then shakes AS WE PRE-LAP THE RHYTHMIC 
           DRUMS OF A NATIVE AMERICAN RAINMAKING RITUAL... 

                                 PACINO
                        You got any ideas on the Don?

                                 COPPOLA
                        Well, as a matter of fact...  

           EXT. HOLLYWOOD HILLS - NIGHT - EST.

           THE DRUMS CONTINUE OVER... the Hollywood sign.

           INT. ROOS’ CADILLAC / EXT. LONG DRIVEWAY - CONTINUOUS

           POV: Inside the car as it pulls off Mulholland and up a 
           long tiki-torch lit driveway, approaching a gate.  

           REVEAL: Coppola and Roos wide-eyed at the strange 
           surroundings as they pull past the security gate.  

                                 FRED ROOS
                        ‘fuck is this?  Lord Of The Flies?     

           EXT. HOLLYWOOD MANSION - MOMENTS LATER

           Roos parks the Cadillac on the edge of a large circular 
           driveway, in the center of which a full-blown Native 
           American rainmaking ritual is underway.  

           Coppola and Roos get out and take in... the ten-foot high 
           BONFIRE, around which dance and leap COUNTLESS PAINTED AND 
           HEAD-DRESSED MEN; hair braided, naked.  

           RABBITS ROAST ON SPITS tended by WOMEN clothed loosely in 
           buffalo hide, some bare-breasted as they nurse BABIES.  
           Others shuck maize, knead tortillas, hang tobacco, etc.  

                                 FRED ROOS
                               (aside to Coppola)
                        Hang onto your scalp.  

           They get too close and are nearly side-swiped by a LARGE 
           MALE DANCING WILDLY, sporting the largest headdress.  
                                 FRED ROOS (CONT’D)
                        Ho, easy, fella!  

           The male stops and approaches, looming.  It’s MARLON 
           BRANDO; 45, shoulder-length blond hair, more than pudgy.  

                                 FRED ROOS (CONT’D)
                        Marlon!

                                 BRANDO
                        No, no.  In this land I am called, “He 
                        With Deep Pockets”.  

           Coppola and Roos just stare, not sure how to react.

                                 BRANDO (CONT’D)
                        That was a joke, boys.  

                                 FRED ROOS
                               (chuckling, re: the dance)
                        Well, Marlon, what the hell are you doing 
                        here?

                                 BRANDO
                        What, this?  California’s in a drought.  
                        I’m taking care of it.  

           EXT. BRANDO’S MANSION - LATER

           The dancing has ceased in favor of feasting.  Roos, 
           Coppola, and Brando sit outside a large teepee, Brando 
           passing around the peace pipe.  Coppola smokes, COUGHS:

                                 COPPOLA
                        Marlon, I just wanna say, I’m in awe of 
                        you.  And I genuinely feel you’re the 
                        only actor who can bring the dignity and 
                        gravitas the Don requires.    

           Brando smokes, pondering for a long beat, then responds 
           IN FLUENT APACHE...  

                                 BRANDO (SUBTITLE)
                        What you speak, it is true.  Father Bear 
                        must be lion-hearted.  But I have 
                        foregone the way of the sacred clown. 

                                 COPPOLA
                        ... I don’t... I don’t speak whatever 
                        that is--

                                 BRANDO
                               (in English)
                        I’m through acting.  I give myself 
                        entirely now to righting the injustices 
                        of these peoples.  

                                 FRED ROOS
                        This part could be your comeback, Marlon.  
                        Think how much righting you could do in 
                        the world if you won another Oscar.  
           Brando shrugs, acknowledging his point.  

                                 BRANDO
                        For guidance, we must pray.  
                               (takes their hands, bows head)
                        Ehecatl, God of Winds, if it be your will 
                        I star in this motion picture, give us a 
                        sign. 

           Silence, as they wait... then SFX: A BIG-ASS WET FART DRAGS 
           OUT for at least five seconds before petering out!  Then:

                                 BRANDO (CONT’D)
                        Ehecatl has spoken.  

           He breaks into childlike LAUGHTER, holding up a whoopee 
           cushion.  Eventually, Coppola and Roos laugh too.    

                                 BRANDO (CONT’D)
                        I like to make jokes! 
                               (more laughing)
                        You should see your faces!  

           He pantomimes Coppola and Roos’ faces, still laughing as 
           a NATIVE AMERICAN approaches: 

                                 NATIVE AMERICAN 
                        Okay, Mr. Brando.  We’re gonna wrap up.

           Brando nods, standing.  The Indians start packing up.

                                 FRED ROOS
                        Just like that?

                                 BRANDO
                        Ten hours.  It’s in their contract.  

                                 COPPOLA
                               (surprised)
                        You’re paying them?

                                 BRANDO
                        They won’t do the song and dance 
                        otherwise.  I mean, what’s the point?
                               (leans in, whispering)
                        And, actually, I’m not paying.  Don’t 
                        have the cash.  They want to be actors, 
                        so I just promised to get ‘em SAG cards.
                               (laughs at his lie)
                        They believe me ‘cuz I’m famous!  

           Brando’s LAUGHTER grows to HYSTERIA as he walks off.  ANGLE 
           ON: Roos and Coppola mesmerized as they watch him exit.

                                 COPPOLA
                        So, was that a “yes”? 

                                 FRED ROOS
                               (shrugging)
                        It wasn’t a “no”. 
           EXT. THE POLO LOUNGE (BEVERLY HILLS HOTEL) - DAY

           Unbridled opulence.  A haven for the WELL-TO-DO and 
           FAMOUS, all of whom are preoccupied with the two biggest 
           swinging dicks in the room:

           Evans finishing lunch with mega-producer DINO DE LAURENTIIS; 
           50, thick Italian accent, small but fierce.  Evans toasts.

                                 EVANS
                        Dino baby, I wanna Cent-anni you on the 
                        recent success of Waterloo.  

           SUPER: “Dino De Laurentiis, Producer -- ‘La Strada’, ‘Ulysses’”

                                 EVANS (CONT’D)
                        Doing bango-boxo in the old country, hmm?  
                        That’s real nice.  Quaint, but nice.   

                                 DE LAURENTIIS
                               (insulted)
                        You know, Evans, in-a Italy Love Story is-
                        a... come se dice... a genre, no a title.  
                        Audience is sophisticated enough to 
                        process story from, eh, content.  And 
                        fucking.  

                                 EVANS
                        So happens this is the love story to end 
                        ‘em all, Didi.  And you wanna talk 
                        sophistication, how ‘bout The Godfather?  
                        Took me six months to read that novel.  
                        Stone sober.  

                                 DE LAURENTIIS
                        Ah, si, The Godfather.  Soon, I forget 
                        the real Cosa Nostra in my street 
                        watching American boys-a with capguns 
                        defending their, eh, Mickey Mouse Club.  
                        And a whore with a fica like-a ‘dis!

           He makes a “giant pussy” gesture with his hands.  Evans 
           blushes, up against the wall.    

                                 EVANS
                        No, we’re cutting the walk-in box, Dino.  
                        We’re going high class all the way.  
                        Marlon Brando’s up for the Don.  

           De Laurentiis begins HOWLING WITH LAUGHTER!  

                                 DE LAURENTIIS
                        Marlon Brando!!!  An Italian?!  No, no, 
                        you’re not serious?  
                               (off Evans’ scowl, laughing)
                        You are!  YOU ARE SERIOUS!!!  Well, my 
                        friend, forget opening the film in Italy.  
                        They’ll laugh him right off-a the screen!  
                               (patronizing him)
                        Oh, Evans, come ti senti?  Are you well?  
                        I worry about-a you!
           (In true Hollywood fashion, the following is exchanged 
           through clenched whitened teeth, smiles plastered on.)   

                                 EVANS
                        Well, Evans doesn’t worry about you, ya 
                        wop bastard.  So have your little laugh, 
                        ‘cuz come the premiere, I’ll have all you 
                        goombah fanooks eating ziti from my hand.  

           De Laurentiis betrays no anger, chuckling through with a grin.

                                 DE LAURENTIIS
                        Fanook, eh?  Rosemary’s Baby can suck-a 
                        my dick. 

                                              DE LAURENTIIS (CONT'D)
                                            Vaffanculo.
                          EVANS
           What’s that, you’ve got a 
           babydick?

           The two keep chuckling as a WAITER sets down their bill.  

                                 WAITER
                        Have a pleasant evening, gentlemen.  

           The waiter leaves and both men scramble for the check, a 
           silent tug-of-war beginning.    

           EXT. PARAMOUNT LOT ENTRANCE / INT. EVANS’ JAG - DAY

           A THRONG of CHANTING PROTESTERS with signs reading 
           “Italians for Italian Roles” clogs the busy security gate.  

           Evans turns in from the street and guides his Jaguar 
           coupe through the crowd, being parted by SECURITY.  

                                 EVANS
                               (sotto)
                        What’s this, a pizza-making convention?   

           He rolls down his window and yells at the BOOTH GUARD.

                                 EVANS (CONT’D)
                        Open the goddamn gate.  Get off your ass!

           The gate opens and Evans guns the car into the lot. 

           INT. SCREENING ROOM - LATER

           Evans sits in darkness, the screen reflection alone 
           illuminating his stern face. 

           ON-SCREEN: An A.C. slates Pacino for his screen test. 

                                 A.C. (O.S.)
                        Screen test.  Al Pacino for Michael 
                        Corleone.  Marker.  

           ON-SCREEN: The CAMERA sets, pulling back briefly to 
           reveal Pacino standing in all his glory at 5’5’’.  
                                 EVANS
                        Who’s this runt?

           Behind Evans, Coppola bristles, Roos and Ruddy sitting 
           beside him.   

           ON-SCREEN: CLOSE ON Pacino sitting at a small table, 
           playing the Michael/Kay wedding scene.  Pale and gaunt, 
           bags under his eyes and his hair wild despite having been 
           combed, Pacino certainly isn’t Ryan O’Neal! 

                                 PACINO (AS MICHAEL)
                        Now Johnny is my father’s godson.  And my 
                        father went to see this bandleader...

                                 EVANS
                                (to Coppola)
                        What’s with the hair?  And he’s pale 
                        enough to be a goddamn taint, ‘cept for  
                        the bags under his eyes.  He looks like a 
                        fucking junkie!  

                                 COPPOLA
                        New York actors go for that style.  A 
                        little hair, a little wardrobe and--

                                 EVANS
                        He’ll look like a fucking junkie taint in 
                        church.  

                                 PACINO (AS MICHAEL)
                        ... So, the next day, he signed a release 
                        for a certified check of one thousand 
                        dollars--

                                 EVANS
                        I’ve seen snuff films where the corpse 
                        had more marquee appeal.  Enough.  

           He waves his hands, standing.  The LIGHTS COME UP.  

                                 EVANS (CONT’D)
                        What’s your problem, Francis?  I suggest 
                        Ryan O’Neal, you bring me the tossing 
                        dwarf from some Kabuki freakshow.   

           Evans heads for the exit.

           INT. FOYER OUTSIDE SCREENING ROOMS - MOMENTS LATER

           Coppola, Roos, and Ruddy chase after Evans, already 
           halfway across the foyer.   

                                 COPPOLA
                        Bob, if you’d actually watched Pacino--

                                 EVANS
                        Don’t show me that popcorn fart again.  I 
                        wanna see O’Neal.   
                                 RUDDY
                        Don’t forget about Redford.

           Coppola stares daggers at Ruddy.

                                 EVANS
                        Right!  The Jaw.  Him too--  

                                 COPPOLA
                        If you’d watched, you’d see Pacino’s eyes 
                        have the chilling intensity Michael needs.

                                 EVANS
                        “Chilling intensity?”  Have O’Neal drown 
                        his balls in ice water before you call 
                        “Action”.  This film needs a star.

                                 COPPOLA
                        We’ll have one.  Brando’s interested.  

                                 EVANS
                        Brando?  Not a snowball’s chance in hell.  
                        The man can’t open a picture in Italy! 

           Coppola and Roos exchange confused looks.

                                 EVANS (CONT’D)
                        He’s been box office poison for years and 
                        I hear he’s completely off the 
                        reservation.

                                 RUDDY
                        You have no idea!  
                                (to Roos)
                        Tell him about the rain dance.  

                                 FRED ROOS
                               (ignoring him, to Evans)
                        But you said Brando’s great.

           Evans stops, stepping up to Roos.  

                                 EVANS
                        I said he’s divine, and who the fuck are 
                        you to question Evans changing his mind 
                        after foie gras at the Polo Lounge?

           Evans moves again, out the door.  Coppola to the others:

                                 COPPOLA
                        Stay here.  Both of you.  

           EXT. THE PARAMOUNT LOT - DAY - CONTINUOUS

           Coppola finds Evans lighting a cigar, looking at the 
           CROWD OF PROTESTERS clogging the Paramount entrance, 
           still CHANTING “Italians for Italian roles!”   
                                 COPPOLA
                        Certain actors reflect a certain time and 
                        place, Bob.  The picture should embody 
                        New York City, just after the war.  That 
                        economy birthed these family dynasties, 
                        precursors to the corporations ruling us 
                        today.  That era and its people are the 
                        groundwork for the film’s commentary.  

           Evans exhales smoke, laughing.  

                                 EVANS
                        So, just like that, you wanna film in New 
                        York.  With New York actors no less.

                                 COPPOLA
                        Mise-en-scene and casting make or break 
                        any film.  You have to know that.   

           Evans chuckles some more, then gestures to the protesters.

                                 EVANS
                        What do ya make of this little charade?

                                 COPPOLA
                        It’s not about hiring Italians?

                                 EVANS
                        Oh, sure it is.  But that’s foreplay.   
                               (off Coppola’s confusion)
                        The Italian-American Civil Rights League.  
                        “Guineas for a greasier tomorrow.”  
                        They’ve vowed to do anything to disrupt 
                        this production and us “smearing their 
                        heritage.”  This is only the latest 
                        stunt.  Guess where they’re based.    

                                 COPPOLA
                               (his face dropping)
                        New York City.  

                                 EVANS
                        Which means you got a better chance 
                        shootin’ a load in the Queen of England 
                        than you do in that city.  
                               (a slow burn)
                        And what sheik’s giving you the cash to 
                        set this in the ‘40s, cuz Evans sure 
                        isn’t.  I’m making a lean, mean gangster 
                        pic.  A blockbuster.  
                                (brandishing his cigar)
                        And it will have blockbuster faces in it.  
                        Commentary or no.  It’s not personal.  
                        This is a business.  Enterprise.

           He drops the cigar on Coppola’s shoe.

                                 EVANS (CONT’D)
                        Oscar Mayer, not Oscar gold!   

           Evans hops onto a waiting golf cart driven by an ASSISTANT. 
                                 EVANS (CONT’D)
                        Go. 

           The kid floors it, steering left to avoid PEDESTRIANS.  
           Evans scolds him:

                                 EVANS (CONT’D)
                        No!  Let them move.  

           Pedestrians dive out of the cart’s way as Coppola seethes.   

           INT. COPPOLA RESIDENCE / DINING ROOM - DAY

           Coppola sits.  Lucas sets the table, silverware in hand.   

                                 COPPOLA
                        I find a way to reconcile this pulp novel 
                        with my own creative benchmark, plus his 
                        desire for authenticity and he won’t give 
                        me what I need.  I’m gonna quit!   

                                 LUCAS
                        You can’t quit.  What about your family?     

           He gestures to the kitchen where Eleanor, the kids, 
           COPPOLA’S PARENTS and OTHER FAMILY work on a large meal.   

                                 LUCAS (CONT’D)
                        And the company?

                                 COPPOLA
                        We’ll do some educational films, maybe a 
                        few commercials.  Hang in ‘til THX hits.  

           Lucas takes an unsteady breath, pacing nervously:

                                 LUCAS
                        I don’t think THX is gonna do that kind 
                        of business, Francis.  I showed Warners 
                        the rough cut yesterday.

                                 COPPOLA
                        And?...
                               (off Lucas’ face)
                        They hated it.  

                                 LUCAS
                        They practically threw feces at the 
                        screen.  They’re still gonna release, but 
                        they won’t spend a penny to market it.  

                                 COPPOLA
                        Great.  

                                 LUCAS
                        That’s not all.  They’re calling in the 
                        Zoetrope loan.  Immediately.  That’s 
                        another six hundred grand.  

           This sinks in, Coppola slumping, then snapping:
                                 COPPOLA
                        Were you gonna tell me about this?!

                                 LUCAS
                        You were meeting Evans.  I thought the 
                        fourth horseman could wait.  I’m sorry 
                        about THX.  

                      LUCAS (CONT’D)
                                                     COPPOLA
           I’ll get in the edit bay 
           and start cutting--  
                                            It’s fine.  Ju-ju-just, 
                                            George!... Shut up and set 
                                            the table.  
           Lucas does so as Coppola stews. 

           INT. COPPOLA RESIDENCE / FOYER - LATER

           The DOORBELL RINGS and Lucas lets in Ruddy and Roos.  
           Ruddy is loaded down with several briefcases.  

                                 LUCAS
                        Hey.  You made it.  Come in.
                               (re: Ruddy’s briefcases)
                        Need some help?

                                 RUDDY
                        Sure, thanks.  I brought all my research 
                        on this Italian League for later.

                                 FRED ROOS
                        How you doin’, Georgie?  

                                 LUCAS
                        Oh, pretty good.  For a man who was just 
                        fed his own genitals.  

           They head in.  

           INT. COPPOLA RESIDENCE / DINING ROOM - LATER

           Coppola sits brooding in the same position we last saw 
           him in, untouched food before him as HIS GUESTS AND 
           ENTIRE FAMILY eat merrily, kids running everywhere! 

           CONVERSATIONS: RUDDY AND ITALIA COPPOLA (FRANCIS’ MOTHER):

                                 ITALIA COPPOLA
                        Are you looking forward to Christmas?

                                 RUDDY
                        Oh, I’m not very religious, ma’am.

                                 ITALIA COPPOLA
                               (gasps)
                        But you’re so handsome.  

           LUCAS AND AUGUST COPPOLA (FRANCIS’ BROTHER):

                                 LUCAS
                               (explaining)
                        ...no, no; it’s a sword made of light. 
                                 AUGUST COPPOLA
                        Get outta here!  

           ELEANOR AND HER SONS:

                                 ELEANOR
                        ...Boys, eat that broccoli.

                                 GIO
                        No, I don’t like it.

                                 ELEANOR
                        You wanna turn eight?  Eat it.  

           FRED ROOS AND ACTRESS TALIA SHIRE (FRANCIS’ SISTER):

                                 TALIA
                        ... and I can relate to Connie having 
                        grown up with domineering brothers.  

                                 FRED ROOS
                        You’ll do great, Tally.   

                                 TALIA
                        Well, I got a new headshot--

           Coppola seizes on this:  

                                 COPPOLA
                        What?  Wha-- What about Connie?

           The table’s instantly quiet; it’s the first he’s spoken.

                                 FRED ROOS
                        I invited Tally to audition for us.  I 
                        saw her in that play last month, she was 
                        outstanding. 

                                 COPPOLA
                        I swear to Christ, everything and 
                        everyone is working against me.  I’m all 
                        alone, dripping in doom here.  

                                 ELEANOR
                        It’s just an audition.

                                 COPPOLA
                        So suddenly you’re an expert?

                                 TALIA
                        Don’t take it out on her.  That’s not--

                                 ITALIA COPPOLA
                        Talia, sweetheart.  Don’t interfere.  

                                 COPPOLA
                        Evans finds out I got my kid sister 
                        auditioning, he’ll shit down my throat.  
                      ITALIA COPPOLA
           Oh, such lovely language 
           for your family.  
                                                  CARMINE COPPOLA
                                            Francis, we’re eatin’ gravy 
                                            here!

                                 COPPOLA (CONT’D)
                        He already loathes all my casting 
                        choices.  Nepotism’ll really help my 
                        credibility, Tal! 

           He stands abruptly and storms out.  Still wrapped in their 
           earlier conversation, an oblivious August turns to Lucas.  

                                 AUGUST COPPOLA
                        You mean like a laser?  

           EXT. COPPOLA BACKYARD - MOMENTS LATER

           Coppola pouts at a patio table.  Ruddy and Roos approach.

                                 COPPOLA
                        Tally’s too beautiful to play the Don’s 
                        daughter.  The groom wants to be a 
                        Corleone and the price is marrying this 
                        beast of a woman.  That’s how I saw it. 

                                 FRED ROOS
                        Georgie told us what happened with 
                        Warners.  How can we help?

                                 COPPOLA
                        I’ll never convince Evans to make the 
                        film I want without getting into New 
                        York.  I won’t get the atmosphere.  I 
                        won’t get the actors.

                                 RUDDY
                        ‘kay.  I have my notes on the League 
                        right here.  

           Ruddy and Roos sit, Ruddy opening his briefcase. 

           This continued conversation is INTERCUT WITH: 

           EXT. GULF & WESTERN BUILDING (NEW YORK CITY) - DAY - EST.

           WIDE SHOT: A dark Buick pulls up to the spectacular 
           skyscraper.  THREE MEN in suits emerge and head inside. 

           INT. GULF & WESTERN STAIRWELL - MOMENTS LATER

           WE HEAR FOOTSTEPS before JOE COLUMBO SR. (50s, nice suit,  
           not ostentatious) comes into view and begins up the stairs, 
           followed by his aid, GIANNI RUSSO, 27 (more on Gianni later).  

                                 RUDDY (V.O.)
                        Now, the Italian-American Civil Rights 
                        League was formed by Joseph Columbo after 
                        his son, Joe Junior, was arrested for 
                        melting silver coins into bars he tried 
                        to sell back to the U.S. Mint.  
           ANGLE ON: Also heaving himself up the steps is JOE JR., a 
           brain-dead mouth-breather if ever there was one!    

                                 RUDDY (V.O.)
                        Joe Senior felt his family was being 
                        unfairly targeted because of their 
                        ethnicity...

           INT. GULF & WESTERN CONFERENCE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Joe Sr. and his entourage enter and cross to Ruddy, 
           standing beside a small bar. 

                                 RUDDY (V.O.)
                        ... so the League’s stated aim is to 
                        combat harmful pejorative stereotypes.  

           Ruddy shakes Joe Sr’s hand.  

                                 RUDDY
                        It’s an honor, sir.  Care for a drink?

                                 JOE SR. 
                               (frowning)
                        Why?  ‘Cuz I’m Italian?  

           SUPER: “Joe Columbo, Boss of the Columbo Crime Family, 
           New York City”

           EXT. COPPOLA BACKYARD - AS BEFORE

                                 RUDDY
                        Basically, the League’s a smokescreen for 
                        his crimes -- extortion, gambling, fraud.  
                        His members are mostly good people, 
                        but he’s a crook.  Probably a murderer.  
                        They’ll be some hoops, my friend.  

                                 COPPOLA
                                (gruff)
                        I shouldn’t have to jump through any of 
                        ‘em.  That’s your job.  

           Coppola locks eyes with Eleanor through the kitchen window.  
           He smiles, but gets only a pissed-off stare in return.

                                 COPPOLA (CONT’D)
                               (discouraged by Eleanor)
                        I don’t care what it takes.  A crook and 
                        a murderer?  
                               (nods at Ruddy)
                        Go do business with him, Al.  

           INT. GULF & WESTERN CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Ruddy swallows anxiously, now seated with Joe Sr., et al.  

                                 RUDDY
                        Mr. Columbo, our director Francis Coppola 
                        is a third generation Italian-American.

                                 RUDDY (CONT'D)
                        He’s not about to besmirch his own 
                        people.  The script he’s crafting has the 
                        singular goal of showing how the American 
                        dream was corrupted by moral ambiguity 
                        and crime amongst all cultures in 1940s 
                        New York.  Not just the Italians.  We 
                        have an unscrupulous Jewish film 
                        producer, a crooked Irish police captain--

                                 JOE SR.
                               (cutting Ruddy off)
                        There ya go, make it about the Paddys.  

                                 RUDDY
                        ... I’m sorry?  

                                 JOE SR.
                        If it’s about universal corruption, base 
                        it on the Irish gangs.  

           Ruddy is caught; Columbo has a point!

                                 JOE SR. (CONT’D)
                        Or the Russians.  Nobody cares a lick 
                        about them.  Especially not now.  

                                 RUDDY
                        Mr. Columbo--

                        The Japs are startin’ something too.  
                        Uh...
                               (struggles for the name)
                        ... the Isuzu.

                                 GIANNI RUSSO
                        --The Yakuza.  

                                 JOE SR.
                        --The Ikuzu.  Drag their shame out.  You 
                        can film anywhere in town you like.  I’ll 
                        even get ya a rate on rice.  

                                 RUDDY
                        Sir, we can’t change the foundation of 
                        the book without sacrificing the 
                        characters.

                                 JOE SR.
                        Ah, so it is about Italians.    

                                 RUDDY
                        It’s about the mafia.

                                 JOE SR.
                        ‘Scuse me?  There is no mafia.  

                                 JOE JR.
                               (seething)
                        We oughta’ break his fucking legs.  
                                 JOE SR.
                        --Junior!  

           Junior blushes under his father’s withering glare.  
           Gianni Russo shakes his head.  Ruddy is terrified.  

                                 JOE SR. (CONT’D)
                               (to Ruddy)
                        My children talk when they should listen.  
                               (then)
                        But, anyway, Mr. Ruddy, our position is 
                        unwavering.  So long as your film 
                        “propagraces” the myth of this imaginary 
                        organization, we’ll stand against it. 

           Joe Sr. gestures to Gianni Russo -- “We’re leaving”.  
           Ruddy scrambles, pulling documents from his briefcase.  

                                 RUDDY
                        Wait, sir, let’s compromise.  I have a 
                        list of fiscal incentives the production 
                        can offer your constituents--   

                                 JOE SR.
                        “Constituents?”  

           He CHUCKLES, then spots and brushes some lint off Ruddy’s 
           pants before standing.  Russo stands too.  

                                 JOE SR. (CONT’D)
                        Nobody voted me in, Mr. Ruddy.  I’m just 
                        a man with powerful friends.  Try to film 
                        in this town and you’ll find out.  I 
                        don’t have to compromise.   
                                (then, to Joe Jr.)
                        Junior, make it quick.  

           Joe Jr. stands, rounds the table fast, coming up to Ruddy 
           fast, his hand in his suit like he has a gun!  Then, he 
           pulls out... a screenplay, tossing it on the table.  

                                 JOE JR.
                               (to Ruddy)
                        I been banging this Underwood past couple 
                        months, here’s what I come with.  It’s 
                        Seven Samurai meets West Side Story.  I 
                        got Ann-Margret’s tits hangin’ out 
                        through the whole fucking thing.    

           He winks and heads for the door before turning back:

                                 JOE JR. (CONT’D)
                        Oh, and I’m with William Morris.  

           ON Ruddy’s face AS WE:

                                                               CUT TO:

           EXT. PARAMOUNT LOT - DAY - EST.

           Back in LA, business as usual...
                                 COPPOLA (PRE-LAP)
                        He brushed lint off your suit?  

           INT. CASTING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Ruddy faces Coppola and Roos, having just recounted the scene.  

                                 RUDDY
                               (nodding)
                        Readying my body for the wake, I suppose.  
                               (then)
                        Guess Evans was right about New York.

                                 FRED ROOS
                        If I know Bob, I’m sure he’ll be gracious 
                        about it.  

           Ruddy chuckles.  Not Coppola.  He snaps at Ruddy:

                                 COPPOLA
                        Don’t admit a goddamn thing to Bob.  As 
                        far as he knows, you smoothed it over.  
                        Start building the sets in Manhasset.  

           Ruddy looks askance at Roos -- “Is he crazy?” 

                                 RUDDY
                        Columbo controls the entire state.  

                                 COPPOLA
                        Then pull a rabbit out of your hat.  I 
                        wanna film in New York.  That should end 
                        any debate.   

                                 RUDDY
                                (quietly)
                        I’d rather not lie to Bob, Franc--

                                 COPPOLA
                        Of course not!  He’s the money.  
                               (sneering)
                        You’ve shown real mettle today, Al.

           Ouch.  Silence as Ruddy recovers from the lashing.  

                                 RUDDY
                        Okay, Francis.  We’ll start building.  
                        I’ll take another run at Columbo.  

                                 COPPOLA
                        Fine.  
                               (a pseudo-apology)
                        I just want to hear more good news.   

           There’s a KNOCK and Ruddy’s secretary, BETTYE McCARTT  
           (30s, cute -- yes, that’s how she spells her name) enters.  

                                 RUDDY
                        Yeah, Bettye.  
                                 BETTYE
                        Ryan O’Neal is here to read.  

           Ruddy and Roos look away as Coppola huffs.   

           INT. CASTING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           CU ON: RYAN O’NEAL doing his pining-after-dead-girlfriend 
           lovesick face; PAUSING OVER-DRAMATICALLY THROUGHOUT.

                                 RYAN O’NEAL (AS MICHAEL)
                        My father... (PAUSE) made him an offer... 
                        (PAUSE) he couldn’t refuse.

           A 16mm camera films him and DIANE KEATON playing the 
           Michael/Kay wedding scene.  Coppola, Ruddy and Roos watch.

                                 DIANE KEATON (AS KAY)
                        What was that?

                                 RYAN O’NEAL (AS MICHAEL)
                        Luca Brasi... (PAUSE) held a gun to his 
                        head... (PAUSE) and my father assured 
                        him... (PAUSE)

           ANGLE ON: Coppola, trying to mask horror at the abomination.  

                                 RYAN O’NEAL (AS MICHAEL) (CONT’D)
                        ... that either his brains... (PAUSE) or 
                        his signature... (PAUSE) would be on the 
                        contract... (LONG PAUSE)

           Thinking O’Neal’s finished, Roos reaches to shut off the 
           camera when:

                                 RYAN O’NEAL (AS MICHAEL) (CONT’D)
                        That’s my family, Kay... (PAUSE) It’s not 
                        me.

           Coppola, Ruddy, and Roos lean forward, hanging on O’Neal, 
           unsure if he’s done!  At last, he smiles and they CLAP.

                        COPPOLA
           That’s great, Ryan.  You 
           really did something there.  
           Thank you.  
                                                    FRED ROOS
                                            Wow!  I got chills.  I mean 
                                            chills.  You’re the real 
                                            deal, young man.

                                 RYAN O’NEAL (CONT’D)
                        I’m so glad you liked it.  I prepared 
                        more if--

                                                    FRED ROOS
                        COPPOLA
           Oh, no, no, no.  I’ve seen 
           all I need.  I couldn’t ask 
           anymore of your time.  
                                            No, no!  Not without 
                                            writing you a check with 
                                            alotta zeroes on it.  We’re 
                                            good.

                                 RYAN O’NEAL (CONT’D)
                        Alright, well, thanks fellas.  I’ll see 
                        you at the premiere?
                                 FRED ROOS
                        Love Story, only two more weeks.  We’ll 
                        be there.  

                                 RYAN O’NEAL
                        O-kay. 
                               (extending his hand)
                        Lovely to meet you Diane.   

                                 DIANE KEATON
                        You as well.  

           She reaches to shake, but is holding the script sides in 
           her hand.  Laughing at herself, she drops the sides.  
           They both bend to retrieve them, smacking heads.  O’Neal 
           laughs, looking away just as Diane bends again, this time 
           head-butting his crotch!

                                 DIANE KEATON (CONT’D)
                        Oh God! I-- I’m sorry.

                                 RYAN O’NEAL
                        It’s okay.  I wasn’t using them--

           Diane is her usual Annie Hall frenzied apologetic mess as 
           O’Neal holds the door for her; a belt loop on her flowing 
           trousers catching the doorknob, yanking her back.  

                                 DIANE KEATON
                        Oooh!  Sorry!  

           At last they’re out and Fred Roos closes the door, 
           shooting Coppola and Ruddy a look.   

                                 FRED ROOS
                        ‘least we won’t have to worry about him 
                        once Bob sees this footage.  

                                                           SLAM CUT TO:

           INT. FOYER OUTSIDE SCREENING ROOMS - DAY

           Evans bursts through a door labelled “Screening Room 4” 
           into the foyer, an ecstatic snap in his step.

                                 EVANS
                        Sen-sational!  O’Neal kills it again!

           Behind him, Coppola, Ruddy, and Roos exit in defeat.  

                                 EVANS (CONT’D)
                        You boys are on an upswing.  First New 
                        York and now this kid.  I’m telling ya, 
                        he’s the find of the century!  
                               (to Coppola)
                        Do you love him?
                               (before he can respond)
                        ‘course, you love him.  Evans is gonna 
                        send him a Jag.  Hardtop, not a 
                        convertible.  We can’t risk losing that 
                        gorgeous sun-kissed cash-cow head!  
           He notices the three of them looking down.

                                 EVANS (CONT’D)
                        What’s wrong?  
                               (then, realizing)
                        You don’t love him. 

                                 COPPOLA
                        He’s not a fighter, Bob.  He’s not 
                        internal, he’s a pretty boy--

                                 EVANS
                        A good pretty boy’ll bring this town to 
                        its knees.  They’re our bread and butter.  
                        I’m not having this argument with you 
                        again, Francis. 

           Evans heads for the exit, calling back:  

                                 EVANS (CONT’D)
                        O’Neal’ll put more asses in seats than 
                        fucking polio.  That’s what counts.  

           Evans pushes open the door, leaving Coppola to brood.     

           INT. BARBERSHOP - DAY

           Al Pacino sits uncomfortably in a barber’s chair as a 
           TEAM OF BARBERS/BEAUTICIANS prep him for the works.    

           REVEAL: Coppola and Roos watching from nearby.  

                                 FRED ROOS
                        I think you’re reaching here, Francie.

           The barber begins cutting Pacino’s hair.  Pacino winces!  

                                 COPPOLA
                        Why?  If Evans sees a pretty actor who 
                        can actually act, maybe he’ll choose him.  
                               (off Roos’ skeptical look)
                        It’s worth a shot.  Al’s good-looking 
                        under all that hair.    

           Another barber uses a straight razor to hack at Pacino’s 
           sideburns.  He GASPS!   

                                 PACINO
                        Ooh, ooh, I don’t think I like that.  
                               (yelling to Coppola)
                        I told you they wouldn’t want me.  This 
                        won’t change a thing.  A star will not be 
                        born! 

                                 COPPOLA
                        Remember you said you trust me?  Now grit 
                        your teeth.

           An esthetician begins plucking Pacino’s unibrow as the 
           barber continues, hair pouring onto the floor.    
                                 PACINO
                        I feel very vulnerable right now.  This 
                        isn’t me. 

                                 COPPOLA
                        You’re an actor, Al.  There is no you.  
                        Michael is a dashing college kid.  

           Pacino CRIES OUT, his face engulfed by beautifying hands. 

                                 FRED ROOS
                               (to Coppola)
                        I’m just saying maybe we shouldn’t 
                        provoke Evans.  He already gave us Diane 
                        Keaton, Duvall for Hagen, John Cazale as 
                        Fredo.  All our first picks.  Why push 
                        him any further?  

                                 COPPOLA
                        Because, as ridiculous as it is, we have 
                        to fight for the actors we want.  All of 
                        them.  I haven’t given up on Brando yet 
                        either.    

           Coppola notices Roos squirm a bit.

                                 COPPOLA (CONT’D)
                        What?

                                 FRED ROOS
                        Bob sent me a memo this morning-- 

                                 COPPOLA
                        Direct to you?  He bypassed me?!  

                                 FRED ROOS
                        Except for Michael, he now only wants us 
                        considering Italians for the Corleones.    

                                 COPPOLA
                        Why?  I had Ruddy tell him the League was 
                        under control.  

                                 FRED ROOS
                        Doesn’t matter.  He wants an 
                        international cast.  For the Don, he’s 
                        talking Ernest Borgnine, Richard Conte, 
                        Frankie Valli, even Sinatra. 

                                 COPPOLA
                        Wha--  Jesus Christ, Ole’ Blue Eyes?!  
                        Maybe he can tap dance with Bing at 
                        Connie’s wedding.  Think of the ticket 
                        sales then! 
                               (then)
                        All Italians means we can’t run Jimmy 
                        Caan for Sonny.  Caan’s a Jew.

           Roos gestures toward Pacino, leaning in.  Hushed:
                                 FRED ROOS
                        That’s my point, Francis.  We got a lot 
                        of other battles left to fight.  Like it 
                        or not, the buck stops with Evans.  

           ANGLE ON: A jaded Coppola looks away, noticing... 

           RACK FOCUS TO: A floor to ceiling length barber pole on 
           the wall.  Coppola’s eyes follow the red and blue lines 
           spinning upward, all the way to the top.   

                                 COPPOLA
                        ... No, it doesn’t.  

                                 FRED ROOS
                        Huh?

           Coppola moves for the exit with purpose.  

                                 COPPOLA
                        The buck doesn’t stop with Evans.  

                                 FRED ROOS
                        What are you talkin’ about--?

                                 COPPOLA
                        I’ll take care of it.   

           Glancing back, Coppola notices the gaggle of barbers/ 
           beauticians escorting a towel-wrapped Pacino to the shampoo 
           sink -- Pacino nearly a foot shorter than all of them!

                                 COPPOLA (CONT’D)
                               (to Roos, re: Pacino)
                        Oh, and call Florsheim, will ya?  Get 
                        someone to fit him for lifts.   

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. JAFFE ESTATE - DUSK - EST.

           A car drives along a winding road on an opulent estate, 
           pulling up to a huge mansion.  Coppola gets out.  

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. JAFFE’S DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           Coppola sits alone at an enormous table, a sumptuous meal 
           before him.  SERVANTS stand at attention along the wall.      

           Seconds later, A MAN pushes through a swinging door.  This 
           is STANLEY JAFFE; completely bald, the angriest man in 
           Hollywood with his permanent scowl and red smoking jacket.  

                                 JAFFE
                        Alright, start talking.  

           Jaffe sits and begins throwing food at his face.  He 
           NEVER STOPS EATING, just CHEWS, SLURPS, GRUNTS, etc.  
           SUPER: “Stanley Jaffe, CEO, Paramount Pictures” 

                                 COPPOLA
                        First, thank you for seeing me, Mr. 
                        Jaffe.
                               (off Jaffe’s GRUNT)
                        You know I’m directing The Godfather.
                               (another GRUNT through food)
                        And my casting director and I feel we 
                        have the right actor for the pivotal role 
                        of Don Corleone. 
                               (Jaffe GRUNTS understanding)
                        He’s smart and intense, has the physical 
                        grandeur to portray a man of such power.  

           Jaffe glances at a servant and TAPS HIS FORK loudly on 
           his empty plate.  She refills, he continues scarfing.

                                 COPPOLA (CONT’D)
                        He... He’s a box office draw, he’s 
                        received acclaim around the world.  
                               (GRUNT: “And?”)
                        The only issue is, Bob Evans doesn’t want 
                        him.  

           Hearing “Bob Evans”, Jaffe chokes and begins COUGHING.  
           After drinking some water, sotto:

                                 JAFFE
                        ... ‘at motherfucker!  

                                 COPPOLA
                               (nods, then moves on)
                        So, we were hoping, Mr. Jaffe, you could 
                        grant us a small favor.  

                                 JAFFE
                        Jaffe’s listening.  

                                 COPPOLA
                        Well,... give Marlon Brando the part.  

           Jaffe stops eating immediately, puts down his fork.

                                 JAFFE
                        Marlon Brando?  

                                 COPPOLA
                               (terrified)
                        Yes.

                                 JAFFE
                        That part is perfect for him.

                                 COPPOLA
                               (relieved)
                        Yes.

                                 JAFFE
                        It’ll make him a big star again.
                                 COPPOLA
                               (elated)
                        YES!

                                 JAFFE
                        And I’m gonna run him outta the business!  

                                 COPPOLA
                               (crushed)
                        No...

                                 JAFFE
                        And let me tell you why.

           Jaffe throws down his napkin and stands, leaning on the 
           table as he gets closer and closer to Coppola.

                                 JAFFE (CONT’D)
                        Sam Spiegel and my father used to talk 
                        about the good old days; when actors were 
                        hired help.  Chess pieces to be moved 
                        however was best for the studio.  This is 
                        before Sam did “On The Waterfront.”  
                        Talent got outta line, demanded too much 
                        of the take; they got cut loose.  And 
                        then Marlon Brando comes along with his 
                        Sense Memory Technique and Stanislavsky 
                        charm.  People can’t get enough of him, 
                        and others like him.  So now they’re 
                        calling the shots -- trailer riders, 
                        producing credits, back end points.  
                        Pappy lost a lot of his nut after that.  
                        All us producers did.  And it’s not like 
                        Brando needed the cash.  These actors 
                        already get everything for free.  He did 
                        it just to make Pappy look ridiculous.  
                        AND MY PAPPY CAN’T AFFORD TO BE MADE TO 
                        LOOK RIDICULOUS.  NEITHER CAN I!  Now you 
                        get the hell outta here!  And if Brando 
                        wants to try anything clever, you tell 
                        him I ain’t no squaw lookin’ for a SAG 
                        card.  

           Coppola reacts.

                                 JAFFE (CONT’D)
                        Yeah.  I heard about that.  

           EXT. JAFFE’S FRONT DOOR - LATER

           The front door opens; Coppola and Jaffe emerge.  Jaffe 
           holds out his hand, all smiles.  

                                 JAFFE
                        Good luck with the picture.

           Coppola shakes warily.  

                                 COPPOLA
                        Thank you for dinner and a very pleasant 
                        evening.  
           He gets in his car and drives away.  

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. CASTING ROOM - DAY

           OVERHEAD ANGLE: Headshots and sandwiches spread over a 
           large table, Coppola before them, head in hands, depressed.  

           Beside him, Roos SHUFFLES the headshots.  Ruddy stands across 
           from them in silence, having just delivered some bad news.    

                                 COPPOLA
                        And how’d Columbo find out?

                                 RUDDY
                        That’s what he does.  It’s what I was 
                        afraid would happen.  We’ve already 
                        dropped a hundred grand in Manhasset and 
                        now the Teamsters have the set completely 
                        boarded up.  

                                 COPPOLA
                        Jesus, Al, you were supposed to reach out 
                        again.

                                 RUDDY
                        I haven’t been able to find him.  

                                 COPPOLA
                        Well, where the fuck is he?

                                 RUDDY
                        I don’t know.  A guy like that wants to 
                        disappear, he disappears!

                                 COPPOLA
                        Don’t yell at me.

                                 RUDDY
                        Well, I’m sorry, but I’m getting death 
                        threats now.  LAPD told me to switch up 
                        cars so I can’t be tailed.  I got Bettye 
                        my poor secretary driving my Alfa looking 
                        over her shoulder half the time.  And, 
                        excuse me, but it was your idea to start 
                        building, not mine--

                                 COPPOLA
                        I shouldn’t a’ had to deal with this, any 
                        of this, at all!  You’re logistics, I 
                        direct, goddamnit!  If I had a feature 
                        producer, I wouldn’t be in this shape!  
                        Hitchcock had David O. Selznick.  Look 
                        what I got.  Hogan’s-fucking-Heroes!  

           Ruddy heads for the door, pissed off and hurt.  
                                 COPPOLA (CONT’D)
                        I’m pushing a boulder up a mountain here, 
                        Al.  You wanna kick a few pebbles outta’ 
                        my way?     

           But Ruddy’s gone.  Roos, disapprovingly:   

                                 FRED ROOS
                        This is no pebble, Francis.  And he’s not 
                        Houdini.  

           INT. HALLWAY/WAITING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Ruddy walks quickly past Bettye, who’s sitting at a desk.

                                 BETTYE
                        Al?

           He doesn’t respond, just keeps moving down the hall right 
           past... Pacino freshly scrubbed, trim in a suit, great 
           haircut, he looks like (dare we say it) a movie star!  

           Pacino’s eyes return to the sides he’s been studying when 
           a furious Evans charges in, past Pacino and into...

           INT. CASTING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           ... the room.  Evans SLAMS the door, goes around the table 
           and right up to Coppola, who stands.  

                                 EVANS
                        You went over Evans’ head.   

                                 COPPOLA
                        Bob, Jaffe’s the CEO, he’s got a right to 
                        weigh in.  

                                 EVANS
                        Smug-ass spaghetti-slurper.  I was 
                        shielding you from that lunatic for your 
                        own good.  I knew that eunuch wants to 
                        hate-fuck Brando and our only shot was a 
                        united front.  

                                 COPPOLA
                        What united front?  You hate Brando too.  

                                 EVANS
                        We were “in talks” about it.  We’re 
                        always in talks!  Oh, but that’s not good 
                        enough for you.  You’re an auteur.  You 
                        crap masterpieces for breakfast and we’re 
                        all just here to wipe your ass.  Well, 
                        now you’ve shit yourself, Boyardee, and 
                        you can kiss Brando goodbye, even if he 
                        does turn out to be the right guy, which 
                        he ain’t!  

           Evans heads for the door, then turns back:
                                 EVANS (CONT’D)
                        I’m not the sharpest hair up your ass.  
                        So you better listen up.  “No means no” 
                        when you’re in bed with Evans.  

           He exits, slamming the door, the resulting breeze blowing 
           a bunch of the headshots off and around the table.  

           INT. HALLWAY/WAITING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Evans straightens his tie, about to walk off when something 
           catches his eye.  He slowly zeroes in on... Pacino! 

           Evans is apoplectic -- “What’s he doing here?!” -- but 
           soon he’s smiling, a plan forming.  He approaches:   

                                 EVANS
                        Pacino, right?
                               (before he can respond)
                        Bob Evans, V.P. Worldwide Production.

                                 PACINO
                               (standing, shakes hands)
                        Al.  How are you, sir?

                                 EVANS
                        I’m always wonderful.  Say, nice haircut.  
                        What’d that run you, ‘bout two bucks?

           Evans laughs, slapping Pacino’s shoulder.

                                 EVANS (CONT’D)
                        Just joshin’ ya!  I’m glad to see you’re 
                        back.  We could use a face like yours in 
                        this picture, even if the studio doesn’t 
                        like you for Michael.  

           Pacino’s face drops; the wind right out of his sails.

                                 EVANS (CONT’D)
                        What’s Coppola testing you for, a button 
                        man? 

                                 PACINO
                               (devastated, he lies)
                        ... uh, I guess,... I’m not really sure.

                                 EVANS
                        Yeah, I can see that.  Stand you up on a 
                        couple apple boxes... Grrr!  You’ll be 
                        terrifying!  
                               (then)
                        Look, I gotta run.  Good luck, kid.  

           Evans saunters off, pleased with himself.  Pacino’s 
           already fragile ego begins melting down.  Humiliated and 
           angry, he spins to leave, nearly running into A PASSERBY.

                                 PACINO
                        Sorry, sorry.
           He goes to step around, but a STUDIO TOUR GROUP rounds a 
           corner, clogging the hallway as Pacino tries to get by.

                                 PACINO (CONT’D)
                        Pardon me-- ‘scuse me-- Excuse me!

           Frustration running high, he goes “full Pacino” on the 
           poor unassuming tourists blocking his way!

                                 PACINO (CONT’D)
                        Sir!... MAKE AN AISLE!  GET OUTTA THE 
                        WAY!  SCOOT!... SCOOT!!!

           Bettye calls past the alarmed crowd...

                                 BETTYE
                        Al?... Al?!  

                                 PACINO
                               (still to the crowd)
                        MOVE YOUR ASSES!  ACTOR WALKIN’ HERE!  

           He finally gets clear and exits the building; everyone 
           staring, stunned at the antics of this lunatic!    

           A beat later, Coppola emerges from the casting room, his 
           eyes searching before he turns to Bettye.    

                                 COPPOLA
                        Where the hell is Al?

                        proud to announce Paramount’s big

           SUDDENLY, THE PICTURE GOES BLACK.  PULL OUT TO REVEAL:

           INT. COPPOLA’S HOME OFFICE - DAY

           Coppola, alone, shuts off a TV, his stress having just 
           doubled with Evans’ announcement.  He returns to TYPING. 

           Moments later, Talia KNOCKS and enters excitedly.  

                                 TALIA
                        Francis, thank you, thank you, thank you!

           She hugs him in his chair.  He hugs her back, confused.

                                 COPPOLA
                        What’s this for?

                                 TALIA
                        Well-- for Connie.  For giving me the 
                        part!

           Coppola stares, in pure shock, as she continues:

                                 TALIA (CONT’D)
                        Bob Evans himself called to tell me.  He 
                        loved my test, said nepotism be damned, 
                        you’re perfect for it.  Said I’m worth 
                        “five Pacinos”...
                               (confused)
                        ... which I don’t-- Is that a Jewish 
                        thing?  I’m not sure what that means.  
                        But I am so happy, and so stunned.  
                        Honestly, I didn’t think you wanted me.
                                 COPPOLA
                        I don’t.  You’re completely wrong for it.    

           Talia steps back, like she was just slapped.

                                 TALIA
                        Then, why--

                                 COPPOLA
                        Evans cast you, not me.  He probably 
                        figures it’s a small part, who cares who 
                        gets it, and now when we’re fighting he 
                        can play the “remember I cast your kid 
                        sister” card.  It’s leverage.  
                               (his anger building)
                        Everything with him is a goddamn power 
                        play, Tally! 

                                 TALIA
                        I’m sorry.  Fred called me in--  

                                 COPPOLA
                        “Called you in?!”  You glad-handed and 
                        bat your pretty little eyes, at my table-- 

                                 TALIA
                        Well, that’s how actors get in the door!  
                        It has nothing to do with you-- 

           Coppola stands, boiling over.   

                                 COPPOLA
                        It has everything to do with me!  I got 
                        no room to move here!   
                               (pointing at the TV)
                        “Paramount’s big production of 1971 is 
                        The Godfather”.  It’s on a pedestal now.  
                        If I quit, it means I couldn’t handle a 
                        high-profile project.  If I stay and let 
                        Evans screw it up, then I’m the director 
                        who ruined The Godfather.  My reputation, 
                        my integrity, my company, my home are all 
                        on the line.  On top of that, the actual 
                        mafia’s pissed at us, and now all the 
                        baggage you piled on! 

           The weight of the situation; her naivete, his anger at 
           her -- washes over Talia, who’s moved to tears.  

                                 TALIA
                        Do you want me to not take it?  I don’t 
                        have to take it.

                                 COPPOLA
                        No, don’t do that.  I’ll probably be 
                        fired anyway.  Why shouldn’t you get 
                        something out of it?   

           Low blow, and Talia feels it.  Coppola sits and begins 
           TYPING again.  A beat later, quietly:    
                                 TALIA
                        Since we were kids, you have always been 
                        the star, Francis.  The rest of us only 
                        try to keep up.  But we’re here too, ya 
                        know.  

           Coppola keeps TYPING as she exits.  A beat later, he 
           stops and looks up at a newspaper photo taped to the wall 
           -- it’s the one of Evans, Bart, Ruddy and Coppola.

           The PHONE RINGS, but Coppola’s eyes remain on the photo 
           until he suddenly punches it, breaking through the 
           plaster and hurting his hand in the process.   

                                 COPPOLA
                        Fuck!  Ahh... Jesus!

           He HUFFS and goes back to typing, using only the 
           uninjured hand.  A moment later, Eleanor enters.    

                                 ELEANOR
                        Francis, I’ve got--
                               (noticing the damaged wall)
                        What’s that?

                                 COPPOLA
                        ... well that’s an accident, but nobody 
                        was hurt.  

           She glares at him, but swallows the anger.

                                 ELEANOR
                        Your friend, Mr. Butts, is on the phone.   

                                 COPPOLA
                        Huh?

                                 ELEANOR
                        Yeah.  Seymour.  
                               (off his confusion)
                        As in...

                                 COPPOLA
                               (getting it)
                        Seymour Butts.  

           He immediately picks up the phone as Eleanor exits.

                                 COPPOLA (ON PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        Hello, Marlon.  

                                                         INTERCUT WITH:

           INT. BRANDO’S BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           REVEAL: Brando in the tub, LAUGHING at his own joke.

                                 BRANDO (ON PHONE)
                        “See More Butts”!
                                 COPPOLA (ON PHONE)
                        Take it on the road.  You’ll kill with 
                        the five and under crowd.

           Brando stops laughing, suddenly very serious. 

                                 BRANDO (ON PHONE)
                        No.  I would never bullshit a child.  
                        They speak only the truth.  This is why 
                        we hate them.  

                                 COPPOLA (ON PHONE)
                        ... I wasn’t implying you’d--

                                 BRANDO (ON PHONE)
                        Did you see your studio man on TV?

                                 COPPOLA (ON PHONE)
                        I did.  

                                 BRANDO (ON PHONE)
                        This picture’ll be subject to a lot of 
                        scrutiny now.  

                                 COPPOLA (ON PHONE)
                        Do ya think?

                                 BRANDO (ON PHONE)
                        By nature, I’m very private.   

                                 COPPOLA (ON PHONE)
                        You’re an actor, sure.

                                 BRANDO (ON PHONE)
                        I worry people won’t accept me as an 
                        aging Italian.  I’ve always been so...

           Brando checks himself out in the mirror, smoothing his 
           hair, waiting for Coppola to jump in...

                                 COPPOLA (ON PHONE)
                        ... beautiful.  Is that it? 

                                 BRANDO (ON PHONE)
                        If one must put a word to it.  
                               (then)
                        Have to turn you down, Francis.  My 
                        career as it is, I can’t afford to fall 
                        on my “beautiful” face again.  Your word, 
                        not mine.  

           Coppola bites his knuckles -- “Another problem?!”  Then:

                                 COPPOLA (ON PHONE)
                        Marlon, I truly don’t believe there’s a 
                        part on God’s earth you can’t play.  Your 
                        talent outshines even your beauty when it 
                        comes to disappearing into a role.  
                        That’s why I want you. 

           Brando absorbs this, the flattery working.
                                 BRANDO (ON PHONE)
                        Well, I did have a few thoughts.  

                                 COPPOLA (ON PHONE)
                        Yeah?

                                 BRANDO (ON PHONE)
                        This man, the Don.  I think maybe he was 
                        shot in the throat long ago.  

           Brando switches into Don Corleone’s raspy/mumbly voice.  

                                 BRANDO (ON PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        So, now he sounds like this.  His vocal 
                        cords are damaged.  Swollen and obtuse, 
                        like, eh... cauliflower ear.  

           Coppola struggles to hear him.  

                                 COPPOLA (ON PHONE)
                        I... I can’t understand you. 

                                 BRANDO (ON PHONE)
                               (still as the Don)
                        But it’s alright.  Powerful people, they 
                        don’t have to speak loud.  

                                 COPPOLA (ON PHONE)
                        They do have to speak English though.  
                        But listen, I think you’re onto 
                        something.  Workshop it some more, you 
                        can always quit later.  

           Brando holds up a rubber duck from the tub, singing:

                                 BRANDO (ON PHONE)
                        Rubber duckie, you’re the one.          
                        You make bathtime lots of fun.       
                        Rubber duckie, I’m awfully fond of you,... 

                                 COPPOLA (ON PHONE)
                        Bye, Marlon.  

                                 BRANDO (ON PHONE)
                        Vo-vo-dee-oo!

           Coppola hangs up.  END INTERCUTTING.  Coppola rubs his 
           temples, stretches his injured hand and returns to 
           TYPING, painfully.  The PHONE RINGS again.  Irritated:

                                 COPPOLA
                        ELEANOR!  THE PHONE!  

                                 ELEANOR (O.S.)
                        I’M IN THE BATHROOM!  DON’T TAKE IT OUT 
                        ON THE WALLS!  

           Coppola answers the phone. 
                                 COPPOLA (ON PHONE) 
                        What?!  

                                                         INTERCUT WITH:

           INT. PUZO’S OFFICE (LA) - CONTINUOUS

           Puzo at his desk, script pages in hand.

                                 PUZO (ON PHONE)
                        It’s Mario.  Jesus Fuck, what’s wrong?

                                 COPPOLA (ON PHONE)
                        Oh, nothing.  Brando wants the Don to 
                        sound like a stroke victim is all.  

                                 PUZO (ON PHONE)
                        Evans is giving him the part now?

                                 COPPOLA (ON PHONE)
                        No.  But Brando’s turning it down anyway.

                                 PUZO (ON PHONE)
                        ... I see.  Not my problem.  Got your 
                        first batch ‘a pages here...

           Coppola pauses, expecting the worst.

                                 COPPOLA (ON PHONE)
                        ... And?

                                 PUZO (ON PHONE)
                        And I thought you were an asshole 
                        before... 
                               (laughing)
                        ... talkin’ about art!  
                               (reads off a page)
                        “It’s not personal, Sonny.  It’s strictly 
                        business.”  And a minute later he shoots 
                        two men point blank in the head.  That’s 
                        your dream come full circle right there.  
                        Horror justified by prosperity.  You 
                        pulled it outta’ the book like I never 
                        could.  
                               (off Coppola’s silence)
                        I’m saying it’s great writing, Francis.    

                                 COPPOLA (ON PHONE)
                               (sincere)
                        Thank you, Mario.  

                                 PUZO (ON PHONE)
                        Yeah.  You see Evans on the tube?

                                 COPPOLA (ON PHONE)
                        Lot to live up to.

                                 PUZO (ON PHONE)
                        Nevermind that.  Ruddy settle things with 
                        the Guinea Squad yet?  
                                 COPPOLA (ON PHONE)
                        I don’t think so.  Actually, Al and I are 
                        kinda’ on the outs right now.  

                                 PUZO (ON PHONE)
                        Well, he better.  Evans telling the world 
                        it’ll shoot in New York without reaching a 
                        deal... Columbo and his boys won’t be 
                        happy about that.  

                                                               CUT TO:

           EXT. RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD / MCCARTT RESIDENCE - DAY

           The pleasance of suburbia: BIRDS CHIRPING, KIDS PLAYING, 
           maybe an ICE CREAM TRUCK. 

           An Alfa Romeo parks in the driveway of one home.  Bettye 
           McCartt (Ruddy’s secretary) climbs out with groceries, 
           her young SON and DAUGHTER wrestling in the back seat.

                                 BETTYE
                        No roughhousing in Mr. Ruddy’s car, 
                        please!  

           INT. MCCARTT RESIDENCE / KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER

           Bettye sets the grocery bags on the counter and begins 
           unpacking them.  Before her kids can run off:

                                 BETTYE
                        Wait, you both need a bath.  I just have 
                        to put the milk away.

           The kids start fighting about something... 

                                                         INTERCUT WITH:

           EXT. MCCARTT RESIDENCE - CONTINUOUS

           ANGLE: Two sets of feet sporting polished wingtips move 
           quickly down the sidewalk.  

           ANGLE: The TWO MEN in suits (their faces out of frame) 
           charge; each with a small caliber pistol already in hand.  

           ANGLE: Overhead, as the men take aim at the Alfa Romeo in 
           Bettye’s driveway.  

           In the kitchen, Bettye startles as GUNFIRE CRACKS over 
           her children’s arguing!  She drops a grocery bag.

           ANGLE: Oranges spill from the bag and roll across the floor.  

           Outside, BULLETS tear through the Alfa’s fenders and 
           SHATTER its windows!

           Inside, Bettye SCREAMS as she rushes to her kids, pulling 
           them down under the kitchen table, landing hard on and 
           breaking her wristwatch.  She covers the kids’ heads.  
           At last, the men outside pocket their weapons.  One 
           tosses a HANDWRITTEN NOTE inside the Alfa before they 
           both hop into a car driven by a THIRD MAN and PEEL AWAY. 

           INSERT: The note -- “Keep your cameras out of New York.”  

           The incident is over in mere seconds, leaving Bettye 
           quivering beneath her table, comforting her CRYING kids.  

                                 BETTYE
                        Shh, it’s okay.  We’re alright.  Shh...

           INT. ROBERT EVANS’ OFFICE - DAY

           Evans chomps a cigar, sitting behind his desk across from 
           Peter Bart, Coppola, and Ruddy. 

                                 RUDDY
                        We switched cars so I could duck their 
                        tail.  I never thought they’d pull 
                        anything like this.  Bettye’s scared 
                        shitless.  

                                 EVANS
                        We gotta protect our women.  Get out to 
                        NYC and take the war to them.   

           He pulls a sawed-off shotgun (a lupara) from beneath the 
           desk and looks through the barrels.  Everyone jumps!  

                                 COPPOLA
                        Holy shit, Bob!  Put that away.

                                 EVANS
                        Back off, Nellie.  I got a right to be 
                        bare-armed, or... shoot bears, whatever 
                        the hell it is.  Don’t tread on Evans.   

                                 BART
                        You saw Phil Spector again, didn’t you?   

                                 EVANS
                               (loading the gun)
                        Little turf row may send you pussyboys 
                        running.  Evans came up in men’s fashion.

           He closes the loaded lupara with a flair and sets it down.  

                                 EVANS (CONT’D)
                        We struck a deal.  They don’t honor it 
                        like gentlemen, the gloves are off.  

                                 RUDDY
                               (guilty)
                        ... actually, Bob, we never technically 
                        shook hands with them on anything.  

           Evans’ confusion gives way to rage.  Bart stands and 
           casually makes his way toward Evans’ desk. 
                                 EVANS
                        But you built sets!

                                 RUDDY
                        They stopped us.  We were hoping to 
                        handle it without you.   

           Bart grabs the lupara away just as Evans reaches for it.

                                 EVANS
                        You lied to me, Al?

           Ruddy looks away.  Evans’ knowing eyes zero in on Coppola.

                                 EVANS (CONT’D)
                        You made him.  

                                 COPPOLA
                        New York’s too important to bend over on, 
                        Bob.  

                                 BART
                        We may have to bend over now.

                                 EVANS
                        Too late, I’m already grabbing my ankles, 
                        cornhole puckered.  Or did you miss me 
                        vowing to the press this film’s our next 
                        Love Story.  That means authenticity.  
                        New York.  In the 40’s-- 
                               (to Coppola)
                        And I don’t care how much you fight me on 
                        the period, Coppola.  The picture needs 
                        integrity!  

                                 COPPOLA
                               (shocked)
                        I wanted it to be period!  You said we 
                        don’t have the money. 

                                 EVANS
                        That ain’t how Evans remembers it. 
                               (to Ruddy)
                        You’re flying East tonight.  You settle 
                        with the League or you don’t come back.  
                               (to Bart)
                        Pete, take him to the airport.
                               (off their hesitation)
                        Now!  What am I, talkin’ Swahilian?!  

           Bart and Ruddy stand to exit.  Coppola too.

                                 EVANS (CONT’D)
                        Not you, doughboy.  

           As he exits, Bart shows Coppola the lupara reassuringly -- 
           “You’re safe, I’ve got it.”   Once the door closes:

                                 EVANS (CONT’D)
                        Who the fuck do you think you are, lying 
                        to me?  
                                 COPPOLA
                        The director.  And I wouldn’t have to lie 
                        if you’d stop undermining me--

                                 EVANS
                        I’m doing my job.  

                                 COPPOLA
                        Sabotaging my screen tests?
                               (off Evans’ blush, smug)
                        That little farce you played with Pacino 
                        outside my casting room.  You think that 
                        could fool me?      

                                 EVANS
                        Why are you testing some actor I already 
                        axed?  We’re going with O’Neal! 

           Coppola shakes his fists, his temper getting the best of him.   

                                 COPPOLA
                        Goddamnit, I should not have to put up 
                        with this!

                                 EVANS
                        With what, Francis?  Input?  These are 
                        million dollar decisions!

                                 COPPOLA
                        You call what you expectorate “input?!”  
                        You complain about the press; you’re so 
                        far up my ass, I think you’re in love.  

                                 EVANS
                        Bullshit!  I’ve had the greatest asses in 
                        the world!  Yours looks like a bag ‘a 
                        dirty laundry!  

                                 COPPOLA
                        FUCK RYAN O’NEAL!

                                 EVANS
                        No, FUCK AL PACINO!  

           Furious, Coppola heads for the door.  

                                 EVANS (CONT’D)
                        You don’t know everything about 
                        everything, King Shit.  See Blow-etrope 
                        and the fortune you owe for reference.  
                        Think about your wife and kids out 
                        whorin’ on Skid Row, ‘cuz you got one 
                        chance left to clean up your act.  

           Coppola exits, SLAMMING the door.  Evans yells after:

                                 EVANS (CONT’D)
                        I said CLEAN IT UP!  
                                (a beat later, sotto)
                        Guinea brat.
           INT. PUZO’S OFFICE (LA) - NIGHT

           Puzo pours a couple scotches as Coppola sits self-pitying:   

                                 COPPOLA
                        I don’t know what to do, Mario.  I just 
                        don’t know.  He questions everything I 
                        say; me, the director he hired.  I spend 
                        all day explaining myself and he can’t 
                        hear me.  It’s like I’m tap dancing in 
                        outer space.   

           Puzo sits beside him and hands off a scotch.   

                                 COPPOLA (CONT’D)
                        We wrote a great script, we have the best 
                        actors willing to play the parts.  I 
                        mean, what else am I supposed to do?  I 
                        don’t know! 
                               (sulking)
                        Just-- I don’t know what to do.  I don’t 
                        know what to do!--  

           Without warning, Puzo slaps him hard across the face; 
           Coppola sloshes scotch all over the carpet.  He’s stunned! 

                                 PUZO
                        You can act like a man!  “It could be 
                        epic”, you said.  Think that comes cheap?  
                        You’re gonna bump a few heads.  What, you 
                        shouldn’t have to convince nobody?  Who 
                        the hell are you, Jesus H. Christ 
                        Senior?! 
                               (sips his scotch, chuckles)
                        Ya know where my generation fucked yours 
                        up?  We were so horrified from the war, 
                        we idealized everything.  You all assume 
                        there’s a purpose for you and if ya just 
                        get to the right place, suddenly you’ll 
                        be master and commander.  Like this 
                        Zoetrope; it’s a nice idea - the inmates 
                        runnin’ the studio - but creation don’t 
                        happen that way.

                                 COPPOLA
                        What way?

                                 PUZO
                        In a fucking bubble.  Nobody ever did 
                        nothing good without adversity as an 
                        ally.  Hell, I may not like the friggin’ 
                        thing, but The Godfather connects with 
                        people; I think because I wrote it with a 
                        gun literally to my head.  It makes you 
                        strong, sharpens your instincts.  You 
                        learn what’s worth fighting for and how 
                        to compromise so when problems arise, you 
                        can move forward.  Like a man.  
                               (another sip)
                        You found the book pedestrian. 

           Coppola tries to protest, but Puzo keeps going.  
                                 PUZO (CONT’D)
                        But ya had to adapt it, you didn’t have a 
                        choice.  So, you got clever.  Now Evans 
                        is threatening to sink the ship, get 
                        clever again.  Work the problem.  Work 
                        with people, Francis.  Something’s not 
                        goin’ how you like, there’s usually a 
                        pretty good reason.  Give ‘em the benefit 
                        of the doubt.  Don’t be a cunt.  

           Puzo gestures a toast.  They drain their scotches.  

                                 PUZO (CONT’D)
                        That’s all I’m sayin’.   

           He gives a deep CHUCKLE and winks at his humbled apprentice.    

           INT. HALLWAY/WAITING ROOM - DAY

           Bettye works at her desk.  A MAN approaches from a door 
           down the hall; tall, bushy hair, the unmistakable swagger, 
           he winks at every woman he passes.  No doubt who this is:  

                                 THE MAN
                        Jimmy Caan to see Coppola.

                                 BETTYE
                        He’ll be just a moment.

           JAMES CAAN (30) gives Bettye the once over and perches 
           himself on the edge of her desk. 

                                 JAMES CAAN
                        I’m reading for Sonny.
                               (off her curt nod)
                        The handsome brother.  What’s your name?  

           INT. CASTING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Coppola sits writing on a legal pad when Fred Roos KNOCKS 
           and pops his head in the door.  

                                 FRED ROOS
                        Hey, Francie.  
                               (pointing outside)
                        I thought we weren’t reading Caan for 
                        Sonny.  He’s not Italian.

                                 COPPOLA
                        He’s not reading for Sonny.  Last minute 
                        change.  

           Roos gives him a look -- “What gives?”  

                                 COPPOLA (CONT’D)
                        Bob’s giving us the cash to set the film 
                        in the 40s. 

                                 FRED ROOS
                        What?  That’s great!  I thought he hated 
                        that idea.  
                                 COPPOLA
                        He did.  Until he thought it was his.  

           Intrigued, Roos steps in and closes the door.  

           INT. HALLWAY/WAITING ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Caan is still on Bettye’s desk, wasting his charms.  Fred 
           Roos steps out from the casting room.  

                                 FRED ROOS
                        Jimmy.

                                 JAMES CAAN
                        Ho!

           Caan jumps up and pulls him in for a big embrace.  

                                 FRED ROOS
                        Good to see you, pal.  Listen, we’ve got 
                        some new sides for you.   

           Caan just shrugs in that way of his - “Yo, whatever!”  

           INT. SCREENING ROOM - DAY

           Evans flicks his cigar in an ashtray, Roos sitting behind him.  

           ON-SCREEN: James Caan is reading the “Michael” scene with 
           Diane Keaton, but playing the part as “Sonny” -- wearing a 
           wife beater, eating the lasagna, smacking his lips, etc.

                                 JAMES CAAN (AS MICHAEL/SONNY)
                        The bandleader -- the balls on this guy!  
                        He says no.  So next day, pop goes to see 
                        him with Luca Brasi.  And within an hour, 
                        bada beep bada boop, he signs the release 
                        for a measly grand.  

           Caan shrugs a’la “Sonny” and steals an olive off her 
           plate.  Evans in the audience, to himself:

                                 EVANS
                        What the fuck?

                                 DIANE KEATON (AS KAY)
                        How did he do that?

                                 JAMES CAAN (AS MICHAEL/SONNY)
                        “How did he do”-- Luca held a gun to his 
                        head while my father assured him -- BADA 
                        BING!  Either his brains or his Hancock 
                        would be on the contract.  That’s a true 
                        story.

           Caan stuffs her lasagna in his mouth.  

           Behind Evans and Roos, Coppola enters and feigns shock:
                                 COPPOLA
                        Whoa, what’s going on?!  
                               (to the projectionist)
                        Hey, cut it!  Cut it!

                                 JAMES CAAN (AS MICHAEL/SONNY)
                               (chewing lasagna)
                        It’s my family, hon.  It ain’t me. 

           The test ends abruptly, the LIGHTS COME UP.  

                                 COPPOLA
                        Fred, why’s he watching this?  
                               (realizing)
                        Christ, I didn’t tell you.  Bob decided 
                        we’re going with O’Neal.  

                                 FRED ROOS
                        We are?
                               (playing outrage)
                        Goddamnit, you gotta keep me in the loop!
                               (to Evans)
                        My apologies.  I know your time is money.  

                                 COPPOLA
                        I’m sorry too, Bob.  Truly.

           Evans puffs his cigar, wooed by the respect.   

                                 EVANS
                        Under the bridge.  Evans is benevolence.  

                                 FRED ROOS
                               (re: Caan)
                        Kid has charisma though, don’t he?  The 
                        way he eats; his swagger and gestures.

                                 COPPOLA
                               (sitting)
                        Oh, he’s bottled fury.  Red pepper flakes 
                        up his ass, like my old man says.  Wish 
                        we could use him someplace.

           Evans turns back toward the screen, thinking.  Coppola 
           and Roos wait for him to take the bait.  Then:   

                                 EVANS
                        What about for Sonny?

           Coppola and Roos look at each other; in sheer epiphany!

                        FRED ROOS
           That just might work.
                                                     COPPOLA
                                            We never considered that. 

                                 EVANS (CONT’D)
                        He’s got the right moves; his walk, his 
                        mannerisms.  

           They nod, hanging on his every word.  Evans loves it.  
                                 EVANS (CONT’D)
                        He’s a guinea hothead if I ever saw one.  
                               (pointing at Coppola)
                        And I seen one!  

                                 COPPOLA
                        You’re right, I gotta admit.  He’d make 
                        an incredible Sonny.

                                 FRED ROOS
                        Brilliant!  Why didn’t we see it?   

           Evans stands proudly, adjusting his suit.  

                                 COPPOLA
                        Shit!--
                               (sighs)
                        Jimmy Caan’s not Italian.  

           Roos performs an exaggerated slump.  

                                 FRED ROOS
                        Sonuvabitch.  Don’t that beat all.        

                                 EVANS
                        Well, look fellas, the all-WOP mandate 
                        was just a guideline--

                                 COPPOLA
                        No, Bob, we’ll find someone else.  I’ve 
                        asked enough of you already.  
                               (standing)
                        Since our argument, I’ve been really 
                        trying to put myself in your shoes, and 
                        I’ve realized you’re on the ropes same as 
                        me.  Jaffe wants you gone, am I right? 

           Evans bristles, blowing out smoke, but doesn’t disagree.

                                 COPPOLA (CONT’D)
                        You can’t afford to give him any excuse.  
                        Casting non-Italians might throw the 
                        picture’s credibility into question.  You 
                        want to be bold, but you have to kowtow. 
                        I can relate.   

                                 EVANS
                               (his ego injured)
                        Kowtow?  To cocksucker Jaffe?  Never!

           Coppola and Roos exchange reluctant expressions.  

                                 COPPOLA
                        Well, you kinda’ already did, no?

           Evans glares.

                                 COPPOLA (CONT’D)
                        I mean, you were the one who called 
                        Brando divine.  You signed me to the 
                        picture right after I threw out his name.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 COPPOLA (CONT’D)
                        You practically gave him the part.  The 
                        way you spun on a dime, I just assumed 
                        Jaffe or someone had you by the balls.   

           Livid, Evans picks up the ash tray and throws it.  

                                 COPPOLA (CONT’D)
                        Take it easy, Bob!  I understand.  It’s 
                        self-preservation.  We all have a master.  

                                 EVANS
                        “A master.”  I’ll show you a master, ya 
                        stupid zip.  Follow me.   

           He storms out.  Coppola and Roos trade proud smiles 
           before following...

           INT. STANLEY JAFFE’S OFFICE (LA) - LATER

           Jaffe stands over his desk, pointing his finger.

                                 JAFFE
                        You don’t understand.  Marlon Brando 
                        never gets that movie.  

           REVEAL: Sitting across are Evans, Coppola, and Fred Roos.  

                                 JAFFE (CONT’D)
                        He costs way too much and he’s completely 
                        unpredictable except for being a pain in 
                        the ass.

                                 EVANS
                        What’ll it take?  Anything, Stan.  

                                 JAFFE
                               (correcting him)
                        Mr. Jaffe.  

           No love lost between these two.  Evans concedes though. 

                                 EVANS
                        Of course.  Anything, Mr. Jaffe.  

                                 JAFFE
                        Anything, huh?  Okay, how ‘bout no cash 
                        up front.  He does it for back end only.

                                 EVANS
                        Done.

           Evans starts to stand, but Jaffe continues:

                                 JAFFE
                        And he puts up a bond to cover any 
                        overruns he may cause.    

           Coppola and Roos look skeptical.  Evans compliments Jaffe:  

                                 EVANS
                        Sharp.  No problem.  
           Evans heads merrily for the door; Jaffe can’t stand it!

                                 JAFFE
                        One more thing.  
                               (after Evans turns back)
                        I’ll need to see a screen test.  

           Evans swallows nervously.  Coppola and Roos cringe. 

                                 EVANS
                        You want to ask Marlon Brando to test?

                                 JAFFE
                        No, I want you to.  
                               (bullshitting)
                        The shareholders need to be assured of 
                        his commitment.  

                                 EVANS
                               (flummoxed)
                        Uh,... well-- I’ll see what I can do, Mr. 
                        Jaffe.

           Jaffe shoots him a huge shit-eating grin.  

                                 JAFFE
                        Good luck, Bob.  

           EXT. JAFFE’S OFFICES (THE PARAMOUNT LOT) - MOMENTS LATER

           Coppola and Roos exit with a confident Evans.  Coppola 
           opens his mouth to speak:   

                                 EVANS
                        Wait ‘til he can’t see us.  

           REVEAL: Jaffe spying from his window.

                                 EVANS (CONT’D)
                        Peeping Tom Cocksucker. 

           When they’re far enough away:

                                 COPPOLA
                        How do we get Brando to work for free, 
                        Bob?

                                 FRED ROOS
                        And possibly pay us.  

                                 EVANS
                        Don’t matter.  Evans got you your “in”.  

                                 COPPOLA
                        What “in”?  

                                 EVANS
                               (re: Jaffe)
                        I knew that pale-face shaved prick 
                        couldn’t let me leave before goosing 
                        himself with a wire brush.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 EVANS (CONT'D)
                               (off Coppola’s confusion)
                        You don’t think Marlon Brando’s screen 
                        test goes all the way up the totem pole?  
                               (shaking his head)
                        Fuckin’ amateurs.  

                                 COPPOLA
                        I don’t understand.  Anyway, Brando 
                        hasn’t tested since 1953.  He won’t do 
                        it.  

           Evans slaps Coppola playfully on the cheek.    

                                 EVANS
                        That’s your problem, Francis.  The Master 
                        has a plan.  Now do your part and trust 
                        me.     

           Coppola starts to object, but then settles himself.

                                 COPPOLA
                        Okay, Bob.  I’ll have faith. 

           Evans winks and walks away, leaving Coppola and Roos lost 
           in their newest challenge.  

           INT. BARE SOUNDSTAGE - NIGHT

           A production meeting is underway.  A TENT CARD on the 
           table lists the name and title of the woman speaking now, 
           “NIKKI ROBERTS, Production Coordinator”.

                                 NIKKI ROBERTS
                        So, production still starts in six weeks.  

                                 COPPOLA
                        Correct.  

                                 NIKKI ROBERTS
                        But we haven’t locked down a city to 
                        shoot in.   

           Her boss (with his own tent card) “GRAY FREDERICKSON, 
           Production Manager” gestures for her to stay calm.  

                                 COPPOLA
                               (making light)
                        You say that like it’s unusual.

           Coppola looks around the table populated by department 
           heads and their lieutenants, hoping for laughs.  Nope!...  

                                 COPPOLA (CONT’D)
                        Kidding.

           Fred Roos squirms beside him.  Ruddy is noticeably absent.  
           “ALEJANDRO ESTEVEZ, Art Director” laments: 

                                 ALEJANDRO ESTEVEZ
                        It’s not just the Manhasset disaster--
                                 COPPOLA
                        --We’ll get those sets back--

                                 ALEJANDRO ESTEVEZ
                        --or the rush to scout.  We have to dress 
                        these locations for 1945.  

                                 COPPOLA
                        I know.

                                 ALEJANDRO ESTEVEZ
                        You “know,” but you’ve never actually 
                        shot a period film.  That kind of detail 
                        takes months.  I’m sure the notion of a 
                        studio crew versus six film students in a 
                        VW bus makes you feel invincible, but we 
                        have limitations too.  

           He looks to his boss, “DEAN TAVOULARIS, Production 
           Designer” to show backup.  Tavoularis is stone-faced.  

                                 COPPOLA
                        Al Ruddy is handling New York.  That’s 
                        why he couldn’t be here today.   

           “JAKE WEBBER, A-Camera Op” jumps in with the sarcasm...

                                 JAKE WEBBER
                        Swell.  The producer of TV’s twelfth best 
                        comedy is on the case.  

           SNOBBY LAUGHTER all around the table.  Coppola withers until 
           Jake’s craggy boss, “GORDON WILLIS, Cinematographer” cuts in:

                                 WILLIS
                        Goddamnit, that’s enough!  

           Everyone’s instantly quiet, some burying smiles.  

                                 GRAY FREDERICKSON
                        All of you, please don’t be cavalier.  
                        Gordy, Dean, me and your other department 
                        heads have seen how a time crunch affects 
                        people.  So follow our lead.  Don’t let 
                        the pressure turn you indifferent, or 
                        disrespectful.  

           “STEVEN KESTEN, 1st A.D.” moves on.    

                                 KESTEN
                        What’s the status on Michael and the Don?  

                                 COPPOLA
                        We’re working on Brando, but it’s not a 
                        done deal.  
                               (pauses, considering)
                        And still no Michael. 

           Fred Roos looks askance at Coppola (who just lied).   
                                 KESTEN
                               (frustrated)
                        One or both of them is in nearly every 
                        scene.  I need their schedules so I can 
                        start blocking out our days--    

                                 COPPOLA
                        I realize that. 

           QUESTIONS COME HARD AND FAST suddenly from around the 
           table... Until an overwhelmed Coppola has to stop it. 

                                 COPPOLA (CONT’D)
                        Everyone, guys!  HEY!  
                               (when they’re quiet)
                        I understand there are challenges.  But 
                        we’re all just gonna have to get a little 
                        creative on this one.  

                                 JAKE WEBBER
                        Sure.  Fix it in post.  

           There’s SNICKERING as all eyes turn to “ARAM AVAKIAN, 
           Editor”, who flips everyone the middle finger. 

                                 AVAKIAN
                        Yeah, fix THIS in post.   

           The SNICKERING continues as Coppola trades weary glances 
           with Frederickson, Tavoularis, and Willis.   

           INT. BARE SOUNDSTAGE - LATER

           The meeting has broken up.  Stanley Jaffe has arrived and 
           introduces himself to some of the junior crew members -- 
           Nikki, Alejandro, Jake, Kesten, Avakian. 

           A distressed Coppola stands off to the side watching 
           Jaffe.  Roos approaches him.  

                                 COPPOLA
                        What’s Jaffe doing here?  

           Roos doesn’t know, merely shakes his head.  

                                 FRED ROOS
                        You alright, Francie?

                                 COPPOLA
                        Beside the crew thinking I’m a ten-year-
                        old with a windup Super 8?  Sure.

                                 FRED ROOS
                        Why lie about O’Neal?

                                 COPPOLA
                               (shrugs)
                        I tell them, it’s official.  
                               (points at Roos’ cross pendant)
                        Still hoping for a miracle.   
           They spot Bettye McCartt approaching.  

                                 BETTYE
                        Francis, I have Al on the phone for you.

           Coppola sighs, again eyeing Jaffe schmoozing with the crew.

           EXT. BLOOMINGDALE’S DEPT. STORE (NYC) - NIGHT - EST.

           The store is decorated for Christmas time.  THRONGS of 
           CUSTOMERS make their way in and out.  

                                 RUDDY (PRE-LAP)
                        A week I’ve been out here and no sign of 
                        the man...

           INT. BLOOMINGDALE’S/INT. CASTING ROOM (LA) - CONT. - INTERCUT

           Ruddy’s on a pay-phone in the store’s foyer talking to 
           Coppola back in L.A.  

                                 RUDDY (ON PHONE)
                        ... I been past League headquarters 
                        everyday, Columbo’s “social club”, wife’s 
                        house, girlfriend’s house, black 
                        girlfriend’s house - nothing. 

                                 COPPOLA (ON PHONE)
                        Maybe your Alfa had him whacked.  He’s at 
                        the bottom of the East River.  

           Ruddy doesn’t laugh; he’s still sore at Coppola.  

                                 RUDDY (ON PHONE)
                        Nah, he’s posturing -- if he wants to 
                        talk, he’ll find me.  

                                 COPPOLA (ON PHONE) 
                        Know what you’ll pitch if he does?

                                 RUDDY (ON PHONE)
                        I got a notion, but it’s pretty radical.  
                        Wanna hear it?  

                                 COPPOLA (ON PHONE)
                        No.  Whatever it is, you have my full 
                        support.  

           Ruddy pulls away from and looks at the receiver, shocked.  

                                 COPPOLA (ON PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        Look, Al, I don’t have a clue how to 
                        solve this.  It was easier to deny that 
                        and scream at you.

                                 RUDDY (ON PHONE)
                                (shakes head, but touched)
                        Worst apology I ever heard.
           Coppola laughs.

                                 COPPOLA (ON PHONE)
                        Yeah, well, I’m not really in the habit.  
                                (after a beat, serious)
                        I have trouble remembering the carpet 
                        doesn’t roll itself out.  That being 
                        said, this needs to happen fast so get 
                        back to work.  

                                 RUDDY (ON PHONE)
                        You kiddin’?  Never stopped.

           PULL BACK TO REVEAL: He’s surrounded by shopping bags.  

           EXT. BLOOMINGDALE’S DEPT. STORE - MOMENTS LATER

           Slinging the shopping bags (one with a child’s sled 
           emerging), Ruddy heads for a cabstand when someone steps 
           right in his way.  Ruddy looks up.  It’s Joe Columbo.  

                                 JOE SR.
                        Al!  Al Ruddy.  Merry Christmas.

                                 RUDDY
                        Thank you.  

                                 JOE SR. 
                        Hey, I’m glad I run into ya.  I wanna 
                        talk.  

           Joe Sr. gestures toward a car at the curb; Joe Jr. stands 
           guard ominously.  Ruddy swallows, trying to stay composed. 

                                 RUDDY
                        It’s kinda late.  How ‘bout we meet for 
                        brunch?   

           Ruddy tries stepping around, but Gianni Russo appears, 
           blocking his path.  

                                 JOE SR.
                        Fuck brunch, Producer.  Get in the car.

           Ruddy moves toward the car and Joe Jr., who eyeballs him.

                                 JOE JR.
                        You read my script yet?  

           INT. DARKENED HALLWAY - LATER

           FROM BLACK a door opens, illuminating the hallway.  Joe 
           Sr. leads Ruddy inside by the elbow, Joe Jr. and Gianni 
           Russo behind them.  They walk in tense silence for awhile 
           before Russo leans forward suddenly, startling Ruddy.

                                 GIANNI RUSSO
                        Hey, you think I could be in the movie?
                                 RUDDY
                        Wha-- absolutely, yes--

                                 JOE SR.
                        Knock it off, Russo.  

                                 GIANNI RUSSO
                        I been told I got a good face.  

           Joe Sr. quiets him with a look, turning back to Ruddy.

                                 JOE SR.
                        I’ve been considering this problem of 
                        ours.  And it occurred to me, maybe he 
                        don’t think we’re organized.

                                 RUDDY
                        No, I know you’re organized.  
                               (off Columbo’s glare)
                        Shutting down our set.  My car.  Ya know, 
                        my secretary broke her wristwatch diving 
                        for cover.    

                                 JOE SR.
                        We don’t know nothing about that.  

                                 RUDDY
                               (testing him)
                        About what?

           Joe Sr. stops at a set of double doors, beyond which the 
           MUFFLED DIN OF MUSIC is just audible.  

                                 JOE SR.
                        On the other side ‘a these doors is a 
                        personal hell for you.  

                                 RUDDY
                        Mr. Columbo, threatening me--

                                 JOE SR.
                        No, I want you to see it before you start 
                        begging.  Boys... 

           Gianni Russo and Joe Jr. move to open the doors; Ruddy 
           breathing erratically in anticipation of the horror!

           RUDDY’S POV: The doors open, revealing... MADISON SQUARE 
           GARDEN: FRANK SINATRA onstage wrapping up Fly Me To The 
           Moon before a FULL AUDIENCE.  

           Stunned and confused, Ruddy watches for a beat before Joe 
           Sr. signals his men to close the doors again.  Leaning in:

                                 JOE SR. (CONT’D)
                        Sold out crowd.  All proceeds go to 
                        stopping your little cinematic 
                        crucifixion of the Italian peoples.  At 
                        least six hundred K says my man at the 
                        door.  
                                 RUDDY
                        Sir, to be clear, I fully acknowledge we 
                        can’t shoot The Godfather in New York 
                        without your okay.  That’s why I’ve been 
                        trying to find you.  So I can make an 
                        unprecedented offer I feel will put to 
                        bed all your concerns.  If you’ll just 
                        hear me out--

           He’s interrupted by the doors flying open, FRANK SINATRA 
           (55) having just left the stage to THUNDEROUS APPLAUSE.     

                                 FRANK SINATRA
                               (noticing)
                        Oh, hey Joe!

                                 JOE SR.
                        Frankie-boy!

           They embrace, the jovial Sinatra then noticing Ruddy.  

                                 FRANK SINATRA
                        Who we got here? 

                                 JOE SR.
                        Ah, this is Al Ruddy, producer of The 
                        Godfather.

           Sinatra’s smile melts into sheer contempt.

                                 FRANK SINATRA
                        My agent sends over a screen test and you 
                        pricks don’t even gimme a callback?!

           He grabs Ruddy’s tie, pulling him in! 

                                 FRANK SINATRA (CONT’D)
                        I oughta’ break your fuckin’ legs.  

                                 JOE JR.
                        ‘at’s what I’m talkin’ about!--  

                                 JOE SR.
                        Junior!  

           Junior shuts up.  Sinatra eyes Ruddy a bit longer, then 
           releases him, nods to Joe Sr. and exits down the hall.  

                                 JOE SR. (CONT’D)
                        See?  It’s these musicians ya gotta worry 
                        about.  
                               (fixing Ruddy’s tie)
                        I don’t like violence, Al.  I’m a 
                        businessman.  Blood costs too much.  

           He slides the knot up on Ruddy’s tie, choking him a bit.

                                 JOE SR. (CONT’D)
                        So, what’s your offer?

           PRE-LAP: THE SOUND OF A VAN DOOR SLIDING OPEN...
           EXT. BRANDO’S MANSION - DAY

           Coppola and Roos step out of the van, accompanied by a 
           CAMERAMAN and SOUNDMAN lugging equipment.  

                                 FRED ROOS
                        Alright, fellas, move as quickly and 
                        quietly as you can.  Rumor is he don’t 
                        like noise.

           Coppola takes in the scene... 

           REVEAL: The large circular driveway where the rainmaking 
           ritual occurred earlier.  The Native American setting 
           (bonfire, roasting spits, huts, canoes, totum poles, 
           buffalo hides, pottery) lays in ruin, pillaged and still 
           smoking; almost as if... well, the white man came through.  

                                 COPPOLA
                               (sotto)
                        What the hell?  
                               (then)
                        Bury My Heart At Wounded Knee.  

           Suddenly, Brando appears wearing a kimono and a straw 
           hat.  He is not his usual jovial self. 

                                 COPPOLA (CONT’D)
                        Hey, Marlon.  

                                 BRANDO
                        What’s the camera for?  

                                 COPPOLA
                        Well, you were worried about playing an 
                        aging Italian.  I figured we could film 
                        the makeup test, you can improv a little 
                        and then see how you look.

           He waits nervously to see if Brando buys it.  Eventually:

                                 BRANDO
                        Very well.  

                                 COPPOLA
                               (relieved)
                        Great.  
                               (to the crew)
                        Let’s set up inside.  

           He looks back at Brando, who’s despondent over the site.  

                                 COPPOLA (CONT’D)
                        Marlon, are you okay to do this?  
                               (re: the destruction)
                        What happened here?

                                 BRANDO
                        Someone told the tribe I can’t get them 
                        SAG cards.  They sought reparations.  
                                 COPPOLA
                        Jesus.  I’m sorry.  

           They watch the charred tatters of the large teepee 
           flutter in the wind.  CLOSE ON: Brando as he removes the 
           straw hat, his face filled with emotion.

                                 BRANDO
                        Look how they massacred my teepee.  

                                                               CUT TO:

           VIDEOTAPE SCREEN TEST FOOTAGE: 

           Inside Brando’s house, WE WATCH him exit his bedroom 
           pulling his blond ponytail up into a bun.  He removes the 
           kimono and slips on a suit jacket.  He then methodically 
           bends the corners of his dress shirt collar.   

                                 BRANDO
                               (to camera)
                        All those old Italians bend their collars 
                        this way.  Like a fin.  

           Satisfied, he sits at a table with cigars, cheese, and 
           salami (props).  We think he’s considering what to eat 
           until he plucks a wad of Kleenex and begins packing it in 
           his mouth.  In the Don’s voice:

                                 BRANDO (AS DON CORLEONE) (CONT’D)
                        See, he should have the face of a 
                        bulldog.  Mean-looking, but warm 
                        underneath.  

           Brando stands and moves to a mirror; shuffling with 
           cautious efficiency.  

                                 BRANDO (AS DON CORLEONE) (CONT’D)
                        And this man doesn’t move fast.  He’s 
                        already ten steps ahead of you.  

           He takes a can of black shoe polish and rubs it through 
           his blondish locks.  

                                 BRANDO (AS DON CORLEONE) (CONT’D)
                        The hair’s dark, tight.  He’s elegant, 
                        but not given to frivolity.  After all, 
                        he makes his living in the shadows.  

           Brando scratches his neck with the back of his finger-
           nails, slowly transforming into the character.  

                                 BRANDO (AS DON CORLEONE) (CONT’D)
                        And yet, he’s managed to bathe his wild 
                        beast in legitimacy.  That’s why the 
                        other animali respect him.  He refuses to 
                        be a fool dancing on a string.

           He pauses for a moment, just breathing as the CAMERA 
           ZOOMS IN; it’s amazing.  He is Don Corleone.  
           The silence is broken when Brando’s PHONE RINGS.  The Don 
           acknowledges it with a shrug.  

                                 COPPOLA (O.S.)
                        Do you need to take that, Marlon?  

           Brando ignores him, answering the phone as the Don.

                                 BRANDO (ON PHONE AS CORLEONE)
                        Yes?... (LISTENS)  Am I happy with my 
                        long distance?  Who frets over such 
                        things?... (LISTENS)  A favor?  But then 
                        you must do one for me... (LISTENS)  No, 
                        not now.  The day may never come...  

           WE PULL BACK FROM THE FOOTAGE REVEALING...

           INT. BLUHDORN’S OFFICE / GULF & WESTERN (NYC) - DAY

           ... a FINELY-SUITED MAN in horn-rimmed glasses leaning   
           over the TV on which the screen test is playing.  This is:

           SUPER: “Charles G. Bluhdorn, Chairman of Gulf & Western”  

           Enamored with Brando, and in his thick Austrian accent:  

                                 CHARLIE BLUHDORN
                        ‘zat’s incredible!  He became ‘zis man 
                        before our very eyes!  

           Nearby, Jaffe simmers.  Coppola, Evans, Roos, and Ruddy 
           are beaming.   

                                 EVANS
                        Evans agrees, Charlie-baby.  Though I’m 
                        humbled you’d concern yourself with 
                        matters so trivial.

                                 CHARLIE BLUHDORN
                        ‘Vell, Paramount may be just a 
                        subsidiary, but no tape of Marlon Brando 
                        ‘vill escape my attention.  

                                 EVANS
                               (smug, to Jaffe)
                        Huh.  I shoulda’ known.    

                                 JAFFE
                        We oughta’ keep our options open.  He 
                        hasn’t agreed to our conditions yet--  

                                 CHARLIE BLUHDORN
                        Conditions?!  Ask for ‘vhatever you vant, 
                        but under no circumstances ‘vill you turn 
                        him ‘avay.  He is ‘facking amazing! 
                               (a bad Brando impression)
                        “’ze day may never come.”  Ha, I love it!
                                 JAFFE
                        I gotta say, Charlie.  Actors like Brando 
                        with no accountability and crazy demands 
                        make my position as studio chief 
                        impossibly difficult--

                                 CHARLIE BLUHDORN
                        ‘vell, so ‘vat?  You make a vast salary 
                        to endure such stunts.  Deal ‘vit it.  

           Evans winks at Jaffe, now livid.  

                                 CHARLIE BLUHDORN (CONT’D)
                        So, ‘vat about Michael?  Do ‘ve have 
                        another star?

                                 EVANS
                        You want another star?  How about Ryan O’-
                        Fucking-Neal?

           Bluhdorn leans back, blanching.  Evans’ face drops.

                                 CHARLIE BLUHDORN
                        O’Neal?... ‘ze Irishman... Hmm...

                                 EVANS
                        Wait’ll ya see his test, Charlie.  He--

                                 CHARLIE BLUHDORN
                        I’ve seen it.  I ‘zink ‘ve can do better.  

           Roos looks at Coppola while stroking his gold cross -- 
           there’s that miracle!

                                 CHARLIE BLUHDORN (CONT’D)
                        Moodier.  Mercurial.  O’Neal’s a ‘facking 
                        Boyscout.  

           Now it’s Evans’ turn for silent anger, Jaffe smiling! 

                                 EVANS
                        ‘course.  But consider the business--

           A SECURITY GUARD abruptly comes through the door.  

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        I’m sorry, gentlemen.  We need to vacate 
                        the building.  There’s been a bomb threat.  

           Nervous looks, but for Evans who wants to continue arguing:

                                 EVANS
                        It’s bullshit.  All this time in showbiz 
                        Evans never been near a bomb.  

           EXT. GULF & WESTERN BUILDING (NEW YORK CITY) - LATER

           It’s chaos as FIRETRUCKS and POLICE surround the front of 
           the building, along with countless LOITERING EMPLOYEES.  

           Off to one side, Bluhdorn and Jaffe appear to be arguing.  
           Nearby, a clearly displeased Evans approaches Coppola and 
           Roos.  He blows cigar smoke right in Coppola’s face.  

                                 EVANS
                        Don’t get any ideas, Francis.  I’ll see 
                        every cry-baby in town before I consider 
                        that dwarf Pacino again.  Nicholson, 
                        Beatty, that kid who mumbled his way 
                        through The Graduate.  All of ‘em.

                                 COPPOLA
                        Fine.  And Bob... thanks for Brando.  
                        Only you could’ve pulled that off.  

           Evans offers a curt nod and meanders away, just as a 
           guilty Ruddy returns from talking to a cop. 

                                 RUDDY
                        Cop says the threat came from a phone 
                        booth in Little Italy.  Looks like 
                        Columbo’s playing hardball right up to 
                        the showdown.  

                                 FRED ROOS
                        What showdown?

                                 RUDDY
                        The League’s reading the script tomorrow.  
                        I made them consultants.  

                                 COPPOLA
                        ... You did what? 

                                 RUDDY
                        How else was I gonna get them to engage?  
                        I offered the chance to help craft a real 
                        blockbuster from the ground up, to make 
                        sure it’s sensitive to their concerns.  

                                 COPPOLA
                        Jesus Christ, Al!  And what if the League 
                        decides the five families all go out for 
                        gelato and Don Corleone’s elected 
                        President? 

                                 RUDDY
                        We’ll talk ‘em out of it.  

                                 COPPOLA
                        “We?!”  

                                 RUDDY
                        Yeah, I need you to come.  
                               (off Coppola’s scoff)
                        Listen Francis, my instincts tell me, 
                        more than anything, Columbo wants us to 
                        feel him shake the earth.  It’s about 
                        power more than substance.  Now, I’m not 
                        sure yet how we show that deference 
                        without destroying the film, but we’re 
                        gonna have to give him something.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 RUDDY (CONT'D)

                        production coming to his picayune meeting 
                        is a good start.  
                               (pauses, then)
                        You said I had your confidence.  Do I?

           Coppola considers, not answering.

                        associates that came as far as from 
                        Poughkeepsie, Newark, and other 
                        territories of the tri-state area.  Thank 
                        you.

           CAMERA LANDS on Coppola and Ruddy sitting anxiously 
           amongst these pseudo-gangsters.    

           Gianni Russo seats Joe Sr. and pours him a glass of water.

                                 JOE SR. (CONT’D)
                        How did things ever get so far?  It’s so 
                        unfortunate, so unnecessary to stifle 
                        cinema, but the myth of this so-called 
                        “mafia” has to rubbed out.  
                               (dry spits)
                        Morto!     

           As Joe Sr’s speech continues, Gianni Russo creeps from 
           behind and sticks his head between Ruddy and Coppola.

                                 GIANNI RUSSO
                               (to Ruddy, hushed)
                        Hey, yo, I read the book again.  And I 
                        really do think I’d be a dynamite Sonny.  

           Ruddy nods, hoping Gianni will go away.  He doesn’t.
                                 GIANNI RUSSO (CONT’D)
                        I got the anger issues.  And let me tell 
                        ya, in these pants is a loaf that’ll 
                        choke a goddamn horse and I ain’t afraid 
                        to show it.   

                                 RUDDY
                               (hurried)
                        ‘kay, you’re on the list.  Thank you.

           Russo leans back.  Coppola looks at Ruddy, aghast.  

                                 JOE SR.
                        ... because we have here the script for 
                        The Godfather, which we will now 
                        “purview” and consult upon.  Gentlemen.    

           A hushed SILENCE as the men open their scripts, put on 
           glasses, COUGH, etc. and begin reading.  WE SEE a medley 
           of squinting confusion until, finally:

                                 ANTHONY MAIDA
                        What the fuck is “Fade In”?  

                                 JOE JR.
                               (showing off for Coppola)
                        It means the screen comes up from black.

                                 ANTHONY MAIDA
                        Ah...  That’s good.

           Another silent beat.  They read, then:

                                 ED LUCHESSI
                        How ‘bout “Int”?  What’s an “Int”?

                                 COPPOLA
                        Short for “interior”.  “Interior Don’s 
                        office”.   

                                 ED LUCHESSI
                        Who the hell is Don, tough guy?

                                 COPPOLA
                        No, the Don.  Don Corleone.  From the 
                        book.

                                 ED LUCHESSI
                        Never read it.  But this office sounds 
                        nice.     

           More reading, then:

                                 JERRY D’ALESSANDRO
                        Why’s this Bonasera gotta say he believes 
                        in America?  Who don’t?  If he’s some 
                        kinda’ half a fag pinko, change that 
                        shit.   
                                 JOE SR.
                               (pointedly, to Coppola)
                        Agreed.  We’re not communists.  

           The table raucously AGREES, under which a disillusioned 
           Coppola whispers to Ruddy:

                                 COPPOLA
                        We’ll never get through this, Al.  Not 
                        without pop-up books.   

           But Ruddy doesn’t hear; his wheels are spinning, in the 
           midst of a breakthrough.  Secretary Greco speaks up.  

                                 SECRETARY GRECO
                        Says the undertaker made his fortune 
                        here.  What kinda’ cash we talkin’ about?

           The others TEEM with similar questions.  Ruddy snaps to.  

                                 RUDDY
                               (taking over)
                        Gentlemen.  Gentlemen, please!  
                               (as they hush)
                        I think I can save us all a lot of time if 
                        you’ll indulge me for just a moment.  
                               (to Joe Sr.)
                        You mentioned communism; how many of you 
                        know it was conceived in Germany, not 
                        Russia?  
                               (no response)
                        And that its roots as a concept go as far 
                        back as Ancient Greece.  Before the 
                        written word even.  

                                 JOE SR.
                        Goddamn history lesson now? 

                                 RUDDY
                        It’s an ideology as old as mankind.  From 
                        all over the world.  And yet, we identify 
                        it as Russian.  Does that sound familiar?   

                                 ED LUCHESSI
                        Yeah, it do.  

                                 JOE SR.
                        It do?

                                 ED LUCHESSI
                        Yeah.  Couple months ago, my little girl 
                        shows me her U.S. History book, talking 
                        about the great Italian migration.  And 
                        before it mentions our food, or our 
                        music, or craftsmanship, it says we 
                        brought over “La Cosa Nostra”.  That’s 
                        our great contribution.  Like no other 
                        kinda’ peoples came with a few bad 
                        apples.   
                                 RUDDY
                        But they put a name on yours, the 
                        “mafia”.  They created a word to give it 
                        special significance.  Increased 
                        attention.  Just like “pinko”.  You hear 
                        that, you think Soviets and you sit up.  

                                 ANTHONY MAIDA
                        Sorry, what the hell are we talkin’ about 
                        here?

           The others GRUNT their own confusion.  Coppola shoots 
           Ruddy an alarmed look, but Ruddy persists...  

                                 RUDDY
                        There’s no common name for the Irish mob 
                        in America, or the Chinese mob in 
                        America, or the Polish, the Greeks, even 
                        the Russians.  Just the Italians.  

                                 ANTHONY MAIDA
                        That’s an infamia!  

                                 RUDDY
                        Yes!  That... whatever it means.  ‘Cuz 
                        when you give something a name, you pull 
                        it out of the crowd.  You make it a 
                        separate target.  You all want to erase 
                        the myth of the mafia, erase the name.   
                               (holds up his script)
                        We’ll help you start right here.  

                                 JERRY D’ALESSANDRO
                        Meaning what?  You’ll take out the word 
                        “mafia”?

                                 RUDDY
                        And “La Cosa Nostra”.  That way, we’re 
                        not actually saying the story’s about 
                        anything larger than these men --  
                               (gesturing to Luchessi)
                        Just some bad apples doing what bad 
                        apples do.  

           The men exchange looks; entertaining the idea.  Coppola 
           smiles at Ruddy, a twinkle in his eye!  

                                 JOE SR.
                               (to Coppola)
                        You’d do this for us?  Sounds like a big 
                        change. 

                                 COPPOLA
                               (humbling himself)
                        It’s, uh... it’s massive.  Probably take 
                        me weeks, but if it’s what you want... 

           The League members appear satisfied; all but Joe Jr.  

                                 JOE JR.
                        But these bad apples.  They’re still 
                        Italians.  
           The table MURMURS discord.  Ruddy looks around 
           desperately, not wanting to lose his momentum.  His gaze 
           lands on Gianni Russo, which sparks another lighting bolt!  

                                 RUDDY
                        Hey, who wants to be in the movie?!   

           The men go silent, looking at each other for approval.  
           Finally, D’Alessandro raises his hand, then everyone else 
           does too; the entire room suddenly GIDDY WITH ANTICIPATION!  

           Joe Sr. stands and extends his arms toward Ruddy.  Ruddy 
           has no idea what this is, but eventually figures out to 
           hug the man, which he does awkwardly as the men APPLAUD.  

           EXT. PARK SHERATON HOTEL (NYC) - LATER - DAY

           Ruddy and Coppola exit the hotel and head down the street.  
           They look sternly at one another, then burst into LAUGHTER. 

                                 RUDDY
                        How many times is “mafia” in the script?  

                                 COPPOLA
                        Once.  And “Cosa Nostra” not at all.  

                                 RUDDY
                        Aaah, they don’t need to know that.  

           They LAUGH again, Coppola putting his arm around Ruddy.

                                 COPPOLA
                        Well, we’re in business.  ‘cept now I 
                        gotta put all those mopes on camera.  

                                 RUDDY
                        I had to push ‘em over somehow.
                               (shrugs)
                        Everybody wants to be in pictures.  

           They trudge off; the beginning of a lifelong friendship.  

           INT. PRODUCTION OFFICE BULLPEN (NYC) - NIGHT

           It’s late.  Lucas, Coppola, Fred Roos and Ruddy sit 
           around, eating spaghetti.  Takeout boxes sit nearby.   

                                 LUCAS 
                        What about Nicholson?    

                                 COPPOLA
                        We tested him.  
                               (cueing him)
                        Fred?...  

                                 FRED ROOS
                               (doing a spot on Nicholson)
                        Luca Brasi put a gun to his head and, uh, 
                        pulled the fucking trigger!  

           He does Nicholson’s crazy laugh; eliciting CHUCKLES from all. 
                                 RUDDY
                        What’d Evans think?

                                 COPPOLA
                        Good, just not Michael.  Same with 
                        Beatty, Hoffman, Bobby DeNiro, Martin 
                        Sheen, David Carradine, Dean Stockwell. 

                                 LUCAS
                               (dry)
                        Wow.  Can I have a shot?

                                 COPPOLA
                        Bluhdorn mentioned Charles Bronson.  And 
                        Evans is talking Redford again.     

                                 FRED ROOS
                        He’s it if we don’t think of something 
                        quick.  
                               (off Coppola’s outrage)
                        We’re three weeks out! 

                                 COPPOLA
                        Pacino was born to play this part.  I 
                        know it.

                                 RUDDY
                        Evans won’t have it.

           Lucas dangles pasta over his mouth, lowering it in.  
           Coppola watches, disgusted.   

                                 COPPOLA
                        George, you’re in New York now.  You 
                        can’t eat pasta like a white man. 
                               (handing him a spoon)
                        Twirl!  

           Lucas ignores the spoon, carries on as before.  Coppola 
           shakes his head, but then something occurs to him.  

                                 FRED ROOS
                        So, Francie, what should we do about 
                        Michael?    

                                 COPPOLA
                               (watching Lucas)
                        ... Ask him to Sunday dinner.  

           EXT. PATSY’S RESTAURANT (56TH ST., NYC) - NIGHT 

           The authentic Italian restaurant’s neon red sign FLICKERS 
           as a beacon to the carbohydrate-deprived.  

           Coppola waits out front in the cold.  Talia approaches 
           hurriedly, but stops short when she sees her brother.  
           There are still some hard feelings between these two.     

                                 COPPOLA
                        Hey.
                                 TALIA
                        You’re waiting?  Am I that late?-- 

                                 COPPOLA
                        No, no, you’re early.  I asked you in 
                        before everyone else. 

                                 TALIA
                        Oh.  Well, it’s freezing.  Let’s get 
                        inside.  

           She moves for the door, but he blocks her.  

                                 COPPOLA
                        Before we do... 
                               (hesitates)
                        I saw your play last night.

                                 TALIA
                               (skeptical)
                        It’s a black box, Francis.  I would’ve 
                        noticed you.  

                                 COPPOLA
                        I hid in the back.  I wore a poncho.  

                                 TALIA
                        Why did you hide?

                                 COPPOLA
                        ‘Cuz in all the knock-down, drag out 
                        fights I’ve had with Bob Evans, he never 
                        once held you over my head like I said he 
                        would.  Made me wonder if I missed 
                        something.  
                               (pauses, smiling)
                        Turns out I did.  

           Her emotions surfacing, Talia hugs him tightly.  She 
           wipes away a few tears and then looks at him.

                                 TALIA
                        What?

                                 COPPOLA
                        I need a favor.  

           He holds the door open for her and they enter.  

           SUPER: “March 17, 1971” 

           INT. PATSY’S RESTAURANT / PRIVATE ROOM - LATER

           PAN ACROSS: The Corleone family (Brando, Caan, Talia, 
           ROBERT DUVALL, JOHN CAZALE, and MORGANA KING), seated 
           around a table, a full Italian spread before them.  

                                 COPPOLA (O.S.)
                        Just live in the characters.  Eat like 
                        they’d eat.  Talk about what they’d talk 
                        about.  
           Only Brando watches Coppola speak.  The rest (all relative 
           newcomers) gawk at their Lord and Savior, Marlon Brando!  

                                 COPPOLA (CONT’D)
                        Fight however they would.  Remember, it’s 
                        1942.  The war’s in full swing, and here 
                        you are at another boring Sunday dinner 
                        with mom and dad.

           ANGLE: The glowing eyes of the young actors are burning 
           holes through Brando, who politely pretends not to notice.

                                 COPPOLA (CONT’D)
                        Just a little improv, okay?  Pretend 
                        we’re not here.

           Coppola sits beside Fred Roos, Ruddy, and Lucas.  The 
           cast does nothing but stare at Brando.  Seeing he’ll have 
           to take the initiative, Brando begins uncorking the wine.  

                                 BRANDO (AS DON CORLEONE)
                        How was everyone’s day?

           He pours his “wife” some wine and gradually the others 
           remember what they’re here to do.  

                                 JOHN CAZALE (AS FREDO)
                        Pretty good, Pop.  Thinkin’ ‘bout getting 
                        a motorcycle.

                                 JAMES CAAN (AS SONNY)
                        Yeah, and I’m gettin’ a mop, so’s when he 
                        flies over the handlebars, I can clean 
                        his ass off the street.  

                                 TALIA (AS CONNIE)
                        Sonny! 

                                 BRANDO (AS DON CORLEONE)
                        Is this necessary?  Language in front of 
                        your mother.  

           As they continue, Pacino skulks in through the dark entrance.  
           Coppola rushes up before Pacino can take in the scene.  

                                 COPPOLA
                        Thanks for coming, Al.  I just wanted to 
                        apologize again for what happened at your 
                        screen test.  

                                 PACINO
                        Don’t be sorry.  My whole life I been 
                        rejected.  As a baby, my mother’s breasts 
                        recoiled at my touch--
                               (noticing Brando)
                        Jesus Christ, is that who I think it is?!

                                 COPPOLA
                        Al, give me your coat.  
           Pacino’s frozen, staring at Brando.  Coppola helps him 
           out of his coat.  

                                 PACINO
                        But, wha-- why am I here--

                                 COPPOLA
                        Shhhh.  
                               (gesturing toward the table)
                        Go be Michael.  

           CLOSE ON Pacino; he takes in the moment, steeling himself.    

           A beat later, the “family” chatter dies down as “Michael” 
           sits and begins serving himself.  Then, Brando to Pacino:

                                 BRANDO (AS DON CORLEONE)
                        What time do we supper in this house?

                                 PACINO (AS MICHAEL)
                        Sorry.  Bus got stuck on Broadway.

                                 JAMES CAAN (AS SONNY)
                        Sure you weren’t just stuck on a broad?

           Sonny looks for laughs from his “siblings”, then tickles 
           Fredo when he tries not to smile.  The Don bristles.   

           ANGLE ON: Evans walks in urgently.  Coppola is waiting.   

                                 EVANS
                        What’s going on?  Where’s the emergency?

                                 COPPOLA
                        I wanted you to see this.  

           He gestures to the family dinner which Evans drinks in 
           approvingly until he spots Pacino.  Furious:

                                 EVANS
                        Jesus Christ, is that who I think it is?!  

                                 COPPOLA
                        Just watch him in action for five 
                        minutes, Bob.  Five minutes.  

                                 EVANS
                               (turning to leave)
                        You’re outta your fuckin’ skull, Coppola.

           Coppola puts a hand on his shoulder, stopping him.

                                 COPPOLA
                        Five minutes!  And if you’re not 
                        convinced, I’ll go with Redford no 
                        questions asked.  You won’t hear a peep 
                        outta me.  Please.  

           Evans chokes back his discord and huffs.  But he stays.

           Talia watches Coppola out of the corner of her eye.  
           The director gives her a conspiratorial nod and Talia 
           quickly turns on the waterworks...

                                 MORGANA KING (AS MAMA) 
                        Constanzia, what’s wrong?  

           Connie looks tearfully at Michael, hesitant to respond.  

                                 TALIA (AS CONNIE)
                        Michael is enlisting.  

                                 MORGANA KING (AS MAMA)
                        ... what?  

                                 TALIA (AS CONNIE)
                        I heard.  

           Michael looks between Fredo and Hagen, seeking the 
           culprit.  Hagen looks down culpably.  Sonny is shocked.   

                                 BRANDO  (AS DON CORLEONE)
                               (to Pacino)
                        Is it so?

                                 PACINO (AS MICHAEL) 
                        That’s right, Pop.  I wish to serve my 
                        country.

                                 BRANDO (AS DON CORLEONE)
                        You wish to serve strangers.

                                 ROBERT DUVALL (AS TOM HAGEN)
                        Michael, before you do anything--

                                 PACINO (AS MICHAEL)
                               (cutting him off)
                        Now, hold on, Tom.  I’m speaking to my 
                        father.  

           ANGLE: Evans registers the firmness of Pacino’s shift in 
           demeanor, a bit surprised.

                                 PACINO (AS MICHAEL) (CONT’D)
                               (to Brando)
                        You find this foolish?

                                 JAMES CAAN (AS SONNY)
                        It’s goddamn wreckless!

                                 BRANDO (AS DON CORLEONE)
                               (silencing him)
                        Santino.  
                               (to Michael)
                        Young men often have something to prove--

                                 PACINO (AS MICHAEL)
                        I’ve got nothing to prove. 

                                 BRANDO (AS DON CORLEONE)
                        A boy your age wouldn’t know.   
                                 PACINO (AS MICHAEL)
                        Men my age are dying to protect our way 
                        of life.  Egalitarian.  Moral.   
                               (with muted cynicism)
                        Like you, Pop.  

           Everyone at the table clocks Michael’s insinuation, 
           looking for the Don’s response.  

                                 BRANDO (AS DON CORLEONE)
                        And yet, you claim nothing to prove. 

                                 PACINO (AS MICHAEL)
                        I’m signing up.

                                 BRANDO (AS DON CORLEONE)
                        You’ll be classified 4-F.  

           Michael registers the Don’s implication.  He turns to 
           Hagen, who nods affirmative.

           Evans moves closer to the scene, curious where Pacino 
           will go next.  And what happens is what makes Pacino 
           “Michael”; his eyes go dead, black.  He is chilling in 
           his plainspokenness; his brilliant and ruthless cunning.   

                                 PACINO (AS MICHAEL)
                               (to Brando)
                        You pull many strings.  None with me.  I 
                        don’t fear you, and that’s where your 
                        power ends.  Can you stop me going to 
                        Canada and enlisting--?

                                 TALIA (AS CONNIE)
                        Michael, stop it. 

                                 PACINO (AS MICHAEL)
                               (to Brando, undeterred)
                        Perhaps I’ll rob a liquor store or punch 
                        a cop, and some downtown judge offers me 
                        military service or jail.  What will you 
                        do then?

                                 TALIA (AS CONNIE)
                        That’s plenty about the war tonight.  

                                 PACINO (AS MICHAEL)
                               (to his father, mercilessly)
                        How will it look when a Don -- Godfather 
                        to his people -- won’t let his son join 
                        the same war his paisan lose their boys 
                        to every day?  Forcing that son to hop a 
                        steamer and abscond.  

                                 TALIA (AS CONNIE)
                        I mean it!  Can’t we just eat?

                                 PACINO (AS MICHAEL)
                               (one last shot at his father)
                        Why, it might make you seem a hypocrite.  
           Evans chuckles at this; the confrontation has him rapt.  

                                 TALIA (AS CONNIE)
                        No more, you two.  No more!  I’m sorry I 
                        brought it up!  I--  

           She breaks down, falling into Mama Corleone’s arms.  

                                 MORGANA KING  (AS MAMA CORLEONE)
                        That’s enough.  Cambiare argomento.  
                        Change the subject.  

           Connie cries softly as Michael continues to stare down 
           his father.  The Don eventually breaks eye contact, 
           returning to his meal.  As if it’s the final word: 

                                 BRANDO (AS DON CORLEONE)
                        You’ve upset your sister.  

           But it’s clear Michael won the argument as the Corleones 
           all begin eating again.  

           Evans watches them simply exist as a unit, mesmerized.  

           MUSIC: Then, (AND ONLY THEN) do we hear the softest bars 
           of Nino Rota’s Godfather score, symbolically punctuating 
           the hard fought birth of the Corleone family.  

           As they break bread, conversation resuming, Evans sits 
           beside Coppola.  Both continue to watch Pacino, consumed.    

                                 EVANS
                               (leaning in)
                        Alright, Francis.  You can have your 
                        midget.  

           Relief washes over Coppola.  As he closes his eyes and 
           releases the biggest sigh of his life, WE PRE-LAP: 

                                 JAFFE (PRE-LAP)
                        Pacino won’t make it past the first week.  

           INT. JAFFE’S OFFICE (FILMWAYS STUDIOS) - DAY

           Stanley Jaffe stands in his office addressing a GROUP OF 
           PEOPLE sitting.  WE ONLY SEE THE BACKS OF THEIR HEADS...

                                 JAFFE
                        Neither will Brando.  Coppola.  Or, God 
                        willing, that sun-fried sack ‘a shit in 
                        an ascot Bob Evans.  He may have a way 
                        with Charlie Bluhdorn, but I spoke to 
                        Paramount’s Board of Directors and they 
                        agree; sometimes you have to save the 
                        parent company from itself.  We could 
                        have Sinatra in this film.  O’Neal!  
                        Redford!  Stars!  Instead, they pick 
                        Blando and the hairy afterbirth of some 
                        cocker spaniel.  That can’t be allowed.  
                        The Board has the balls to rectify poor 
                        leadership.  Which is why you’re here.  
           REVEAL: His audience, key personnel from the earlier 
           production meeting -- Nikki Roberts (Prod. Coordinator), 
           Alejandro Estevez (Art Director), Jake Webber (Camera), 
           Aram Avakian (Editor), and Steve Kesten (1st A.D.).

                        You all work directly for Coppola or a 
                        department head loyal to him.  Once 
                        they’re gone, you lieutenants will ensure 
                        a smooth transition for our new actors 
                        and director.  You’ll be handsomely 
                        rewarded.  

                                 KESTEN
                        Who is the new director?  

                                 JAFFE
                               (a Mona Lisa smile)
                        A definite step up.

                                 JAKE WEBBER
                        You’re asking us to betray our mentors.  
                        Gordy Willis got me on this picture.  Now 
                        I should just stab him in the back?     

                                 JAFFE
                        Only if you wanna be Cinematographer on 
                        the biggest picture of the year.  

                                 JAKE WEBBER
                               (caving fast)
                        He’ll always be in my heart.  That’s what 
                        counts.  

           The other lieutenants AGREE -- now bought and paid for!  

                                 ALEJANDRO ESTEVEZ
                               (to Jaffe)
                        If you have the support, why let them 
                        start filming?  Fire them now.  

                                 JAFFE
                        To save face with Charlie, the Board 
                        wants to give ‘em a few days.  That way 
                        when shit slips up, it’ll justify 
                        overruling Bluhdorn.   

                                 NIKKI ROBERTS
                        Yeah, but what if everything goes 
                        perfect?  

                                 BART (O.S.)
                        On a film set?  

           Everyone looks toward another corner of the room where WE 
           REVEAL: Peter Bart (Evans’ V.P.) has been sitting all along.

                                 BART (CONT’D)
                        When’s the last time that happened?

                                                           SLAM CUT TO:
           CLOSE ON the angry face of GORDON WILLIS.   

                                 WILLIS
                        Why you little punk!  What the hell are 
                        you doin’, tellin’ me my business?!   
                               (re: some film lights)
                        I pulled them flags off a’ here because I 
                        want contrast, you ignorant snot-nose.  

           REVEAL -- INT. GENCO OLIVE OIL OFFICE SET (FILMWAYS STUDIOS)

           A CREW preps to shoot the Don’s meeting with Sollozzo (in 
           which the Don refuses to sell drugs).  ACTORS and STAND-
           INS also bustle about as Willis faces off with Coppola.   

                                 COPPOLA
                               (staying composed)
                        The glare off their faces is too harsh, 
                        Gordy--

                                 WILLIS
                        These overheads are the source.  It 
                        should be harsh!  Christ, it’s a pack a’ 
                        dagos in a fucking warehouse not Audrey 
                        Hepburn on the goddamn Spanish steps!    
                               (to his grips)
                        Now bring those kickers in.

                                 COPPOLA
                               (to the grips)
                        No, hold on.  It’s too bright--

                                 WILLIS
                               (over him, to the grips)
                        Goddamn it, I said take ‘em in!  

           Willis ditches Coppola abruptly to confer with his 
           cameraman, Webber.  Coppola steams as Kesten approaches. 

                                 KESTEN
                               (re: Willis)
                        Let him use a lava lamp if he wants.  
                        It’s Day 3 and we’re half a day behind.  

                                 COPPOLA
                        I asked for eighty days, they gave me 
                        fifty.  It’s a tricky lighting scheme 
                        we’re trying.  Good work takes time.

                                 KESTEN
                        The lighting isn’t our only problem.

           Kesten gestures toward the set where...

           ANGLE: Brando (dressed as the Don) approaches actor AL 
           LETTIERI (Sollozzo) with Scotch Tape and index cards upon 
           which he’s scribbled his lines for the scene.  

                                 BRANDO
                        It’s Al, right?
           Before Lettieri can answer, Brando presses one card onto 
           his tie and another directly on his forehead!   

                                 AL LETTIERI
                        Yes, Mr. Brando, um...  Sir, can I ask 
                        what you’re doing.

                                 BRANDO
                               (looks up, ”duh”)
                        Learning my lines... And, please, call me 
                        Marlon.  

           ANGLE: Kesten turns back to Coppola.

                                 KESTEN
                        He’s completely unprepared.  

           Coppola watches Brando sit across from Lettieri.

                                 AL LETTIERI
                               (re: index cards)
                        If I move, won’t these fall off?  

                                 BRANDO
                               (pointing to his head)
                        Not to worry.  I have a backup.

           He grabs the prop bottle of anisette from the scene, on 
           the back of which he has also taped his lines!

                                 AL LETTIERI
                        Dream come true to work with you, Marlon. 

           ANGLE: Back on Kesten, looking expectantly at Coppola.

                                 COPPOLA
                        He’s a brilliant actor.  We have to be 
                        patient with his process.  
                               (Kesten’s unmoved)
                        The studio will just have to accommodate.  

           Coppola moves toward Brando.  Kesten gloats privately.  

                                 KESTEN
                        Oooo-kay.  

           Brando’s now fixated on his suspenders -- lifting them 
           up, considering, then down.  Up and down.  Up and down. 

                                 COPPOLA
                               (watching Brando)
                        ‘bout ready for a run-through?

                                 BRANDO
                        Would this man go suspenders up or down 
                        on this occasion?  

                                 COPPOLA
                        You’ll have a sport coat on, Marlon.  You 
                        can take the suspenders off if you like.
                                 BRANDO
                               (ignoring him)
                        Up implies a formality.  A longing to 
                        impress... but he’s already decided what 
                        he’ll tell this fellow, Salami.  

                                 COPPOLA
                               (correcting)
                        Sollozzo.

                                 BRANDO
                        So, maybe down.  Because he’s at peace 
                        with his decision.   

                                 COPPOLA
                               (in a rush)
                        Down works fine--

                                 BRANDO
                        Or perhaps he senses the danger in this 
                        man.  In which case, up.  For fear of 
                        being caught with his pants down.  

           Coppola spots the crew SNICKERING at them.  He blushes.  

                                 COPPOLA
                        Let’s try it with them up.      

           Brando takes a deep breath, horribly put upon.  Finally:

                                 BRANDO
                        Very well.

           Coppola starts to rush off when:

                                 BRANDO (CONT’D)
                               (an epiphany)
                        Wait!  Just a minute!   

                                 COPPOLA
                        Yes?  

                                 BRANDO
                        What if... he’s wearing a belt? 

           His mind blown, Brando stands and walks off the set, 
           removing the suspenders.  More CHUCKLES from the crew.

           ANGLE: CLOSE ON Coppola closing and rubbing his eyes. 

                                 EVANS (O.S.)
                        Francis!  

                                 COPPOLA
                               (eyes still closed)
                        Yes, Satan?  

           He opens his eyes to find Evans standing before him.

                                 EVANS
                        We need to talk.  
           EXT. SOUNDSTAGE (FILMWAY STUDIOS) - DAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Coppola and Evans alone outside, in mid conversation:  

                                 COPPOLA
                        It’s day fucking 3!  They haven’t even 
                        seen any footage.  

                                 EVANS
                        You’re behind.  And Jaffe’s already spent 
                        weeks mystifying Brando and Pacino.  No 
                        footage can compete with a studio board’s 
                        innate lack of vision.  They’re gone.  

                                 COPPOLA
                        And just who the fuck do they think can 
                        replace me?!  I wrote the script, I’ve 
                        been prepping for a year.  Who’s more 
                        qualified than that?

                                 EVANS
                        ... Elia Kazan.  

           Coppola stops, crushed -- Kazan trumps anybody.  

                                 COPPOLA
                        Kazan?  How do you know?    

                                 EVANS
                        I had Bart buddy up with Jaffe, like he’s 
                        turning on me.  He’s my Jew Luca Brasi.  
                                (then)
                        I’m sorry, kid.  I liked how this was 
                        shaping up.  

           Coppola starts walking, trying to come up with something.

                                 COPPOLA
                        You gotta buy me another week.  I’ll 
                        shoot the best scenes, prove the actors--   

                                 EVANS
                        Can’t do it.  The Board’s lost their hard-
                        on for Evans too.  But listen, they want 
                        a smooth transition for Kazan and in 
                        exchange for leaving quietly, I convinced 
                        the board to do a deal with Warners so 
                        you can keep Zoetrope.  Best I could do.  

           Coppola looks away, considering this -- his dream reborn.   

                                 EVANS (CONT’D)
                        You’re solvent again.  Family’s secure.  
                        You get to walk away a winner.  

                                 COPPOLA
                        ... no.

                                 EVANS
                        Whaddya mean “no”?
                                 COPPOLA
                        I won’t go quietly.

                                 EVANS
                        Francis, don’t be an asshole.  Saving 
                        your artsy shit mill’s what you wanted.

                                 COPPOLA
                        Well, now I want to make this picture.  

                                 EVANS
                        I swear to Christ, you’d fight me if I 
                        hired Raquel Welch to tongue your balls.  

                                 COPPOLA
                        More than any film I’ve done, I know 
                        exactly how this one has to be made; not 
                        in spite of our goddamn fights, because 
                        of them.  They’ve been like a sadistic 
                        refining process.  My vision is so clear 
                        because we beat each other down ‘til all 
                        we had left was truth.  That’s art.   

                                 EVANS
                               (offended)
                        Jesus, don’t say that--

                                 COPPOLA
                        --That is art, Bob!--  

                                 EVANS
                        --How dare you suggest it!-- 

                                 COPPOLA
                        You could’ve hired some yes-man, but you 
                        picked me, someone who wouldn’t settle 
                        because deep down you’re an artist--

                                 EVANS
                        Who the fuck are you talking to, fatboy?!

                                 COPPOLA
                        --AND YOU WANNA THROW AWAY ALL WE FOUGHT 
                        FOR NOW?! 

           Evans is for once beat down, and winded.  After a moment: 

                                 EVANS
                        The decision’s been made.  There’s no 
                        shortage of department head minions 
                        willing to betray you so Kazan can slide 
                        right in.  And then my balls are clipped. 

                                 COPPOLA
                        You’re still the boss tomorrow though?
                               (off Evans’ nod)
                        All I need is five more days.  
                               (then)
                        What if there were no minions to help 
                        Kazan slide right in?  
           ON EVANS, considering... 

                                                               CUT TO:

           INT. UNDISCLOSED ANTEROOM - DAY

           CLOSE ON an infant BABY GIRL in an embroidered, white dress. 
           This is SOFIA COPPOLA, in the arms of her mother Eleanor.  

           Leaning into each other on a sofa, faces touching, Coppola 
           and his wife enjoy a quiet moment with their daughter.  

                                 COPPOLA
                        Look what you did, Ellie.

                                 ELEANOR
                        We did it.

                                 COPPOLA
                        No.  I’m sorry to say I did as little as 
                        possible since we learned she was coming.  
                        For both of you.  

           Eleanor doesn’t disagree.  But she knows a turning point 
           when she sees one.  Meeting his eyes:

                                 ELEANOR
                        So do this with me now.  

           He smiles at her and they share a kiss.  

           INT. CATHEDRAL - DAY

           A LONG SHOT of a church interior.  An ORGAN PLAYS (Is it 
           the same Bach piece as in The Godfather?  Why not?).  

           Sofia’s parents hold her over the baptism font, her 
           brothers standing nearby along with a PRIEST. 

                                 PRIEST
                        The child’s sponsors?

                                 COPPOLA
                        They couldn’t make it from San Francisco, 
                        but we don’t want to wait any longer.  
                        I’ll speak for her if that’s alright.  

           The priest nods and readies himself to begin the ceremony 
           (NOTE: I’m not writing out the Priest’s Latin; it’s the 
           same as in the actual Godfather “baptism montage”).  

                                 PRIEST
                        (SPEAKS LATIN)

           The priest breathes on the baby three times.  CLOSE ON 
           Coppola watching intently.  The baby’s bonnet is removed. 

           THE PRIEST’S LATIN CONTINUES OVER THE FOLLOWING MONTAGE:  
           INT. FILMWAYS OFFICE - In a wife beater, Ruddy cleans 
           metallic “parts”.  He’s assembling something.  

           EXT. SOUNDSTAGE - Gordon Willis sits on a camera box, 
           wiping lenses and smoking.  Looking through a lens, he 
           spots a cube truck arriving.  

           INT. BARBER SHOP/SALON - Evans YELLS at someone over the 
           phone while A BARBER tries to shave him, A MANICURIST 
           struggling to buff his nails.  

           INT. STUDIO MILL - A nervous Lucas checks himself in the 
           reflection of a saw blade, wipes his brow.

           CATHEDRAL - The priest blesses the baby with oils. 

                                 PRIEST (CONT’D)
                        (SPEAKS LATIN)

           FILMWAYS OFFICE - Ruddy finishes assembling his metal 
           contraption.  

           REVEAL: It’s a typewriter carriage.  He slides it into an 
           Underwood, loads pink paper, and begins typing pink slips  
           for “Steven Kesten”/”Nikki Roberts”/”Alejandro Estevez”, etc.  

           Ruddy removes a slip and hands it to Evans, who signs it.  

           CATHEDRAL - The priest blesses Sofia.  CLOSE ON Coppola.

                                 PRIEST (CONT’D)
                        Sofia, do you believe in God, the Father 
                        Almighty, Creator of Heaven and Earth?  

                                 COPPOLA
                        I do.  

           STUDIO MILL -  Lucas moves past a hastily painted sign 
           reading, “Art Direction, ‘Godfather’”.

                                 PRIEST (V.O.)
                        Do you believe in Jesus Christ, His only 
                        Son, our Lord?

                                 COPPOLA (V.O.)
                        I do.  

           Lucas spots Alejandro Estevez (the Art Director) at a 
           drafting table.  Lucas hesitates, losing his nerve.  

                                 PRIEST (V.O.)
                        Do you believe in the Holy Ghost, the 
                        Holy Catholic Church?

                                 COPPOLA (V.O.)
                        I do.  

           About to retreat, Lucas spots a Polynesian temple set 
           shelved in the racks.  A mask carved into it looks just 
           like a Stormtrooper’s helmet!  Lucas finds his grit.    
           EXT. FILMWAYS MAIN ENTRANCE - The studio’s main building 
           has a wide imposing staircase before it.  1st A.D. Steve 
           Kesten is at the base shuffling EXTRAS inside.

           REVEAL: Evans watching Kesten.  

           INT. POST FACILITY - Ruddy stalks through a hallway of 
           edit bays, eventually locating Editor Aram Avakian 
           hunched over a flatbed in a wool sweater.

           EXT. PRODUCTION OFFICE/FILMWAYS LOT - Peter Bart tracks 
           Nikki Roberts (the Production Coordinator) down the 
           office’s gravel pathway toward a security booth.  

           SOUNDSTAGE - Camera Op Jake Webber and his 1st A.C. roll 
           a dolly from the cube truck onto the stage’s freight 
           elevator.  Seeing them descend, Willis stubs out his 
           cigarette and heads down some stairs.  

           CATHEDRAL - Sofia begins CRYING. THE CRYING CONTINUES OVER...

                                 PRIEST
                        (SPEAKS LATIN) 

           FILMWAYS MAIN ENTRANCE - Evans makes contact with Kesten 
           and the two head up the staircase, chatting.  

           INT. FILMWAYS SECURITY BOOTH - Nikki enters and heads for 
           the exit door, which she finds locked.

           Confused, she turns to the SECURITY GUARD, who ducks under 
           the counter.  REVEAL: Bart standing across from her!  

           INT. SOUNDSTAGE/ELEVATOR - Willis flies down the stairs 
           and positions himself in front of the freight elevator 
           door, through which he can see Jake and the 1st A.C. 
           descending.  Jake carries a tower of film cans.

           CATHEDRAL - CLOSE ON the baby and then Coppola.

                                 PRIEST (CONT’D)
                        Sofia Carmina Coppola, do you renounce 
                        Satan?

           SOUNDSTAGE/ELEVATOR - The elevator door opens and Jake is 
           startled to see Willis holding a pink slip and mouthing 
           “You’re fucking fired!”  

           The film cans come toppling out of the elevator door.  

                                 COPPOLA
                        I do renounce him.

           FILMWAYS SECURITY BOOTH - Reading glasses perched on the 
           edge of her nose, Nikki scans her own pink slip.  She 
           looks up, tears in her eyes and the glasses slip off, 
           shattering when they hit the ground. 

                                 PRIEST
                        And all his works?  
           STUDIO MILL - Lucas stands before Alejandro, who angrily 
           crumples and tosses his pink slip into a pull chain 
           toilet (part of the bathroom set he was building).  

                                 COPPOLA
                        I do renounce them.  

           EDIT BAY - Standing amidst the bins of film holding his 
           pink slip, a furious Avakian flails at Ruddy; his thick 
           sweater snagging the pins on a bin.  He swings with the 
           other arm, snagging another bin!  Increased flailing only 
           further entangles him -- the bins slamming all over the 
           room, eventually toppling along with Avakian!  

                                 PRIEST
                        And all his pomps?

                                 COPPOLA
                        I do renounce them.  

           FILMWAYS MAIN ENTRANCE - Atop the staircase, Kesten 
           SCREAMS at Evans about the pink slip.  Extras watch as 
           Kesten moves to get in Evans’ face, but misses the step, 
           slips, and begins rolling down the stairs!  

           The fall is so horrible Evans begins chasing to stop him.

                                 PRIEST
                        Sofia Coppola, will you be baptized?

                                 COPPOLA
                        I will.

           The Priest baptizes Sofia with water. 

                                 PRIEST
                        In Nomine Patris...

           EDIT BAY - Avakian lays entangled in film, not unlike a 
           mummified body.

                                 PRIEST (V.O.)
                        ... et Filii...

           SOUNDSTAGE/ELEVATOR - Jake Webber sits amidst the spilt 
           film cans, crying.

                                 PRIEST (V.O.)
                        ... et Spiritu Sanctu.

           MAIN ENTRANCE - A bloodied Kesten lays at the bottom of 
           the stairs surrounded by extras.  Evans walks hurriedly 
           away past an APPROACHING AMBULANCE.  

           CATHEDRAL - CLOSE ON Coppola behind a candle.

                                 PRIEST
                        Sofia Coppola go in peace and may the 
                        Lord be with you.  
                                 PRIEST (CONT’D)
                        Amen.  

                                                    END MONTAGE/CUT TO:

           INT. JAFFE’S OFFICE (FILMWAYS STUDIOS) - DAY

           Coppola enters along with Evans, Bart, and Ruddy.  Jaffe 
           puts his phone down mid-dial upon seeing:

           Charlie Bluhdorn push past the other men.    

                                 CHARLIE BLUHDORN
                        You must answer for ‘ze Board, Stanley.  

           Jaffe pauses, then rises to meet them.

                                 JAFFE
                        Charlie, you got it all wrong. 

                                 EVANS
                        You tried to cut us out.  

                                 JAFFE
                               (to Bluhdorn)
                        I don’t know what you heard, but I’m 
                        innocent.  I swear on your kids--  

                                 COPPOLA
                        Sit down.  

           Jaffe glares, then sits.  Coppola pulls a chair beside him.  

                                 COPPOLA (CONT’D)
                        Steve Kesten’s in a coma.  Avakian’s

                        need weeks to get up to speed.  But I’ll 
                        settle my business with the Board long 
                        before then.

           Jaffe puts his face in his hands, shaken. 

                                 CHARLIE BLUHDORN
                        Don’t be afraid, Stanley.  I’m not 
                        revoking your stock options.  But you 
                        ‘vil tender your resignation.  

                                 EVANS
                        Hear that, cock muppet?  You’re getting a 
                        golden parachute.  Like all dipshit studio 
                        heads.  Only don’t tell us you’re 
                        innocent.  It insults Evans’ intelligence, 
                        which are considerable.   

                                 JAFFE
                        Francis, I--

                                 COPPOLA
                        Go on, get outta my sight.  
           EXT. PRODUCTION OFFICE/FILMWAYS LOT - MOMENTS LATER

           Jaffe emerges from the office onto the gravel path and is 
           immediately surrounded by SEVERAL SECURITY GUARDS.  

           Coppola and the gang step out a beat later.  Jaffe to Bart:

                                 JAFFE
                        Pete, can you get me off the hook?  For 
                        old time’s sake?  

                                 BART
                        Can’t do it, Stanley. 

           Bart nods at the guards and they march Jaffe toward a 
           waiting golf cart, his shoulders slumped in dread.   

           Coppola watches along with Evans, Bluhdorn, et al. as 
           Jaffe is carted away.  They then move ominously down the 
           path, GRAVEL CRUNCHING beneath their feet. 

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. OLD LUNA RESTAURANT (THE BRONX) - NIGHT

           We’re on location, the FILM CREW resetting STERLING 
           HAYDEN and Al Lettieri for another take of the McCluskey 
           /Sollozzo murder scene (by Michael).  

           Pacino sits in a far corner of the restaurant facing a 
           wall, panicking.  Coppola watches his actor, concerned.  

           An ANGRY ON-SET STUDIO EXEC -- recognizable by his suit, 
           frantic joylessness and clipboard -- charges up to Coppola. 

                                 STUDIO EXEC
                        Who the hell put this scene on the 
                        schedule?  
                               (re: Pacino)
                        We’re not supposed to be shooting with 
                        him anymore.  

           Coppola doesn’t acknowledge him, eyes glued on Pacino.  

                                 STUDIO EXEC (CONT’D)
                        You’re quite crafty in slowing this down, 
                        but the Board has made up its mind.  

           Coppola merely sips his coffee and the exec huffs off.

                                 STUDIO EXEC (CONT’D)
                        Somebody find me a goddamn phone!  

           This cues Coppola to approach Pacino, still facing away.  

                                 COPPOLA
                        Al?  

                                 PACINO
                        I don’t want to do this anymore. 
                                 PACINO (CONT’D)
                               (re: the exec on the phone)
                        They don’t want me.  They’re just... 
                        toying with me this whole time.  But I 
                        know they don’t want me!  

           Coppola SIGHS and pulls a chair over to sit with him.  

                                 PACINO (CONT’D)
                        It’s the truth, isn’t it?

                                 COPPOLA
                        You know the truth?  They don’t know what 
                        they want.  Never have.  None of ‘em.  
                        That’s our job.  To show them what they 
                        want.  We gotta jump through a lot of 
                        hoops to do it, so it’s easy to think 
                        they’ve got us on a string.  But what 
                        they’re really doing, Al, is waiting for 
                        us to dance.  And all the bullshit we put 
                        up with; the egos and infighting and 
                        rejection, is all about getting to the 
                        music.  That’s this, right now.  With the 
                        cameras about to roll and at least ten 
                        minutes before that asshole can shut us 
                        down.    

           Pacino looks up, beginning to come back online.

                                 COPPOLA (CONT’D)
                        This is when we set the tempo.  And if 
                        you can accept how rare these moments 
                        are, then they belong to you. 

           Pacino gives a tiny nod.  Coppola stands and goes right 
           to his NEW A.D.

                                 COPPOLA (CONT’D)
                        Are we ready?  
                               (off the A.D.’s nod)
                        Good.  I wanna go now.  

           Pacino, with renewed focus and vigor, sits in his 
           position at the table across from Lettieri and Hayden (as 
           Sollozzo and McCluskey) as the A.D. CALLS OUT:  

                                 A.D.
                        Roll camera! 

                                 CAMERAMAN
                        Camera rolling.

                                 A.D.
                        Sound!  

                                 SOUNDMAN
                        Sound speeding.  

                                 COPPOLA
                        ‘kay, everyone settle.
           SFX: The growing sound of an approaching ELEVATED SUBWAY 
           CAR threatens the crew’s audio.  

           The studio executive appears at Coppola’s side as the 
           restaurant begins SHAKING, the subway clearly close by.  

                                 COPPOLA (CONT’D)
                        ALRIGHT, WE’RE SET AND--

                                 STUDIO EXEC
                               (re: the TRAIN SOUND)
                        Hold up!  You have to wait for that to 
                        stop!

           Coppola looks at:

           Pacino; having flawlessly assumed the internal mania possessed 
           only by a man about to make a horrible decision which he can 
           never undo.  This is Michael Corleone’s beginning.

                                 COPPOLA
                               (to the exec, smiling)
                        It’s a train.  It won’t stop. 
                               (then, to the set)
                        ACTION!

           MUSIC: PRE-LAP Connie’s Wedding Tarantella...

           EXT. CORLEONE COMPOUND SET (MANHASSET) - DAY

           A HIGH ANGLE of the Corleone mall dressed for Connie’s 
           wedding.  HUNDREDS OF GUESTS mill about laughing and 
           dancing.  Coppola’s father, Carmine, leads the band 
           playing the tarantella.  Italia sits nearby clapping.  

           THE ENTIRE CAST interact with the guests, many are the 
           wiseguys with their WIVES and CHILDREN, all clapping.   

           Several cameras and CAMERAMEN are posted throughout, 
           covering the action.  Ruddy, Willis and Fred Roos survey  
           the process.  Nearby, Mario Puzo eats some of the prop food.  

           Seated with his family, Joe Columbo Sr. is outraged when 
           the PRODUCTION STILL PHOTOGRAPHER snaps his pic.  Joe Jr. 
           and another HOOD promptly rip the negative from the poor 
           man’s camera.  Joe Sr. shreds and throws it on the ground.   

                                 COPPOLA (O.S.)
                        Okay, CUT!  CUT!  CUT!  CUT! 

           REVEAL: Coppola at the forefront of it all, sweaty from 
           the heat and frustrated.

                                 COPPOLA (CONT’D)
                        Everyone, there still isn’t enough 
                        activity.  This should be organized 
                        chaos.  I remember men tossing sandwiches 
                        back and forth to each other, kids 
                        dancing in the aisles, wine spilling all 
                        over the grass and just-- a thousand 
                        Italians screaming over each other.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 COPPOLA (CONT’D)
                        Okay?  I know it’s hot, but we have to 
                        get an authentic feel here and we’re 
                        very, very behind.    

           He looks at his A.D.

                                 COPPOLA (CONT’D)
                        Let’s go again right away.

                                 A.D.
                        We gotta change mags.  

                                 COPPOLA
                        Fuck!
                               (then, calming himself)
                        Just, please ask them to hurry.

           The A.D. runs off and Coppola heads for some shade where 
           Puzo sits, eating.   

                                 COPPOLA (CONT’D)
                        That’s prop food, Mario.  It’s for the 
                        actors.

                                 PUZO
                        It tastes like a prop.  
                                (tosses plate on the ground)
                        Ooh, that reminds me.  
                               (takes out his script)
                        Scene here where Clemenza shows Mike how 
                        to cook sauce--   

                                 COPPOLA
                        Ya know Mario, I got my hands pretty full 
                        with this scene right now.  

                                 PUZO
                        I don’t wanna forget.  

                                 COPPOLA
                               (bites his tongue)
                        Fine.

                                 PUZO
                        First off, what’s the scene for?

                                 COPPOLA
                        I like to get a good recipe in every 
                        script.  That way if people hate the 
                        film, at least they come away with 
                        something.  

                                 PUZO
                        Shrewd.  I’d ‘a gone with an alfredo, 
                        but...  Problem right here is he says, 
                        “You start out with a little oil and you 
                        brown some garlic.”  

                                 COPPOLA
                        Yeah, what’s the problem?
                                 PUZO
                        Gangsters don’t “brown”.  Gangsters 
                        “fry”.  

           Coppola’s inclined to lose it on him, but then he takes a 
           deep breath, realizing the old man is right.

                                 COPPOLA
                        Good call, Mario.  I’ll change it.

                                 PUZO
                        You’re doin’ A-one, kid.  I’m ‘a get some 
                        of that cake.  

           Puzo moves for the wedding cake.  Coppola calls after: 

                                 COPPOLA
                        No, that’s--

           But he drops it, overwhelmed with the futility.

                                 BRANDO (O.S.)
                        Hey there, folks!  FOLKS!  

           Coppola looks at Brando, standing on a table trying to 
           settle the crowd.   

                                 COPPOLA
                        What now?

                                 BRANDO
                        Folks, hi.  Hi.  I’m Marlon Brando.  I’m 
                        in the movie. 

           The crowd APPLAUDS.  Brando signals them to stop. 

                                 BRANDO (CONT’D)
                        And I realize what I’m about to do may be 
                        somewhat off color, but I have a bit of a 
                        reputation as a prankster and these two 
                        gentlemen...

           He points at James Caan and Robert Duvall, both smiling.  

                                 BRANDO (CONT’D)
                        They dared me to do something for which 
                        they don’t think I have the stomach.  

           The crowd just stares, expectantly.  Coppola blanches.

                                 COPPOLA
                        Oh, shit.  

                                 BRANDO
                        Anyway, there’s really nothing left to 
                        say, so...

           Brando turns, drops his pants, bends over and moons the 
           entire production!  Caan and Duvall are in hysterics.
           With everyone else, it’s a medley of responses: From mild 
           amusement to outrage; mothers covering their children’s 
           eyes, etc.  Coppola buries his face in his hands.  

                                 BRANDO (CONT’D)
                               (pulling his pants back up)
                        Many thanks.  You will all be receiving a 
                        meal penalty.  

           ANGLE ON: Bettye McCartt (Ruddy’s secretary) recovering 
           from Brando’s stunt as Joe Jr. approaches with a gift bag.   

                                 JOE JR.
                        Boy, it’s not every day you get to see 
                        Marlon Brando’s ass in person, huh?  
                        Beats an autograph.   
                                (extending his hand)
                        I’m Joseph Columbo Jr., from the Italian-
                        American Civil Rights League.  

           Bettye registers this with sheer terror, but doesn’t move.

                                 JOE JR. (CONT’D)
                        We heard about an unfortunate incident 
                        where you broke your watch, and we 
                        thought we could help you out with ‘dat.
                                (hands her the gift bag)
                        Open it.  

           Bettye pulls out a Cartier case and opens it, revealing a 
           diamond-encrusted watch -- worth at least ten grand!  

           She stares at Joe Jr., her mouth gaping.  

                                 JOE JR. (CONT’D)
                        I know, it’s beautiful, right?  You’re 
                        welcome.  Just don’t wear it in Florida.

           He walks away, Bettye still frozen in shock. 

           ANGLE ON: Coppola rushes up and grabs his A.D.’s wrist.

                                 COPPOLA
                        Can we get this started already?  Before 
                        Brando shows his cock. 

                                 A.D.
                        Just a few more minutes.

           He hurries off, leaving Coppola exasperated.

                                 EVANS (O.S.)
                        Hey, Francis!  

           REVEAL: Evans bee-lining for Coppola.  

                                 EVANS (CONT’D)
                        Francis!  
                                 COPPOLA
                               (under his breath)
                        And here’s how this gets worse.  

                                 EVANS
                        Evans bears tidings.  The Board saw your 
                        rushes.  

           Evans pauses dramatically, waiting for Coppola.

                                 COPPOLA
                        Don’t make this a moment, Bob.  It’s not 
                        General Hospital.  

                                 EVANS
                        Brando’s in the clear.  Pacino...?
                               (tentative)
                        Word they used was “horrified.”  

           Coppola nods in defeat before Evans cracks a smile.  

                                 EVANS (CONT’D)
                        As in “chills up their spine!”  Smart 
                        move shooting the Sollozzo murder when 
                        you did.  Really sold the midget’s 
                        mettle.  He’s in like Flynn, and so are 
                        you, kid.  Kazan be damned!  

                                 COPPOLA
                               (relieved)
                        Well, it’s about time.  Holy shit.  

                                 EVANS
                        No, “Holy Evans.”  Told ya you’d owe it 
                        all to me.    

                                 COPPOLA
                        I don’t know how you figure.  But thank 
                        you, Bob.   

           They shake hands.  Evans turns to leave, then hesitates.  

                                 EVANS
                        Actually, one more thing... something’s 
                        been eating Evans’ craw.  Why’d you 
                        audition Jimmy Caan for Michael?  He was 
                        all wrong for it.  

                                 COPPOLA
                        I don’t know.  Don’t ask me about 
                        casting.

                                 EVANS
                        ‘Cuz it occurred to me; maybe he was your 
                        pick for Sonny all along.  Maybe you 
                        wanted Evans to think it was his idea.  
                        So he’d feel good; perhaps be more 
                        amenable to Brando and other less obvious 
                        choices.  

           Coppola remains silent.  Eventually, Evans CHUCKLES.  
                                 EVANS (CONT’D)
                        Ahhh, but you couldn’t pull a move like 
                        that on Evans.   
                                (more CHUCKLING)
                        You ain’t nearly got the stones.
                                (more CHUCKLES)
                        Not with Eartha Kitt on all fours and an 
                        eight-ball up your ass could you swing 
                        such dick.
                                (LAUGHING, then dead serious)
                        I mean, could you?   

                                 COPPOLA
                        Don’t ask me about casting, Bob.    

           Coppola turns to leave and Evans grabs his arm, hard. 

                                 EVANS
                        No, Francis, ‘cuz if you tricked me, it 
                        means I’m slippin’.  So I gotta know... 
                        Is it true?

           Coppola is at once aware of this man’s gaping vulnerability. 

                                 EVANS (CONT’D)
                        Is it?

           He looks straight into Coppola’s eyes, and Coppola returns 
           the look so directly we know he’ll tell the truth.

                                 COPPOLA
                               (after a long pause)
                        No.  

           Evans exhales relief.  He slaps Coppola on the back.

                                 EVANS
                        I knew it.  I knew it!  Jesus Christ, 
                        Evans needs a drink.  
                               (pointing at Coppola)
                        You don’t get one, buster.  You’re making 
                        a blockbuster.  Remember what I said 
                        about the audience smelling the 
                        spaghetti?  This is what I meant!   

           He walks away feeling like a king.  Coppola smiles 
           privately as his A.D. returns.  

                                 A.D.
                        We’re ready, but we can’t find the groom.  

                                 COPPOLA
                        Whaddya mean you can’t find him?
                               (to the crowd)
                        HEY, WHERE’S THE GROOM?!  
                               (no response)
                        HEY, EVERYONE, WHERE’S CARLO?  

                                 MALE VOICE (O.S.)
                        HERE!  YO, I’M RIGHT HERE!
           REVEAL: The crowd parts for the GROOM.  It’s Gianni Russo 
           (Columbo’s aid)!  He got a part after all.  To Talia:

                                 GIANNI RUSSO
                        Let’s get married, baby!  

           He smooches her as Coppola climbs on a large camera crane.

                                 COPPOLA
                               (shouting instructions)
                        Alright, I wanna pick it up with “C’e La 
                        Luna”.  Let’s go.  

           The crew jumps into action; slating cameras, rolling sound, 
           BOOM OPS taking position.  Coppola rises on the crane above 
           the crowd along with OUR FINAL VIEW of the scene.

                                 COPPOLA (CONT’D)
                        And... action! 

           It’s the magic of the movies -- perhaps tarnished by this 
           story but still very much alive! -- as the wedding guests 
           begin SINGING THE CHORUS to C’e La Luna Mezz’o Mare. 

                                 THE CHORUS
                        La la la, la-la-la-la la-la la-la...  

           On stage, Mama Corleone begins singing:

                                 MORGANA KING
                        C'e la luna mezz'o mare
                        Mamma mia me maritari,
                        Figghia mia, a cu te dari
                        Mamma mia pensaci tu.

           As she continues, the crowd wildly festive despite the heat:

           SUPER: “In March of 1972, ’The Godfather’ shattered box 
           office records in its initial release, quickly becoming 
           the highest grossing film of its time.”   

           SUPER: “Nominated for ten Oscars, the film garnered three 
           -- Best Actor for Marlon Brando, Best Adapted Screenplay 
           for Francis Ford Coppola and Best Picture.” 

           SUPER: “To date, ‘The Godfather’ has grossed Paramount 
           Pictures over 250 million dollars and continues to play 
           in theaters worldwide.”

           SUPER: “It is widely regarded as a masterpiece of 
           American cinema.”  

           HIGH ANGLE: As Coppola relishes his vision coming to life 
           and the crowd SHOUTS OUT ONE LAST CHORUS...

                                 THE CHORUS
                        La la la, la-la-la-la la-la la-la,
                        La la la, la-la-la-la-la la-la-la la-la!

                                      THE END.
