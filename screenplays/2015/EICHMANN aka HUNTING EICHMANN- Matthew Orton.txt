                       the Nazi war criminal, Adolf Eichmann

           “He said he will leap into his grave laughing, because the 
           feeling of having six million Jews’ deaths on his conscience 
           gave him extraordinary satisfaction.”

              - Dieter Wisliceny, quoting Adolf Eichmann, 1948

           Wind. The GROWLS of an approaching THUNDERSTORM as we PRELAP-

           EXT. GARIBALDI STREET. BUENOS AIRES. NIGHT

           The year is 1960, and we are in the San Fernando barrio, on 
           the outskirts of Buenos Aires, Argentina. 

           Rain slaps the asphalt road. Small bungalows, illuminated by 
           kerosene lamps, cast shadows across large yards. We glimpse 
           families relaxing, dining, celebrating together...

           INT. BUICK. NIGHT

           THREE MOSSAD AGENTS sit in silence, staring forward as rain 
           pounds their ‘53 black sedan. They watch a KIOSK and BUS-STOP 
           nearby. Their hood is open, as if they’ve broken down.

           Behind the wheel sits RAFI. Normally so warm and calm, now 
           this short man’s eyes bulge behind thick specs and his hand 
           jitters. UZI, the dripping-wet beast of a man by his side, 
           clenches his fists against the cold. 

           In the back sits PETER MALKIN. Handsome, in a gaunt kind of 
           way. A caged animal. In the eyes, grim determination. 

                                 UZI
                             (checks watch)
                        Like clockwork, you said.

                                 RAFI
                        I know what I said, habibi.

                                 UZI
                        Well, my watch isn’t broken.

                                 RAFI
                        We can’t turn back. Not now. 

                                 UZI
                        Peter?

           They both turn. Malkin doesn’t look at either of them.
                                 MALKIN
                        He’s here.

           Climbs out of the car. Both Rafi and Uzi turn to see-

           -a GREEN/YELLOW BUS (No.203) wheezing towards the kiosk.

           EXT. GARIBALDI STREET. NIGHT

           Striding forward, Malkin dons a pair of fur-lined leather 
           gloves. Breathes, steadying himself. Looks up as-

           -WHOOSH. The bus DRIVES STRAIGHT PAST THE KIOSK.

                                 MALKIN
                        No. No, no! 

           Behind him, leaning out of the car window, Uzi hisses-

                                 UZI
                        Where is he? What do we do?! 
                        Where’s Attila?!

           Off the look of TOTAL PANIC IN MALKIN’S FACE AS WE CUT TO-

           TITLES: EICHMANN

           The SCRATCHING of a fingernail grows louder and louder-

           INT. DINING ROOM. VILLA MINOUX. DAY (JANUARY, 1942)

           A brown stain, on a slate-grey collar. Try as it might, the 
           clipped, tobacco-stained thumbnail is failing to shift it.

           Over the sound of the scratching, a general MURMUR builds to-

                                 HEYDRICH (O.S.)
                        Herr Eichmann? 

           Looking up from his collar, ADOLF EICHMANN finds himself at a 
           plush dining-table surrounded by 14 HIGH-RANKING NAZIS. This 
           is the Wannsee conference. During the next hours these men 
           will seal the fate of approximately six million human beings. 

           Attractive in his way, Eichmann appears languid and calm. Not 
           in the eyes, though. They betray a man constantly evaluating. 
           Always searching for weakness, for opportunity.

           He clears his throat. His right hand twitches briefly. Stops.
                                 EICHMANN
                        Gentlemen. I begin by stressing our 
                        enemy threatens not only our war and 
                        our country but also our families. 
                        My eldest is six. My second only two 
                        and a third is on the way. I am sure 
                        I speak for everybody gathered here 
                        when I say we will give our lives 
                        and souls today to guarantee the 
                        safety of Germany’s children. 

           There’s a small RUMBLING of approval from the collected men. 
           Eichmann smiles thinly. The sense he was hoping for more. 

                                 EICHMANN (CONT’D)
                        But how? We tried reasoning with 
                        the enemy. We’ve tried deportation. 
                        But no, no, the foolish Jew has 
                        stayed put. So. We adapt. Before I 
                        continue, a glass to Herr Heydrich, 
                        Lange, Schöngarth and our men in 
                        the Einsatzgruppen for their work 
                        in the Ukraine dealing with the 
                        Slav and the Eastern Jew. 

           Eichmann lifts a glass of wine. Those at the table raise 
           glasses. Several KNOCK ON THE TABLE in support. Heydrich, 
           Lange and Schöngarth nod in appreciation.

                                 EICHMANN (CONT’D)
                        But Reichsführer Himmler has noted a 
                        problem. A bullet in a Jew is a 
                        bullet not in an enemy soldier. 
                        Plus, dispatching women and children 
                        this way is... problematic. The men 
                        hesitate. And with 10.3 million to 
                        go- the exact break-down is in 
                        document 171 there- we cannot afford 
                        even a second’s hesitation per Jew. 
                        Now. Within six weeks, the camps of 
                        Belzec, Sobibor and Auschwitz-
                        Birkenau will be operational. The 
                        MoT, the Foreign Office and we at 
                        the RHSA will strive to relocate all 
                        enemies of the Reich to the camps. 
                        At present, we process about 2000 a 
                        day, but with the zyklone B proposal- 
                        details in appendix C- permanent gas 
                        chambers and a more efficient train 
                        timetable, by next year it will be 
                        that many every hour. By 1949, if we 
                        follow the plans I’ve outlined in 
                        your files, our children will live 
                        and thrive in a Jew-free Europe. 
           Silence, for a moment. Then, Heydrich KNOCKS the table. All 
           the others follow suit, BANGING louder and louder. For a 
           moment, Eichmann basks in the glory. That’s more like it.

           As it dies, Heydrich begins to speak. But Eichmann returns to 
           his collar. Licks his thumb. Tries the stain again. This 
           time, it shifts. And, as the sound of SCRATCHING BUILDS- 

           WE SMASH INTO A RAPID MONTAGE OF THE SIGHTS AND SOUNDS OF THE 
           FINAL YEARS OF WW2. Stalingrad, Tripoli, the Pacific, 
           Normandy Landings, the Red Army, the Berlin bombing, 
           Hiroshima, the liberation of the camps... 

           Over footage, a mishmash of NEWS ANNOUNCEMENTS, CHEERS, 
           MUSIC, CHURCHILL AND EISENHOWER proclaiming an Allied victory- 
           BUT, LOUDER THAN THE NOISE, COMES A BROADCAST-

                                 NEWSCASTER (V.O.)
                        As the Nazi high command are 
                        rounded up, several remain missing. 
                        With the world’s eyes turned to 
                        Nuremberg, the question on 
                        everyone’s lips is: where is Adolf-

           EXT. ROSENHEIM PRISON CAMP. DAY (1945)

                                 AMERICAN PRIVATE
                        Eichmann? Where is he?

           An AMERICAN PRIVATE, chewing gum and flanked by two others, 
           stares at an assortment of Wehrmacht soldiers and officers. 
           They stare blankly forward, refusing to engage. 

           Taking the gum from his mouth, the American Private plants it 
           on a defiant Wehrmacht SOLDIER’S nose. 

           The Wehrmacht Soldier PUNCHES the American Private. 

           NEARBY

           Hidden by a makeshift barracks and beside a barbed-wire 
           fence, Eichmann watches a FIGHT break out. Sees other 
           American soldiers running over to help break it up. 

           Eichmann tears the arms from a jacket. Wraps the sleeves 
           around his hands. Grabs the barbed-wire fence. 

                                 EICHMANN (V.O.)
                        Dear Vera. My darling wife. My love. 

           Scrabbles up and, in a few moments, is on the other side. 
           Quickly runs into the woods. As he PASSES A TREE-
           EXT. TOTENGEBIRGE MOUNTAINS. LOWER SAXONY. DAY (1946)

           Knee-high snow covers this lush alpine landscape. All around, 
           LUMBERJACKS hack at trees. On a stump, an old RADIO. 

           One Lumberjack chops with a particular ferocity. It takes a 
           moment to recognise EICHMANN, such is his beard and dress. 

                                 EICHMANN (V.O.)
                        I hope with all my heart that you 
                        and the children are safe.

           Bright red in the face, he stops. Lets the axe slip from his 
           hand. Approaches the radio. Robert Jackson, lead American 
           Prosecutor at Nuremberg, in his opening statement:

                                 ROBERT JACKSON (ON RADIO)
                        The wrongs, which we seek to condemn 
                        and punish, have been so calculated, 
                        so malignant, and so devastating, 
                        that civilisation cannot tolerate 
                        their being ignored, because it 
                        cannot survive their being repeated.

           Eichmann lies in the snow as he listens. Snowflakes drift 
           onto his cheeks. They MELT the moment they touch his skin. 

                                 EICHMANN (V.O.)
                        I miss you. Though I have not spent 
                        the past years a prisoner, I will 
                        not be free until you and the boys 
                        are with me.

           Finally, Eichmann sits upright-

           INT. CHAMBER. SAN ANTONIO CHURCH. GENOA. DAY (1950)

           Beard thicker, hair greyer, Eichmann sits in a camp-bed. A 
           candle flickers. Above him, boots STOMP on floorboards.

                                 ITALIAN OFFICER (O.S.)
                        Hey, shit-head, when was he here?!

           The SMASH of something shattering. AN ARGUMENT breaks out.

           A door opens. BISHOP HUDAL rushes in clutching a Red Cross 
           passport, ticket and landing permit. Whispers instructions.

                                 EICHMANN (V.O.)
                        But there is a plan. I will leave.

           The priest points to another door. Shaking his hand, Eichmann 
           takes the documents and opens the wooden door-
           EXT. GIOVANNA C SHIP. DAY (!950)

           -stepping out onto the upper-deck of an OLD STEAM-LINER. 
           Stares at the now-distant Italian coast. A smile on his lips. 

                                 EICHMANN (V.O.)
                        To a place of opportunity and 
                        safety. I am already arranging for 
                        you to join me in this new land.

           Turning, Eichmann sees a muscular BLONDE MAN nearby. Blind in 
           one eye. He notices Eichmann. Recognises him. Salutes.

                                 EICHMANN (V.O.)
                        Life will be good for us there. I 
                        promise you, my love. 

           A smile on Eichmann’s lips as he turns back to the sea...

           INT/EXT. PERSONNEL. SHIN-BET HQ. TEL AVIV, ISRAEL. DAY (1960) 

           Outside, a young Tel Aviv BUSTLES. White-stone buildings, 
           already faded by the scorching Israeli sun. A stretch of 
           ocean, the yellow beach. All noise and excitement and energy.

           But inside this stuffy office, TWO MEN sit in silence. One, a 
           PERSONNEL OFFICIAL, turns a tape recorder on. The other is 
           PETER MALKIN. Heavier set than when we first saw him.  

                                 PERSONNEL OFFICIAL
                        For the tape, state your name.

                                 MALKIN
                        Malkin, Peter. 

                                 PERSONNEL OFFICIAL
                        Mr. Malkin, can you describe your 
                        present role within Shin Bet? 

                                 MALKIN
                        Desk monkey. 
                             (off the official’s look)
                        Collections department, German 
                        desk. Tactical co-ordination and 
                        execution. Previously, disguise 
                        specialist and field operative. 

                                 PERSONNEL OFFICIAL
                        And you’ve been out of active 
                        service for eight months now, yes?

                                 MALKIN
                        I haven’t been counting.
                                 PERSONNEL OFFICIAL
                        And do you understand why?

                                 MALKIN
                        Anti-Semitism?

                                 PERSONNEL OFFICIAL
                        Mr. Malkin.

           He stops the tape. Fixes Malkin with a look.

                                 PERSONNEL OFFICIAL (CONT’D)
                        The point of today is to figure out 
                        whether you’re ready to return to 
                        the field. So are you gonna fuck me 
                        around, or d’you wanna go back to 
                        chasing the bad guys? Hmm? OK. Let’s 
                        try that again. 

           Off Malkin, staring straight forward. 

           INT. BATHROOM. SHIN-BET HQ. DAY

           A tap runs. Malkin leans over the sink. A hip-flask, clenched 
           in one hand. He takes a hit. Lets it sit before swallowing. 

           Returns the flask to his pocket. Ignores someone BANGING on 
           the door. Puts his hand down on the sink-

           -a BLUE, WOVEN BRACELET comes out from under his jacket 
           sleeve. He stares at it for a long moment. 

           INT. CANTEEN. SHIN-BET HQ. DAY

           Malkin sits at a steel bench, chewing through falafel balls. 
           Clusters of people sit and talk, but Malkin remains alone. 
           His jacket is off, and his bracelet visible. 

           Across from him he notices a dark-haired, sharp-eyed agent 
           HANNA enter with a friend. He watches her a moment. 

                                 AHARONI (O.S.)
                        How’s it in purgatory, fuckhead?

           Stood with two friends, CIA-trained AHARONI sneers at Malkin. 
           A sense of superiority hangs off him like a bad cologne.

                                 MALKIN
                        You should come visit more often. 

                                 AHARONI
                        Oh yeah? 
                                 MALKIN
                        Yeah. It’d make a welcome change to 
                        the inside of the Old Man’s ass. 

           The friend blurts out a laugh. A look from Aharoni.

           Across from them, Hanna is looking over. Makes eye contact 
           with Malkin. Aharoni sees. 

                                 AHARONI
                        We just got back from Cologne. Long 
                        nights. You know what she told me, 
                        about you and her? It wasn’t that you 
                        hit the prick we were meant to be 
                        watching. It wasn’t you fucking my 
                        mission. No, no. She said it was more 
                        your limp dick and faggoty bracelet-

           WHUMP! Malkin SLAMS Aharoni’s head into the table- Aharoni 
           recovers, GRABS MALKIN’S HAND, TWISTING IT BACK-

           -but Malkin TURNS, too quick, seizing Aharoni’s arm- holds it 
           as he JABS Aharoni in the rib, DROPPING HIM. 

           The room respond- people CHEERING, WHOOPING, some joining in-

           Aharoni’s two friends weigh in- Malkin DUCKS a swipe from the 
           first- LIGHTNING-FAST PUNCH TO THE GUT, ELBOW TO THE FACE- 

           -the second GRABS MALKIN, but he SLIPS OUT OF HIS GRASP, 
           SPINS AND SHOOTS HIS HAND OUT, GRABBING THE GUY’S THROAT AND-

           -SLAMS HIM DOWN INTO THE GROUND.

           Just as another Mossad agent goes to enter the fray- THREE 
           PEOPLE GRAB MALKIN FROM BEHIND, DRAGGING HIM OFF. He tries to 
           wriggle free. And, as he’s pulled away a NOISE- the sound of 
           a GAS-FIRE IGNITING- BUILDS AND BUILDS-

           In amongst the crowd, we catch a GLIMPSE of an incongruous 
           WOMAN- blonde hair, red cheeks, DRESSED LIKE A POLISH PEASANT-

           Malkin STOPS STRUGGLING. Stares at where this woman was a 
           moment ago. He doesn’t even notice as he’s dragged past Hanna. 

           INT. HAREL’S OFFICE. MOSSAD HQ. DAY

           Stood at his window staring out, is 48-year-old spymaster 
           ISSER “Old Man” HAREL. Built like a pitbull with a voice to 
           match. His secretary DVORA, at her type-writer nearby. 

           Sat in the centre of the room is Malkin. Watches Harel, who 
           looks like he’s deciding whether or not to explode. Finally-
                                 HAREL
                        Dvora, out you go. Come on. You 
                        know what you get like when I get 
                        angry. Get on! Move it! 

           Affronted, Dvora stares daggers at Malkin as she leaves. 

                                 HAREL (CONT’D)
                        First you waste 30 minutes playing 
                        clowns at your reassessment. Then 
                        you put six-inches worth in our 
                        chief interrogator’s face. 

                                 MALKIN
                             (beat)
                        It won’t happen again. 

           Harel studies him a moment. 

                                 HAREL
                        You know I used to grow oranges, on 
                        the Herzliya kibbutz?

                                 MALKIN
                        Oh. You’ve never mentioned it. 

                                 HAREL
                        You wanna talk about your smart mouth 
                        as well as your shitty attitude? 
                             (Malkin holds hands up)
                        It was before all this. Brits were 
                        still here and people like us could 
                        grow oranges. Arabs worked with us 
                        then, peacefully. One of ‘em, name 
                        no-one could remember or pronounce, 
                        looks like a stereotype of a 
                        stereotype. So we call him Arab the 
                        Arab, which he seems to have no 
                        problem with. Nice guy. Family man. 
                        But one morning I wake up to 
                        gunfire. And Arab, who just last 
                        night was wrapping Diphenyl paper 
                        around oranges- now he’s got his 
                        hands on a Kalashnikov. 

                                 MALKIN
                        So what, you shot him?

                                 HAREL
                        You know what I saw, before I did? 
                        He hesitated. Stood in a pool of 
                        blood. And I could see him thinking: 
                        how has this happened. Why am I 
                        here, doing this? He was lost.
                                 MALKIN
                        And then he was dead.

                                 HAREL
                        Six months, unpaid leave- I hear 
                        another peep it’ll be a year. Come 
                        back when you know why you’re here.

           EXT. TEL AVIV BEACH. NIGHT

           Sat looking out over the quiet stretch of sand and rolling 
           waves, Malkin toys with the bracelet on his wrist. 

           A CLINK of bottles nearby. He doesn’t turn. Finally RAFI 
           EITAN plumps himself down beside Malkin. Opens two beers. 

                                 RAFI
                        You’re an asshole. You know that?

                                 MALKIN
                        Only 9-5. Sometimes weekends. 

                                 RAFI
                        Well, it’s 6.30 on a Tuesday, so.

           He hands Malkin a beer. They both take a swig.

                                 RAFI (CONT’D)
                        Heard about your talk with the Old 
                        Man. It won’t be six months. I’ll 
                        talk to him, don’t worry. 

                                 MALKIN
                        Maybe I shouldn’t be doing this. 
                        Maybe he’s right, Raf. 

                                 RAFI
                        About nobody liking you, probably.
                        About the other stuff? Nah. You 
                        just need to get laid for once. Get 
                        it out of your system. 

           Rafi looks at Malkin, who cracks a small smile. Chuckles.  

           EXT. RUGBY PITCH. BUENOS AIRES. DAY (1960)

           A beautifully-kept pitch encircled by wooden bleachers. A 
           SMALL TEAM of enormous men run drills, training for the 
           Torneo de la URBA. As one guy (ANTONIO) DEMOLISHES ANOTHER-
           INT. UNDER BLEACHERS

           A MOAN sneaks from sweet-faced, brown-haired SYLVIA HERMANN 
           as a firm hand eases its way up her thigh. A blond-haired GUY 
           kisses her neck. But when he angles for the inside-thigh...

                                 SYLVIA
                        Uh-uh, not a chance. Klaus, Klaus! 

           Pulling his face from her body, KLAUS’ looks at her, smiling. 
           Raffish and chiselled, he’s not used to being rebuffed. 

                                 KLAUS
                        You’re not enjoying being bad?

                                 SYLVIA
                        I am a good Catholic girl. And any 
                        prospective, uh-

                                 KLAUS
                             (kissing her neck again)
                        Husband? Lover? Client? 

                                 SYLVIA
                        -any boy has to meet my Papa first. 

                                 KLAUS
                        And... if he likes me? 

                                 SYLVIA
                        If. Then. Maybe. 

                                 KLAUS
                        You think he’s free tonight? 

           INT. DINING ROOM. HERMANN HOME. NIGHT

           Sparsely decorated, but spacious. An open door leads onto a 
           patio and small garden. The remnants of an asado on the table- 
           pamplona, lamb etc. Two bottles of Cordoban wine, one empty. 

           Klaus and Sylvia sit opposite her father LOTHAR, whose kind, 
           bearded face is covered by a broad grin. The scars beside his 
           eyes and their vacant look betray his blindness.

                                 KLAUS
                        -the second my hand touches the ball, 
                        Antonio smashes me. PING! Ham-string 
                        goes. My father said he practically 
                        heard it. Otherwise, I’d be playing.

                                 LOTHAR
                        And that’s how you two met, is it?
                                 KLAUS
                        No sir, I’m not sure Sylvia’s ever 
                        watched a rugby game...

           He grins at her. Playful, she kicks him under the table. 

                                 SYLVIA
                        We met at the dance-hall in Olivos. 

                                 LOTHAR
                        “Rock n roll” is it? Pah. 

                                 SYLVIA
                        Papa, you haven’t even heard it!

           Sylvia rolls her eyes. Klaus places a hand on her arm. 

                                 KLAUS
                        Your father just has more refined 
                        tastes. Bach. Wagner. Am I right? 
                        Music from the old country. 

                                 LOTHAR
                        I thought I heard it in your voice!

                                 KLAUS
                        We came over in ‘52. I was at 
                        school in Bad Aussee, for a time.

                                 LOTHAR
                        But your accent? 

                                 KLAUS
                        We moved all over. My father was 
                        the Obersturmbannführer, so. 

           This hits Lothar. A slight quiver in his voice. 

                                 LOTHAR
                        And you miss it? Will you go back?

                                 KLAUS
                        I like it here. The air, the ladies. 
                        Besides, I hear things, you know? 

                                 LOTHAR
                        Oh? 

                                 KLAUS
                        Jews. Again. Press, government. 
                        Fingers all over. Demanding. Oh we 
                        suffered so much, give us sympathy, 
                        give us money, power! Bleugh. Ask 
                        me, we should’ve finished the job. 
           Sylvia gasps in a playful way. Slaps his wrist. Klaus laughs. 
           Ever the rockstar, no apologies for being controversial. His 
           hand moves to Sylvia’s thigh and she grabs it. Wags a finger.

                                 LOTHAR
                        Your father, the Obersturmbannführer? 
                        Wasn’t that Adolf Eichmann? 

                                 KLAUS
                             (distracted)
                        Once upon a time.

           Sylvia manages to dislodge Klaus’ hand. She mouths “later” to 
           him. Unseen by either, a strange look has come over Lothar. 

           INT. STUDY. HERMANN HOUSE. NIGHT

           The house now silent, Lothar sits at his desk. Takes a sip 
           from a glass of scotch. His hand trembles. 

           After a moment, he takes a fresh piece of paper. Inserts it 
           into his brail typewriter. Begins to type...

           EXT. OCEAN ROAD. BEIT YANAI. ISRAEL. DUSK (A MONTH LATER)

           Sun dipping low into the ocean. Driving an old Sabra Sussita, 
           a now-bearded Malkin cruises past endless fields. 

           INT. CORNERSTORE. HAIFA. EVENING

           Malkin watches the SHOP-KEEP hoick a carp out of a bathtub. 
           Takes the fish to a grinder. 

           A CHEER nearby grabs Malkin’s attention. He turns to a group 
           of OLD MEN playing cards. Sat on little plastic chairs, they 
           drink schnapps, smoke Luckys. Mood seems vibrant. Happy.

           Except for one guy. With them, but separate. Only three teeth 
           left, a whisp of white hair. Rake thin. And, on his forearm, 
           a TATTOO. A letter, then numbers. Like a cattle stamp.

           He sees Malkin looking at him. Pulls his sleeve down, 
           covering the tattoo. Returns his focus to the cards.

           INT/EXT. ANIA’S APARTMENT. SAME

           Stepping inside, Malkin swings the door shut with his foot. 

                                 MALKIN
                        Mama? 
           INT. KITCHEN. ANIA’S APARTMENT. MOMENTS LATER

           Cramped and cluttered. Malkin enters only to be GRABBED in a 
           hug by his mother ANIA. He lets her, but doesn’t reciprocate.

                                 ANIA
                        Are you hungry? 

                                 MALKIN
                        Mama! You bought a refrigerator?

           Nestled in a corner sits a gleaming-white GE refrigerator. 

                                 ANIA
                        The whole block’s come up to see 
                        it. Come, feel how cold it is. 

                                 MALKIN
                        You know you can’t afford this. 

           She forces his hand into the refrigerator.

                                 ANIA
                        Look, look! And don’t give me that 
                        face. I’ve been saving some of what 
                        you give me. And I kind of sold the 
                        telephone. 

                                 MALKIN
                        The telephone?!

                                 ANIA
                        What, I only call you, everyone else 
                        I can shout to out the window. It’ll 
                        be OK. You take good care of me. 

           She lets go of Malkin. Takes the fish. Goes to cook it. 
           Misses the look from Malkin. Maybe it’s him who can’t afford 
           it. He glances at the refrigerator.

           Several framed photos on top. His father, his brothers... and 
           one of the BEAUTIFUL POLISH WOMAN Malkin saw standing in the 
           canteen. She’s wearing a bracelet identical to Malkin’s.

           INT. DINING ROOM. ANIA’S APARTMENT. LATER

           Shabbat. Ania lights candles, then mutters the kiddush over 
           wine. Malkin watches. On the walls, more family pictures. She 
           finishes. Malkin takes the cloth from two loaves of challah. 
           Tears off a chunk. They eat in silence.

           Ania goes to serve the fish. A KNOCK at the door interrupts. 
           Malkin, waving his mother down, gets up to answer it. 
           INT. ENTRANCE. ANIA’S APARTMENT. SAME

           Opening the door, Malkin finds- Hanna, standing there.

                                 MALKIN
                        What’re you doing here? 

                                 HANNA
                        Rafi wants to see you. It’s urgent. 

                                 ANIA (O.S.)
                        Peter? Tell me that’s a lady guest??

                                 MALKIN
                        No, Mama. It’s work.

                                 ANIA (O.S.)
                        Does she want to see the refrigerator?

                                 MALKIN
                        No, we’re talking, Mama, Christ. 
                             (to Hanna)
                        Give me a second.

           Malkin heads inside, leaving Hanna there. 

           EXT/INT. STREET/CAR. NEAR BAR. NIGHT

           Pulling up at the curb, Hanna kills the engine. They sit in 
           silence. Both daring the other to talk first.

                                 HANNA
                        You and your mother. Are you close?

                                 MALKIN
                        I’m all she’s got. So, you know. 
                        And you, Aharoni. You close?
                             (she doesn’t respond)
                        Guess it’s none of my business.

                                 HANNA
                        What do you want from me, Peter?
                             (off his silence)
                        You are so. Argh. Look, you be as 
                        fickle as you like. What I want from 
                        you hasn’t changed. And no. We both 
                        know what he’s like.

           Malkin takes this. Opens the door to climb out-

                                 HANNA (CONT’D)
                        What Rafi has to say. It means great 
                        things for Israel. For our home.
           Malkin gets out of the car. Off Hanna, watching him go.

           INT. BAR. MOMENTS LATER

           Cigarettes and their smokers fill this cushion-ridden dive 
           with a dull haze. Sat at the bar, Rafi turns as Malkin enters. 

           He looks back to the BARMAN. Nods at him. A small bell is 
           rung. Immediately, the bar begins to empty. The Barman 
           deposits a bottle of arak by Rafi, then heads out himself.

                                 MALKIN
                        That kind of a chat, huh.

                                 RAFI
                        What happened to your Mama’s phone?

                                 MALKIN
                        Don’t ask. 

           Malkin sits beside Rafi. Pours himself a generous glass. 

                                 RAFI
                        Peter. Where’s Adolf Eichmann?

                                 MALKIN
                             (beat)
                        I heard rumours. Kuwait, with the 
                        grand Mufti. Wiesenthal almost 
                        caught him in Altaussee. So he says. 

                                 RAFI
                        We... think we might’ve found him. 
                        Buenos Aires. Argentina. Lothar 
                        Hermann, a German Jew living there, 
                        claims his daughter is dating 
                        Eichmann’s eldest son. 

                                 MALKIN
                        No?! What are we doing talking! 

                                 RAFI
                        It’s complicated. For starters, 
                        Lothar is- well, he’s blind. So 
                        there’s that. 

                                 MALKIN
                        So someone goes out to check. 

                                 RAFI
                        Even then. Courtesy of Manus and 
                        Friedman we have the photo of him. 
                        But it’s a decade old. Older, even. 
                                 MALKIN
                        Send me. I’ll know if it’s him. 

                                 RAFI
                        That brings us on to the “you” part. 

                                 MALKIN
                        I have to be there, Raf. 

                                 RAFI
                        No, Peter. You have to lead there. 
                        I’ll be overseeing, but I need a 
                        mind like yours in charge.

           A silence, as Malkin studies his friend. Rafi’s smiling. 

                                 MALKIN
                        You’ve got the team already. Don’t 
                        you? Come on! Who’s in? 

           Rafi raises his eyebrows. You tell me...

           INT. GARAGE. TEL AVIV. DAY (ONE WEEK AGO)

           Hunched over a car’s bonnet, bald giant UZI toils away. Feet 
           up, aviators accentuating movie-star looks, YAAKOV reads. 

                                 MALKIN (V.O.)
                        You’ll have someone who knows their 
                        way around a car. Uzi. It has to be. 

                                 UZI
                             (looking up)
                        Did I say something to upset you?

                                 MALKIN (V.O.)
                        A navigator, for routes in and out. 
                        So, Yaakov. Christ though, those two.

           Yaakov tries to ignore Uzi, but he keeps staring. Eventually-

                                 YAAKOV
                        I’m reading.

                                 UZI
                        Yeah, but for an hour? 

                                 YAAKOV
                        Christ habibi, d’you hurt your head 
                        over-thinking that hard? 

           As a SQUABBLE breaks out- RAFI steps into the room. 
                                 RAFI (V.O.)
                        Best of the best.

           INT. CANTEEN. SHIN-BET HQ. DAY

           Sat eating a measly salad, Baghdadi Jew EPHRAIM chews slowly. 

                                 MALKIN (V.O.)
                        You’ll need an expert. 

                                 RAFI (V.O.)
                        Ephraim. He knows the city and the 
                        language better than anyone. 

                                 MALKIN (V.O.)
                        How’s his temperament? 

           Rafi approaches from across the room. Ephraim eyes him 
           coldly. Pulls his salad closer. Not until I’m finished.

                                 RAFI (V.O.)
                        Little better, since the diet. 

           INT. DANI’S OFFICE. SHIN-BET HQ. DAY

           Hunched over a desk, his pale skin and long limbs making him 
           look like the ghost of a spider, DANI adds a final detail to-

           -a picture of a beautiful NAKED LADY. Surrounded by forgery 
           equipment and work he’s probably supposed to be doing.  

                                 MALKIN (V.O.)
                        Dani. Best forger there is. We’ll 
                        need passports, visas, all sorts. 
                        Plus he could do with the sunshine. 

           He hasn’t noticed RAFI, at his doorway. Watching.  

                                 RAFI (V.O.)
                        I mean, it’s winter over there. But 
                        of course we’re taking Dani. 

           INT. RAFI’S OFFICE. NIGHT

                                 MALKIN
                        The doctor? 

                                 RAFI
                        Hanna. Trained by Yoni Elian as an 
                        anaesthesiologist. She’s a great 
                        field medic too. You OK with that?
                                 MALKIN
                        Why wouldn’t I be? 

           Rafi finishes his drink rather than answer.

                                 MALKIN (CONT’D)
                        You’ll need a disguise guy. 

                                 RAFI
                        Yeah, we will. And it’d be handy-

           Rafi KNOCKS his glass from the bar- Malkin CATCHES IT.

                                 RAFI (CONT’D)
                        -if we had someone with the reflexes 
                        to catch the bastard. 

                                 MALKIN
                        Rafi. It’s gotta be me. 

                                 RAFI
                        Don’t preach to the converted 
                        habibi. I’ve spent the past few 
                        days working on Isser. Now it’s 
                        your turn. If you want in on this 
                        Peter, show him we need you.
                             (then)
                        If we do this. If we catch the Adolf 
                        Eichmann. Maybe when our time’s up, 
                        we can all go to rest happy, eh? 

           Off Malkin, his mind whirring. An energy has returned. 

           INT. STUDIO ROOM. MALKIN’S APARTMENT. NIGHT

           Pacing the halls of his own home, Malkin drinks straight from 
           the bottle. Stares at ARTWORK hanging on his walls. 

           Fixates on an abstract that looks similar to the WOMAN on his 
           mother’s fridge. Even in this painting, she wears a bracelet 
           that matches the one Malkin toys with now. 

           Malkin turns. On the other side of this sparse room stands a 
           SINGLE BED. Above it are PHOTOGRAPHS, stuck to the wall.

           He approaches. We see that the pictures are all WANTED NAZIS. 
           Names are scrawled underneath. Mengele, Strangl, Rauff, 
           Schaeffer... dozens and dozens. Some- like Wolfgang Pilz, 
           Eugene Sanger- have CROSSES through them. Most don’t. 

           And there, at the top of them all, is a picture of a young 
           Adolf Eichmann. Staring out. It’s his picture that Malkin 
           focuses on. For the longest moment, he just glares at it. 
           Finally, Malkin screws the lid back onto his bottle. 

           EXT. MOSSAD HQ. DAY

           Climbing out of his car, Malkin runs towards the entrance.

           INT. UNDERGROUND POOL. MOSSAD HQ. DAY

           Swimming an aggressive front-crawl, Harel comes to the end of 
           a length. Hauls his hairy self out of the pool. Grabs a towel. 

           INT. CHANGING ROOM

           Drying himself, Harel pulls off his goggles- JUMPS at the 
           sight of MALKIN, sitting there waiting. 

                                 HAREL
                        Christ. Gimme a damn heart-attack. 
                        What’re you doing here?

                                 MALKIN
                        You weren’t in your office. 

                                 HAREL
                        So how’d you get in?

                                 MALKIN
                        Security’s actually pretty lax. You 
                        should have someone look at that.

                                 HAREL
                        Yeah, I’ll get right on it. Lemme 
                        guess- 

                                 MALKIN
                        The Eichmann mission. I can help.

           Harel grunts in exasperation, more to himself than Malkin. 
           Sets off towards the showers. Malkin follows.  

                                 MALKIN (CONT’D)
                        He’ll be living under an alias. New 
                        hair, new look. We need a 
                        specialist, someone who can spot 
                        that sort of thing a mile off.

                                 HAREL
                        Aharoni’s out there now. He’ll 
                        conduct surveillance, our people 
                        here will analyse the photographs.
                                 MALKIN
                        Aharoni, you serious?

                                 HAREL
                        He’s your superior, a fine agent and 
                        he’s done a shit-ton more for this 
                        country than you, pisher.

                                 MALKIN
                        The escape route then. We’ve known 
                        Argentina’s sympathetic to Nazis 
                        for years now. You try and get him 
                        out, road, rail, air, there’s no 
                        telling who’ll recognise him.  

                                 HAREL
                        Towel. 

           Malkin passes it. Follows Harel as he walks back to lockers.

                                 HAREL (CONT’D)
                        I have other disguise guys. Ones I 
                        know can hold their temper. Who 
                        aren’t still on unpaid leave. And 
                        who don’t bug me when I swim!

                                 MALKIN
                        You know you don’t have another 
                        agent who will give as much as me. 
                        You know what they took from me.  

           By the lockers now, that last part causes Harel to pause. He 
           looks back at Malkin. 

                                 HAREL
                        What, you think this is a cabaret?

           Malkin, getting it, turns around. Harel gets dressed.

                                 MALKIN
                        You told me to come back when I knew 
                        this was what I wanted. Here I am. 
                        Besides, the team need me. Let me 
                        prove it to you. 

                                 HAREL
                             (beat; looks back)
                        And how you gonna do that? Cause a 
                        mission this important, you’re sure 
                        as hell not going out until you do. 

           Off Malkin, considering the challenge. 
           EXT. POLICE STATION. SAN FERNANDO. BUENOS AIRES. DAY

           A row of ‘58 police-cars sit outside a dilapidated building. 
           Two OFFICERS smoke and jabber away in Spanish.

           INT. ALMIRÓN’S OFFICE. POLICE STATION. SAME

           The room is thick with the fug of cigars. Sat in a cracked 
           leather chair is thick-moustached RODO ALMIRÓN. Chief of this 
           district but with an air suggesting he dreams of far greater 
           things. Opposite sits a GUEST we only see from behind. 

           They both take drags. Almirón puffs out perfect circles. 

                                 ALMIRÓN
                             (re: cigars)
                        We raided a Perónist hideout last 
                        week. Caught one of the bastards. We 
                        wanted information on his comrades. 
                        So we tickle his toes, before long 
                        he squeals about “under the 
                        floorboards”. We look, and we find 
                        many things. Like these. 

           The guests nods, slowly. Takes another puff on the Cuban. 

                                 GUEST
                        Be gentle. Violence just begets 
                        violence. But when your enemy 
                        thinks you’re his friend? Then. But 
                        I’m not here to talk about these 
                        rebels, these children, am I?

           That voice. Clearly belongs to ADOLF EICHMANN. He’s aged 
           well. Seems physically stronger. A sense of ease around him.

           Almirón picks up a BUNDLE OF NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS from his 
           desk. Drops it on a coffee-table in front of Eichmann.

                                 ALMIRÓN
                        You’ve hidden well these past years. 
                        But there is a fight coming. Our 
                        world slips closer to chaos. And our 
                        enemies, it seems, are converging.

           Papers like Der Wag, Argentinisches Tageblatt. The headline 
           of the top one reads “IS ADOLF EICHMANN IN ARGENTINA?”

                                 ALMIRÓN (CONT’D)
                        The rat we caught. He was a little 
                        Cohen. His comrades need weapons, 
                        money, explosives. If they find 
                        you, that’s valuable information. 
                                 EICHMANN
                        What are you proposing?

                                 ALMIRÓN
                        We hide you like we did Mengele. 
                        Just until things quieten down. 
                        Then, when the time comes for me 
                        and my men to make our play-

                                 EICHMANN
                        You want my help. 

                                 ALMIRÓN
                        We need it, Herr Eichmann. We cannot 
                        road-block our enemies into defeat. 
                        We need a more permanent solution. 
                        And no-one is more qualified. 

                                 EICHMANN
                             (beat)
                        You know what I do on my Saturdays, 
                        Rodo? I dig. Saw. Chop. The whole 
                        day. Klaus and Dieter help. Horst, 
                        when he’s home. And little Ricardo. 
                        He rides on Daddy’s shoulders. 

                                 ALMIRÓN
                        This life. For a man like you?

                                 EICHMANN
                        My wife is happy. My boys too. 
                        Klaus is in love, even. We have run 
                        enough, and I will not make them 
                        run further. I appreciate your 
                        concern, I do. But the world will 
                        forget Adolf Eichmann, and it will 
                        never know who Ricardo Klement is. 

           Almirón ponders this. Stubs out his cigar. Stands.

                                 ALMIRÓN
                        You may force yourself to forget.

           Opens the door to his office- outside, a bull-pen full of 
           Almirón’s officers. He addresses them-

                                 ALMIRÓN (CONT’D)
                        Boys. My guest is leaving. 

           They turn. Stand and, as one, give the NAZI SALUTE. 

                                 ALMIRÓN (CONT’D)
                        But we have not forgotten. Please. 
                        Consider my proposal, Herr Eichmann.
           A smile plays on Eichmann’s lips. 

           INT. SYLVIA’S ROOM. HERMANN HOUSE. NIGHT

           The trumpets and crone of Elvis erupt as a vinyl spins 
           Hardheaded Woman. Posters of ‘50s rock icons juxtapose wedding 
           dress pictures. Sylvia dons pink lipstick, humming along. 

           INT. DINING ROOM. HERMANN HOME. NIGHT

           Sat at the table, Lothar hears Sylvia racing downstairs.

                                 SYLVIA
                        Back by 11 Papa, don’t wait up.

                                 LOTHAR
                        Sylvia, darling. Can I talk to you? 

           She hesitates. Tugs her red skirt down slightly. 

                                 LOTHAR (CONT’D)
                        You know, a father doesn’t need 
                        sight to know it’s too short. But, 
                        I suppose, a daughter’s dress 
                        always is. Where are you off to?

           He reaches out for Sylvia’s hand. She takes it. 

                                 SYLVIA
                        The ABC club. Klaus’ brother just 
                        got back from Cincinnati. He 
                        brought the new Hank Ballard and 
                        the Midnighters record with him. 
                        We’re gonna twist, papa!

           She playfully tries to do “the twist” with Lothar. But he 
           doesn’t respond with much enthusiasm. 

                                 LOTHAR
                        Sylvia, there’s something I need to 
                        tell you. I’ve tried, over the past 
                        few days, but there just never... 

                                 SYLVIA
                        What is it? 

                                 LOTHAR
                             (beat)
                        You’re Jewish, my love.

                                 SYLVIA
                        What? No Papa, we’re Catholic.
                                 LOTHAR
                        By choice, yes. But not by birth. By 
                        birth you are Jewish, as am I. It’s 
                        the real reason why we left Germany. 
                        And it- it’s the real reason why I 
                        will never see you as the beautiful 
                        woman you have no doubt become. 

                                 SYLVIA
                        I don’t... What does it mean? 

                                 LOTHAR
                        Nothing, maybe. Or- we’ll talk it 
                        over my love. For now, all it means 
                        is that you must stop seeing Klaus.  

                                 SYLVIA
                        What? No! Why would you say that?

                                 LOTHAR
                        Darling, listen, there is a man 
                        coming soon, he will explain-

                                 SYLVIA
                        I love him, Papa. 

                                 LOTHAR
                        Sylvia, calm down, let me finish- 
                        Klaus’ father, he’s responsible for-

                                 SYLVIA
                        I don’t care about his father!

                                 LOTHAR
                        It is complicated, Sylvia, enough!

                                 SYLVIA
                        No, it’s simple. You said it 
                        yourself: I’m a woman. I don’t care 
                        if I’m Jewish, or who his father is. 
                        I am not going to stop seeing him!

           With that, Sylvia turns and leaves. Lothar flinches as he 
           hears the front door SLAM shut. 

           EXT. STREET CORNER. BARRIO OLIVOS. NIGHT

           Shivering in the cold, Sylvia’s illuminated by approaching 
           headlights. The ROAR of engines draws closer as we see-

           A GROUP OF BIKERS approach. Moto Guzzi four-speeds, red and 
           black, twenty of them. One slows to a stop in front of her. 
           KLAUS passes her a helmet.
                                 SYLVIA
                        Who are these people? 

                                 KLAUS
                        Just friends, baby. 

                                 SYLVIA
                        Are they coming to the club? 

                                 KLAUS
                        You’ll see. 

           She hesitates a moment. Shakes it off. Puts the helmet on. 
           Climbs onto the bike. Klaus TEARS after the other bikers. 

           EXT. ROAD-BLOCK CONSTRUCTION. NIGHT

           SOLDIERS build a military-grade ROADBLOCK. Barbed-wire, road-
           spikes. Rifles, slung over shoulders. They wave the bikers 
           through as they approach.

           EXT. WOODED HILL. BARRIO BALVANERA. NIGHT

           Pulling to a stop, Klaus jumps off. Hurries towards a group 
           of bikers collected on the verge of a hill with their bike 
           headlights on. They’re drinking, and watching whatever’s 
           below them. Sylvia goes to join him, when a friend 
           (FRANCESCA) grabs her. They walk over together. 

                                 FRANCESCA
                        Hola chica! Ready to party? 

                                 SYLVIA
                        Cesca, who are these people? 

                                 FRANCESCA
                        You mean Klaus hasn’t introduced you? 
                        Chica, they’re Tacuara. They keep the 
                        city safe. 

                                 SYLVIA
                        Don’t the police do that? 

                                 FRANCESCA
                        They try chica. But today, a bomb 
                        went off in San Nicholas. It killed 
                        two people! Another in Boca last 
                        week. The police can’t keep up. So 
                        they help with the fight. 

                                 SYLVIA
                        Fight against who? 
                                 FRANCESCA
                        People like that. 

           They’ve reached the edge of the hill. Sylvia lets out a GASP 
           when she sees-

           -TWO YOUNG JEWISH MEN, trapped by a fence and blinded by the 
           bike’s headlights. They’re shouting at the Tacuara in 
           Spanish, demanding to be let go. 

           Klaus, a bottle of Cordoba Extra in hand, swaggers to the 
           front of the group. We notice several of them are wearing 
           grey shirts with MALTESE CROSSES stitched into them. 

                                 KLAUS
                        Comrades! These vermin threatened the 
                        peace of our city. They build bombs. 
                        Their mouths spit lies and their 
                        manhoods- if we can call them that- 
                        get far too close to our women.

           A JEER from the gathered crowd. The accused shout OBJECTIONS- 
           Sylvia watches on, horrified- this is her boyfriend Klaus-

                                 KLAUS (CONT’D)
                        You will not be judged by corrupt 
                        courts, or by the police, hamstrung 
                        by red-tape. Tonight, we will be 
                        your judges. Let the trial commence!

                                 ANTONIO (O.S.)
                        Hey, Klaus!

           Waving for attention, Antonio (who we glimpsed briefly on the 
           rugby pitch) drunkenly holds up his empty beer bottle-

           -and SLINGS IT at the two Jewish Men. It SMASHES as it hits 
           one of them. 

           Klaus LAUGHS, as do several others. A few more BOTTLES are 
           thrown- some pick up sticks, HURLING THEM WITH FEROCITY- 

           -SYLVIA SEEMS FROZEN TO THE SPOT- SHE’S MORTIFIED, TERRIFIED-

           -BLEEDING NOW, the two Men try and flee over the fence-

                                 KLAUS
                             (picking up a stone)
                        Oh no you don’t-

           As he goes to SLING IT STRAIGHT AT THEM-

                                 SYLVIA
                        STOP!!
           She grabs his arm. WRENCHES the stone out of his hand. 

                                 SYLVIA (CONT’D)
                        Leave them alone! They’re scared! 

           Several of the Tacuara boys are watching now. Embarrassed, 
           Klaus throws her off. Glares at her. A beat. 

                                 KLAUS
                        Go home, Sylvia. 

           She looks at him, at Francesca, at the Tacuara. At the men, 
           who have used the distraction to climb the fence...

           Sylvia turns and walks away. Francesca hurries after her. Puts 
           an arm around her. Fuming, Klaus watches them go. 

           EXT. HERMANN HOUSE. NIGHT

           Heels off, feet bloodied, Sylvia approaches her home.

           INT. DINING ROOM. HERMANN HOME. NIGHT

           She closes the front door. Goes to head upstairs-

                                 AHARONI (O.S.)
                        That her?

           She FREEZES. A stranger is sat with her father. AHARONI. 
           Lothar nods to him. Sylvia approaches, slowly. 

                                 LOTHAR
                        Darling. This man is from Israel.

                                 AHARONI
                        Can you help us find him?
                             (off her silence)
                        I’ve just flown for 39 hours. It 
                        included, but was not limited to, 
                        having the mosquitos of Senegal 
                        dine like kings on my pulmonary 
                        artery. So, no fucking around. Can 
                        you help us find Adolf Eichmann?

           Off Sylvia, who turns from Aharoni to her father. Lothar 
           seems to be watching her with his sightless eyes.

           EXT. TEL AVIV BEACH. EVENING (DAYS LATER)

           SPRINTING across the sand, Malkin drops to push-ups. Up, 
           SPRINTS BACK. Sweat drips. Muscles, growing tighter. 
           EXT. MOSSAD HQ. NIGHT.

           The sounds of MUSIC, in the distance. The night has begun. 

           INT. EMPTY OFFICE. SAME

           At his desk, Malkin applies a dark-tipped pencil to his face. 
           Creates wrinkles. He wears a salt-and-pepper beard, and a wig.

           Done with the pencil, he looks at himself in the mirror. 
           Almost completely unrecognizable. 

           He unties his bracelet. As he does, a female voice whispers-

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Peter...

           He spins around, surprised- to find HANNA standing at the 
           doorway. She’s been drinking. Giggles at his disguise. 

                                 HANNA
                        Nice look! Hey. Are you OK? 

                                 MALKIN
                             (shakes it off)
                        Bringing out my inner geriatric. 

                                 HANNA
                        A group of us are headed out. If 
                        you want some dutch courage?

                                 MALKIN
                        I can’t. Thanks. 

           Hanna goes to leave- changes her mind. Steps into the room 
           instead. Looks over Malkin’s assorted wigs. 

                                 HANNA
                        Did you know there are penguins in 
                        Argentina? Down in Patagonia. I’m 
                        gonna convince Rafi to organise a 
                        trip for us all. After we’ve, you 
                        know. Got him.

           Hanna takes a step closer to Malkin. 

                                 HANNA (CONT’D)
                        But. But I don’t think you’ll get 
                        to meet them. The penguins. Because 
                        you see, your hair- it’s all wrong. 

                                 MALKIN
                        Oh yeah?
                                 HANNA
                        It’s a disaster. Here-

           She comes close. Close enough to comb her fingers through his 
           wig, restyling it. Malkin opens his mouth, but no words come.

           They lock eyes. Hearts beat. A lifetime, in the silence.

                                 HANNA (CONT’D)
                        Say it. Just, let go. Talk to me. 
                             (off his silence)
                        You need this. You do. Don’t you? 

                                 MALKIN
                        Yeah. Yeah, I do. 
                             (breaking away)
                        Have a good night.

           He turns back to the mirror. Hanna stares at him for a 
           moment. Leaves. Malkin watches the reflection of her go. 

           EXT. APARTMENT BLOCK. HAIFA. LATER

           Checking his watch, Isser Harel scours passersby, looking for 
           Malkin. He spots a decrepit old man walk up to him- 

                                 HAREL
                        Christ. Age does not suit you. 

           He heads upstairs. MALKIN, hunched, shuffles after him. 

           INT/EXT. ANIA’S APARTMENT. MOMENTS LATER

           The door opens. Ania stares out at the two strangers outside.

                                 ANIA
                        Can I help you? 

                                 HAREL
                        Shalom Mrs. Malkin. We work at the 
                        Foreign Office with Peter. Is he in?
                             (she shakes her head)
                        Would you mind us waiting for him? 
                        My name is Isser. This is- Stephan.

           Malkin nods. She takes a step back. Welcomes them in.

           INT. LIVING ROOM. MOMENTS LATER 

           Settling himself on the sofa, Malkin keeps his eye on Harel. 
           Ania returns from the kitchen with two glasses of water. 
                                 HAREL
                        You live by yourself, Mrs. Malkin? 

                                 ANIA
                        Please, Ania. No one calls me Mrs. 
                        Malkin anymore.

                                 HAREL
                        Did your husband leave you? 

           She hesitates as she hands the glasses of water to them. 

           Harel catches Malkin’s eye. It becomes clear what he’s doing. 

           Ania turns to a cabinet, on which sits a framed picture of a 
           tall, strong man and his three young children. 

                                 ANIA
                        He didn’t leave me. But he is gone.

                                 HAREL
                        He died in the camps? In the Shoah? 

                                 ANIA
                             (beat)
                        After. When he heard about what had 
                        happened. What they did to our 
                        people. Our family. But I’m sure 
                        Peter has told you about it.

                                 HAREL
                        No. He hasn’t. 

                                 ANIA
                        Oh. Not once? 

                                 MALKIN
                        Mrs. Malkin, we can wait elsewhere-

                                 HAREL
                        Not once. You lost family?

                                 ANIA
                        Fruma. Peter’s sister. She had three 
                        little ones. They were all... Taken. 
                        When we heard, Peter’s brother- my 
                        Jacob- he just gave up. The grief 
                        was too much. He was saying kaddish 
                        when the car hit him. 

           Harel looks at Malkin. He’s deriving no joy from this. 

                                 HAREL
                        And Peter’s father?
                                 ANIA
                        His heart couldn’t bear it. Any of 
                        it. And so he followed our Jacob. 

                                 HAREL
                        Why were they so weak? Look at 
                        Peter. He’s still alive.

           That noise, FIRE IGNITING, builds somewhere within Malkin.

                                 ANIA
                        Peter is not alive. Not really. He 
                        denies himself a life. Blames 
                        himself, for what they did. For 
                        Fruma. And so he is a ghost in this 
                        world. Alone, always. 

                                 HAREL
                        Like you. All alone. Pathetic, no?

           Breathing steadily, Malkin tries to calm himself. He counts 
           carefully under his breath: one, two, three-

                                 ANIA
                        I- I’ll die soon enough. But 
                        Peter... He really never spoke of 
                        his brother? Of Fruma? 

           Harel turns to Malkin.

                                 HAREL
                        He told me he was an only child. 

           Too much for Ania. Her lip wobbles. Chokes down a small SOB. 

                                 ANIA
                        Sorry, I’m sorry, could you...

           Malkin doesn’t move, nor react. After a moment, Harel nods. 

                                 HAREL
                        Of course. I’m sorry, Mrs. Malkin.
                        I’ll be outside. 

           He leaves. Ania, tears on her cheeks, gazes at the picture of 
           her husband. Rocks back and forth, trying to mutter kaddish. 

           Standing, Malkin goes to reach out to her-

                                 ANIA
                        Please. You go too. 

           Taking his hand back, Malkin turns and walks out.
           EXT. APARTMENT BLOCK. HAIFA. MOMENTS LATER

           At the street edge, Harel hails a cab. Shakes off the feeling 
           of what he’s just done. Footsteps approach. 

                                 HAREL
                        We wait for confirmation that the 
                        target- codename: ATTILA- is live. 

           A cab stops. He climbs in. Before he drives away- 

                                 HAREL (CONT’D)
                        You held it together. Fine. But you 
                        screw this operation up, make me 
                        regret it for even a heartbeat, 
                        you’re not just off the team, 
                        you’re out of the damn country. 

           The cab pulls away, leaving Malkin alone in the street.

           Moments later, and MALKIN LETS RIP. Nearby bins bear the 
           brunt of his rage- HE KICKS, PUNCHES, SMASHES- 

           Slowly tires. Eventually, he stops. Pants.

           Glares at terrified PASSERSBY, daring them to say something.

           INT/EXT. FIAT TRUCK/MECHANIC’S. SAN FERNANDO. ARGENTINA. DAY

           Behind the wheel, Aharoni tinkers with a lens hidden in the 
           base of a BRIEFCASE. Lothar sits beside him, sightless eyes 
           staring out of the windscreen, as if watching-

           SYLVIA, standing outside a mechanic’s shop, deep in 
           conversation with a GREASE MONKEY. Motorbikes everywhere. In 
           her hands, she’s carrying a small crate of beer. 

           The Grease Monkey shakes his head. Sylvia looks disappointed.

                                 AHARONI
                        This is feeling goose-chasey...

           Slipping a beer out, Sylvia offers it to the Grease Monkey. 
           After a quick glance over his shoulder... he takes it. Points 
           to a spot in the distance. 

                                 AHARONI (CONT’D)
                        Huh. Make an Israeli outta her yet. 

           Sylvia returns to the car. Climbs into the back. 

                                 SYLVIA
                        Garibaldi Street. 10 minutes. 
           EXT. ROADBLOCK. SAN FERNANDO BARRIO BORDER. LATER

           Sat squat between swaying Jacaranda trees on a quiet street, 
           armed SOLDIERS patrol this fortified position. 

           Aharoni pulls up nearby. Waits in line. They watch as 
           soldiers wave cars through one at a time. A Chevrolet saloon 
           has been pulled over. THREE MIDDLE-AGED MEN stand nervously 
           by their vehicle as a SOLDIER rummages through their trunk. 

                                 AHARONI
                        What the fuck...

                                 SYLVIA
                        Our 150th Independence Day is soon. 
                        Most people just want to celebrate. 
                        But the government has a lot of 
                        enemies. Or so it says. Don’t stare. 

           Eyes back on the road, Aharoni narrowly avoids the fierce 
           glare of the SOLDIER who stops them. Pokes his head in, 
           scouring the inside of the car- 

           -when the soldier searching the Chev’s trunk SHOUTS in 
           Spanish. He’s found an ANTIQUE RIFLE. 

           The THREE MEN TRY TO EXPLAIN- but the SOLDIERS begin BEATING 
           THE MEN MERCILESSLY. 

           With a final glare at Aharoni, the Soldier WAVES THEM THROUGH 
           THE ROADBLOCK. They drive on without looking back.

           EXT. GARIBALDI STREET. DAY

           Pulling to a stop across the road from Number 14, Aharoni 
           kills the ignition. They all stare at the house on Garibaldi 
           Street. On a raised embankment nearby, a train rumbles past. 

                                 AHARONI
                        Our entire mission rests on this. 
                        Confirm his identity, and get him 
                        to the door. Understand? 

                                 LOTHAR
                        If you feel you are in danger, even 
                        for a moment, you leave. Alright?

                                 AHARONI
                        He won’t hurt you. Not in his own 
                        home. But, yeah. Good luck. 

           With a deep breath, Sylvia climbs out of the car. 
           EXT. 14 GARIBALDI STREET. DAY

           Sylvia walks to the door. Hand, trembling. Reaches up and 
           gives a gentle knock. Waits. Silence stretches. No sound 
           inside. She reaches up again-

           -when the door SWINGS OPEN. VERA EICHMANN, a stout, motherly 
           woman, stands in the doorway.

                                 VERA EICHMANN
                        Can I help you? 

                                 SYLVIA
                        Mrs. Eichmann? I’m a friend of 
                        Klaus’. Sylvia. I had a gift for 
                        him I was hoping to drop off.

           A moment. Vera scrutinises Sylvia... breaks into a smile. 

                                 VERA EICHMANN
                        I wondered when we’d meet you! 

           INT. LIVING ROOM. EICHMANN HOUSE. MOMENTS LATER

           Ushered into a sparsely furnished space, Sylvia spots an 
           ENORMOUS BOUQUET OF FLOWERS on a small dining table. 

                                 SYLVIA
                        Oh my. They’re beautiful. 

                                 VERA EICHMANN
                        Aren’t they just? Fresh today. 

                                 SYLVIA
                        Is it a special occasion? 

                                 VERA EICHMANN
                        This year even more so.

           Just then, they hear the sound of a RASPBERRY being blown, 
           followed by a CHILD’S SQUEAL. Footsteps draw closer-

           -the backdoor OPENS. And there, silhouetted by the midday 
           sun, a small child in his arms... stands Adolf Eichmann.   

           There’s an odd serenity to him. Such tenderness, in the way 
           he holds his son. He bends his neck and, pressing his lips to 
           his little boy’s stomach he BLOWS. Young RICARDO GIGGLES with 
           glee. As Eichmann looks up- he spots Sylvia.

                                 EICHMANN
                        Oh. Hello there.
                                 VERA EICHMANN
                        Darling, this is Sylvia. 

                                 EICHMANN
                        Not the Sylvia? Ha. We had no idea 
                        you’d be calling. It’s a pleasure.

                                 SYLVIA
                        I just wanted to- to give Klaus- 

           The beer crate-minus-one suddenly looks very out of place. 

                                 VERA EICHMANN
                        Would you like some coffee, dear?

                                 SYLVIA
                        Oh no, I don’t want to be a bother.

                                 EICHMANN
                        Oh, please. Vera buys the beans 
                        from an Italian. Arabica, I think. 

           Before Sylvia can object, Eichmann has approached Vera. He 
           plants a kiss on her lips. Hands her Ricardo.

                                 EICHMANN (CONT’D)
                        He’ll need a nap soon. 

                                 VERA EICHMANN
                        Has Daddy tired you out, little 
                        munchkin? Has he?

           Vera retreats into the house with Ricardo. Eichmann watches 
           her go. Turns to Sylvia. 

           Smiles. Something off about it. Not suspicious. Just... off. 

                                 EICHMANN
                        What do you think?

                                 SYLVIA
                        Excuse me? 

                                 EICHMANN
                        The house! Still needs electricity, 
                        but she’s getting there. 

                                 SYLVIA
                        Oh. It’s lovely, Mr. Eichmann. Did 
                        your sons help you build it? 

                                 EICHMANN
                             (beat)
                        You mean Klaus and Dieter? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 EICHMANN (CONT'D)
                        I’m their uncle, Ricardo. Their 
                        father died during the war. 

                                 SYLVIA
                        Oh, I’m so sorry. That’s awful. 

                                 EICHMANN
                        I’m curious- was it Klaus that gave 
                        you this address? 

           Just then, the front door closes. Eichmann turns just as 
           KLAUS ENTERS. He FREEZES when he sees Sylvia. 

                                 KLAUS
                        What the fuck are you doing here?

                                 EICHMANN
                        She’s brought you a present, Klaus. 

                                 SYLVIA
                             (holding up the beer)
                        One of them fell out but- I wanted 
                        to apologise. For leaving the other- 

                                 KLAUS
                        Who told you where I live??

                                 EICHMANN
                        There’s no need to raise your voice. 

           Just then, Vera enters with a tray of coffee and cake. 

                                 VERA EICHMANN
                        Klaus, darling. Are you going to 
                        join us for cake? 

           He grabs Sylvia by her wrist. Pulls her towards the entrance.

                                 EICHMANN
                        Now hold on just a minute...

           INT/EXT. ENTRANCE. EICHMANN’S HOUSE. CONTINUOUS

           Storming down the corridor, dragging Sylvia behind him, Klaus 
           ignores Eichmann, who follows him.

                                 EICHMANN
                        Klaus, that’s about enough.

           Swinging open the door, Klaus goes to haul Sylvia outside-

           -when his father GRABS HIM BY THE JAW IN A VICE GRIP. In a 
           split second, Klaus is reduced to a vulnerable little whelp.
                                 EICHMANN (CONT’D)
                        That is not how we raised you to 
                        treat ladies. Is it? 

           Eichmann’s grip TIGHTENS. Klaus lets go of Sylvia’s arm. 

                                 KLAUS
                        Sorry, father.

           For a split second, Eichmann’s eyes flicker to Sylvia. 

                                 EICHMANN
                        You don’t need to call me that.

           He lets Klaus go.

           Rubbing his jaw, Klaus leaves the house. Jerks his head for 
           Sylvia to follow. 

           Eichmann steps out after them. Watches them walk away- when 
           he catches a glimpse of something REFLECTING THE SUN-

           ACROSS THE STREET, IN THE CAR

           Aharoni, the lens of the briefcase-camera pointed at 
           Eichmann, REALISES HIS MISTAKE. Snaps one last photo. Throws 
           the briefcase down, hits the ignition, and drives. 

                                 LOTHAR
                        Wait, wait, Sylvia-

                                 AHARONI
                        She’s alright. We’ll circle back. 

                                 LOTHAR
                        Was it him? Did he see you??

           Off Aharoni, gripping the wheel, deep in thought.

           INT. BEDROOM. EICHMANN HOUSE. SECONDS LATER

           Pulling open a chest of drawers, Eichmann takes out a 
           REVOLVER. Checks it’s loaded, moves to the window- no sign of 
           the car. He breaths steadily. Thinking. 

           EXT. KIOSK. BUS-STOP. SAME

           Approaching the bus-stop, Klaus GRABS Sylvia. 

                                 KLAUS
                        Francesca and I had a little ‘chat’. 
                        OK? She told me what you are.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 KLAUS (CONT'D)
                             (leans close)
                        You tell anybody what happened 
                        between us, and I will cut your 
                        tongue out and make a fucking 
                        Hanukkah candle out of it. 

           With that, he turns on his heel and leaves Sylvia. She 
           struggles to hold it together. 

           INT. MALKIN’S APARTMENT. MORNING (TWO WEEKS LATER)

           A fast, rhythmic SWISHING sound. The sun is barely up, but 
           Malkin’s already SKIPPING like crazy. A total machine.

           He stops. Next, finger-tip chin-ups on his door-frame. The 
           photograph wall of NAZI OFFICERS and the abstract painting of 
           Fruma all watch Malkin as he works and pushes and sweats. 

           Finally, he finishes. Picks up a phone. Makes a call. 

                                 MALKIN
                        Rafi? I’m ready. 

           EXT. ORANGE GROVE CLEARING. DAY

           A HAND DRIVES INTO RAFI’S THROAT, ANOTHER AROUND HIS WAIST- 
           Malkin, with the help of Uzi, CARRIES RAFI to a parked car-

                                 YAAKOV
                        39 seconds.

           They put Rafi down. Reset. Nearby, the team watches. 

                                 MALKIN
                        Again. We need sub-30. Let’s move!

                                 RAFI
                        No, no. Uzi, we’re swapping places. 
                        My back can’t take any more.

                                 MALKIN
                        Raf, Attila is half Uzi’s size.

                                 RAFI
                        Yeah, and he’s twice mine. So, you 
                        have a nice big margin of error.

                                 YAAKOV
                        Don’t go easy on him, habibi. 

                                 UZI
                        I don’t want to hurt Peter.
                                 MALKIN
                        You won’t. We ready? Ephraim-

                                 EPHRAIM
                        Learn it! Un. Momento. Señor. Easy.

           Malkin gives the thumbs up. Walks quickly towards Uzi-

                                 MALKIN
                        Un momento-

           Uzi CRACKS Malkin straight in the balls. DROPS HIM instantly. 
           The group BURST OUT LAUGHING as Malkin GASPS for breath. Uzi 
           immediately crouches down-

                                 UZI
                        I’m sorry Peter. You said I 
                        wouldn’t hurt you. 

                                 RAFI
                        Take five everyone. 

           Malkin waves Uzi away- he’s fine. Laughs, even. Uzi wanders 
           over to Hanna, Ephraim and Yaakov, embarrassed. Rafi sits. 

                                 RAFI (CONT’D)
                        You alright? How’re the mini-Peters?

                                 MALKIN
                        I’m OK. They’re OK. 

           Rafi chuckles. Silence settles as they stare over the grove. 
           Red stone hills in the distance. No countryside like it. 

                                 RAFI
                        You know why you’re doing this?

                                 MALKIN
                        Sure. For the glory of Israel. 

                                 RAFI
                        Come on, don’t do that. Don’t 
                        bullshit me. 

                                 MALKIN
                        Well, why are you doing it? 

                                 RAFI
                        For my kids. So they can know what 
                        we went through. What we stand for. 

                                 MALKIN
                        And if you didn’t have the family? 
                        The white picket fence. 
                                 RAFI
                        You know I only have the fence so the 
                        damn dog doesn’t kill the postman. 

                                 MALKIN
                        What do we stand for, Raf? 

                                 RAFI
                        Something good, in a world that’s 
                        so bad. So. Why’re you doing this? 

           Malkin glances at Hanna. She’s laughing at something. As he 
           watches- Uzi passes in front of her- 

           Suddenly, it’s the WOMAN Malkin keeps seeing. His sister, 
           FRUMA. She stares at Malkin-

           -he frowns- rubs at his eyes- looks back-

           -Hanna again. Looking at him, confused. Everything OK? 

                                 RAFI (CONT’D)
                        Uh-oh.

           Climbs to his feet as a CAR APPROACHES. SKIDS TO A HALT 
           nearby. Skinny forger Dani pokes his head out. 

                                 DANI
                        We’ve got a problem. 

           INT. RAFI’S OFFICE. MOSSAD HQ. DAY

           The Team pour over DOSSIERS with OPERATION ATTILA rubber-
           stamped across the front. Harel enters, looking stressed. 

                                 HAREL
                        Christ Rafi, d’you clean in here?

                                 RAFI
                        It’s a delicate eco-system sir. 

           Harel loads slides into a PROJECTOR. The photos Aharoni took 
           appear on the opposite wall. They’re blurry. Unclear. 

                                 MALKIN
                        Christ. We don’t have time for this!

                                 HAREL
                             (shooting Malkin a look)
                        As you can see from the file, Sylvia 
                        Hermann claims the target only ever 
                        referred to himself as “Ricardo”. 
                        Surname “Klement”. The boys’ uncle.

                                 HAREL (CONT'D)
                        Comparing these pictures to the only 
                        others we have on file of Eichmann- 
                        well, you can all see the issue.

                                 YAAKOV
                        Says here she heard the boy call 
                        him “father”?

                                 HANNA
                        “You don’t have to call me that.” 

                                 RAFI
                        You’ve had the whizz-kids take a 
                        look at ‘em?

                                 HAREL
                        IDs at Tel Hashomher came back 
                        with: “Inconclusive”. 

           The group take a moment, considering what’s in front of them. 

                                 HAREL (CONT’D)
                        As it stands, we lack the evidence 
                        to begin. If we seize an innocent 
                        Argentine, we could trigger a war. 
                        Aharoni’s assessing options, but 
                        until we have superior intelligence-

                                 MALKIN
                             (reading the file)
                        Flowers, in the house. And here- the 
                        wife implied it was an anniversary? 
                        What day was she there on?

                                 HAREL
                        Malkin, I was in the middle of-

                                 YAAKOV
                        The 21st of March.

                                 HAREL
                        Oh, well why doesn’t everyone just 
                        start interrupting me.

           Fired on by an idea, Malkin approaches Rafi’s desk. Sifts 
           through files at break-neck speed. 

                                 RAFI
                        Be careful, don’t-

           A pile of docs SLIP OFF THE DESK AND SPILLS ACROSS THE FLOOR. 

                                 RAFI (CONT’D)
                        Asshole. 
           Finding what he’s after, Malkin holds it up to the group. A 
           smile spreads across his face. A marriage certificate. 

                                 MALKIN
                        Vera Eichmann: “This year more than 
                        others.” Why is 1960 special? Anyone 
                        wanna guess which day, 25 years ago, 
                        Eichmann married his wife? Oh yeah. 
                        21st of March. Ricardo Klement is 
                        Adolf Eichmann. We found Attila.

           Harel takes the doc. Studies it. Eyes back on Malkin. 

                                 HAREL
                        Let me speak to the President. 

           Taking the certificate with him, Harel leaves. Several hands 
           clap Malkin on the shoulder- nice work. 

           He glances over at Hanna. She smiles. He gives a small smile 
           back but turns immediately to Rafi, who’s discussing 
           logistics. The smile slips from Hanna’s face.

           INT. DINING ROOM. MALKIN’S MOTHER’S. NIGHT

           Sat at a table with Ania. Malkin counts out shekel notes. 
           Puts a sizeable wad on the table.  

                                 MALKIN
                        Not for refrigerators. OK? 

                                 ANIA
                        Why so much? Where are you going?

           Silence. Malkin pushes the money towards her. 

                                 MALKIN
                        Things will be different, Mama. When 
                        I’m back. They will. 

                                 ANIA
                        Wherever you’re going. If it brings 
                        you peace, I will be happy. 

           Malkin stands. Kisses her forehead. As he leaves-

                                 ANIA (CONT’D)
                        Am Yisrael chai. 

           EXT. PHONE-BOOTH. GARIBALDI STREET. DAY

           Eichmann stands at a pay-phone. Dials. 
                                 EICHMANN
                        This is a message for Rodo Almirón. 

           Eichmann hesitates. Thinks. Glances across at the side of the 
           road he saw Aharoni and Lothar on. 

                                 EICHMANN (CONT’D)
                        Tell him I’d like to accept his 
                        offer. It is time for us to move.

           EXT. WOODLAND. DAY

           Almirón stands, smoking a cigar. He’s staring at something, 
           deep in thought. We don’t see what.  

           ANTONIO, now dressed in police uniform, approaches. Whispers 
           in his boss’ ear. Doesn’t look at what Almirón’s observing.

                                 ALMIRÓN
                        Have Regina arrange tickets to 
                        Uruguay. Sort security, make sure 
                        word doesn’t spread. Understood? 

           Antonio nods. Eager to please. Goes to leave-

                                 ANTONIO
                        What do you think happened? 

           Now we see what Almirón sees- TWO MANGLED CORPSES. The Jewish 
           Men Antonio, Klaus and the Tacuara were attacking. 

           Almirón puts out his cigar. 

                                 ALMIRÓN
                        Suicide. Such a shame.

           Walks off, leaving Antonio to stare at the bodies. Their 
           injuries suggest death was not self-inflicted.

           INT. ISSER HAREL’S OFFICE. NIGHT

           Stood in front of Harel’s desk, Malkin looks ready. 

                                 HAREL
                        I briefed the others as they left. 
                        But I wanted to speak to you alone. 

           INT. SDE DOV AIRPORT. NIGHT

           Malkin hands over a passport. Loads bags onto scales. 
                                 HAREL (V.O.)
                        President Ben-Gurion greenlit this 
                        mission on one condition. Do you 
                        know what that was?

           INT. AIR FRANCE FLIGHT 304. NIGHT

           Strapped in, Malkin sketches in a South American Guide Book. 
           The beginnings of a picture of his sister, Fruma. 

                                 MALKIN (V.O.)
                        We’re not killing him. You want us 
                        to bring him back to Israel. Alive.

                                 HAREL (V.O.)
                        Ah. Rafi told you?

           Malkin glances up. Notices a DAD strapping his KID in. 

                                 MALKIN (V.O.)
                        No sir. I figured that one.

           He looks away as the Dad hands his boy a TEDDY-BEAR. 

           INT. ISSER HAREL’S OFFICE. NIGHT

                                 HAREL
                        How so? 

                                 MALKIN
                        The whole world deserves to see him 
                        punished. For what he did. 

                                 HAREL
                        I’ll be there too, in an apartment 
                        downtown. But there’s only so much I 
                        can do. If you’re caught, Israel 
                        will deny all knowledge of your 
                        existence. If you fail, Eichmann 
                        escapes justice. Leads a long life. 
                        Maybe he goes on to do it all again. 
                        So don’t fail. For Israel. OK? 

           Off Malkin, considering this.

           INT/EXT. AIR FRANCE FLIGHT 304. NIGHT

           Malkin leans back as the plane SURGES DOWN THE RUN-WAY-

           Outside, the plane hurtles up, up into the sky, over the 
           Mediterranean, leaving Israel far behind. 
           INT. LIVING ROOM. EICHMANN’S HOUSE. NIGHT

           Sat with a small glass of scotch, staring from his window, 
           Eichmann contemplates the world outside.

           He turns to the table. Sheets of hand-written paper lie 
           before him. He continues to add to them. 

           EXT. EZEIZA INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT. BUENOS AIRES. DAY

           A military check-point outside the terminal checks every car 
           that heads in or out. A plane WHOOSHES down to land. 

           INT. PASSPORT CONTROL. LATER

           Stood in front of a rotten-toothed BOARDER GUARD, Malkin 
           waits patiently. The Guard eyes him suspiciously. Eventually 
           STAMPS his passport.

           EXT. ARRIVALS. MOMENTS LATER

           Carrying two heavy bags, Malkin emerges from the airport-

           To find AHARONI, leaning on a FORD TRUCK. Wrapped up against 
           the cold. Malkin approaches. 

                                 MALKIN
                        This the Old Man’s idea? 

                                 AHARONI
                        Rafi’s. 

           Malkin nods. Puts a bag down. Extends his hand. 

                                 AHARONI (CONT’D)
                        First Garibaldi, then we head to 
                        the safe-house. Get in the car. 

           He climbs in the cab. Malkin swallows the snub. Picks up his 
           bags. Places them in the back. 

           EXT. RICCHIERI FREEWAY. DAY

           The truck ploughs along the quiet freeway. Green fields, 
           either side. A bunch of ABANDONED CARS rust away in both.

           EXT. AVENIDO NUEVO DE JULIO. BUENOS AIRES. DAY

           A glitzy street lined with Parisian architecture. 
           Billowing flags, bustling coffee-shops, ornate grated 
           balconies. The Truck rumbles past them all. 

           EXT. AVENIDO MAIPU. BARRIO OLIVIO. DAY

           Grand architecture replaced by quiet residential roads. An 
           ARMY JEEP loaded with soldiers rolls past the FORD TRUCK. 

           INT/EXT. FORD TRUCK

           Aharoni and Malkin drive in silence. After a moment-

                                 MALKIN
                        How’d you get the cars? 

                                 AHARONI
                        Guy called José Moskovits. The Old 
                        Man knows him. He’s the buyer. 
                        Cars, houses, food, weapons. 

                                 MALKIN
                        We don’t need weapons. 

           Silence stretches. Aharoni glances at Malkin.

                                 AHARONI
                        You think you coulda taken better 
                        photos of Attila. Don’t you?

                                 MALKIN
                        Did I say that? 

                                 AHARONI
                        Tell me I’m wrong. 

                                 MALKIN
                             (beat)
                        I wouldn’t have let him see me. 

                                 AHARONI
                        There it is. That Malkin-flavoured 
                        bullshit. You self-righteous prick. 
                        You think I’d let him see me?

                                 MALKIN
                        Guessing so. 14 Garibaldi, right?

           Malkin nods out of the window. Aharoni looks to realise-

           -they’re approaching Eichmann’s house... and there’s a big 
           “En Venta” (For Sale) sign out front. 
           Aharoni slows to a stop. 

                                 AHARONI
                        Fuck me. 

                                 MALKIN
                        The Old Man just might. 

                                 AHARONI
                        We don’t know what this means.

                                 MALKIN
                        It means you spooked him.

                                 AHARONI
                        Listen fuckhead, before you start-

                        Hola? Hello? Are you here to see 
                        the house? 

           They turn to find Vera Eichmann, standing outside the house, 
           staring at the two of them. Little Ricardo, on her hip.

                                 VERA EICHMANN (CONT’D)
                        We weren’t expecting anyone till 4? 

                                 AHARONI
                        No ma’am. We’re just exploring the 
                        area. Thanks. 

           With a curt nod, Aharoni drives off. In the rear-view, Malkin 
           keeps an eye on Vera and baby Ricardo watching them go. 

           EXT. TIRA SAFE-HOUSE. DAY

           An eight-foot wall surrounds the decrepit house. Rotting 
           wooden slates juxtapose faux-opulent Corinthian columns. A 
           house that has never been loved nor cared for.   

           The Ford Truck and a Vauxwagon sit outside. French windows 
           lead out onto wooden decking and a small garden. 

                                 MALKIN (V.O.)
                        We need to move, quickly. The next 
                        few days count for everything.

           INT. DINING ROOM. TIRA. DAY

           Surrounding a big table with a map spread across it are 
           Malkin, Uzi, Dani, Ephraim, Hanna, Rafi and Aharoni. 
           Malkin glances at Rafi, who nods. He looks at Aharoni, who 
           looks away. Close enough. 

                                 MALKIN
                        So, here’s what needs to happen if 
                        we’re going to make this work.

           EXT. RAILWAY EMBANKMENT. DAY

           Lying perfectly still, it’s almost impossible to see MALKIN, 
           half-covered in foliage and brush. Binoculars are watching-

                                 MALKIN (V.O.)
                        First thing’s first. We learn him. 
                        His life, his routine. Everything. 

           EICHMANN. Walks to the road. Then to the kiosk/bus-stop. Buys 
           cigarettes and a paper. Right on cue, the 203 bus turns up. 

                                 MALKIN (V.O.)
                        I want to know when he leaves, how 
                        he leaves, how fast he walks, where 
                        he walks, what the light is like, 
                        when he returns. Spare no detail.

           MALKIN scribbles a note down in a notebook.

           INT. 203 BUS. NIGHT

           Eichmann climbs on. Sits beside an old WOMAN. Takes a bag of 
           her shopping onto his lap to make room. 

                                 AHARONI (V.O.)
                        He works in a Mercedes factory in 
                        Gonzáles Catán. We could grab him 
                        somewhere near there? 

                                 MALKIN (V.O.)
                        It’s too far away. Plus he’s not 
                        alone consistently enough. 

                                 RAFI (V.O.)
                        How about his return journey? 

           Hat tilted to hide his face, RAFI clocks Eichmann, a few rows 
           in front of him. Jots a note down. 

                                 RAFI (V.O.)
                        There’s a blind-spot. Beside a ditch 
                        about 40 metres from his house. 
                        There’s a bush that should stop any 
                        family members spotting us.
           INT. DINING ROOM. TIRA. DAY

                                 RAFI
                        Plus, it’s dark as anything. And the 
                        only time he’s routinely alone. 

                                 YAAKOV 
                        Between us and Garibaldi we can 
                        avoid road-blocks. When it comes to 
                        getting him to the harbour, less so.

           INT/EXT. VAUXWAGON. NEAR ROAD-BLOCK. DAY

           Parked in a residential street, Ephraim chews through a batch 
           of empanadas drenched in chimichurri. Watches something.

                                 MALKIN (V.O.)
                        OK. So we’ll need our escape route 
                        water-tight. 

                                 RAFI (V.O.)
                        Isser wants Attila back here before 
                        we leave to clarify it’s him. 

                                 MALKIN (V.O.)
                        Ephraim? 

           Outside, the GUARDS OF A ROADBLOCK change over at the end of 
           a shift. Ephraim checks his watch. Scribbles down details. 

                                 EPHRAIM (V.O.)
                        Cevallos, Matienzo then down via 
                        Boulogne to here. Far as I can tell, 
                        roadblock soldiers switch at 2000 or 
                        0800. That’s when we slip through.

           EXT. DECKING. TIRA. DAY

           Yaakov pours over a map, marking their escape route in pencil. 
           On the table across from him, Uzi tinkers with an engine. 

                                 UZI (V.O.)
                        We’re gonna need new cars. 

                                 RAFI (V.O.)
                        What about the ones we’ve got?

           Uzi loosens a screw- OIL spurts out, covering Yaakov’s map. 
           Stares daggers at Uzi, who looks mortified.

                                 YAAKOV (V.O.)
                        Trust me. We need new cars. 
           INT. EMPTY ROOM. TIRA. DAY

           Hanna, Rafi and Aharoni turn this room into a cell. Bolt the 
           bed to the floor, hammer blankets up over the windows-

                                 RAFI (V.O.)
                        The plan is to smuggle him onto a 
                        meat-packing ship set for West 
                        Africa. The exact departure time 
                        varies. Weather and tide dependent. 

                                 MALKIN (V.O.)
                        So, we make sure it’s safe to hold 
                        him here at least for a few hours. 

           Hanna rigs a BELL system to the FRONT DOOR. Checks it works. 
           Every time the front door opens, the bell RINGS.

           INT. STUDY. TIRA. DAY

           Pouring over his desk, an X-acto knife slices paper. A 
           magnifying glass, distorting Dani’s pale features. Nearby, a 
           small stack of passports and some Argentine peso notes.

                                 MALKIN (V.O.)
                        Dani. Passports? Visas? 

                                 DANI (V.O.)
                        They’re coming, they’re coming! 

           He sits up, flexing his hand against cramp. As he does, he 
           casts an eye over the pictures of ladies he’s drawn. 

           INT. DINING ROOM. TIRA. NIGHT

                                 MALKIN
                        They need to be ready soon. We 
                        don’t have a second to waste. 

           EXT. BASE OF EMBANKMENT. NIGHT

           Malkin goes to clamber up the bank towards the train tracks- 
           STOPS as he sees a POLICE-CAR driving by. Squat, black and 
           armoured, Argentine police-cars look more like police-tanks.

                                 MALKIN (V.O.)
                        This city’s imploding day by day. We 
                        get this done soon, or we’re gonna 
                        find ourselves buried in the rubble. 

           Finally, they pass. In the ensuing darkness, Malkin climbs. 
           EXT. RAILWAY EMBANKMENT. NIGHT

           Rain tumbles down on Malkin, who is in his usual spot. 
           Binoculars are out, but he doesn’t need them to see-

           -CARS AND MOTORCYCLES OUTSIDE OF THE EICHMANN HOUSEHOLD. 

           He presses the binoculars to his eyes.

           INT. LIVING ROOM. EICHMANN HOUSE

           Lamps illuminate A SMALL PARTY. Klaus, to one side, his arm 
           around a NEW GIRL. Chats with his brother DIETER and boys 
           from the Tacuara. Vera plays the host, glass in hand. An 
           Astor Piazolla record plays in the background.

           A fork TAPS on a glass. Attention shifts to the sofa where 
           Eichmann the entertainer stands. Someone kills the music. 

                                 EICHMANN
                        Now, you all know no party of ours 
                        is complete without a speech or 
                        three. But brief, but brief, OK. To 
                        you, firstly. Friends, loved ones, 
                        new and old. Argentina is nothing 
                        without you. We will miss you all. 

           A general CHEERS from the crowd. Glasses are raised. 

                                 EICHMANN (CONT’D)
                        Then, to my wife. My Vera. You have 
                        come to the ends of the Earth for 
                        me. And, as we prepare to embark on 
                        a new adventure together, I want 
                        you to know how grateful I am. For 
                        your love, your support. Now, this 
                        is really pushing it but if you’ll 
                        endure a moment more. I’m a bit 
                        late this year, darling, but-

                                 VERA EICHMANN
                        Oh no!

           From behind the sofa, Eichmann draws a VIOLIN. 

                                 EICHMANN
                        Oh yes! This year it’s Andreas 
                        Hofer’s “My Love, Do Not Forget Me”. 

           Approaching, Vera pulls Eichmann down into a gentle kiss. 

                                 VERA EICHMANN
                        Silly man. 
           He stands, taking a faux-pompous pose. Begins to play. 

           EXT. RAILWAY EMBANKMENT

           The trill of the music is faint now. The crowd surrounding 
           Eichmann sway with the music. The image BEGINS TO SHAKE-

           ON MALKIN

           Malkin trembles, his breathing heavy. Lowers the binos. That 
           sound, A FLAME IGNITING, THRUMMING LOUDER AS IT BUILDS-

           A FOOTSTEP, nearby. Malkin SPINS, INSTANTLY IN DEFENCE MODE-

           It’s Hanna. She holds her hands up. 

                                 HANNA
                        At least come back long enough to 
                        update us. Maybe take a shower?

           Malkin shakes it off. Nods. Hanna sets off down the hill. 

           Unable to help himself, Malkin steals one last glance back at 
           the house- FREEZES when he spots-

           -a TRIO OF POLICE-CARS coming to a stop outside the Eichmann 
           house. Each of the men who exit (one of whom is Almirón) 
           carry gifts. They head inside. 

           Malkin lowers the binoculars, mind whirring.

           INT. LIVING ROOM. EICHMANN HOUSE. NIGHT

           Pouring a drink, Almirón sees Eichmann approaching. Tilts his 
           glass. What a party. In response, Eichmann hands him a BUNDLE 
           OF PAGES he’s carrying. 

                                 EICHMANN
                        I’ve got a few more volumes in me. 
                        This is mostly logistics. How we 
                        organised the camps, methods of 
                        removing inmates etcetera. 

           Almirón’s smile widens. He holds up his glass and ROARS-

                                 ALMIRÓN
                        To the long life of our host! 

           The crowd respond accordingly. Eichmann basks in it. 
           INT/EXT. CAR/TIRA SAFE-HOUSE. NIGHT

           The car pulls to a stop outside the house. Malkin opens his 
           mouth to say something- stops. Hanna looks at him, waiting. 
           The words just won’t come. She gives up. Goes to climb out-

                                 MALKIN
                        Back in Israel. You told me the news 
                        about Eichmann was good for our 
                        home. And I realised. Watching him. 
                        His family, friends. I don’t... I 
                        haven’t felt that. Home. Not since 
                        Poland. Since I left my sister. 
                        Fruma. Since they, uh. 
                             (all coming out now)
                        I know I had my chance. I know you 
                        think I don’t- that I can’t talk to 
                        you. But I want to. I do. I want to 
                        know what music you like. What food, 
                        what movies, what you do when you’re 
                        not...

                                 HANNA
                        Hunting Nazis? 

                                 MALKIN
                        And when I think about you. About us. 
                        I feel close to it. That feeling. But 
                        then I just can’t. Because they’re 
                        out there. And I- I don’t deserve it. 
                        To be happy. Not while people like 
                        him can be too.

           Malkin takes a moment. Stares into the darkness outside. 

                                 MALKIN (CONT’D)
                        But if we do this. If we get the 
                        Eichmann, make him pay. It’ll be 
                        different. It will. So when we’re 
                        back, maybe we could go for dinner? 
                        At, uh. The Colony Hotel. Maybe?  

           A beat. Hannah laughs. Malkin, affronted, turns to her.

                                 MALKIN (CONT’D)
                        What, seriously? 

                                 HANNA
                        Peter. We have the same job.
                             (off his look)
                        So I know how much you earn.

           Malkin laughs, as he gets what she’s saying. 
                                 MALKIN
                        OK so starters at the Colony Hotel.

                                 HANNA
                        We could share a starter.

                                 MALKIN
                        Then we go to Azura, or Lina maybe. 
                        Some masabacha, hummus.

                                 HANNA
                        Beer.

                                 MALKIN
                        Beer, yeah. 

                                 HANNA
                        I would like that. 

                                 MALKIN
                        You would? 

                                 HANNA
                        You know I would.

           Malkin nods. Hanna smiles. Climbs out. Malkin watches her go. 

           INT. KITCHEN. LATER

           Rafi finishes stirring a coffee. Hands a cup to Malkin. 

                                 RAFI
                        You think it’ll be a problem?

                                 MALKIN
                        We’ll have to get him out of the 
                        country quickly. No way we can know 
                        if it’s specific officers or the 
                        police in general. 

                                 RAFI
                        I’ll speak to the Old Man. 

                                 MALKIN
                        Let’s have the cars sorted tomorrow.

           Rafi nods. A moment’s silence. He studies Malkin.

                                 RAFI
                        Are you smiling? 

                                 MALKIN
                        What? I’m not smiling. 
                                 RAFI
                        You are. Christ it’s like the 
                        heavens opened. Angels are weeping.
                        You got laid. Tell me you got laid?

           Malkin bats Rafi across the head. They laugh.

           EXT. GARDEN. TIRA. DAY

           Next morning, Malkin, shirtless, practices walking up to and 
           grabbing an invisible target, over and over. Totally focused. 

           INT. STUDY. TIRA. DAY

           Dani, wiping sleep from his eyes, returns to his desk. He 
           settles. Finishes writing the serial number on a 1000 peso 
           note. Places it on top of the others. 

           Picks up two INTERNATIONAL DRIVERS LICENSES with Yaakov and 
           Uzi’s pictures on. Admires his handiwork.

           EXT. CAR DEALERSHIP. BARRIO PALERMO. DAY

           Yaakov, aviators on, hands the licenses to an ARGENTINE CAR-
           SALESMAN. As the guy checks them over- 

           -Yaakov nods to Uzi, who heads towards a parked Chrysler.

           Keeping an eye on several POLICE-CARS across the street, 
           outside a municipal building, Uzi bends down. Draws a new 
           LICENSE PLATE from a rucksack. 

           Unscrews the old plate. Chucks it into the trunk. Closes the 
           lid. Another glance around- begins attaching the other one-

           BOOOM!! AN EXPLOSION BURSTS FROM THE SIDE OF THE MUNICIPAL 
           BUILDING- UZI CRACKS HIS HEAD ON THE BUMPER IN THE BLAST- 

           -clutches his head, falling back- doesn’t see the license 
           plate he’s left, dangling half on. 

           Across the road, CHAOS AS THE POLICE BLOW WHISTLES, PEOPLE 
           SCREAM. SOME OFFICERS CALL FOR SUPPORT, others STOP passing 
           cars, searching them, but one, looking around wildly- 

                                 ANTONIO
                        Hey!

           Antonio spots Uzi. The car, and the dangling license plate. 
           He hurries over, his hand on his revolver. 
                                 ANTONIO (CONT’D)
                        What’re you doing down there. Hey? 

           Uzi clutches his head, groaning. Yaakov’s over in an instant.  

                                 YAAKOV
                        Easy, easy. What’s the problem?  

                                 ANTONIO
                        Am I talking to you, Vince Taylor? 
                        I’m interested in your friend here. 

                                 YAAKOV
                        Up you get, habibi-

           Yaakov realises his mistake a heartbeat too late. 

                                 ANTONIO
                        That Hebrew? You Israeli? 

                                 YAAKOV
                             (beat)
                        Everyone says it in New York. I 
                        don’t know where it’s from.

                                 ANTONIO
                        Oh, so you’re American?

                                 YAAKOV
                             (holding out his license)
                        Last I checked. 

                                 ANTONIO
                        Huh. Alright. Alright. And the 
                        license plate. Just came loose, 
                        right? Tell you what. I’m gonna 
                        have a look in your trunk. 
                             (nobody moves; he takes 
                              out his revolver)
                        Open it. 

           Yaakov glances at Uzi. He’s recovered, but looks from Antonio 
           to Yaakov, unsure what to do. 

           A beat. Another. Antonio pulls the hammer back on his gun-

           Yaakov bends down. Inserts the key-

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        AQUI, AQUI!!

           Antonio turns. A group of officers have SWARMED a vehicle- 
           the trunk is open- LOADED with explosives. Two STUDENTS are 
           being dragged from the car and beaten with truncheons. 
           Frowning, Antonio pockets his pistol. Without another word, 
           turns and runs over to join the others. 

                                 YAAKOV
                        Nice and instinctive there, Uz. 

           Hoists the big guy to his feet. 

           INT. DINING ROOM. TIRA. AFTERNOON

           The entire team are gathered. A tension, as tempers run high. 
           Harel paces the room. 

                                 HAREL
                        And you’re sure he said Israeli? 

           Yaakov nods. 

                                 AHARONI
                        What do we do? Reassess?

                                 MALKIN
                        We need to move. Tonight. 

                                 RAFI
                        The room’s barely ready. The “new” 
                        cars haven’t been serviced since 
                        the 1920s. We’re not ready. 

                                 MALKIN
                        If we don’t move tonight, and he 
                        catches even the vaguest hint of 
                        suspicious Israelis in town, that’s 
                        it. We’ve lost him. Maybe forever.

                                 HANNA
                        Peter’s right. 
                             (to Malkin)
                        You’re ready, aren’t you?

                                 MALKIN
                        Yeah. Una momento-

                                 EPHRAIM
                        Un momento, Christ! 

                                 HAREL
                        I need to speak to the President.

                                 MALKIN
                        We can do this. We have to do this, 
                        tonight. Does everyone else know 
                        what they’re doing? 
           The group look at one another. After a moment, Yaakov nods. 
           So does Uzi. Ephraim. Rafi. Eventually, even Aharoni does. 

                                 HAREL
                             (beat)
                        Well what the fuck are you waiting 
                        for, a gold medal? Move!

           EXT. DRIVEWAY. TIRA

           Working fast, Uzi fiddles with the insides of a Buick. Nods 
           to Yaakov, at the wheel. He hits the gas. The engine ROARS. 

           INT. STUDY. TIRA

           Dani continues to work. Nearby, Malkin applies a wig to 
           Aharoni. Firmly positions it on his head. Gestures to Rafi, 
           who’s up next. 

                                 RAFI
                        Don’t be a prick about it.

           INT. DINING ROOM. TIRA

           Yaakov pours over the map. Rubs out one line. Draws another. 

           INT. BEDROOM. TIRA

           Hanna tugs on a dark blue jumper. Opens a medical kit. 
           Extracts a syringe and a small vial. Checks it.

           EXT. DRIVEWAY. TIRA. NIGHT

           Piling out of the house, all dressed in dark clothing, 
           Malkin, Rafi and Uzi climb into the dark Buick, while 
           Aharoni, Hanna and Yaakov get into the grey Chrysler.  

           Dani and Ephraim swing the gates open. The cars stream out. 
           In the distance, THUNDERCLOUDS begin to gather. 

           INT. MERCEDES-BENZ FACTORY. NIGHT

           AN ASSEMBLY LINE. Truck bodies pass through SEARING FLAMES 
           before a TEAM OF WORKERS attach panes of glass. One truck 
           after the other, after the other, after the other. 

           Eichmann watches them. Enraptured. A door opens nearby. A 
           MANAGER asks for a chat but neither we nor Eichmann hear him.
           EXT. GARIBALDI STREET. NIGHT

           Proceeding slowly, the Buick eases to a stop on the edge of 
           the road. Immediately, Uzi climbs out. Pops the hood. Begins 
           to fiddle. Not long after, smoke begins to rise. 

           INT. CHRYSLER. NIGHT

           Watching from behind the wheel, Aharoni’s parked across from 
           the kiosk, perpendicular to Garibaldi. 

           It starts to rain. 

           INT. BUICK. NIGHT

           Rafi checks his watch. 

           Every second ticks LOUDER and LOUDER. 

           Malkin’s eyes, fixed on a patch of shadow near to Eichmann’s 
           house. He fondles the bracelet on his wrist.

           Movement, in the dark. Malkin leans in to get a closer look-

           KNOCK KNOCK! 

           A CYCLIST, JABBERING in Spanish, outside the car, offering to 
           help. He is pointing to the exposed engine. 

           Quickly, Uzi clambers out. Manages to get rid of the guy. 

           Uzi climbs back in, dripping wet. Rafi checks his watch.

                                 RAFI
                        Like clockwork, you said.

           INT/EXT. 203 BUS/GARIBALDI STREET. NIGHT

           The gangly BUS-DRIVER whacks on the wipers. 

           We move BACK, through the bus. ASSORTED PASSENGERS talk, 
           read, snort and snuffle. The bus slows, approaching the kiosk-

           No-one goes to get off so the bus CONTINUES ON. We keep 
           moving backwards and backwards until-

           -we’re outside the bus, looking at Malkin, soaked in rain, 
           exactly where we left him at the beginning. 

                                 UZI (O.S.)
                        What do we do?! Where’s Attila? 
           Spinning on his heel, Malkin bolts back to the car. 

                                 MALKIN
                        We stay put. 

                                 UZI
                        You think he knows? 

                                 MALKIN
                        No, look - through the trees.

           Just visible in 14 Garibaldi, Vera Eichmann prepares dinner. 

                                 MALKIN (CONT’D)
                        You don’t have your family schlep 
                        round the world only to leave 
                        without them at the last minute.

                                 UZI
                        He escaped without them before. 

                                 RAFI
                        We need to consult with the others-

           Just then, A SECOND 203 BUS APPROACHES. The sound of it 
           wheezing its way into the stop. All eyes turn-

           -to see TWO PEOPLE GETTING OFF. 

           One, a woman, turns and walks in the opposite direction. But 
           A MAN WALKS TOWARDS THEM. 

           THEY TENSE. Eyes search the darkness, for a clue, a sign-

           A FLASH OF LIGHTNING illuminates the night for a split-second- 

           -IT IS ADOLF EICHMANN. APPROACHING. 

                                 MALKIN
                        Start the engine. 

                                 RAFI
                        Peter-

           But he’s gone. Moving towards Eichmann. Rain, hammering down, 
           the clouds belching out crashes of THUNDER every few seconds. 

           Closer. Getting closer. 

           All Malkin can hear is his breath. Heavy. Another FLASH OF 
           LIGHTNING- and SOMETHING CATCHES MALKIN’S ATTENTION-

           -movement, in the darkness? Is someone there??
           IN THE CHRYSLER:

                                 AHARONI
                        What the fuck is he doing?

           ON MALKIN: 

           Malkin SNAPS OUT OF IT AS EICHMANN WALKS STRAIGHT PAST HIM-

                                 MALKIN
                        Señor?

           Eichmann stops. Turns, sharply.

                                 MALKIN (CONT’D)
                        Un momenti-to señor.

           The tiniest mistake. But in that split second, Eichmann knows. 
           And, as he OPENS HIS MOUTH TO SCREAM-

           -MALKIN GRABS HIM AROUND THE THROAT. But Eichmann’s faster 
           than he looks- fingers SQUEEZE MALKIN’S WRIST, NAILS BITING-

           WITH A SHOVE, MALKIN AND EICHMANN TUMBLE INTO A MUDDY DITCH-

           IN BUICK:

                                 RAFI
                        Let’s move, let’s move-

                                 UZI
                        Wait! 

           He points- Vera is staring out of the window. Did she hear??

           IN DITCH:

           Animals don’t fight this scrappy. Drenched in mud, Malkin 
           PRESSES into Eichmann’s neck- reaching back, EICHMANN TRIES 
           TO GET TO MALKIN’S EYES, SCRATCHING, POKING-

           -TWISTING HIS BODY, Malkin begins to drag Eichmann up the 
           slope of the ditch- when Eichmann’s SCRABBLING HANDS FIND A 
           ROCK- HE SWINGS IT AT MALKIN, CRACKING HIM IN THE SKULL-

           For a split-second, Malkin’s grip weakens, and Eichmann lets 
           out a BLOODCURDLING SCREAM-

           IN BUICK: 

           Vera back at her cooking- LOOKS UP AS SHE HEARS THE SCREAM-

                                 RAFI
                        GO, GO!
           Uzi REVS the engine, drowning out most of it, as the car guns 
           towards the ditch. Heads to the blind-spot by the hedge/ditch.

           IN DITCH: 

           Eichmann tries to stand, to run- Malkin CRASHES INTO HIM, 
           tackling him to the ground. PRESSES HIS FACE INTO THE MUD-

           In doing so, Malkin catches a glimpse of Fruma’s bracelet. 
           That THRUMMING sound begins. And, as he glances up-

           FRUMA. WATCHING. A TIMELESS RAGE CONTORTING HER FEATURES. 

           TIME SLOWS, as Eichmann STARTS TO DROWN IN THE MUD. Malkin 
           doesn’t let up, gazing at his sister-

           When the Buick SCREECHES TO A HALT. Uzi BURSTS THROUGH THE 
           FORM OF FRUMA, hurrying down the side of the ditch. 

           MALKIN SNAPS OUT OF IT. Lets Eichmann up to breathe. 

           He and Uzi drag Eichmann up the side of the ditch. Neither see 
           Eichmann JERK HIS HEAD, FLINGING HIS GLASSES INTO THE MUD.

           The Chrysler appears immediately afterwards. HURLING OPEN THE 
           DOOR, Yaakov throws Hanna a look- SHE READIES THE SYRINGE- 

           Malkin and Uzi BUNDLE EICHMANN INTO THE BACK OF THE CAR. 
           HANNA GRABS AT HIS ARM, SEARCHING FOR THE VEIN-

           -when Eichmann SLAMS HIMSELF BACK INTO HER- HANNA’S HEAD 
           COLLIDES WITH THE WINDOW, SHATTERING IT WITH THE IMPACT- 

           The syringe falls to the floor- rolls under the chair-

           ON EICHMANN HOUSE:

           The COMMOTION has Vera Eichmann spooked. She’s got the 
           REVOLVER. CHECKING IT’S LOADED, SHE RUNS TO THE DOOR-

           ON BUICK:

           Rafi SLAMS his foot down, engine roars- WHEELS SPIN- 

           ON CHRYSLER:

                                 AHARONI
                        Keep the fuck’s mouth shut, 
                        everyone in, NOW, MOVE!

           He hits the accelerator- ENGINE SPLUTTERS- SURGES FORWARD-

           Uzi slams the door shut. Hops into the Buick with Rafi. 
           Malkin stays in this car, hand clamped over Eichmann’s mouth. 
           Yaakov locates a pair of BLACKED-OUT GOGGLES. Eichmann never 
           once stops staring at Malkin. 

                                 MALKIN
                             (to Hanna)
                        Are you OK? Did he hurt you? 

           Malkin reaches out to her. Takes her head in his hand, 
           searching her eyes. She looks back. Smiles. Woozy, but OK.  

           It’s the last thing Eichmann sees. Yaakov slips the googles 
           over Eichmann’s eyes. Suddenly, their enemy goes very still.

           INT/EXT. CHRYSLER/RESIDENTIAL ROAD. NIGHT

           The car drives in silence. Interrupted by the CHURNING of the 
           engine, as Aharoni tries to shift gear. He GROWLS in fury.

           Hand stemming the blood from her head, Hanna catches a 
           GLIMPSE of Malkin, in the moonlight. Bloody and muddy. 
           Eichmann lies between them. 

           They drive on.

           EXT. TIRA SAFE-HOUSE. NIGHT

           Drenched, Yaakov and Uzi haul gates open. The cars zip 
           inside. A BODY is bundled into the house.

           INT. EICHMANN’S ROOM. TIRA. MOMENTS LATER

           Aharoni, Uzi and Malkin carry Eichmann in. Put him on his 
           feet. He stands still, goggles on. His right hand TWITCHES. 

           Harel and Dani enter the room. Both see Eichmann. A grim 
           smile on Harel’s face. Dani looks like he’s about to faint. 

           Hanna enters, carrying her medical bag. Spotting her, Harel 
           nods to Eichmann. 

           She undoes his shirt. Takes a tape-measure and small light 
           from her medical bag. Examines him. After measuring his head-

                                 HANNA
                        Circumference is 22”. Matches. Scar 
                        on the left brow too. But there’s no 
                        SS number tattoo, nor blood-type. 
                        Dentures, but no cyanide capsule. 

           Harel looks at Uzi. Gestures he stay here. To the rest of the 
           group, he jerks his head- outside, now. 
           Aharoni and Harel step out. As Malkin goes, Uzi touches his 
           shoulder. So does Rafi, then Yaakov. Dani, Hanna, Ephraim. 
           Each of them showing their appreciation in this silent way.  

           INT. CORRIDOR. TIRA

           The group huddle around Harel. 

                                 HAREL
                        I want Attila’s identity confirmed. 
                        Eliminate all doubts. Aharoni, you, 
                        and you alone, are permitted to 
                        talk to him. Get a confession. This 
                        is not a success until you do.

           Aharoni nods. Together, they return to the room. 

           INT. EICHMANN’S ROOM

           Aharoni approaches Eichmann. Forces him onto the bed. Removes 
           the goggles. Eichmann squints, as his eyes adjust.

                                 EICHMANN
                        Ah. I thought so. 

                                 AHARONI
                        If you are honest with us, you will 
                        not be harmed. Do you understand. 

                                 EICHMANN
                        I do. 

                                 AHARONI
                        What is your name? 

                                 EICHMANN
                        Ricardo Klement. 

                                 AHARONI
                        What is your name? 

                                 EICHMANN
                        Would you like to see my passport? 

                                 AHARONI
                        What is your name?

                                 EICHMANN
                        Ricardo Klement.

                                 AHARONI
                        What is your profession? 
                                 EICHMANN
                        Foreman, Mercedes-Benz factory. 

                                 AHARONI
                        Who is your wife? 

                                 EICHMANN
                        Vera.

                                 AHARONI
                        When was your third son born? 

                                 EICHMANN
                        March 29th, 1942.

                                 AHARONI
                        What is your name? 

                                 EICHMANN
                        Ricardo Klement.

           Eichmann continues to answer questions in the background, but 
           we focus on Malkin. Something isn’t right. He whispers to Uzi-

                                 MALKIN
                        He was wearing glasses. 

           Suddenly, it dawns on Uzi. He turns to Rafi and WHISPERS. A 
           similar expression infects Rafi... And Eichmann NOTICES.

                                 AHARONI
                        What is your name? 

                                 EICHMANN
                        Ricardo Klement. 

                                 AHARONI
                        Was your SS number 45,381?

           Eichmann eyes the group. The whispers. The panic. They know. 

                                 EICHMANN
                        The cavalry will, I think, be 
                        amassing already. 

                                 AHARONI
                        When is your birthday?

           Malkin and Eichmann lock eyes. Without looking at Aharoni-

                                 EICHMANN
                        My name is Adolf Eichmann. 
           EXT. TIRA SAFE-HOUSE. NIGHT

           Uzi THROWS HIMSELF INTO THE CHRYSLER- MALKIN GETS THE GATE- 
           IN HIS RUSH TO OPEN IT, HE BREAKS PART OF THE LATCH-

           Forget it. Leaps into the car. They tear into the night. From 
           the shelter of the porch, Harel watches. Chews his lip. 

           INT/EXT. CHRYSLER. NIGHT

           TEARING THROUGH NEAR-DESERTED ROADS, Uzi SWERVES the car 
           around a slow-moving tractor. 

                                 MALKIN
                        Can’t it go any faster? 

           A loud TOOT of an ON-COMING CAR’S HORN- Uzi SWINGS BACK into 
           the correct lane- 

                                 UZI
                        Peter, have you got any idea how 
                        much good luck and fairy dust is 
                        holding this tin-heap together?

           INT. LIVING ROOM. EICHMANN HOUSE. SAME

           Baby Ricardo, BALLING HIS EYES OUT. Klaus enters a house in 
           chaos. His younger brother DIETER is pacing the living room. 
           Vera is trying to calm little Ricardo, but rushes to Klaus. 

                                 VERA EICHMANN
                        Klaus. What do we do??

           He looks at her. The fear in her eyes. 

           EXT. EICHMANN’S HOUSE. NIGHT

           Armed with his father’s revolver and flash-light, Klaus 
           scours the road. His motorbike, parked at the curb.  

           His small beam of light dances across asphalt- suddenly 
           SUBSUMED AS A 203 BUS SURGES TOWARDS HIM. 

           Klaus looks up- WAVES for the bus to slow down. It doesn’t. 

                                 KLAUS
                        Prick!

           But, as the bus passes, there’s a loud CRUNCH as its wheels 
           crush broken glass into the road.
           Klaus picks up a shard. Examines it. 

           Turning, he looks to the nearby ditch. Sees the churned 
           grass, the mud. And, swinging his flashlight-

           -he spots a SHIMMER OF LIGHT. 

           Approaches. Bends down to find HIS FATHER’S GLASSES, THERE IN 
           THE MUD. He goes to extract them-

           WHEN A SCREECH grabs his attention. He LOOKS UP, JUST IN TIME 
           TO SEE THE CHRYSLER ARRIVE AT GARIBALDI STREET- 

           IN CHRYSLER:

                                 UZI
                        Fuck!

                                 MALKIN
                        Keep driving, go, GO!

           ON KLAUS:

           HE AND MALKIN lock eyes. But then Klaus’ gaze strays to the 
           Chrysler’s SMASHED WINDOW- TO THE GLASS ON THE ROAD-

           AND AS THE PIECES FALL INTO PLACE- KLAUS RAISES THE REVOLVER-

           IN CHRYSLER:

                                 MALKIN (CONT’D)
                        The lights!

           Uzi KILLS THE HEADLIGHTS AS- BANG! BANG! 

           The car goes dark as Klaus fires. Unclear if he’s hit them.

           Adrenaline coursing, Klaus hurls himself towards his 
           MOTORBIKE. With a ferocious KICK, the engine GROWLS TO LIFE. 

           INT/EXT. CAR/SAN FERNANDO ROAD

           Lights out, the Chrysler SKIDS AROUND A CORNER. Its back 
           SWINGS, impossible to control. RAIN CONTINUES TO POUND DOWN-

                                 MALKIN
                        Take a left, a left!

           WHITE-KNUCKLES WRENCH THE WHEEL AS-

           -A BEAM OF LIGHT FROM KLAUS’ MOTORCYCLE APPROACHES-

           Teeth bared, revolver raised, Klaus TAKES AIM- FIRES! 
           SMASH! The CHRYSLER’S BACK WINDOW takes the impact- both 
           Malkin and Uzi duck, as Uzi SWINGS ONTO A MAIN ROAD-

           -SLIPS between two SLOW-MOVING TRUCKS- SWERVES, ALMOST LOST 
           IT- normally an artist at the wheel, even Uzi struggles now-

           A HORN BLARES as he SLIPS IN FRONT OF A BUS- IT TURNS SHARPLY-

           -FORCES KLAUS TO SLOW AS THE TAIL OF THE BUS ALMOST HITS HIM-

           EXT. SLIP-ROAD

           The Chrysler thunders into the darkness of the slip-road. A 
           few moments later, Klaus’ motorbike SCREECHES AFTER THEM-

           EXT. RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT

           Racing along, another SHARP TURN FROM UZI- TOO MUCH THIS 
           TIME, the BACK OF THE CAR SPINNING THEM AROUND-

           -to see the LIGHT FROM KLAUS’ bike, getting brighter on a 
           nearby road- the SCREAM OF HIS ENGINE, LOUDER- CLOSER-

           Malkin glances over his shoulder- 

                                 MALKIN
                        Reverse!

                                 UZI
                        What?! 

                                 MALKIN
                        Just do it, now!

           Ramming stick into reverse- the car MOUNTS SOMEBODY ELSE’S 
           DRIVEWAY- HURTLES TOWARDS A TINY SPACE BETWEEN TWO HOUSES- 

                                 MALKIN (CONT’D)
                        To the right, just a touch to the-
                             (off movement)
                        No, your other right-

           Sweat dripping, KLAUS SOUNDING SO CLOSE NOW, Uzi turns the 
           wheel just a hairs-breadth- 

           ON KLAUS:

           He approaches a turn. Hard left. Eyes scanning ahead- 

                                 KLAUS
                        FUCK!! Fuck, fuck!
           NO SIGN OF THEM ANYWHERE. 

           REVVING his engine, Klaus shoots down the road, straight past-

           -THE DRIVEWAY WHERE THE CHRYSLER IS HIDDEN. 

           Malkin and Uzi raise their heads, making sure it’s safe. That 
           was way too close.

           INT. ALMIRÓN’S OFFICE. POLICE STATION. NIGHT

           Done reading Eichmann’s bundle of notes, Almirón turns off 
           his desk-lamp. Just as he does, we spot SIX AIRLINE TICKETS 
           for RICARDO KLEMENT. Uruguay-bound. 

           He goes to leave the room-

           -when his TELEPHONE rings. Almirón glances at the tickets on 
           his desk. Eventually picks up the phone. 

                                 KLAUS (ON PHONE)
                        The Jews. They’ve taken my father. 

           The colour drains from Almirón’s face. 

           EXT. PHONE-BOOTH. GARIBALDI STREET. NIGHT

                                 KLAUS
                        Can you meet at Garibaldi? 

                                 ALMIRÓN (ON PHONE)
                        Give me 30 minutes.

           INT. ALMIRÓN’S OFFICE

           Slamming the phone down, Almirón throws open his door- to his 
           OFFICERS, many of whom are just lounging around-

                                 ALMIRÓN
                        I want all international transport 
                        hubs with large Jewish work-forces 
                        covered. Rail, harbour, move NOW! 
                        And do not be the fuck I flay alive 
                        for asking about overtime. 

           EXT. PHONE-BOOTH. GARIBALDI STREET

           Klaus inserts some more pesos. 
                                 KLAUS
                        Get the Tacuara together. They’ve 
                        taken my father. 

                                 ANTONIO (ON PHONE)
                        Wait, what? Who, who’s taken him? 

           Turning, Klaus sees his MOTHER standing in the driveway, 
           clutching a CRYING RICARDO. 

                                 KLAUS
                        I’m not sure who exactly. But I know 
                        where to ask first. Round up the 
                        men. Mother will welcome you. 

           He hangs up. Vera takes a few steps towards him-

           -Klaus LEAPS ONTO HIS BIKE. KICK-STARTS THE ENGINE. 

           INT. DINING ROOM. HERMANN HOME. NIGHT

           Sat at the table she once ate at with Klaus, Sylvia now 
           studiously pours over textbooks. Just as she turns a page-

           THE FRONT-DOOR BURSTS OPEN, SPLINTERED FROM A KICK- 

           SYLVIA CRIES OUT AS KLAUS ENTERS, PISTOL RAISED-

                                 KLAUS
                        WHERE IS HE?!

                                 SYLVIA
                        Klaus, what are you doing here-

           Klaus grabs her roughly by the jaw. Raises the pistol to her 
           temple. Her eyes dart between the gun and Klaus.

                                 KLAUS
                        I will ask you one more time. Where 
                        have you people taken him? 

                                 SYLVIA
                        I don’t know what you’re-

           WHUMP! Klaus HEADBUTTS Sylvia. Sylvia falls, hard.

           Klaus DRAGS her up so that they’re nose-to-bleeding-nose- 

                                 KLAUS
                        You know, I’m not even gonna kill 
                        you. If you don’t tell me, I’ll 
                        make you watch as I put a bullet in 
                        your old man’s head. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 KLAUS (CONT'D)
                        And then, you still say nothing, I 
                        have one shot left for your spine. 

           Sylvia stares deep into Klaus’ wild eyes... and, mustering 
           everything, SPITS STRAIGHT IN HIS FACE.

                                 SYLVIA
                        I hope he’s looking up from hell. 

           For a moment, it seems like Klaus is going to let this slide- 

           WHEN HE RAISES HIS PISTOL BUTT, GOES TO HIT HER-

           CRACK! A CANE CRASHES STRAIGHT INTO KLAUS’ FACE- he falls 
           back in surprise, DROPPING HIS REVOLVER-

           Quickly off his back, Klaus SCRABBLES FOR HIS GUN-

           -OLD HANDS GRAB IT FIRST. Klaus FREEZES as LOTHAR levels the 
           gun in his direction. Sightless eyes blink hopelessly. 

           A beat. Klaus considers. Takes a step toward Lothar-

           BANG!! 

           A bullet WHIZZES past Klaus, missing him by centimetres. 

                                 LOTHAR
                        One more bullet, by your count. Do 
                        you want to chance it? Leave now, 
                        and we won’t tell every Jew in 
                        Argentina who you really are. Or 
                        that you were overpowered by an old 
                        blind man and his daughter.

           Klaus GLARES at Sylvia and Lothar, weighing up his options. 

           Lothar PULLS THE HAMMER BACK-

           And Klaus RETREATS. SLAMS the front door as he goes. 
           Immediately, Lothar drops the pistol. Fumbles for Sylvia. 

           She reaches out to him, and he takes her in his arms. She 
           SOBS, as he strokes her hair. 

                                 LOTHAR (CONT’D)
                             (whispers, in Hebrew)
                        Shout for joy, O daughter of Zion. 
                        Shout in triumph, O daughter of 
                        Jerusalem. The Lord, in your midst; 
                        you will fear disaster no more.

           We linger as they stand, embracing amongst the wreckage. 
           INT. DINING ROOM. TIRA. LATER

           The team stand in silence (minus Rafi, who’s keeping an eye 
           on Eichmann). Aharoni is glaring across at Malkin, who is 
           pacing back and forth.

           IN THE NEXT ROOM, Dani continues to work. The sound of his 
           knife SLICING PAPER can be heard. 

           Finally, Malkin looks up. Catches Aharoni staring at him. 

           Before either temper can flare- the door opens. Harel enters.

                                 HAREL
                        The Harbour is out. Police overran 
                        the area ten minutes ago. Our 
                        contacts barely got out.  

           The room reacts with muted dismay. 

                                 AHARONI
                        So what do we do?   

                                 HAREL
                        I’ve spoken to Yehuda Shimoni at El-
                        Al. He can get landing clearance, 
                        provide uniforms, and have Yosef 
                        Klein pilot- who I trust. We can get 
                        a plane full of delegates over to 
                        celebrate Argentina’s 150th year. 
                        They fly in, we fly out. It’s a good 
                        cover and we’re in safe hands. 

                                 EPHRAIM
                        But? 

                                 HAREL
                        But it’ll take time to set up. 
                        Nine, ten days. So. Eyes on at all 
                        times. Only Aharoni talks to him. 
                             (turning to him)
                        There’s one more thing. El-Al and the 
                        president are insisting on Attila 
                        signing a document agreeing to stand 
                        trial in Israel. Without it, we’re 
                        not going home. Understood?

           Aharoni nods. The team look at one another. Anxious. 

                                 MALKIN
                        You know how he kept the victims 
                        coming? How he kept the fires of 
                        Auschwitz alight? Synagogue to 
                        synagogue. Home to home. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MALKIN (CONT'D)
                        He isolated our leaders. Convinced 
                        them our people would be safe. 
                        Eichmann didn’t load the trains. He 
                        had us do it for him.

                                 HAREL
                             (beat)
                        Are you suggesting an alternative? 

           Dripped in threat. Malkin holds his tongue.

                                 HAREL (CONT’D)
                        Ten days. Stay low, and pray that 
                        his family do the same. 

           With that, Harel leaves. Malkin looks to Hanna. She returns 
           his look. Both on edge. Ten days. Fuck.  

           INT. LIVING ROOM. EICHMANN HOUSE. DAY (TWO)

           A MAKESHIFT WAR-ROOM. Tacuara and police POUR OVER MAPS of 
           Buenos Aires. Pistols, rifles and sticks with knives attached 
           (where the name “Tacuara” comes from) lie around everywhere. 

           Several MEN are SIFTING THROUGH PICTURES OF EICHMANN. 

           INT. EICHMANN’S BEDROOM

           Ricardo, asleep, rocks gently in his mother’s arms. 

           INT. SPARE BEDROOM. EICHMANN’S HOUSE

           Klaus reloads the revolver. His face has a DARK WELT from 
           Lothar’s cane, distorting his otherwise handsome features. 

           Gun loaded, he looks in the mirror. Brandishes the gun.

           Door opens. It’s Almirón. Jerks his head at Klaus. Outside. 

           EXT. EICHMANN HOUSE. SAME

           Leaning against the wall, Klaus watches Almirón closely. In 
           the background, three police-cars amidst a sea of MOTORBIKES.

                                 ALMIRÓN
                        We need to proceed carefully. 

                                 KLAUS
                        Huh. And father called you his 
                        closest ally. Your plan is to wait?
                                 ALMIRÓN
                        Boy, do not misquote me, especially 
                        when I’ve had this little sleep. I 
                        have loyal men across the force, but 
                        not its entirety. If we’re careful, 
                        whispers will reach me. But if 
                        they’re louder than whispers, you 
                        may lose me very quickly. 

                                 KLAUS
                        So what do we do? 

                                 ALMIRÓN
                        Sassen has Der Weg running a full-
                        page reward sheet for the safe 
                        return of Ricardo Klement. It’ll 
                        note his German identity. It will 
                        offer $10,000, the exact amount the 
                        Israelis offered when they thought 
                        Eichmann was hidden in Kuwait. 

                                 KLAUS
                        And people will get that?

                                 ALMIRÓN
                        Our friends will. You’ll see. Who 
                        do you think sold him out? 

           A beat. Klaus shrugs. Doesn’t know. 

                                 KLAUS
                        When does the search begin? 

                                 ALMIRÓN
                        It already has. 

           EXT. SYNAGOGUE. BUENOS AIRES. NIGHT

           Two TACUARA BOYS sit atop motorbikes, watching the Synagogue 
           like hawks. They REV at a group of leaving worshippers.

           EXT. MERCEDES BENZ FACTORY. GONZÁLES CATÁN. DAY (THREE)

           Two OFFICERS STAPLE UP POSTERS. We catch a glimpse of a 
           picture of Eichmann on them.

           EXT. ROAD BLOCK. HIGHWAY. BUENOS AIRES. DAY

           Soldiers stop a car. HAUL A HASIDIC JEW OUT- HIS WIFE AND TWO 
           BOYS SCREAM as the soldiers point guns at them to be quiet. 
           One, armed with a “Missing: Ricardo Klement” POSTER, forces 
           him to open the trunk.

           INT. STUDY. TIRA. DAY (FOUR)

           Rafi enters. Approaches Dani’s desk, where he toils away. He 
           notices, pinned up on a wall, a sketch of a beautiful woman.

                                 RAFI
                        Who’s the lovely lady? 

           Dani shrugs. Rafi’s eyes roam the room. Spots PESOS notes. 

                                 RAFI (CONT’D)
                        You make these too? 

                                 DANI
                        Just in- you know, in case. 

                                 RAFI
                        We shouldn’t use ‘em. Too risky. 
                        Nice idea, wrong move. Sorry Dani. 

           Dani nods, more to himself. The mood suddenly seems more 
           hostile. Rafi retreats. 

           INT. TIRA SAFE-HOUSE. DAY

           Aharoni pokes his head into the room with Eichmann-

           -Ephraim reads. Sees Aharoni. Gets up to swaps places. 

                                 AHARONI
                        He said anything yet? 
                             (Ephraim shakes his head; 
                              to Eichmann)
                        The cavalry’s taking its sweet time 
                        huh? Come on. Up. Time for a talky. 

           Eichmann doesn’t respond. Blacked-out goggles and gag are on. 
           He’s been dressed in STRIPED PYJAMAS. His hand twitches.

           EXT. RICCHIERI FREEWAY. DAY (FIVE)

           Uzi drives the Chrysler straight off the road. Ploughs across 
           a field a short distance, until he’s by other ruined cars. 

           INT. DINING ROOM. TIRA. DAY

           Yaakov paces. His hands touches each wall as he passes. 
           Ephraim plays chess against Malkin. Malkin studies the board, 
           while Ephraim watches Yaakov pacing. 

           INT. EICHMANN’S ROOM. DAY

           Hanna stares at Eichmann, lying there calmly. After a moment-

                                 EICHMANN
                        Are you wearing perfume? Perhaps 
                        not. Maybe it’s just you. 

           She says nothing. 

           EXT. FIELD. AIRPORT HIGHWAY. DAY

           Harel and Ephraim arrive in the Buick. Park alongside the 
           Chrysler, which Uzi is crouched under. 

           As they disembark, Uzi pulls himself from under the car. 
           Wipes his hands on his trousers. Jerks his head to them both. 

           Walking away, in the direction of the airport, they ignore 
           the Chrysler as it CATCHES FIRE. The Buick follows. 

           INT. DINING ROOM. TIRA. SAME

           Aharoni, asleep on the couch. Deep snores. Malkin, nearby, 
           sketches in his guidebook. Finishes a picture of his sister 
           Fruma. Flicks back over the previous pages. Picture after 
           picture of her, her children...

                                 HANNA (O.S.)
                        What’re you doing? 

           Malkin looks up. She’s standing there. 

                                 MALKIN
                        Nothing. 

           He closes the book. Hanna watches him. 

                                 HANNA
                        You up next? 

                                 MALKIN
                        No, but... You wanna try waking him? 

                                 HANNA
                        He stinks by the way. Attila. Every 
                        few minutes, he lets out a squeak. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 HANNA (CONT'D)
                        It’s been five days, the guy’s gut 
                        must be exploding.

           Malkin laughs at this. Hanna laughs seeing him laugh. 

                                 HANNA (CONT’D)
                        What? 

                                 MALKIN
                        Gross. 

           The laughter subsides. They stare at each other a moment. 
           Tension, rising. She takes a tentative step towards him...

           A SNORT from Aharoni, who turns in his sleep. Breaks the 
           moment completely. 

                                 HANNA
                        I’m gonna-

                                 MALKIN
                        Yeah. Yeah. 

           Hanna heads upstairs. Off Malkin, watching.

           EXT. AIRPORT LONG-STAY CAR-PARK. DAY

           With Ephraim and Harel keeping watch, Uzi quickly BREAKS INTO 
           an old FORD. Climbs in. They follow. 

           EXT. AIRPORT ROAD-BLOCK. DAY

           Driving slowly, Uzi, Harel and Ephraim see TACUARA BOYS 
           STICKING UP ‘RICARDO KLEMENT’ posters. A reward of $10,000. 

           A POLICEMAN converses with the soldiers. Turns his head, 
           feeling eyes on him- Uzi turns away as they’re waved through 
           the road-block. 

           INT. STUDY. TIRA SAFE-HOUSE. DAY

           Bent over a magnifying glass, Dani puts a tiny delicate touch 
           to a SIGNATURE ON AN ARGENTINE VISA-

           -when he hears a commotion outside. Looks up. A FEMALE VOICE.

           INT. ENTRANCE HALL. TIRA

           Poking his head out, Dani sees Rafi arguing with a CLEANER 
           (CATALINA) at the front door.
           Undeniably sexy in her way, there is something about Catalina 
           that just stinks of trouble. 

                                 RAFI
                        No! Gracias, no! Christ alive.

                                 CATALINA
                        Necessito señor. Tengo que limpiar! 
                        Necessito dinero, señor, dinero!  

                                 RAFI
                        I do not speak Spanish, can you- 
                        who is she, what is she doing here? 
                        Does anyone understand her?!

                                 DANI
                        She’s saying- she’s saying she’s a, 
                        uh a- a cleaner, I think. 

           INT. EICHMANN’S ROOM. TIRA. SAME

           Hearing the foreign voice, a gagged Eichmann, hand cuffed to 
           the bed, begins KICKING THE WALL, RATTLING HIS HANDCUFF-

           Yaakov, watching him, quickly JUMPS UP, grabbing his legs-

           INT. ENTRANCE HALL. TIRA. SAME

           Catalina hears the banging. She stops talking to listen. The 
           quiet sounds of a SCUFFLE. Just as Rafi notices-

                                 DANI
                        Here. Dinero. 

           He’s holding some of the FAKE PESOS Rafi saw him make 
           earlier. Avoids Rafi’s eye as he holds the note to Catalina. 

           After a moment, she takes the money. Nods slowly. 

                                 DANI (CONT’D)
                             (to Rafi)
                        I’ll show her out. 

           He steps out. Gestures her to follow. Rafi watches them go. 

           INT. EICHMANN’S ROOM. TIRA. MOMENTS LATER

           Entering, Malkin finds Yaakov GRABBLING WITH EICHMANN WHO- 

           KICKS OUT. Catches Yaakov in the face, BUSTING HIS NOSE. 
                                 YAAKOV
                        Sonofabitch-

           He goes to PUNCH EICHMANN- stops, when he sees Malkin. 

                                 YAAKOV (CONT’D)
                        Your shift? 

                                 MALKIN
                        Yeah. 

           Hand over his now-bleeding nose, Yaakov CURSES as he leaves. 

           EXT. TIRA SAFE-HOUSE. DAY

           Catalina, grumbling as she’s shown out. In the argument, a 
           button on her blouse has come undone. She goes to leave-

                                 DANI
                        Uh... Here. Por lo siento.

           He peels off another note. Holds it out. She eyes the rest of 
           the notes in his hand. Notices Dani, looking at her cleavage. 

           He averts his gaze, embarrassed. She gives a small smile. 
           With one last look at the pesos in his hand... she leaves.

           INT. EICHMANN’S ROOM. TIRA. SAME

           Malkin closes the door after Yaakov. The moment it clicks-
           Eichmann begins MAKING NOISE into his gag. His leg, tapping. 
           Not like he’s trying to be heard- like he’s in pain. 

           Sitting on the chair, Malkin takes out his guide-book. Finds 
           a blank page to draw on. Tries to start drawing. 

           Eichmann continues- tap, tap, MMM, MMM, tap, tap, MMM, MMM-

           Snapping, Malkin goes over. Grabs Eichmann’s throat.

                                 MALKIN
                        Stop it. 

           Eichmann’s head turns to the source of the noise. 

                                 MALKIN (CONT’D)
                        You want something? If you scream...

           He squeezes Eichmann’s throat, just slightly. Eichmann nods, 
           then falls still. Malkin slowly takes the gag from his mouth.  
                                 EICHMANN
                        Herr Captor. I need the bathroom.

                                 MALKIN
                        Herr Captor?

                                 EICHMANN
                        Does the man who seized me have a 
                        name he’d prefer? I recognise your 
                        voice. And those hands.

                                 MALKIN
                        Not another word.

                                 EICHMANN
                        We can dispense with the murder 
                        threats if you like. We both know 
                        you won’t kill me. Not here anyway.

                                 MALKIN
                        Trust me, nothing would give me 
                        more pleasure. 

                                 EICHMANN
                        Oh, I know. In the mud. I could tell. 
                        Such passion. 

                                 MALKIN
                        Give me a reason. Any reason.

                                 EICHMANN
                        There’s someone watching.

           Too quickly, Malkin lets go of Eichmann’s throat. Turns to 
           find UZI, returned from dropping off the cars. On edge.

           Straightening up, Malkin nods to Eichmann. 

                                 MALKIN
                        He needs to shit. Wanna help? 

           A small smile, on Eichmann’s lips. 

           INT. BATHROOM. TIRA. MOMENTS LATER

           Shuffling along, hands cuffed and blacked-goggles still on, 
           Eichmann fumbles around for the toilet. 

           Malkin and Uzi watch from the doorway. They both avert their 
           eyes as Eichmann lowers his trousers.  

                                 EICHMANN
                        May I sit, Herr Captor? 
                                 MALKIN
                        Just get it going. 

           Eichmann settles himself. A silence follows. 

                                 EICHMANN
                        This would be much easier if I had 
                        something to read.

                                 MALKIN
                        I think we’ve got a copy of Mein 
                        Kampf lying around somewhere.

           Eichmann laughs. A genuine chuckle. Surprisingly warm. But, 
           as he does- a horrible GROAN erupts.

                                 EICHMANN
                        Ugh, here we go. 
                             (beat; then)
                        You know, this reminds me of a time. 
                        My father worked at the Tramway and 
                        Electrical in Linz. I loved going to 
                        his office when I was a boy. 
                        Everything was so new. Ductile 
                        tungsten in the lightbulbs. An air-
                        conditioning unit. Even cross-words 
                        were a novelty back then.

           A bubbling FART erupts from Eichmann. Malkin, in spite of 
           himself, has to stifle a laugh. 

                                 EICHMANN (CONT’D)
                        That’s it! Anyway. Anyway. The 
                        first time I visited, I was nine. 
                        He introduced me so proudly. “My 
                        boy”, he said. “This is my boy”. 

           Another horrible BOWEL SOUND. This time Eichmann chuckles. 

                                 EICHMANN (CONT’D)
                        So imagine my dismay when I use the 
                        bathroom- this gleaming palace- and 
                        I unleash hell. It was like a whole 
                        other person fell out of me. Rather 
                        like now.

           Once more, Eichmann’s bowels CHURN LOUDLY- he’s letting rip, 
           and it couldn’t sound or look funnier. Uzi lets out a short 
           laugh, but catches himself. This triggers Malkin who has to 
           bite his tongue. 

                                 EICHMANN (CONT’D)
                        It blocked the toilet, and my Papa 
                        had to pay for the repairs. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 EICHMANN (CONT’D)
                        He was furious, naturally. But I 
                        think- oh Christ that was sore- I 
                        think he was a little proud also. 
                        With how I handled myself. Nearly 
                        there!

           The noise that follows is a DEEP RUMBLE. It’s too much for 
           Malkin and Uzi, who are barely disguising their laughs. 

                                 EICHMANN (CONT’D)
                        I strolled up to him. Told him what 
                        I’d done. And, before he began to 
                        hit me, I said: “Everybody does it, 
                        Papa.” It’s true. Everybody shits. 
                        Knowing that I was never scared of 
                        another human being again. 

           With a final PUSH AND A SPLASH- the carnage comes to an end. 

                                 EICHMANN (CONT’D)
                        Whoa! If only you’d covered my nose 
                        as well as my eyes. May I wipe now, 
                        Herr Captor? 

           Wiping a tear from his eye, Malkin looks to Uzi who is doing 
           the same. Tension from earlier has dissipated. 

                                 MALKIN
                        Go ahead. 

           INT. EICHMANN’S. TIRA. MOMENTS LATER

           Returning the prisoner, Malkin handcuffs him back to the bed.

                                 EICHMANN
                        My mother died when I was 10 years 
                        old. It was the saddest I think I’ve 
                        ever felt. A few months later, my 
                        father had a new woman, from our 
                        local church. Maria. Always 
                        efficiency with him. Endless. 
                             (then)
                        You want me to eat, to shit, to sign 
                        something like that prick keeps 
                        asking? I’ll think about it. But it 
                        has to be you, Herr Captor. I want 
                        to be speaking with you.

           EXT. GARDEN. TIRA. DAY

           Pacing, furious, Harel occasionally stops to point at Malkin 
           without quite knowing what he wants to say. 
           Aharoni, in the background, stares daggers at Malkin. Nearby, 
           Uzi stands guiltily. Hanna and Yaakov linger too.

                                 HAREL
                        You broke rank. Protocol. Clear 
                        instruction. Do you remember what I 
                        said to you. Back in Israel, do you 
                        remember what I told you? 

                                 MALKIN
                             (beat)
                        No. 

                                 HAREL
                        OK me neither, but I’m fucking 
                        certain it was something to do with 
                        you not doing this. 

                                 AHARONI
                        He’s a liability.

                                 HAREL
                        You fucking wait your turn sleeping 
                        beauty. When I’m done with this 
                        schmuck, I’m tearing you a new one. 

                                 MALKIN
                        I can get him to sign off on the 
                        trial in Israel. He’ll talk to me. 

                                 AHARONI
                        He’s playing you, idiot.

                                 MALKIN
                        You think I don’t know? We need a 
                        scribble on a piece of paper. Let 
                        me in the game, I’ll get it. 

                                 HAREL
                             (long beat)
                        You get me results. Or I swear to 
                        Christ, I’ll throw you to the 
                        wolves myself. Understand? 
                             (off Malkin’s nod)
                        Just a few more days. We heard 
                        anything on the radio about the 
                        search-party? The posters? 

           General head-shakes from the group.

                                 HAREL (CONT’D)
                        Hold it together, people. Peter. 
                        We’re depending on you now.
           He heads inside. The others follow, except for Hanna. 

                                 MALKIN
                        What? 

                                 HANNA
                        Don’t fuck this up.

                                 MALKIN
                        Because everyone else was doing 
                        such a good job before!

           Stung, Hanna heads inside. Malkin watches her go.

           A few Tacuara doze on the sofa. Several others drink, chat. 
           Klaus enters, pulling off his motorcycle helmet. 

                                 KLAUS
                        Oh. So you’ve found him then? 

                                 TACUARA MEMBER
                        We were just taking a rest!

                                 KLAUS
                        How about you rest when one of us 
                        isn’t being tortured by the fucking 
                        enemy you shit for brains. 

           Klaus goes to lash out- when he spots ALMIRÓN at his window. 
           Once again, he gestures for Klaus to step outside.

           EXT. EICHMANN’S HOUSE. MOMENTS LATER

                                 ALMIRÓN
                        We’ve heard nothing from our friends 
                        on the boarders, which is 
                        encouraging. But better, we’ve had 
                        men stationed near the Ricchieri 
                        highway put out a fire lately. 
                        They’re pretty common, but one of 
                        them noticed a detail. Sent this.

           He hands Klaus a picture of the burnt-out CHRYSLER. 

                                 KLAUS
                        That’s it. That’s the car!

                                 ALMIRÓN
                        A few holiday-makers returned from 
                        Panama yesterday. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ALMIRóN (CONT'D)
                        Imagine their surprise when they 
                        couldn’t find their Ford. 
                             (another photo)
                        We cross-referenced the license 
                        with army contacts. They checked 
                        the central data-base. A car 
                        matching that description and 
                        registration passed a check-point 
                        into the Floresta Barrio. I think 
                        they’re still here, and I think 
                        that or a nearby barrio is where 
                        they’re holding your father. 

           Klaus grins. Grasps Almirón’s hand in thanks. 

           INT. EICHMANN’S ROOM. TIRA. NIGHT

           Malkin enters with a tray of food. Eichmann is lying on his 
           bed, very still. His hand twitches but only occasionally now.

                                 MALKIN
                        Eat. 

           Eichmann sits up. Opens his mouth. Malkin feeds him. Notices 
           beside the bed, the document Eichmann still hasn’t signed. 

           EXT. STREET OUTSIDE TIRA. MORNING (SEVEN)

           Catalina, on her way to clean a different house, stops 
           outside Tira. Stares in. She can see Dani, in his study. 

           She glances at the gate. Tests the latch that Malkin broke 
           days before. Sees how easily it opens. A plan begins to form. 

           INT. EICHMANN’S ROOM. TIRA. NIGHT

           Hanna checks Eichmann’s pulse. His pupils. His feet- swollen 
           and red. She frowns. Turns to Malkin, who is watching her. 

                                 HANNA
                        I’m worried about thrombosis. He 
                        needs to exercise. 

           Malkin nods. Doesn’t notice Eichmann, studying them both. 

           EXT. GARDEN. TIRA. DAY (EIGHT)

           Walking back and forth across a wooden terrace, Malkin begins 
           to bark COMMANDS at Eichmann, who SQUATS in time to his count. 
           Both Yaakov and Uzi, sat at the decking, head inside. 

           INT. DINING ROOM. TIRA. LATER

           Yaakov, nose clearly broken, wanders the room. Touches every 
           wall he passes. He’s sweating. Rafi enters. 

                                 YAAKOV
                        Malkin still out there with him? 

                                 RAFI
                        No one should be cooped up like 
                        this. We understand. 
                             (re: Yaakov’s agitation)
                        When did it start? 

                                 YAAKOV
                        You know, those fuckers, they’d put 
                        eight cows in each train-cart. 
                        Eight cows. 110 people though. 
                        More, if we were kids.

                                 RAFI
                        I’m sorry. Did you- no. I’m sorry.

                                 YAAKOV
                        Just- get Malkin to hurry up. 

           Rafi goes to leave- stops. 

                                 RAFI
                        Take a walk around the block. Just 
                        once. That’s an order.

           Yaakov nods, although without conviction. Rafi leaves.

           INT. FRONT DOOR. TIRA SAFE-HOUSE. MOMENTS LATER

           Yaakov goes to leave- the alarm-bell Hanna rigged DINGS. 
           Catches the attention of Harel and Aharoni, talking nearby. 

                                 HAREL
                             (turning to Yaakov)
                        Where are you going? 

                                 YAAKOV
                        A walk. That OK?

           Harel looks at Aharoni. He pulls out a Ricardo Klement poster. 

                                 AHARONI
                        All over the barrio. Past few days. 
                                 YAAKOV
                        Shit. So we move him? 

                                 HAREL
                        We’re looking at options. With the 
                        posters though, it’s dangerous. 

                                 YAAKOV
                        So what do we do? 

           Aharoni takes out a PISTOL. Harel looks away in frustration. 

                                 YAAKOV (CONT’D)
                        Christ, where’d you get that?

                                 AHARONI
                        Same guy that sorted the house. You 
                        go out, you take this. OK? 

           He offers the butt to Yaakov. Yaakov takes his jacket off. 
           Heads back inside. 

           INT. EICHMANN’S ROOM. NIGHT

           A NEEDLE comes down on an old record player. The strings of 
           Carlos Gardel’s Por Una Cabeza. Malkin sits back. Folds his 
           arms. Stares at Eichmann who listens, eyes closed. A glass of 
           wine, in his hand. 

                                 MALKIN
                        Sign it. Stand trial in Israel. Let 
                        the world hear the Adolf Eichmann 
                        story.

                                 EICHMANN
                        El Zorzal Criollo. The Creole 
                        Thrush. That’s what they called 
                        this man. Strange, isn’t it. What’s 
                        acceptable, what isn’t. What is 
                        your name, Herr Captor? 

                                 MALKIN
                        You have wine. You have music.

                                 EICHMANN
                        I would like a name. I would like 
                        to know what brought us together. I 
                        would like to know about your place 
                        in the world. 

                                 MALKIN
                        I won’t have one, soon. 
                                 EICHMANN
                        Because you have me? Or because 
                        you’ve met someone special, maybe?

                                 MALKIN
                        Because one day it will all be 
                        machines. One day we’ll be able to 
                        find people like you instantly. 

                                 EICHMANN
                        Ah. And how will that work? 

                                 MALKIN
                        I don’t know. But it will. 

                                 EICHMANN
                        Or else people like me remain free. 
                        But then what about people like you? 

                                 MALKIN
                        Just sign the damn paper.

           Eichmann leans back in his bed. Listens to the music. Sips 
           his wine. SNAPPING, Malkin snatches the glass off of him. 
           Turns the music off. Leaves Eichmann, handcuffed to the bed.

           INT. BEDROOM. TIRA. (DAY NINE)

           Light spills in to a bedroom through a crack in the curtains. 
           Hanna, clearly not having slept, checks her watch. Gets up. 

           INT. DINING ROOM. TIRA. DAY

           Malkin prepares a tray of food. Watched by Aharoni, across 
           the room. Rafi sat at the table, reads a book. Eventually-

                                 MALKIN
                        Nine days. Still no word? 

                                 AHARONI
                        Oh, yeah we had confirmation ages 
                        ago. We just didn’t tell you. 

           Rafi looks up at Aharoni- stop being a asshole. 

           Malkin picks up his tray. Goes to take it through-

                                 AHARONI (CONT’D)
                        Better go before it gets cold. 

           Malkin stops beside Aharoni. 
                                 MALKIN
                        Don’t worry. When we get back, 
                        everyone will hear how you 
                        interrogated the shit outta him.

           In spite of himself, he pats Aharoni on the shoulder-

           -WHO GRABS MALKIN’S WRIST- TWISTS, APPLYING PRESSURE- THE 
           TRAY OF FOOD GOES FLYING-

           -MALKIN COUNTERS, KICKING AHARONI’S LEGS FROM UNDER HIM-

                                 RAFI
                        HEY!!

           AHARONI CRUMPLES AT THE FORCE- RECOVERS- SWIPES, CATCHING 
           MALKIN IN THE FACE- MALKIN GOES TO STRIKE AHARONI AGAIN-

           Rafi’s there, wrenching the two of them apart. 

                                 RAFI (CONT’D)
                        What the fuck is wrong with you two?

           INT. EICHMANN’S ROOM. TIRA

           Lying there, Eichmann listens to the muffled argument raging. 

           INT. DINING ROOM. TIRA

                                 AHARONI
                        You kidding, you see this prick? 

                                 MALKIN
                        He’s an asshole, has been since-

                                 RAFI
                        You. Peter. Not another word. If 
                        you want us to get out of here 
                        alive you will get that damn 
                        signature like you promised. 

           Glaring at Aharoni, Malkin storms out. 

           INT. EICHMANN’S ROOM. TIRA. MOMENTS LATER

           Entering, Malkin takes Eichmann’s goggles off. Sits opposite. 
           Presses the pen and agreement to stand trial into his hands.

                                 MALKIN
                        No more games. 
                                 EICHMANN
                        As I’ve said, I will stand trial in 
                        Germany. Like Merten, like Bohne. 

                                 MALKIN
                        That’s not what we’re offering.

                                 EICHMANN
                        What do I stand to gain, signing? 

                                 MALKIN
                        You get to tell your story.

                                 EICHMANN
                        My story, the Eichmann version, the 
                        same offer, again, again. But I 
                        don’t want to tell my story. Not 
                        until I’ve heard one. Your story.

                                 MALKIN
                        I have no story. I’m just the devil.

                                 EICHMANN
                        Here to take me to hell. You think 
                        that’s where I’ll go, don’t you? 
                        You’re too young for the World War, 
                        but Israel’s Independence- maybe. 
                        And, will you join me in hell? For 
                        following orders. For sharing in 
                        the glory of fighting your 
                        country’s enemy. 

                                 MALKIN
                        I was protecting my country. 

                                 EICHMANN
                        Hmm. I was there- Israel I mean- 
                        after al-Qassam in ‘36. I saw how you 
                        Israelis protected yourselves then. 

                                 MALKIN
                        We fought invaders, on all sides, 
                        enemies who outnumber and outgun 
                        us. We don’t slaughter women. Kids. 

                                 EICHMANN
                        And yet. And yet, I hear whispers. 
                        Rumours of a bell-shaped facility 
                        in the hills of Dimona. Where the 
                        nuclear scientists of Rehovot talk 
                        over coffee, horde uranium, and 
                        plan. Plan for what, I wonder?

           A silence, as Malkin reflects on this. 
                                 MALKIN
                        “Never again”. You know better than 
                        any why we live by that motto now.

                                 EICHMANN
                        You know, I never saw you people as 
                        the plague Hitler did. I said it, 
                        sure, we had to. But you Jews. You 
                        aren’t a unique threat. No, no. 
                        You’re just people. You’re all just 
                        as dangerous as the rest of us. 

                                 MALKIN
                        You’re nothing like us. 

                                 EICHMANN
                        “Shma Yisrael, adonai elohenu, 
                        adonai echad.” See, I can be. 

           Stung by hearing the sacred words from his mouth, Malkin 
           takes a moment. Feigns indifference. Soldiers on.

                                 MALKIN
                        If you believe that. Truly, if that 
                        makes up some internal logic for 
                        you, if you were just following 
                        orders, then tell the world. Tell 
                        them you were just another soldier. 
                        You were just doing your job. 

           A silence stretches as Eichmann considers. 

                                 EICHMANN
                        What’s your name? You’re getting 
                        warmer... 

                                 MALKIN
                             (beat)
                        Peter. 

                                 EICHMANN
                        Do you have any children, Peter?

                                 MALKIN
                        No. 

                                 EICHMANN
                        Hmm. I’ve been thinking you look 
                        like you could do with a good 
                        woman. But then couldn’t everyone. 
                        But children. They make it all make 
                        sense. Maybe one day you’ll know. 
                                 MALKIN
                        I don’t need you to tell me that.
                             (then)
                        My sister had children. Three. 

                                 EICHMANN
                        Had. I see. The camps?

                                 MALKIN
                        Your people never even took her 
                        that far. She died in the woods. 
                        Trying to protect her boys. They’d 
                        have been similar ages to yours. 
                        They were all killed too.

           A long pause follows. Eichmann sighs. Seems deeply affected. 

                                 EICHMANN
                        I am sorry, Peter. Truly sorry. I 
                        don’t- she, uh- may I ask her name? 

                                 MALKIN
                             (beat)
                        Fruma. 

                                 EICHMANN
                        Fruma. Fruma. 

           Slowly, Eichmann picks the document and pen up from the table 
           by his bed. He reads it, slowly.  

                                 EICHMANN (CONT’D)
                        My family. You’ll leave them alone?

                                 MALKIN
                        Sign the document. 

                                 EICHMANN
                        Whatever happens. You promise? 
                        Nothing else matters.

                                 MALKIN
                             (beat)
                        They’ll be safe. We don’t harm 
                        innocent women and children. 

           Nodding at this, Eichmann SIGNS THE DOCUMENT. Hands it to 
           Malkin, along with the pen.

                                 EICHMANN
                        Thank you, Peter. For talking to me. 
                        For treating me like- like you have.

           In response, Malkin gets up. Leaves. Hold on Eichmann. 
           INT. CORRIDOR. OUTSIDE EICHMANN’S ROOM. MOMENTS LATER

           Closing the door, Malkin lets out a long, deep breath.

           INT. DINING ROOM. TIRA. MOMENTS LATER

           Aharoni, Yaakov, Rafi and Uzi are all playing cards at the 
           table. Aharoni throws a few paper chips into the middle. 

           Malkin enters. 

                                 MALKIN
                        Where’s Hanna? 

                                 RAFI
                        Outside. Why?

           He puts the signed document on the table beside Rafi without 
           breaking his stride. Walks through the French doors outside.

           Rafi glances at the doc. Takes a second to register-

                                 RAFI (CONT’D)
                        He got it! He fucking got it!!

           EXT. GARDEN. DAY

           Walking loops around the house, her hands in her pockets, 
           Hanna looks up suddenly as Malkin approaches.

                                 HANNA
                        You look like you’ve seen a ghost-

           He SLAMS INTO HER, wrapping her in his arms, his forehead 
           pressed to hers, their lips, centimetres apart- 

           -breath heavy, he BACKS HER INTO THE WALL- her hands, on his 
           back, his strong arms, pinning her- but they don’t kiss. 

                                 HANNA (CONT’D)
                        Peter- Peter.

           Something is stopping them. Like two magnets of the same pole. 

                                 HANNA (CONT’D)
                        When we’ve got him back. OK?

                                 MALKIN
                        OK. OK. I just...

                                 HANNA
                        I know. Thank you. 
           He relaxes. She smiles. Runs her fingers through his hair. 

           EXT. TERRACE. NIGHT

           Sat on the decking, sipping beers, the team seem relaxed for 
           the first time in a while. In amongst the group is Malkin, 
           chatting to Yaakov. A few empty bottles, at his feet.

           He steals a glance at Hanna. She looks back. Winks.

           His eyes seek out Aharoni, who looks a little sullen. In 
           spite of himself, he tilts his beer to Malkin in recognition. 

           Applause erupts as Rafi, apron adorned, steps out onto the 
           terrace with a plate of FRESHLY COOKED STEAKS.

                                 RAFI
                        I hope you all like whatever comes 
                        after “well-done”.                

           INT. EICHMANN’S ROOM. TIRA. LATER

           Dani swaps with Ephraim, who rushes off to join the party. 

           Goggles still off but eyes closed, Eichmann lies in bed 
           listening to the merriment outside. He takes a deep SNIFF.

           EXT. TIRA SAFE-HOUSE. NIGHT

           All is quiet. Lights are out. Tonight’s revelry, over.

           At the gates, a pair of hands SLOWLY OPEN THE BROKEN LATCH.

           INT. EICHMANN’S ROOM. TIRA. SAME

           Eichmann sleeps. Dani does his level best not to look at him. 
           Outside, he hears a noise. Footsteps. 

           Checking Eichmann, Dani gets up to investigate. Doesn’t spot 
           Eichmann, EYES NOW OPEN, WATCHING HIM GO. 

           EXT. TERRACE. TIRA. MOMENTS LATER

           Sliding open French doors, Dani tentatively steps outside- 
           JUMPS as he crashes straight into CATALINA. She FREEZES. 

                                 DANI
                        What- what are you doing here?
           He turns to yell for the others- when Catalina PUTS A HAND ON 
           HIS CHEEK. She’s improvising. A new plan forms, fast.

                                 CATALINA
                        I- I come. Por tu. 

           Breath catches in Dani’s throat. It’s working. He stares at 
           Catalina. She looks like one of the girls he’s drawn. He 
           glances at the silent house... Who would even know??

           INT. STUDY. TIRA SAFE-HOUSE. MOMENTS LATER

           A small fold-out bed. Dani’s in the room with Catalina, 
           trying to sit comfortably on the bed. 

           He stops fidgeting when Catalina SLOWLY PEELS OFF HER TOP. 
           Her breasts, her torso, tinted blue by the moonlight.  

           For a moment, it looks like Dani might cry. She covers up-

                                 DANI
                        No, no. No problema. You, uh. Men 
                        like me don’t- we don’t get to see 
                        things- perfection. Like you. 

           She smiles, understanding none of what he just said. She 
           climbs on top of Dani. Kisses him. 

           INT. EICHMANN’S ROOM. TIRA

           MOANS. WHISPERING builds, breath heavy, more, more. Meanwhile, 
           Eichmann lies there, without a guard, listening. Waiting. 

           INT. STUDY. TIRA SAFE-HOUSE. LATER

           Passed-out in his bed, Dani is dead to the world. 

           Catalina, on the other-hand, is wide awake. She eyes the 
           remainder of (fake) pesos on Dani’s desk.

           INT. CORRIDOR. OUTSIDE DANI’S STUDY

           Closing the door to the study, Catalina goes to leave- her 
           foot CREAKS a floorboard. She STOPS. Did anyone hear?

                                 EICHMANN (O.S.)
                        Hello? Is someone there? Help me!

           A TAPPING noise joins the whispered plea. Catalina gazes at 
           the door it’s coming from. Looks at the exit. Torn. 
           INT. EICHMANN’S ROOM. TIRA

           The door handle twists. Slowly, it creeps open- and CATALINA 
           STARES IN HORROR AT EICHMANN, BOUND TO THE BED-

                                 EICHMANN
                        Señora, Ayúdame! Ayúdame!

           INT. MALKIN’S BEDROOM. NIGHT

           Deep in a boozy-sleep, Malkin is catapulted into consciousness 
           as the front door’s ALARM BELL RINGS! He BOLTS out of bed. 

           We glimpse the GUIDEBOOK he’s been sketching Fruma in, poking 
           out of a trouser pocket as he pulls them on. 

           INT. STAIRWELL. TIRA

           Taking stairs three at a time, Malkin hits the ground-floor- 
           to find the front door, SWINGING WIDE OPEN.

           Immediately he goes to Eichmann’s room. Bursts in to find-

           -EICHMANN, STILL HANDCUFFED TO THE BED. 

           Behind Malkin, Dani appears, rubbing his eyes. The horror of 
           what’s just happened dawning on him. 

           EXT. SUBURB. FLORESTA DISTRICT. NIGHT

           Running as fast as she can, Catalina SWINGS around a corner-

           Presses herself against a tree. Glances back, making sure she 
           wasn’t followed. As she does-

           -her hands touch the edge of a poster. She glances up at it.

           And there... the picture of RICARDO KLEMENT. A reward of 
           $10,000. A telephone number. She pulls it from the tree.

           Realisation hits Catalina like a freight train.

           INT. DINING ROOM. TIRA. LATER

                                 RAFI
                        What were you thinking?!

           Tempers frayed, the team encircle Dani, who stands ashen-
           faced by the table. Aharoni has his pistol out. 
                                 AHARONI
                        He was thinking with his dick!

                                 YAAKOV
                        Oh and you’ve been the most level-
                        headed agent?

                                 AHARONI
                        The fuck’d you say? 

                                 RAFI
                        Dani, did she see him? Dani? 

                                 MALKIN
                        If we go now, maybe we can find her. 

                                 DANI
                        D- don’t hurt her. It’s my fault. 

                                 AHARONI
                        If we have to, that’s on you too.

                                 YAAKOV
                        Whoa, we’re not the Gestapo, friend-

                                 UZI
                        Stop yelling, everyone! Please!

                                 AHARONI
                        You really wanna call me “friend”?

                                 EPHRAIM
                        For fuck sake, I can’t hear myself 
                        think, can you all-

           SLAM! Hanna crashes her fist down on the table. Silence. 

                                 HANNA
                        We give Attila a physical. Make 
                        sure he’s in a condition good 
                        enough to move. Then we find a new 
                        place to keep him until extraction. 
                        Rafi, have you spoken to Isser? 

                                 RAFI
                        He’s on his way. 

                                 HANNA
                        Ephraim, how long for a property? 

                                 AHARONI
                        One we can set up with the proper-
                                 HANNA
                        Let him answer the goddamn question!

                                 EPHRAIM
                        A day. Maybe two.

                                 RAFI
                        It’s too long. We can’t risk it!

                                 MALKIN
                        So we store him at Isser’s. It’s 
                        our only option. 

           Nobody’s got an argument to that. With a look to Malkin, 
           Hanna indicates he come help her. They go to leave-

                                 AHARONI
                        Because heaven forbid Eichmann 
                        spends a minute without his best 
                        pal Peter Malkin-

           Malkin TURNS SHARPLY, FURIOUS- Hanna GRABS his arm. Don’t. 

           INT. EICHMANN’S ROOM. TIRA. MOMENTS LATER

           Malkin and Hanna enter to find Eichmann is sat upright. 

                                 EICHMANN
                        Peter. What’s going on? 

           Hanna looks to Malkin. Why does he know your name? 

                                 MALKIN
                        The doctor is going to have a look 
                        at you. Make sure you’re healthy.

                                 EICHMANN
                        Surely that’s not what all the 
                        commotion was about? 

           Ignoring the question, Malkin pulls him up. Hanna approaches. 

                                 HANNA
                        May I begin? 

           Eichmann turns to Hanna. Stares. Stunned, for a moment.

                                 EICHMANN
                        I, uh... Sorry dear. Of course. 
                             (then)
                        Seeing a woman as beautiful as you. 
                        It took me back. To a forest. A 
                        small village. Wonderful.
           Malkin bristles at this, just slightly. Hanna grips 
           Eichmann’s wrist. Feels his pulse.

                                 HANNA
                        79- no, hang on. It’s slowing.

           Eichmann stares at Malkin. He leans closer to Hanna. 

                                 EICHMANN
                        Lidice. The village’s name. 1942. 
                        After Heydrich was assassinated. 
                        The Führer was angry. He wanted the 
                        entire village wiped out as 
                        punishment. And one woman- the one 
                        you remind me of- offered herself, 
                        to the men. To spare her children.

                                 MALKIN
                        Hey!

           Hanna shoots him a look. Keep it together. 

           She turns back to her examination. Malkin calms himself. 
           Doesn’t even notice his hand has sought out Fruma’s bracelet. 

                                 EICHMANN
                        I used to drink slivovitz, when I 
                        saw things like that. To calm me. 
                        But I didn’t this time. Not when I 
                        watched what happened to her. 

                                 MALKIN
                        That’s enough-

                                 HANNA
                        Head back.

           She examines Eichmann’s eyes. Malkin COUNTS, under his breath. 

                                 EICHMANN
                        Five men. Several at a time, often. 
                        Over and over. She cried. She bled. 
                        But that just encouraged them. I 
                        think, deep down, she enjoyed it. 
                        Really, I think she wanted more. 

                                 HANNA
                             (to Malkin)
                        Get the gag.

           Malkin GRABS up the rag- tries to force it into his mouth-
                                 EICHMANN
                        Do you think that’s what happened to 
                        Fruma, Peter? D’you think she begged?

           MALKIN FREEZES. That THRUMMING SOUND. A fire, ignited. 

                                 HANNA
                        Peter-

                                 EICHMANN
                        Tell me, Peter. How many German 
                        cocks do you think she had inside 
                        her before they blew her brains out-

           Malkin LAUNCHES HIMSELF ON EICHMANN- GRABS HIS THROAT- 
           SQUEEZES- HANNA SHOUTS, BUT ALL MALKIN CAN HEAR, ALL HE SEES-

                                 EICHMANN (CONT’D)
                             (choking)
                        Imagine, Peter. Every time you fuck. 
                        Just think how many German men split 
                        poor little Fruma wide open-

           The sound of FLAMES, FEVER PITCH NOW, MALKIN GRINDS HIS TEETH-
           Eichmann’s turning REDDER AND REDDER- IMPOSSIBLE TO BREATH-

           HANNA SCREAMS SOMETHING WE DON’T HEAR- THE TEAM PILE IN- 
           MALKIN, BEARING DOWN ON EICHMANN, WHO CHOKES, SPLUTTERS-

           When SUDDENLY- 

           Everything is quiet and still. 

           The room is empty, apart from Malkin, Eichmann... and Fruma. 
           Standing there. Blood and tears and grime covering her face.

           She stares at her brother. Begging him with her eyes. Do it.

           But Malkin... hesitates. 

           Looks around the shitty cell. Down at the Adolf Eichmann. And 
           Malkin sees him. Truly. For the bitter, twisted, manipulative 
           old man he is. Smiling with the glory of having almost won.

                                 MALKIN
                        No. No. Not now. Not like this.

           And Malkin BEGINS TO RELAX HIS GRIP. 

           Eichmann’s eyes dart, confused. Fruma’s face CONTORTS IN 
           ANGER. A WOUNDED CRY TEARS FROM HER- MALKIN TRIES TO RESPOND, 
           TO EXPLAIN TO HER MAYBE WHEN-

           WHUMP!!
           A CHAIR CRASHES INTO HIM, HURLING HIM BACK INTO REALITY- AS 
           IT SHATTERS, FRUMA VANISHES- THE PANDEMONIUM OF THE ROOM 
           BURSTS IN-

           Hitting the floor, Malkin’s GUIDEBOOK SLIPS FROM HIS POCKET-

           -he jumps back up- Rafi and Uzi GRAB HIM- DON’T REALISE THEY 
           ARE STOPPING HIM FROM DEFENDING HIMSELF-

           THWACK! Aharoni SMASHES the remainder of the chair across 
           Malkin’s face- splinters fly as he CRASHES to the floor. 

           Yaakov SURGES FORWARD, PUSHING AHARONI-

                                 YAAKOV
                        Whoa, enough! 

           Aharoni PUNCHES Yaakov, who falls back into Ephraim- he tries 
           to stop Yaakov, but, incensed, Yaakov HURLS HIM OFF-

                                 AHARONI
                        Uzi, hold him back!

           -Uzi GRABS Yaakov- THEY GRAPPLE- KNOCK HANNA BACK INTO A 
           WALL, WINDING HER-

                                 YAAKOV
                        Help Peter!

                                 UZI
                        But Aharoni said-

                                 YAAKOV
                        Don’t think, just do it!

                                 EICHMANN
                        You heard! The big one, you heard 
                        him say he was going to kill me!

                                 AHARONI
                        Is that true? IS IT? 

                                 UZI
                        Yes, OK! I’m sorry, Peter. 

                                 AHARONI
                        He is going to kill Attila. He is 
                        going to fuck us all. And if it’s 
                        the success of the mission or him-

           He pulls out his pistol once again- 

                                 RAFI
                        NO! What are you doing?! 
           Malkin, recovering fast, realises the situation- GRABS THE 
           PISTOL IN AHARONI’S HAND, TRYING TO DEFEND HIMSELF- 

           -but Aharoni TWISTS THE GUN FREE- GRABS MALKIN BY THE THROAT- 
           RAMS HIM INTO THE WALL- PLACES HIS GUN TO MALKIN’S FOREHEAD- 

           GOES TO SQUEEZE THE TRIGGER-

                                 HAREL (O.S.)
                        They’re HERE!!

           The room FREEZES. Turn as one as Harel runs in- stops in his 
           tracks when he sees the chaos inside. 

                                 HAREL (CONT’D)
                        What in the fuck is going on? 

                                 RAFI
                        What do you mean they’re here? 

                                 HAREL
                        El Al. The plane!

           EXT. BUENOS AIRES AIRPORT. NIGHT

           Israel’s Foreign Minister Abba Eban, portly and dressed in a 
           tailored black overcoat, waves to crowds as he climbs from an 
           EL AL AIRCRAFT. Several others follow. 

           A GATHERED CROWD cheer and whoop. Some start singing Hatikva.

                                 HAREL (V.O.)
                        The Foreign Minister’s just landed 
                        with the GOC and other dignitaries. 
                        One of their crew, Yehuda Carmel, 
                        has entered with a passport 
                        claiming he’s Zeev Zichroni. 

           As Abba Eban approaches a microphone, preparing to give a 
           speech to the crowd-

           INT. EICHMANN’S ROOM. TIRA. SAME

                                 HAREL
                        Dani. You’ve prepared a passport 
                        for Eichmann under the same name? 

                                 DANI
                        Yes. 

                                 HAREL
                        Good. Then we don’t waste a moment. 
           Looks pass between the group. We focus on Malkin, bleeding. 
           He notes Harel glaring at him. Fails to hold his glare.

           INT. EICHMANN’S BEDROOM. DAWN

           Vera sleeps in her bed. Ricardo is there beside her. At the 
           doorway, Klaus watches a moment. 

           INT. LIVING ROOM. EICHMANN HOUSE

           Wandering aimlessly, Klaus doesn’t bother to wake Tacuara boys 
           sleeping on the sofa, at the table. In the background, a RADIO 
           drones on about the historic landing of Israel’s first 
           airliner on Argentine soil. But he’s not really listening.

           On a table, he finds a FRAMED PHOTO of him, his brothers and 
           his father, in the mountains. A glorious VISTA behind them. 

                                 KLAUS
                        Where are you, papa? 

           As if in response, the distant sound of SIRENS, APPROACHING.

           EXT. EICHMANN HOUSE. MOMENTS LATER

           Emerging from his house, Klaus picks up his pace as he sees a 
           HORDE OF POLICE-CARS arrive. Almirón emerges from the lead car-

                                 ALMIRÓN
                        We need to move, now. It’s him. 

                                 KLAUS
                        Where is he? 

                                 ALMIRÓN
                        A cleaner gave us an address. Said 
                        he’s tied up in a house of Israelis.

                                 KLAUS
                        Let me get the others! 

                                 ALMIRÓN
                        No we need to move, immediately.

                                 ANTONIO (O.S.)
                        I’ll wait! 

           He nods to Klaus, who smiles in gratitude. Almirón climbs 
           back into his car as Klaus HURTLES BACK INTO THE HOUSE-
           EXT. EICHMANN HOUSE. MOMENTS LATER

           A HORDE OF MOTORCYCLES KICK-START- AN ANGRY HORNETS NEST, 
           THEY SURGE AS ONE AFTER ANTONIO’S CAR-

           INT. DINING ROOM. MORNING

           Standing over a map, Harel fires orders like bullets. 

                                 HAREL
                        Every second counts now. Uzi, 
                        Aharoni. You two leave immediately.

           EXT. TIRA SAFE-HOUSE. DAY

           Uzi and Aharoni steal away, WAVING DOWN A BUS.

                                 HAREL (V.O.)
                        Acquire a new vehicle and meet the 
                        others at this alleyway, just 
                        within the Mataderos Barrio.

           INT. EICHMANN’S ROOM. TIRA. SAME

           Frantic activity as the team DISSEMBLE THE HOUSE. 

                                 HAREL (V.O.)
                        Yaakov, Ephraim, Hanna, Rafi- I 
                        don’t want a trace of us left. 

           In their haste, they FAIL TO SPOT Malkin’s guidebook. 

           INT. DINING ROOM. TIRA. SAME

                                 HAREL
                        Peter, you and Dani want out of the 
                        dog-house? You break your fucking 
                        backs getting him disguised and 
                        ready to go. When you’re done, you 
                        get out via Uruguay. Understood? 
                             (off their nods)
                        I’ll be on the next flight. Let me 
                        know when Attila is on-board.

           Rafi nods. Glances at Malkin, who looks away, ashamed.

           INT. STUDY. TIRA SAFE-HOUSE. SAME

           Dani scratches the final touches into a passport. 
           He then attaches a freshly-taken picture of Eichmann to it. 
           Nearby, Malkin finishes A FAKE NOSE on a now-woozy Eichmann. 

                                 DANI
                             (beat)
                        Peter. I’m- I’m sorry. If something 
                        had happened to you ‘cause of me...

                                 MALKIN
                        Dani. Come on. 
                             (sotto)
                        Was it worth it?

           Just then, Hanna and Rafi enter. But from Dani’s look it was 
           definitely worth it.

           Hanna shows Rafi the sedative device attached to Eichmann. A 
           cord snakes from a needle in Eichmann’s arm, up her sleeve. 

                                 HANNA
                        It’s a short-acting barbiturate. 
                        He’ll stay like this, but if we 
                        need him to move quickly, he can be 
                        functional in a few minutes. 

           Rafi nods. 

                                 RAFI
                        Guys, can we have a minute? Hanna, 
                        your El-Al uniform’s through there.

           Both Hanna and Dani nod. Head out. Silence stretches.

                                 RAFI (CONT’D)
                        You fucked up, Peter.

                                 MALKIN
                        It, uh. Made me think. D’you 
                        remember when we trained, at Masada? 
                        How Gutman used to keep telling that 
                        story. We’d be on ropes, halfway up, 
                        lashed to one another. Passing ammo, 
                        guns, up and down a cliff. And he’d 
                        be going on about the Jews who 
                        killed themselves, up on that 
                        mountain. They chose to die rather 
                        than live under the Romans. I always 
                        thought he was crazy, going on about 
                        it. I thought he was a relic, from 
                        another time. But I get it now.

                                 RAFI
                        Yeah? 
                                 MALKIN
                        Yeah. I think so.

                                 RAFI
                        Would you do it again? To Eichmann, 
                        if you had the chance? 

           Malkin and Rafi lock eyes. Utter conviction from Malkin as-

                                 MALKIN
                        No. No, I wouldn’t.

                                 RAFI
                             (considers; then)
                        I hope that’s true. Cause, you see, 
                        there’s been a problem. The 
                        uniforms El-Al gave us- well, 
                        they’re meant for someone a little 
                        less vertically challenged. I think 
                        the exact measurement is “asshole” 
                        size. So. 

           Malkin eyes widen. Realises what Rafi’s saying. 

                                 RAFI (CONT’D)
                        Get him on that plane habibi, and 
                        don’t make me regret it. Again.
                             (shrugs)
                        Besides. I should try and stop by 
                        Patagonia. I promised the little 
                        ones I’d bring them back a penguin.

           A look between Malkin and Rafi. A smile. 

           INT/EXT. CAR/TIRA SAFE-HOUSE. DAY

           Ephraim, Yaakov, Hanna and Eichmann, all dressed in El-Al 
           uniforms, waiting for Rafi-

                                 YAAKOV
                        One road-block on the way out of 
                        Floresta, then it’s clear sailing to-

           -MALKIN, also in uniform, climbs into the drivers’ seat. 

                                 MALKIN
                        All aboard? 

                                 EPHRAIM
                        Where’s Rafi?! 

                                 MALKIN
                        I’ll explain on the way. 
           Glances at Hanna, who says nothing. Malkin HITS THE IGNITION- 

           The FORD BURSTS FORWARD, heading through open gates. Shortly 
           followed by Rafi and Dani who hurry away from the house.

           INT. FORD. SAME

           Malkin checks his rear-view mirror. Dani and Rafi safely make 
           it into a WAITING TAXI. 

           He turns his focus back to the road. 

           EXT/INT. TIRA SAFE-HOUSE. LATER

           Sirens BLARE, engines ROAR and a HORDE descends on the 
           property. GATES ARE SMASHED OPEN-

           THE FRONT DOOR, SPLINTERED WITH A KICK AS TACUARA AND POLICE 
           PILE IN. POUR INTO EVERY CRACK AND CORNER-

           Klaus, inside. Stares at the sparsely furnished space. 
           SNIFFS. Paces the corridor, stopping outside-

           HIS FATHER’S OLD ROOM. Nothing but a wrought-iron bed and a 
           crumpled rug on the floor. 

                                 ANTONIO (O.S.)
                        There’s a fire in the garden. Died 
                        recently. Five minutes or so. 

                                 KLAUS
                        He was in here! 

           In moments, Almirón is by his side. 

                                 ALMIRÓN
                        How do you know? 

           But Klaus doesn’t answer. Steps into the room. Feels the bed. 
           Notes the small holes in the window. 

                                 KLAUS
                        Trust me. He was here.

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        Checked upstairs sir. House looks 
                        like its been empty for weeks. 

                                 ALMIRÓN
                        Tell me we didn’t pay the bitch 
                        that called this in already?
           Almirón, ready to give up, TURNS TO LEAVE-

                                 KLAUS
                        Wait! 

           Crouching down, Klaus pushes SCRUNCHED UP CARPET TO ONE SIDE-

           -FINDS MALKIN’S GUIDEBOOK. Nestled there. 

           Klaus opens it. Flicks through the pages. Sketch after 
           sketch, not recognising Fruma, the abstract art, children-

           When there it is. A SKETCH OF HIS FATHER. He’s lying in a 
           MINE-CART, being WHEELED TOWARDS THE OVENS-

                                 ANTONIO (O.S.)
                        Sir!

           Klaus and Almirón turn. Antonio arrives, out of breath. 

                                 ANTONIO (CONT’D)
                        Neighbours say they saw a packed 
                        car leave about 20 minutes ago. 

                                 ALMIRÓN
                        Any idea where they were going? 

                                 KLAUS
                             (realises)
                        The sneaky fucking bastards. 

           He turns to Almirón. 

                                 KLAUS (CONT’D)
                        The radio, this morning.
                             (off Almirón’s blank look)
                        I know where they’re going. 

           And, as he SURGES BACK IN THE DIRECTION OF HIS BIKE-

           EXT. ROAD-BLOCK. FLORESTA DISTRICT. MORNING

           The team stare at the road-block ahead. A SOLDIER yawns. The 
           road leading to the sandbags and single-bar barrier is quiet. 
           Small houses, painted white, flank either side.

                                 MALKIN
                        Time?

                                 EPHRAIM
                        8:09. Just turned 8.10. 
                                 YAAKOV
                        Look! 

           The Soldier TURNS at the sound of someone calling. Starts 
           walking over. 

           Malkin drives forward, approaching the road-block-

                                 EPHRAIM
                        Come on- wave us through-

           Creeping towards the barrier, Malkin goes to drive on-

           A WHISTLE BLOWS. The soldier has turned back. Rushes over. 

                                 SOLDIER
                        Dame tus papeles. 

           Ephraim quickly hands the passports and tickets to Malkin, 
           who gives them to the soldier. He checks them over.

           As he does, EICHMANN COMES TO- SEEMS TO GRASP WHERE HE IS- 
           GROANS, TRYING TO GET THE GUARD’S ATTENTION-

           -Hanna SQUEEZES her syringe. JUST as the Soldier looks up- 
           Eichmann’s head SLUMPS forward. 

           The Soldier jerks his head. Drive on. 

           Malkin pulls through. Drives off. In the distance, the faint 
           sound of SIRENS. 

           EXT. HIGHWAY. EDGE OF FLORESTA. SAME

           Klaus and his Tacuara, SCREAMING ALONG THE ROAD. HE POINTS TO 
           SOME OF THEM, WHO SPLIT OFF, SPREADING OUT. 

           INT/EXT. FORD/MATADEROS BARRIO. SAME

           SWERVING IN AND OUT OF TRAFFIC, Malkin keeps his eye fixed on 
           the road. Yaakov pours over a map beside him. 

           In the back, Hanna keeps a floppy EICHMANN propped up. 
           Ephraim pulls at the edges of his outfit. He’s looking pale.

                                 EPHRAIM
                        Will you- 
                             (a car horn BEEPS)
                        Christ! You’ll get us killed! 

                                 YAAKOV
                        Shit, take that left!!
           Malkin does, SHARP. Throws everybody to one side as the car 
           FLIES OFF OF THE SLIP ROAD. 

                                 EPHRAIM
                        And this damn outfit. Could it be 
                        any tighter?!

           UP AHEAD, A BLOCKADE OF SOLDIERS, SNIFFER DOGS, CHECKING 
           EVERY CAR THAT PASSES THOROUGHLY- ENORMOUS QUEUES-

                                 MALKIN
                        Yaakov-

                                 YAAKOV
                        It must be new! Take the right there-

                                 EPHRAIM
                        Look out!

           Another HARD TURN from Malkin, dodging a car.

                                 MALKIN
                        Anything else, Ephraim? 

           But Ephraim has finally shut the hell up. The car SLIPS DOWN 
           A SIDE-STREET-

           INT/EXT. FORD/PEDESTRIAN STREET

           -only to land RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF A SHOPPING HIGH-STREET. 
           Shoppers YELL and SHOUT IN SURPRISE.

                                 MALKIN
                        Shit, Yaakov! 

                                 YAAKOV
                        Reverse, get out of here.

           Malkin WRENCHES the stick into reverse- A HORRIBLE CHURNING 
           SOUND GURGLES-

                                 MALKIN
                        These piece of shit cars!!

           The ENGINE GURGLING, SHOPPERS PROTESTING- the noise attracts 
           the attention of SEVERAL TACUARA BOYS, just passing at the 
           head of the commercial street. 

                                 HANNA
                        Move, Peter!

                                 YAAKOV
                        Forward, there, the alleyway! 
           Back into a gear that works, the car LURCHES FORWARD, parting 
           shoppers like the Red Sea. 

           The Tacuara have spotted the car- REV their motorbikes, 
           pushing past shoppers themselves. ONE OF THEM DRAWS A PISTOL-

           ANOTHER FIRES A RIFLE IN THE AIR- SHOPPERS SCATTER-

                                 EPHRAIM
                        GO! 

           WHEELS SPIN as Malkin propels the car into the tight space-

           EXT/INT. ALLEYWAY/FORD

           Slipping between buildings, A RAZOR’S WIDTH BETWEEN THE CAR 
           AND THE WALL, Malkin grits his teeth as the car BOUNCES DOWN 
           THIS COBBLED STREET- SHOP-KEEPS STARE IN AWE AS-

                                 YAAKOV
                        Right, right!

           Wheel spins, car slips around corner- MALKIN SPOTS SOMETHING-

                                 MALKIN
                        Keep the engine going!

           He LEAPS from the car. THROWS HIS WEIGHT BEHIND A DUMPSTER. 
           Wheels SQUEAKING, BARELY MOVING, MALKIN HEAVES- THUNK! 
           Ephraim’s slammed his hulking weight into the task too. 

           The dumpster picks up momentum. A hill helps it get going-
           ROLLS DOWNWARDS, CRASHING TO A HALT AS IT SLAMS INTO A WALL, 
           BLOCKING THE ROAD BEHIND THEM. Garbage spills everywhere.

           Back in the car, Malkin SLAMS his foot down- it SQUEALS away 
           as the Tacuara bikes approach the dumpster. 

           Springing off their bikes, they LEAP OVER THE DUMPSTER- AIM 
           THEIR WEAPONS AT THE CAR-

           INT. FORD

                                 MALKIN
                        GET DOWN!!

           A SPLIT-SECOND LATER THE BACK-WINDOW SHATTERS AS BULLETS 
           WHIZZ THROUGH- ONE CLIPS YAAKOV’S SHOULDER-

                                 YAAKOV
                        Sonofabitch!
           Another hard TURN of the wheel- 

           AND THEY’RE AWAY. 

           EXT. ROAD-BLOCK. FLORESTA DISTRICT. DAY

           Teeth bared, Klaus drives on. Follows signs to the airport. 

           Two police-cars up ahead. The men (including Almirón) wave 
           him and his Tacuara through the road-block. 

           EXT. ALLEY. MATADEROS BARRIO. DAY

           Uzi and Aharoni wait with a new Ford. Uzi checks his watch.

                                 AHARONI
                        If we’re going to get out of here, 
                        we need to leave now-

           Defiant to the last, Malkin’s car SCREECHES TO A HALT NEARBY-

                                 AHARONI (CONT’D)
                             (drawing his pistol)
                        You’ve got to be kidding me-

           Aims his gun at Malkin as the group TUMBLE OUT OF THE FORD- 

                                 AHARONI (CONT’D)
                        Malkin! The fuck are you doing?

                                 MALKIN
                        Rafi’s orders, we can talk it over 
                        when we’re back-

                                 AHARONI
                        Bull-fucking-shit we can, I am not 
                        being responsible for handing the 
                        whole mission over to a lunatic-

                                 HANNA
                        We don’t have time for this-

                                 AHARONI
                        This is my fucking operation, it 
                        was me that spotted him first, and 
                        I will be damned if I’ll let this-

           THWACK! Uzi’s enormous fist collides with Aharoni’s jaw, 
           knocking him out cold. Before he hits the floor-

           -Uzi’s scooped him up and over his shoulder. Smiles proudly.
                                 MALKIN
                        Thanks, Uzi. 

                                 UZI
                             (to Yaakov)
                        How’s that for over-thinking? 

                                 YAAKOV
                        The guy’s still technically your 
                        boss, habibi. Probably should have 
                        thought that one through. 

           Uzi looks mortified. 

                                 YAAKOV (CONT’D)
                        I’m kidding you ball-bag, nice 
                        work! See you back home. 

           Malkin and his team get into the new car. Uzi waves them off.

           EXT. RICCHIERI FREEWAY. DAY

           Driving down the near-empty highway, the team draw closer to 
           the ARMY ROADBLOCK. Beyond it, the airport. 

           INT/EXT. AIRPORT ROAD-BLOCK. DAY

           Their car comes to an ABRUPT HALT, metres from the road-
           block. Eichmann is THROWN FORWARD. Slumps over, unconscious. 

                                 EPHRAIM
                        Once we’re in the main terminal, we 
                        head straight to join the other El 
                        Al stewards in the staff departure-

           A SOLDIER APPROACHES. Machine gun slung over one arm. 

           Others glance over. About half a dozen soldiers. All armed.

                                 MALKIN
                             (re: Eichmann)
                        Get him up, get him up.

           Malkin winds the window down. The SOLDIER bends. He and 
           Ephraim speak in SPANISH.

                                 SOLDIER
                        Papers? You’re crew?

           Malkin, still with the papers, passes them to the soldier. 
                                 SOLDIER (CONT’D)
                        What happened to him? 

                                 EPHRAIM
                        Oh. Too much Fernet. 

           Ephraim smiles. The Soldier doesn’t. Checks passports.

                                 SOLDIER
                        His face, let me see his face.

           Hanna grabs Eichmann by the shoulders. Pulls him back-

           -AS SHE DOES, THE FAKE NOSE MALKIN ATTACHED COMES LOOSE ON 
           ONE SIDE- SWINGS HALFWAY OFF-

           -THE SOLDIER GLANCES DOWN AT EICHMANN’S PASSPORT, A SPLIT 
           SECOND FROM SPOTTING IT- 

           Ephraim notices- GESTURES TO HANNA AS THE SOLDIER LOOKS UP-

           Hanna, her arm behind Eichmann’s head, holds his face with 
           her fingers either side of his nose, pressing it on firmly. 
           She looks like she’s trying to get him to concentrate-

                                 HANNA
                        Zeev. Hey, Zeev? You there?

           He GROANS. Eyes struggling to focus. 

           The Soldier stares at him. Studying. Nearby, one or two other 
           soldiers are staring too. The ENTIRE TEAM HOLD THEIR BREATH-

                                 SOLDIER
                        This way!

           Indicates a side-road, rather than the road towards the 
           airport terminal. 

                                 EPHRAIM
                        But-

                                 SOLDIER
                        Don’t make me tell you again! Move, 
                        now!

           All the SOLDIERS are looking over now, clasping their rifles- 

                                 EPHRAIM
                             (to Malkin)
                        Take the slip-road. 

           Malkin rolls the car forward. The whole team are on edge. 
           INT. FORD. MOMENTS LATER

                                 MALKIN
                        What’s going on? 

                                 EPHRAIM
                        I don’t know! 

                                 YAAKOV
                        This the route they send staff down? 

                                 HANNA
                        Harel would’ve said, no? 

                                 YAAKOV
                        Just stay calm, everyone. Calm.

           EXT. RUNWAY CHECKPOINT. DAY

           A small car-park, followed by what looks like a MINI-FORTRESS 
           separating the runway from the outside world. At least 15 
           Soldiers and Airport Security, all armed to the teeth. Just 
           beyond the checkpoint, the El-Al Brittania aircraft. 

           One INDICATES to Malkin to park nearby. He does. 

                                 MALKIN
                        Hold it together.

           Unclear if he’s talking to others or himself. 

           They climb out of the car, half-carrying Eichmann with them. 
           As they do-

           -A TEARING SOUND FROM EPHRAIM, WHO FREEZES- notices a RIP in 
           the back of his El Al uniform. This uniform clearly does not 
           belong to someone of his size. 

           Without hesitating, Yaakov comes and helps Ephraim out, 
           WRAPPING HIS ARM AROUND HIM, HIDING THE HOLE. 

           Malkin helps Hanna with Eichmann, whose feet are dragging 
           along the ground. Soldier 2 speaks in English. 

                                 SOLDIER 2
                        He alright to fly? Looks like he’s 
                        gone hard. Very hard. 

                                 EPHRAIM
                        One night in Buenos Aires. 

                                 SOLDIER 2
                        One night huh? 
                                 MALKIN
                        That’s right. 

                                 SOLDIER 2
                             (to Yaakov)
                        What happened to your shoulder?

                                 YAAKOV
                             (beat)
                        There’s a nail, juts out by the 
                        plane’s central galley oven. 
                        Snagged myself on it coming in. 

           The Soldier nods, considering this. 

                                 SOLDIER 2
                        And the back windscreen? 

                                 MALKIN
                        Vandals. This city’s dangerous.

                                 SOLDIER 2
                        It certainly can be. 
                             (to Ephraim)
                        You. Come with me. Bring your 
                        papers. The rest, stay here. 

           Looking to Yaakov in fear, Ephraim doesn’t know what to do- 
           JUST AS SOLDIER 2 TAKES A STEP TOWARDS THEM-

                                 YAAKOV
                        Christ, you’re going to sweat 
                        through the fabric! Give me your 
                        jacket, you fat lump. 

           Pulling it from his shoulders, Yaakov folds it in half, 
           hiding the tear. 

           Nodding in thanks, Ephraim follows the Soldier. Several 
           others take his place, eyeing the group suspiciously. 

           A beat, as they stand in silence, waiting. In the distance- 
           THE SOUND OF SIRENS, DRAWING CLOSER-

           EXT. AIRPORT HIGH-WAY. DAY

           AN ANGRY SWARM, TACUARA AND POLICE THUNDER TOWARDS THE AIRPORT-

           EXT. RUNWAY CHECKPOINT. DAY

           The Soldiers notice. Begin whispering amongst themselves. 
           Malkin glances at Hanna. Fuck. 
           Just as one of the soldiers REACHES FOR HIS RADIO-

                                 EICHMANN
                        They’re coming!

           Everybody FREEZES. The Soldiers stare at Eichmann. 

                                 EICHMANN (CONT’D)
                        Run, run-edy-run, but they’re 
                        coming. For you.

           Ephraim’s returned with Soldier 2- Hanna goes to PRESS ON THE 
           SYRINGE- BUT EICHMANN STRUGGLES-

                                 EICHMANN (CONT’D)
                        NO! This is it. Your last chance. 
                        Before they get you. And me, I’ll 
                        phhhroow away, but you. You’ll 
                        never know what it feels like. To 
                        kill me. Peter. 

                                 SOLDIER 2
                        Wait a second!

           The group stops. Soldier 2 takes his rifle from his shoulder.

                                 SOLDIER 2 (CONT’D)
                        What’s he talking about? 

                                 EICHMANN
                        Do it. Before it’s too late. I 
                        deserve it, I know I do. I do.

                                 EPHRAIM
                        Oh he’s just drunk, he’s just- 
                        motor-mouth, you know, he doesn’t- 

                                 SOLDIER 2
                        Let me see those papers again-

           Hanna glances at Malkin who is staring at Eichmann.

                                 EICHMANN
                        For Fruma. She’d want you to. 

                                 SOLDIER 3
                             (in Spanish)
                        Something’s not right.

                                 SOLDIER 4
                        What is he saying??

                                 EICHMANN
                        You know that’s what she wants. 
                                 HANNA
                        Don’t-

           That noise, the FLAMING SOUND, BUILDS- MALKIN’S ARM, AROUND 
           EICHMANN’S NECK- ONE OF THE SOLDIERS LOADS HIS RIFLE-

                                 EICHMANN
                        Do it! Kill me, please!

           And AS THE TEAM LOOKS ON IN FEAR- 

           -THE SOUND DIES. Malkin, in control, looks up at the soldiers.

                                 MALKIN
                        His, uh. Familia? Dead. Died. En 
                        el... camps? 

                                 EPHRAIM
                             (taking over, in Spanish)
                        Yes. Yes. All of them. Died in ‘45. 
                        When he drinks, he remembers. And 
                        so when he remembers...

                                 HANNA
                        This is what he becomes. 

           She looks at Malkin. For a beat, the SOLDIERS consider...

           THE ONE WITH THE RIFLE RELAXES. STEPS BACK. 

                                 SOLDIER 2
                        I’m sorry to hear that. 
                             (to Ephraim)
                        You should see my wife after a 
                        night on the Fernet. Total monster. 

           Ephraim smiles meekly. 

           With a jerk of his head, Soldier 2 SENDS THEM THROUGH. 

           EXT. AIRPORT. SAME

           Bike SKIDDING TO A HALT, Klaus leaps off. Followed by a small 
           GROUP OF TACUARA-

           INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL. CONTINUOUS

           Boots STOMP across the marble floor, eyes darting left and 
           right, Klaus SPOTS THE DEPARTURE GATES-

           Hurries over. But just as he goes to enter- AN AIRPORT 
           SECURITY GUARD steps in his way. 
                                 AIRPORT SECURITY
                        Ticket, sir? Passport? 

                                 KLAUS
                        You’ve got to let me through. The 
                        Israelis have my father-

                                 AIRPORT SECURITY
                        Sir, I can’t let you through 
                        without a ticket.

                                 KLAUS
                        Are you fucking stupid? Did you 
                        hear what I said? 

                                 AIRPORT SECURITY
                        Sir, I need you to calm down-

                                 KLAUS
                        THE JEWS ARE ESCAPING WITH MY 
                        FATHER YOU PIECE OF SHIT-

           Reaching into his back-pocket, Klaus PULLS OUT HIS REVOLVER-

           SLAM! ANTONIO RUGBY-TACKLES KLAUS TO THE GROUND. Several 
           POLICE PILE IN, HANDCUFFING HIM- Almirón crouches beside him-

                                 KLAUS (CONT’D)
                        GET OFF OF ME!!

                                 ALMIRÓN
                        Trust me. It’s better we take you 
                        than them. 

                                 KLAUS
                        WHAT?! NO! STOP THEM!!

           Jerks his head to his men. To the Airport Security Guard-

                                 ALMIRÓN
                        Air-traffic control. Where is it? 

           EXT. EL-AL BRITTANIA. SAME

           Eichmann’s FEET DRAGGING, the TEAM DASH UP THE STEPS ONTO-

           INT. FIRST-CLASS. EL-AL BRITTANIA. MOMENTS LATER

           A buckle FASTENS. Eichmann, locked in his seat.  

           Malkin hurries to the front of the plane. Taps at the pilot’s 
           door. It opens. YOSEF KLEIN, the captain, stares Malkin over. 
                                 MALKIN
                        Attila’s onboard. We need to move. 

           INT. AIRPORT TERMINAL

           Running, gun drawn, badge out, Almirón SHOVES PEOPLE OUT OF 
           THE WAY- SWINGS INTO A CORRIDOR. Followed by a small team of 
           officers. Weapons drawn. 

           INT. AIR-TRAFFIC CONTROL

           A hive of activity. Juggling radio equipment, wooden plaques 
           indicating flights, and a constant stream of calls and 
           printed data, it’s a wonder the FOUR ATC MEN can manage.

                                 YOSEF KLEIN (ON RADIO)
                        ATC, this is Captain Yosef Klein on 
                        El-Al Brittania 302. NOTAMS checked 
                        and flight-path confirmed with 
                        navigation. El-Al is ready to taxi.

                                 ATC MAN
                        Hang on El-Al, give us a moment. 
                             (to another ATC)
                        Hey! Has Recife sent through 
                        clearance yet? 

           INT. COCKPIT. BRITTANIA

           Silence on the other end of the radio. Klein looks at Malkin.

           INT. STAIRWELL. AIRPORT

           Thundering upstairs, Almirón WHEEZES as he goes. Stops 
           momentarily, COUGHING HIS LUNGS OUT. Those cigars...

           INT. AIR-TRAFFIC CONTROL

           Checking over the reams of paper spooling over the floor, one 
           of the ATC Men scans- scans- THERE. Nods to our guy.

           INT. COCKPIT. BRITTANIA

                                 ATC MAN (ON RADIO)
                        El-Al, this is ATC. Proceed to 
                        runway. Hold for takeoff. 

           Klein turns to Malkin. Nods.
                                 YOSEF KLEIN
                        Take a seat. 

           EXT. RUNWAY

           The Brittania airliner LURCHES FORWARD TOWARDS THE RUNWAY-

           INT. FIRST-CLASS

           Strapped in, Malkin glances back. Sees the people on the 
           plane. None of them have a clue what’s going on. 

           Glances at Eichmann. Dead to the world. 

           INT. AIR-TRAFFIC CONTROL

           Door almost EXPLODES OFF ITS HINGES AS ALMIRÓN CRASHES IN-

                                 ALMIRÓN
                        Stop the El-Al flight.

                                 ATC MAN
                        They’re at the runway-

                                 ALMIRÓN
                        I don’t give two-sides of a fuck, 
                        stop them now-

                                 ATC MAN
                        We can’t- there’s a risk of a 
                        collision! 

                                 YOSEF KLEIN (ON RADIO)
                        ATC this is El-Al, requesting 
                        permission for take-off. 

           INT. FIRST-CLASS. EL-AL BRITTANIA

           Malkin glances out of the window. Tries to see the TERMINAL. 
           What’s going on? Why the delay? 

           INT. AIR-TRAFFIC CONTROL

           Almirón points his pistol at the ATC Man. TAKES AIM-

                                 ALMIRÓN
                        There is a German war-hero on that 
                        plane. You will stop it. 
                                 ATC MAN
                        A German war hero? 

                                 ALMIRÓN
                        Exactly, so stop the fucking plane! 

           A beat. The ATC looks to the others. They’re petrified. He 
           takes a deep breath. Leans over to the Radio. Presses it. 

                                 ATC MAN
                        Permission to take-off granted, El-
                        Al. Have a safe flight. 

                                 ALMIRÓN
                        NO! 

           The ATC man folds his arms defiantly. 

                                 ATC MAN
                        I don’t know much. But I know that 
                        a German war hero means a Nazi war 
                        hero. And there is no such thing as 
                        a Nazi war-hero. 

           CRYING OUT IN FRUSTRATION, PISTOL OUT, ALMIRÓN LOOKS LIKE 
           HE’S GOING TO SHOOT- TURNS AND RUSHES OUT OF THE ROOM-

           EXT. RUNWAY

           The Brittania’s ENGINES BEGIN TO WHIRR-

           INT. FIRST-CLASS. EL-AL BRITTANIA

           Malkin leans back in his chair- goes to relax, when he spots-

           EXT. RUNWAY

           ON THE RUNWAY, Almirón marshals his men INTO A LINE- AS ONE, 
           THEY RAISE THEIR WEAPONS- AIM AT THE PLANE-

                                 ALMIRÓN
                        SHOOT FOR THE WHEELS!

           INT. FIRST-CLASS. EL-AL BRITTANIA

           The plane’s picking up speed now, HURTLING DOWN THE RUNWAY-
           EXT. RUNWAY

                                 ALMIRÓN
                        FIRE!! FIRE! 

           THE CRACK-CRACK OF RIFLES FIRING- ONE OR TWO HIT THE PLANE-

           BUT THEY’RE TOO LATE! Too much speed now, as the plane 
           approaches lift-off-

                                 ALMIRÓN (CONT’D)
                        AGH!!

           His men lower their weapons. Stare at him for instruction-

                                 ALMIRÓN (CONT’D)
                             (spotting something)
                        Shit. Shit, shit!

           A TRUCKLOAD OF SOLDIERS DRIVE OVER- GUNS POINTED AT THEM. 

           Off Almirón, who drops his gun. Hangs his head in defeat. 

           INT. FIRST-CLASS. EL-AL BRITTANIA. MOMENTS LATER

           They are soaring now, up, up through the clouds. 

           GRINS pass between Yaakov, Ephraim and Hanna. A muted but 
           definite sense of relief amongst them.

           Yosef Klein comes in from the cockpit. He shakes each of 
           their hands, though his eyes never leave Eichmann. 

                                 YOSEF KLEIN
                        I can’t believe it. 

           Several of the El-Al stewards are staring too. All at the 
           sleeping form of EICHMANN, whose fake nose has fallen off 
           completely now. 

           One lumbering STEWARD appears particularly affected. We 
           follow him, just for a moment, as he retreats-

           -to the kitchenette area. Breathes deeply. SHAKING AS HE 
           GRIPS THE COUNTER. 

           A tear slips from his eye. Another. Another. Splashing down-
           by his hand. His wrist. On which we see a tattoo, messily 
           scrawled: A-14534. Auschwitz. 

           Back to Malkin, who doesn’t share in the whispered JOY and 
           relief. Instead, he stares out of the window. Argentina grows 
           smaller and smaller beneath them.
           After a moment, Hanna comes and joins him. He doesn’t turn to 
           her. Just continues to stare. 

                                 HANNA
                        Hey. We did it. We’re going home. 

           He turns to her. Looks deep into her eyes. And there he sees 
           that the lust is gone. Instead, a sadness. Pity, even. 

           He holds out his hand. She hesitates. Takes it.

           Malkin CLINGS to her hand. Turns back to the window. Watches 
           as the coast of Argentina recedes into the horizon. 

                                                         FADE TO BLACK:

           INT. MALKIN’S APARTMENT. MORNING (ONE YEAR LATER)

           Malkin, looking older and worn, stares at the photos of the 
           Nazis on his bedroom wall. Adolf Eichmann’s picture now has a 
           big, firm X through it.

           But Malkin’s looking at all the other pictures that don’t.

           EXT. BEIT HA’AM. JERUSALEM. DAY

           All along a busy road, CROWDS BUSTLE TOWARDS A BARBED WIRE 
           PERIMETER circling a sun-blushed stone building. 

           SHIN-BET and POLICE, carrying sub-machine guns, patrol. 

                                 GIDEON HAUSNER (V.O.)
                        When I stand before you here, 
                        Judges of Israel, to lead the 
                        prosecution of Adolf Eichmann, I am 
                        not standing alone.

           Every single person entering is searched thoroughly... Apart 
           from Malkin. He flashes the GUARDS an ID card, and enters. 

           INT. COURT-ROOM. DAY

           Packed to the rafters. From BUSINESS MEN, to RABBIS, to SHOP-
           KEEPS, there’s a huge range of people here.

           Finding a seat, Malkin stares across the vast courtroom to 
           the striking figure of ATTORNEY GENERAL GIDEON HAUSNER. 

           Eichmann sits behind inches of BULLET-PROOF glass, listening 
           intently on a set of headphones. Books surround him. Glasses 
           back on, hair-receding, he looks like he wants to look weak. 
                                 GIDEON HAUSNER (CONT’D)
                        With me are six million accusers. 
                        But they cannot rise to their feet 
                        and point towards him who sits in 
                        the dock and cry out “J’accuse!”

           Malkin eyes roam, scanning the room, the gathered watchers- 

           -he spots HANNA, in amongst them. She’s with a HANDSOME MAN. 
           Hand on his leg. She’s not smiling, but she seems happy. 

           Malkin takes this in. Eventually turns his attention back to 
           the trial, when he realises-

           -that EICHMANN IS STARING RIGHT AT HIM. 

           For a moment, the two lock eyes. Stare for an eternity. 

                                 GIDEON HAUSNER (CONT’D)
                        For their ashes are piled up on the 
                        hills of Auschwitz and the fields 
                        of Treblinka.

           Finally, Eichmann breaks it. Nods towards where Hanna is 
           sitting with this new man. Pulls a faux-sympathetic face at 
           Malkin. For just a heartbeat, WE SEE THE REAL EICHMANN-

           -before he returns to looking meek. Turns back to Hausner. 

                                 GIDEON HAUSNER (CONT’D)
                        Their blood cries out, but their 
                        voice is not heard.

           Malkin stands. Reaches to his wrist- 

           SNAPS OFF FRUMA’S BRACELET. Leaves. 

           Hanna looks up, just in time to see the back of Malkin go. 
           She watches, but doesn’t follow him. 

                                 GIDEON HAUSNER (CONT’D)
                        Therefore, I will be their 
                        spokesman.

           RAFI, sat with HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN, also sees Malkin go. 

           EXT. FIRST CEMETERY. DAY

           Lush and green, cut off from the hustle and bustle of the 
           busy metropolis. Here, the dead sleep in peace. 

           Alone amongst them stands Malkin. Staring. Thinking. In his 
           hand, the remains of Fruma’s bracelet. 
                                 RAFI (O.S.)
                        You know they say all Eichmann will 
                        talk about-

           From behind Malkin, Rafi approaches. 

                                 RAFI (CONT’D)
                        Is what the title cover of his auto-
                        biography is going to look like. 

                                 MALKIN
                        You chosen yours yet? 

                                 RAFI
                        Ha! You think my wife would let me 
                        make a decision like that? Please.

           Rafi comes and stands beside him. Silence.

                                 MALKIN
                        I didn’t see you in there.

                                 RAFI
                        I was with Miriam. The kids. 

                                 MALKIN
                        You never said how they took it. 
                        When you didn’t bring back any 
                        penguins. Your boys, I mean. 

                                 RAFI
                        Oh. They cried. Like children do. 
                        Jacob the most, actually. 

                                 MALKIN
                        Hmm.

           A moment passes. 

                                 RAFI
                        Thing is, Peter. They won’t know it 
                        yet. They might not for years to 
                        come. But we brought them back 
                        something better.

                                 MALKIN
                        Yeah?

                                 RAFI
                        Yeah. We did. 

           Malkin processes this. 
                                 MALKIN
                        It’s just, uh. I’d really like to 
                        have seen them, Raf. The penguins. 
                        Just once. It would’ve helped.

                                 RAFI
                        Maybe. Maybe.
                             (beat)
                        But what you got instead- and I 
                        know you might never believe this- 
                        what you got instead is worth 
                        everything. You caught him, Peter. 
                        You did. So even if it’s just for a 
                        second. It’s OK to be OK. 

           A pause. Malkin struggles to hold it all in.

                                 MALKIN
                        She’s always there, Raf. At my 
                        shoulder. My task-master, my reason 
                        for waking. She keeps me thinking. 
                        Every day, I think of the quiet, of 
                        the home I can’t have. I thought 
                        after we caught him. I thought I 
                        would be different now. But, uh.

                                 RAFI
                        Maybe it won’t ever be, Peter. 
                        Maybe. But for someone out there... 
                        you’ll be enough. Trust me, habibi.
                             (then)
                        She’ll never leave you, Peter. 
                        Fruma, I mean. But she won’t hate 
                        you for being happy, either. 

           With a final pat on the shoulder, Rafi turns to walk away. 
           Malkin turns and shouts after him-

                                 MALKIN
                        You know it wasn’t just me that 
                        caught him, Raf.

                                 RAFI
                        Blah! History only remembers the 
                        tall people. 

                                 MALKIN
                        What about Napoleon? 

                                 RAFI
                             (almost gone)
                        Who?
           Malkin chuckles. Watches Rafi disappear from the park. 
           Finally, he turns back to the graveyard. 

           It’s still empty. He’s still alone. But now... he looks calm. 

           He approaches a gravestone. Places Fruma’s bracelet on top.

                                 MALKIN
                        Yit’gadal v’yit’kadash sh’mei raba. 

           A final, gentle whisper of Mourner’s Kaddish. For Fruma. 

           He straightens. Gazes at his surroundings. And, as the midday 
           sun glistens through the swaying foliage-

           SUPER: 

           “On May 31st, 1962 Adolf Eichmann was hung to death, having 
           been found guilty of all 15 charges brought against him.” 

           INTERCUT WITH-

           EICHMANN, in a SMALL, NONDESCRIPT ROOM, being led up to the 
           gallows. A NOOSE is placed over his head. 

           He says his last words. We don’t hear them. 

           Somewhere, a LEVER IS PULLED- A NECK IS BROKEN- the body of a 
           war criminal sways from side to side. 

           “He was cremated, and his ashes spread in the Mediterranean, 
           so that he might have no place of final rest on this earth.”

           BACK TO MALKIN, still standing in the First Cemetery.

           SUPER:

           “Peter Malkin went on to take part in countless intelligence 
           operations against Soviet spies, weapon smugglers and Nazi 
           officers who had escaped justice.”

           And, as we FADE OUT, a small smile creeps onto Malkin’s face.

           “He has been credited by numerous sources as being the 
           greatest spy of the 20th century.” 

           TO BLACK

           “Peter Malkin died in 2005.”

           “Surrounded by his wife and three children.”

                                     THE END
