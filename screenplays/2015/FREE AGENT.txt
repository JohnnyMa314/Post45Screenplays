           INT. HIGH-RISE APARTMENT, BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

           Light peaks through a window and finds the face of BRIDGETTE 
           (40), who stirs.  She rolls over and is surprised to find a 
           muscular, naked man beside her: this is NICK (28).    

           Shit.

           INT. HIGH-RISE APARTMENT, BATHROOM - EARLY MORNING

           Bridgette washes her face vigorously and downs a fistful of 
           pills.  She peeks back into the bedroom; Nick is still there.  
           She hits herself on the forehead.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Stupid, stupid, stupid.  

           Bridgette hits herself too hard and recoils in pain. She 
           takes another fistful of pills.  

           Bridgette opens the bathroom mirror and is confronted with a 
           half dozen more pill bottles; she glances at the bedroom, 
           then grabs the bottles and shoves them under the sink - next 
           to an economy-size handle of whiskey.  

           INT. HIGH-RISE APARTMENT, BEDROOM - MORNING

           Now dressed in workout clothes, Bridgette stares at the still 
           sleeping Nick; the sheet only covers half of his well-muscled 
           torso.

           Bridgette can’t help herself: she takes a picture of Nick 
           with her phone.  The FLASH goes off, and Nick stirs.

           Bridgette panics and rushes to the door.  

                                 NICK
                             (groggy)
                        Bridgette?

           But Bridgette’s already gone.  Nick rubs his head, hung over, 
           then pounds it softly with his palm. 

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        Stupid, stupid, stupid.  

           EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - DAWN

           Bridgette jogs down the street wearing a baseball cap, which 
           is pulled down to cover her face.  She slows as she reaches a 
           corner, looks each way cautiously, and ducks into an alley.  
           She settles in behind a dumpster and watches an apartment 
           building across the street.  

           EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - AN HOUR LATER

           Bridgette stands in the alley, periodically glancing at the 
           building as she types on her phone.  

           The front door of the building opens, revealing a middle-aged 
           MAN in a suit (Grant, 42) and a pretty younger WOMAN 
           (Michelle, 30) pushing a stroller.  

           Bridgette watches them intently, leaning towards them as 
           though she is going to be pulled from her hiding place onto 
           the street; the couple turns to walk away from Bridgette.  

           Bridgette looks from the couple to the time on her phone, 
           hesitates, and turns the other direction, walking away.  

           INT. GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS OFFICES - MORNING

           Bridgette walks past a giant “Golden State Warriors” logo 
           into an office; people part when they see her coming.  Her 
           phone rings, and she looks at it as she rounds a corner.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        What do you want, Marie?

           MARIE, Bridgette’s assistant (28), quickly hangs up.

                                 MARIE
                        Kendall’s in your office.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Before noon?  Did I miss something?  
                             (Bridgette takes a deep 
                              breath)
                        Ok, remember the code.  If I say 
                        “Raisinets,” it means everything is 
                        fine.  If I say “Good God, what 
                        have I done?” it means “Come help 
                        me dispose of this body.”  

           Marie laughs.

                                 MARIE
                        Did you get laid last night or 
                        something?

                                 BRIDGETTE
                             (freezes)
                        Why?
                                 MARIE
                        You seem... different.  

           Bridgette shrugs and enters her office, trying to play it 
           cool.  Marie watches her, curious.

           INT. BRIDGETTE’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Bridgette cautiously enters her office, which is decorated 
           extensively with basketball memorabilia, and finds MARTIN 
           KENDALL (53) waiting for her.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Good morning, Kendall.  To what do 
                        I owe this honor?

           Kendall smiles at Bridgette the way a snake smiles at a 
           mouse.  He holds up Bridgette’s nameplate, which he has been 
           inspecting.

                                 KENDALL
                        Director of Basketball Analytics.  
                        Impressive. I mean, I don’t quite 
                        buy into all of this statistics 
                        nonsense, but someone must be 
                        listening.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        I’ve been fortunate.  

           Kendall circles the room; Bridgette never turns her back to 
           him. 

                                 KENDALL
                        No, you’re a smart woman.  But at 
                        some point it’s not about being 
                        smart - it’s about being strategic.  
                             (he turns to her)
                        Tomorrow, I’m going to recommend to 
                        the management team that we sign 
                        Devin Jackson.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Ok.

           Kendall waits for Bridgette to say more; she doesn’t.  

                                 KENDALL
                        Do you agree with that assessment?  
                        From a statistical perspective?

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        No.  
                                 KENDALL
                        Care to explain?

           Bridgette grits her teeth.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Every advanced metric we use - true 
                        shooting percentage, adjusted plus 
                        minus, two, three, and five man 
                        line-ups, Sports VU data - shows 
                        that Jackson is overrated. 

                                 KENDALL
                        Is that so?  Then tell me, what do 
                        your magical numbers say we should 
                        do?

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Sign Tyson King.

           Kendall scoffs.

                                 KENDALL
                        I thought you were our stat person.  
                        Jackson’s a bigger star, he scores 
                        six more points per game...

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Because he takes nine more shots.  
                        He also turns the ball over more, 
                        constantly gambles for steals, and 
                        shows what could be charitably 
                        described as inconsistent effort on 
                        defense.  King has shown the 
                        ability to play at an elite level 
                        on both ends of the floor...

                                 KENDALL
                        Except for last year.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        When he was playing hurt.  At his 
                        peak, he has the skills to lead the 
                        league in scoring and win defensive 
                        player of the year.  Jackson is an 
                        all-star.  King could win the MVP.  

           Kendall considers this, and changes tack. 

                                 KENDALL
                        Of course, it’s not all about stats 
                        - you have to look at intangibles.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 KENDALL (CONT'D)
                        Like that Tyson King is going to 
                        sign with Dallas and Devin Jackson 
                        wants to play here.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        King hasn’t signed yet.  

                                 KENDALL
                        He will.  And you know how fickle 
                        Jackson is; if he thinks he’s our 
                        second option, he’ll bolt to 
                        Chicago.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Let him.  We’ll get the next guy.

           Kendall laughs.  

                                 KENDALL
                        Do you know what the expectations 
                        are for this team?  How much we’ve 
                        built up this summer, the cap space 
                        we’d have?  The fans want a star.   

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Fans want to win.  How happy do you 
                        think they’ll be when we sign 
                        Jackson and the team underachieves?

                                 KENDALL
                        Let’s say that happens: guess who 
                        gets blamed?  The coach.  And then 
                        the next coach and maybe, 
                        eventually, the players.  But not 
                        us, because we did our job - we put 
                        the pieces out on the floor. 

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        So we should sign the wrong guy 
                        just to cover our asses?  That’s 
                        inspiring management strategy.  
                        Maybe you should write a book.

           Kendall smiles thinly and takes a mint from Bridgette’s desk.

                                 KENDALL
                        You know, whenever I get too 
                        stressed, I remember just how lucky 
                        we are to work here, and how 
                        precarious our jobs really are.
                             (Kendall unwraps the mint 
                              and drops the wrapper 
                              next to the trash can)
                                 (MORE)
                                 KENDALL (CONT'D)
                        I’m going to recommend Jackson to 
                        the management team. When I’m done, 
                        you will present evidence - any 
                        evidence - that it’s a good idea.  
                        And if you can’t find any, you’ll 
                        keep your mouth shut.

           Kendall pops the mint in his mouth and smiles.

                                 KENDALL (CONT’D)
                        Love your office.  Very quaint.

           Kendall exits, leaving Bridgette fuming.  

           INT. OFFICE HALLWAY - DAY

           Bridgette grabs a report from the printer, flipping through 
           it quickly.  She looks up and sees JOHN HATHAWAY (62) enter 
           an elevator.  

           Bridgette looks both ways and follows him into the elevator.  
           The doors close. 

           INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS

           Bridgette and John speak quietly, standing shoulder to 
           shoulder.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Kendall came to my office this 
                        morning.  He wants me to recommend 
                        Jackson at the board meeting.

                                 JOHN
                        Jackson is a good player.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Jackson is shit.  He’s a five year 
                        pass to getting bounced in the 
                        first round and you know it.  

           John looks at her.  

                                 JOHN
                        There’s something different about 
                        you today.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Must be my new fucking volumizer.  
                        I’m serious, John.  
                                 JOHN
                        So am I.  I know you feel strongly 
                        about this, Bridg, but is this 
                        really the time to take a stand?  
                        You need... stability.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        What I need is for you to stop 
                        worrying about me.

                                 JOHN
                        When my friend gets hit with a 
                        restraining order, that tends to up 
                        my level of concern.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        This isn’t about me...

                                 JOHN
                        I know, I know - it’s about Tyson 
                        King.  What is it about this guy?  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Pre-injury, his adjusted plus minus 
                        was the best...

                                 JOHN
                        You’ve told me the stats - it’s 
                        more than that.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Last game of the season; he’s in 
                        street clothes, recovering from 
                        surgery.  Phoenix is out of the 
                        playoff race, and he’s probably 
                        played his last game there.  All he 
                        has to do is wait for this 
                        meaningless game to be over so he 
                        can forget about his nightmare of a 
                        season.  But instead, he’s coaching 
                        his teammates at every timeout; 
                        he’s yelling instructions onto the 
                        court; he’s celebrating every make 
                        and dying with every miss.  You 
                        can’t fake that.   

                                 JOHN
                        Sounds like somebody else I know.
                             (Bridgette rolls her eyes)
                        I’m not going to be general manager 
                        forever.  Do you want this job?

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        You know I do.  
                                 JOHN
                        Well, Kendall is in front of you in 
                        line, so you need to play nice.  
                             (Bridgette shakes her 
                              head)
                        Trust me.  I’ve got your back. 

           Bridgette wants to say something, but the elevator doors open 
           to reveal Kendall and Nick - the guy Bridgette slept with.  
           As they enter the elevator, Nick and Bridgette lock eyes.

           Kendall continues talking to Nick, who takes notes.  

                                 KENDALL
                        And get Gonzalez on the phone.  I’m 
                        not going to let him pussy out of 
                        this at the last minute.  

                                 NICK
                        Right.  

           Nick stands next to Bridgette, behind Kendall and John.  Nick 
           surreptitiously reaches over and runs his hand down 
           Bridgette’s back.  Bridgette jumps.

           The elevator stops and Kendall and John exit, leaving Nick 
           and Bridgette alone.  Nick turns to Bridgette.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        You left this morning before I 
                        could...

           Bridgette, seething, pulls the emergency stop; the elevator 
           CRASHES to a halt.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Listen up, because I’m only going 
                        to say this once.

                                 NICK
                             (re: emergency stop)
                        I don’t think you’re supposed to 
                        pull that...

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Never - ever - touch me at work 
                        again.  It’s taken me fifteen years 
                        to get where I am, and I’m not 
                        about to have it ruined by some 
                        horny frat boy. 

           Nick raises his eyebrows.  
                                 NICK
                        Because I was clearly the only 
                        horny one last night.

           Bridgette’s phone beeps; she reads an e-mail and starts 
           typing a reply.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Please.  I was faking it.  

                                 NICK
                        Really.  Because at some point I 
                        remember waking up to find that we 
                        were already having sex.  I’m 
                        pretty sure that’s illegal.   

                                 BRIDGETTE
                             (turning red)
                        I don’t have time for this.  

           Bridgette pushes the emergency stop and continues typing on 
           her phone; the elevator lurches downward.  Nick studies her, 
           then reaches over and takes her phone.

                                 BRIDGETTE (CONT’D)
                        Hey!  That’s my phone! 

           Nick types something; Bridgette is catatonic with rage.  

                                 NICK
                        Whenever you get out of this denial 
                        that you’re going through...

           Nick holds the phone out.  Bridgette lunges for it, but Nick 
           pulls it back and kisses her on the cheek. 

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        ...text me.  

           Nick hands her the phone.  The elevator doors open, and he 
           walks out.  Bridgette watches him go, furious.  

           Bridgette looks at her phone: Nick has entered his number 
           under the name “Sex - No Strings.”  

           Bridgette presses “Delete Contact.”  The phone reads “Are you 
           sure you want to delete?”  Bridgette hesitates.  

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Bridgette stares at Nick’s number on her phone; Marie sits 
           beside her.
                                 MARIE
                             (sharp whisper)
                        Bridgette.  Focus.  

           Bridgette snaps back to the meeting in front of her: 

           Bridgette and Marie sit at a large conference table across 
           from a lawyer, CLARK, and his client, GRANT - the man 
           Bridgette was following and her soon-to-be ex-husband.   

           Marie pushes a divorce settlement across the table.  

                                 MARIE (CONT’D)
                        Here is our signed copy of the 
                        settlement.  I’m sure you will find 
                        the terms...
                             (pointedly, to Bridgette)
                        generous to your client.  So 
                        generous, in fact, that I’m not 
                        really sure what we’re doing here.  

           Clark, the lawyer, glances down at the settlement; he pushes 
           it back with a smirk.

                                 CLARK
                        This deal contains an equal 
                        distribution of their shared 
                        assets; we’re not interested in a 
                        penny less than sixty percent.  

           Marie laughs, incredulous.

                                 MARIE
                        Fifty-fifty was a gift.  Unless you 
                        think Mr. Hester having a child 
                        with another woman will somehow 
                        work in his favor in court.

                                 CLARK
                        It will probably play better than 
                        Miss Nelson’s escalating pattern of 
                        substance abuse, which culminated 
                        in aggressive, persistent stalking.  
                        One of them acted illegally; the 
                        other did not.  Or did you not 
                        learn the definition of ‘illegal’ 
                        before you dropped out of law 
                        school? 

           Marie grits her teeth.

                                 MARIE
                        Miss Nelson obeyed the restraining 
                        order while it was in place...
                                 CLARK
                        And then, of course, there’s the 
                        small matter of Miss Nelson herself 
                        having an affair with a much 
                        younger man who just happens to be 
                        one of her subordinates - I believe 
                        his name is Nick Price?  If that 
                        were to become public knowledge, it 
                        would surely damage her career.  
                        And none of us want that.

           Marie is thrown; she looks at Bridgette, who looks down, and 
           regroups.  

                                 MARIE
                        I definitely dropped out of school 
                        before the unit on blackmail...

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Marie.  It's ok.  

           Bridgette looks at Grant.

                                 BRIDGETTE (CONT’D)
                        You win.  Whatever you want.  

           Clark smiles triumphantly and slides an agreement across the 
           table.

                                 CLARK
                        I’ve prepared a new settlement 
                        agreement...

           Marie seethes; Bridgette avoids her glare.

           EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - NIGHT

           Bridgette and Marie exit the building; it’s dark, and a light 
           rain falls.  

           They pause under the awning of the building.  Bridgette 
           lights a cigarette; Marie can’t hold in her anger anymore.  

                                 MARIE
                        What the hell was that?

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        I fucked up.  
                                 MARIE
                        Is that it?  Because every day I go 
                        to work with a confident, 
                        successful, ass-kicking 
                        businesswoman - who then proceeds 
                        to melt into a puddle of weak 
                        bullshit whenever she’s confronted 
                        with her ex-husband.  Why can’t you 
                        just stand up to him?

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        And say what?  

                                 MARIE
                        “Fuck you for leaving me,” for 
                        starters.  I mean, you could’ve at 
                        least hired a real lawyer instead 
                        of trotting me out there to get my 
                        ass kicked. 

           Bridgette steps in front of Marie. 

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Hey.  I’m sorry.  Are we ok?

           Marie softens.

                                 MARIE
                        Yeah.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Good.  Because I have to go finish 
                        that BS Kendall presentation. 

                                 MARIE
                        Right.  I almost buy that.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        I don’t know what you’re talking 
                        about.  

                                 MARIE
                        You’re going to booty text your new 
                        boy toy.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Ugh.  He’s arrogant, he’s immature, 
                        and he’s my coworker.
                             (beat)
                        So, maybe.  

                                 MARIE
                        It was that good?
                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Probably a seven.  

                                 MARIE
                        Out of ten?

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Out of five. 

           Marie grabs for Bridgette’s phone. 

                                 MARIE
                        I’m calling him.  I’m calling him 
                        right now.  

           INT. BRIDGETTE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Bridgette, wearing a sultry dress, poses in the mirror with a 
           glass of wine; she tries to look sexy, but she’s too nervous.  

           A KNOCK at the door.  Bridgette takes a few deep breaths and 
           opens it to reveal Nick, who is self-consciously fixing his 
           collar.

                                 NICK
                        Wow.  You look amazing.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Thank you.  You’re not so bad 
                        yourself.

           Awkward pause. 

                                 NICK
                        Can I come in?

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        If you want.  

                                 NICK
                        I do want.  To.  I do want to come 
                        in.  

           Nick follows Bridgette into her apartment.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Can I take your jacket?

                                 NICK
                        Sure.

           Bridgette does.  Nick takes the moment to lean in for a kiss, 
           but she’s got the jacket in one hand and wine in the other. 
                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Let me just put this stuff down.

                                 NICK
                        Ok.  

           Nick stands in the entryway, uncomfortable, until Bridgette 
           returns and kisses him.  Nick furrows his brow and pulls 
           away.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Is something wrong?

                                 NICK
                        No.  

           They kiss again; Nick pulls away once more.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry, have you been smoking?

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Like an hour ago. 

                                 NICK
                        I’m not used to kissing someone who 
                        smokes. 

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        So...?

                                 NICK
                        So do you mind brushing your teeth 
                        or something?

           Bridgette stares at him, then walks to the bathroom, pissed.  
           She steps out a moment later, brushing her teeth.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        While we’re being honest, I’m not 
                        thrilled with the Axe body spray 
                        you’ve been bathing in.  What’s 
                        that scent?  Mountain Douchebag?

                                 NICK
                        Ok.  If you don’t smoke before I 
                        come over, I’ll stop wearing it.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Agreed. 

           Bridgette goes back to the bathroom to spit.  
                                 BRIDGETTE (CONT’D)
                        And another thing...

           Bridgette steps out of the bathroom, only to run right into 
           Nick.  She’s taken aback.   

                                 NICK
                        Yes?

                                 BRIDGETTE
                             (clears her throat)
                        No touching at work.  No flirting.  
                        No nothing.  

           Nick reaches up and wipes a bit of toothpaste from the corner 
           of Bridgette’s mouth. 

                                 NICK
                        Deal.  But you can’t seduce me at 
                        work if you’re not going to invite 
                        me over later.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        When have I ever tried to seduce 
                        you at work?

                                 NICK
                        Really?

           Bridgette smiles, guilty.  She unbuttons the top three 
           buttons of his shirt.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Fine.  
                             (he kisses her on the 
                              neck; she closes her 
                              eyes)
                        But no sleeping over - this isn’t 
                        summer camp.  You do your business 
                        and you leave.  

                                 NICK
                        Absolutely.
                             (pulls off his shirt)
                        Are we still allowed to sleep with 
                        other people?

                                 BRIDGETTE
                             (false bravado)
                        Of course.  It’s not like we’re in 
                        a relationship. 
                                 NICK
                        Then we have to use protection.  
                        Always. 

           Bridgette undoes his belt buckle and traces her hand across 
           his waistline. 

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Always?

                                 NICK
                        Always... with other people. 

           Bridgette smiles and pulls him into the bedroom. 

           INT. WARRIORS OFFICES - NEXT DAY

           Bridgette sits outside a conference room, tapping her foot.  
           JOHN steps out of the room.  

                                 JOHN
                        They’re ready for you.  
                             (Bridgette stands)
                        Nervous?

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        A little.

                                 JOHN
                        You’ll be fine.  Just stick to the 
                        script and be yourself.

           Bridgette nods and follows John. 

           INT. BOARD ROOM - DAY

           Bridgette gives a presentation to eight men in suits.  

           At the head of the table sits WILLIAM MORGAN, the primary 
           owner of the Warriors, and to his right sits DAVID ENGLISH, 
           the President and CEO.  Kendall sits in the middle of the 
           table.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Today, I’m going to do an advanced 
                        statistical breakdown of some of 
                        the free agents that are available 
                        this summer.  
                             (Bridgette clicks to the 
                              next slide in her 
                              presentation)
                        First, we have Devin Jackson.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 BRIDGETTE (CONT'D)
                        As you can see, Jackson’s 
                        production has increased each year 
                        he’s been in the league.  

           Bridgette catches Kendall’s eye; he gives her a a huge, shit-
           eating grin.

           Bridgette stares at Kendall for a long beat.  The board 
           members look at each other - is she ok?  Bridgette snaps back 
           to her computer.

                                 BRIDGETTE (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry, this is the wrong 
                        presentation.  

           Bridgette opens another file, one that compares Tyson King 
           and Devin Jackson.  

                                 BRIDGETTE (CONT’D)
                        Let’s compare two players: Tyson 
                        King and Devin Jackson.  When 
                        looking at per-game averages, 
                        Jackson seems to have the upper 
                        hand.  When you dig into the 
                        advanced stats, however, you can 
                        see that King is a far superior 
                        player - and that signing Jackson 
                        would be a huge mistake.  

           Kendall’s face falls; he’s irate.  

                                 BRIDGETTE (CONT’D)
                        While his stats did decline after 
                        his injury, King’s continued 
                        ability to draw fouls suggests...

           The owner, Mr. Morgan, leans over to talk to English, the 
           CEO.  Bridgette sees them and continues, emboldened.

           INT. WARRIORS OFFICES, HALLWAY - DAY

           Bridgette and John walk away from the meeting, speaking 
           sharply and quietly.  

                                 JOHN
                        What the hell was that?

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        I was just following your advice.  
                                 JOHN
                        I’m sorry, I must have forgotten 
                        the part where I told you to risk 
                        your entire career on a whim.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        You told me to be myself - and the 
                        one thing I’m not is Kendall’s 
                        fucking marionette.  

                                 JOHN
                        Yeah, well then you should know 
                        that it’s not Kendall that wants to 
                        sign Jackson - it comes straight 
                        from the top.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Really?

                                 JOHN
                        Yes.  And Mr. Morgan’s not too 
                        excited when people waste his time.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        So I just went down in flames.
                             (John nods; Bridgette 
                              turns)
                        I need to talk to him.

                                 JOHN
                        Bridgette, stop.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Look, John, I appreciate everything 
                        you’ve done for me.  But at some 
                        point, I need to fight my own 
                        battles.

                                 JOHN
                        So you don’t want me to let you 
                        head an exploratory group that 
                        pursues signing Tyson King?

           Bridgette stops, shocked.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        What? 

                                 JOHN
                        But there’s a catch: you can’t tell 
                        anyone.  Just research King, get 
                        him to schedule a visit, and when 
                        the time comes we’ll take it to 
                        Morgan together.
           Bridgette hugs John - then quickly lets go, embarrassed.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Thank you.  You won’t regret it.  

                                 JOHN
                        Don’t start celebrating yet.  
                        Kendall’s got more experience than 
                        you, greater resources, and 
                        stronger relationships across the 
                        league - not to mention the fact 
                        that Jackson actually wants to sign 
                        with us and King doesn’t.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Doesn’t matter, we’re going to get 
                        King.  I can feel it. 

                                 JOHN
                        I hope you know what you’re doing.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        I always know what I’m doing.

           INT. BRIDGETTE’S OFFICE - EVENING

           Bridgette enters her office, flustered, with Marie close 
           behind.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        I have no fucking idea what I’m 
                        doing.  
                             (Marie closes the door)
                        I’m going to lose, Kendall’s going 
                        to push me out, and my career is 
                        going to be over. 

                                 MARIE
                        Or you’re going to win, get your 
                        dream job and become the most 
                        powerful woman in league history.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Thanks, Marie.  More pressure is 
                        exactly what I needed right now.  

                                 MARIE
                        What happened to my boss of the 
                        last few days?  The one who came in 
                        and was suddenly interested in 
                        kicking ass again?
                                 BRIDGETTE
                        I don’t know where that came from.  
                        I just woke up on Monday and...

           Bridgette realizes something.  She grabs her jacket.  

                                 MARIE
                        Where are you going?

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        To get some confidence.  

           INT. BRIDGETTE’S APARTMENT, ENTRY WAY - NIGHT

           Bridgette, shirt already half-unbuttoned, opens the door to 
           reveal Nick.

                                 NICK
                        I got your text...

           Bridgette closes the door and attacks Nick, making out with 
           him furiously.  

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        Hold on a second.
                             (Bridgette doesn’t stop)
                        Seriously, we need to talk.
                             (Bridgette still doesn’t 
                              stop)
                        Bridgette - stop.   

           Bridgette stops.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        You’re married.

                                 NICK
                        No.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        You have a girlfriend.  

                                 NICK
                        No.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        You’ve got...
                             (she motions generally to 
                              his crotch)
                        Something.  

                                 NICK
                        No.  
                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Then why are we still talking? 

           Bridgette unbuckles Nick’s pants. 

                                 NICK
                        Kendall asked me to be on the King 
                        team with you.  

           Bridgette takes a step back.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        He wants you to spy on us, to 
                        sabotage any chance we have of 
                        getting King.  

                                 NICK
                        Yes.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Are you going to do it?

                                 NICK
                        No.  
                             (Bridgette studies him)
                        Of course, that’s also what I would 
                        say if I were planning on screwing 
                        you over.  So the real question is: 
                        do you trust me?  

           The DOORBELL rings.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Who the hell is that?

           Bridgette, hastily buttoning her shirt, opens the door to 
           reveal a punky teen girl, TAYLOR (15).

                                 TAYLOR
                        I’m looking for my brother.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        I think you’ve got the wrong 
                        apartment.

                                 TAYLOR
                        Nope, I followed him here.

           Taylor looks over Bridgette’s shoulder and spots Nick.  

                                 TAYLOR (CONT’D)
                        There he is.  
                             (re: Bridgette’s shirt)
                        You missed a button.
           Taylor pushes past a dumbfounded Bridgette into the 
           apartment.  

           INT. BRIDGETTE’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Taylor snoops around the living room.  She opens a cabinet 
           and finds a framed picture laying face down: it’s of Grant 
           and Bridgette at their wedding.

           In the bathroom, Taylor opens the cabinet and finds the pills 
           that Bridgette hid.  She reads the labels, smirks, and slips 
           a few pills into her pocket.

           Bridgette and Nick speak in hurried whispers in the kitchen 
           as Bridgette makes herself a gin and tonic.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        What is she doing here?

                                 NICK
                        Sometimes she just leaves home.  
                        I’ve tried to explain how 
                        irresponsible that is...

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        What about your parents?

                                 NICK
                        My dad hasn’t ever been able to 
                        control her.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Then maybe your mom should step up.

                                 NICK
                        My mom died ten years ago.   

           Nick’s phone rings; he answers.

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                             (into phone)
                        Hey, Dad.  She’s fine.  

           Nick walks into the bedroom.  Bridgette cautiously enters the 
           living room, where Taylor listens to music on the couch.  

           Bridgette puts her drink on the coffee table and sits next to 
           Taylor, who pulls out her earbuds.
                                 TAYLOR
                        This a fucking sweet apartment.  
                        Did you know that you can see the 
                        Golden Gate Bridge from your 
                        bathroom? 

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Yeah.  I live here.  

                                 TAYLOR
                        So, aren’t you supposed to offer me 
                        something to drink?

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        How about some milk?

                                 TAYLOR
                        No, thanks.  I’ll just have some of 
                        your water.  

           Taylor reaches for Bridgette’s gin and tonic, which Bridgette 
           snatches away. 

                                 TAYLOR (CONT’D)
                        Has anyone ever told you that your 
                        hospitality is lacking?

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        How old are you?

                                 TAYLOR
                        Fifteen.  How old are you?

           Nick walks past the bedroom door, talking on the phone; 
           Bridgette cranes her neck to get a better view.  Taylor 
           smiles.

                                 TAYLOR (CONT’D)
                        You’re totally crushing.  How 
                        adorable.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Look, kid: I know you think you’re 
                        pretty hot shit right now, but in 
                        an hour you’ll be back on a bus to 
                        Assbackwardsville and I’ll be 
                        having sex with your brother.  

                                 TAYLOR
                        We’ll see.  Turns out my brother’s 
                        got a nasty overprotective streak, 
                        so when I’m around I tend to get in 
                        the way of what - and who - he 
                        does.
                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Is that supposed to be a threat?  

                                 TAYLOR
                        More like an offer.  Give me what I 
                        want, and I leave your 
                        “relationship” alone.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        I’m not negotiating with a tween.

                                 TAYLOR
                             (shrugs)
                        Have it your way.  But I know if I 
                        was older, and divorced, and it 
                        felt like my whole life was slowly 
                        slipping away, I would be careful 
                        when it came to the things I cared 
                        about.  Because pretty soon, I’m 
                        just going to be alone with my ice 
                        water. 

           Bridgette studies Taylor: who is this girl?

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        What do you want?

                                 TAYLOR
                        When the time comes, you’ll know. 

           Nick hangs up the phone and enters the room, agitated.  

                                 NICK 
                        Taylor, what in the hell do you 
                        think you’re doing?  Dad was 
                        worried sick about you.

                                 TAYLOR
                        Whatever.  It’s a four hour bus 
                        ride, and I left a note.    

                                 NICK
                        Well, I hope you enjoyed the trip, 
                        because you’re about to experience 
                        it in reverse.

           Nick picks up Taylor’s bag.

                                 TAYLOR
                        Then I’ll just run off again - 
                        someplace where I don’t have a big 
                        brother to look after me.  
                             (Nick hesitates; Taylor 
                              walks to the door)
                                 (MORE)
                                 TAYLOR (CONT'D)
                        Lisa’s older brother lives in LA.  
                        I’m sure he’d be more than happy to 
                        house a sweet, naive teen for a few 
                        weeks.  

           Taylor writes a text on her phone.  Nick wavers.    

                                 NICK
                        You haven’t been sweet or naive 
                        since you were seven.  What do you 
                        want?

                                 TAYLOR
                        To stay in the city for a month.

                                 NICK
                             (scoffs)
                        Yeah, right.

           Taylor’s phone beeps.  

                                 TAYLOR
                             (re: phone)
                        Lisa’s brother.  
                             (reading)
                        “We don’t have an extra bedroom.”
                             (texting back)
                        That’s ok, I can share...

           Nick grabs her phone.  

                                 NICK
                        Two weeks.  And no skipping school 
                        next semester.  

                                 TAYLOR
                        Five skip days.  And I want to stay 
                        with Bridgette while I’m here. 

                                 NICK
                             (laughs)
                        No way.  I’m not going to ask her 
                        to do that.   

                                 TAYLOR
                        Then we’ll flip a coin.  Heads I 
                        stay here, tails I stay with you.

           Taylor stares at Bridgette: this is where you agree.  
           Bridgette nods.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Fine.
                                 NICK
                        Bridgette, you don’t have to do 
                        this.

                                 TAYLOR
                        It’s ok, Nick.  We’re just having 
                        fun.  

           Taylor flips the quarter into the air, catches it, and turns 
           it over on her wrist.  She smiles and shows it to Bridgette.

                                 TAYLOR (CONT’D)
                             (to Bridgette)
                        Looks like we’re gonna be besties.

           Bridgette hesitates: what the hell did I just agree to?

           EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - DAWN

           Bridgette, wearing workout clothes with her hat pulled over 
           her eyes, walks back to her apartment.  She hears a 
           basketball CLANG against a rim and looks up. 

           Taylor plays basketball on an worn outdoor court.  Bridgette 
           creeps towards her to get a better look, but accidentally 
           runs into a jogger.  

                                 JOGGER
                        Hey, watch it!

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Sorry.  

           Bridgette looks back at the court, but Taylor’s gone.  
           Bridgette approaches, cautious.

                                 TAYLOR (O.S.)
                        What the hell are you doing here?

           Bridgette spins to find Taylor, ball against her hip.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Just, you know, jogging.  

                                 TAYLOR
                        And?

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        And I saw you, and I was curious 
                        what could possibly be important 
                        enough to get a fifteen year old up 
                        before dawn.  
                                 TAYLOR
                        You’re up.

           Taylor turns away and shoots a deep three pointer.  Swish.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Nice shot.  You play on your high 
                        school team?

                                 TAYLOR
                        Until I got kicked off.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        For what?

                                 TAYLOR
                        Why are you sleeping with my 
                        brother?
                             (Bridgette is silent)
                        Guess I’m not the only one who 
                        doesn’t like questions.

           Taylor puts up another shot: swish.  Bridgette grabs the 
           ball.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Then how about a little one-on-one 
                        for answers.    

           Taylor laughs.

                                 TAYLOR
                        Against you?  Absolutely.  Make-it-
                        take-it, I get the ball.  

           Taylor ‘checks’ the ball to Bridgette, who tosses it back.  

                                 TAYLOR (CONT’D)
                        Question one: why were you really 
                        spying on me?

           Taylor dribbles to the right and puts up a shot - swish.  
           Bridgette gets the ball.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        I was curious.  
                             (Taylor stares at her - 
                              not good enough)
                        I wanted to find out more about you 
                        in case you try to sabotage my... 
                        arrangement with Nick. 
                                 TAYLOR
                        I wouldn’t worry about that.  I 
                        don’t care what bimbo he screws.  

           Taylor grabs the ball and faces down Bridgette.

                                 TAYLOR (CONT’D)
                        Next question: why don’t you have 
                        any kids?

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        What kind of question is that?

                                 TAYLOR
                        You grow up, you get married, you 
                        have kids.  That’s how it works.

           This time, Taylor crosses over to the left and shoots - 
           swish.  Bridgette gets the ball.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        My husband and I made a choice that 
                        we weren’t willing to sacrifice our 
                        professional success to have a 
                        child.

                                 TAYLOR
                        And how’d that work out for your 
                        marriage?

           Bridgette checks the ball back to Taylor, hard.  Taylor 
           smiles. 

                                 TAYLOR (CONT’D)
                        Last question: where were you this 
                        morning?

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        What do you mean?  I was jogging.  

                                 TAYLOR
                        You’re barely sweating, and you’re 
                        not even wearing a sports bra; you 
                        haven’t been running anywhere.  So 
                        where were you?

           Taylor drives, spins and puts up a shot - but is BLOCKED by 
           Bridgette.

                                 TAYLOR (CONT’D)
                        Foul.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        I'm sorry?
                                 TAYLOR
                        Foul.  You fouled me.  

           Bridgette stares at Taylor, incredulous, then nods and throws 
           her the ball.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Alright.  

           Taylor drives to the hoop, but Bridgette blocks her again.

                                 BRIDGETTE (CONT’D)
                        Foul.  
                             (Taylor stares at her)
                        I got your arm.  Sorry. 

           Next time: Taylor tries a step back jumper: blocked. 

                                 BRIDGETTE (CONT’D)
                        Foul.  Tripped you.  

           Next time: Taylor tries to spin the other way, but Bridgette 
           steals the ball.  

                                 BRIDGETTE (CONT’D)
                        Foul.  I think my elbow hit your 
                        hair.  

           Bridgette gives the ball to Taylor - who throws it back, 
           pissed.

                                 TAYLOR
                        Just take the damn ball.  

           Bridgette takes the ball and faces Taylor. 

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        My turn: who taught you to play?

           Bridgette drives past Taylor and scores.  Taylor throws the 
           ball back to Bridgette, mad.

                                 TAYLOR
                        My Mom.  And then my brother.  And 
                        then me.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        And what the hell are you doing out 
                        here at five AM? 

           Bridgette backs into Taylor, knocking her to the ground, and 
           spins to the hoop for an easy layup.  She offers Taylor a 
           hand to help her up, but Taylor ignores her and stands.
                                 TAYLOR
                        Because my brother is so incredibly 
                        anal he’ll probably lock me in a 
                        closet when he wakes up.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        If he's so overprotective, why come 
                        to San Francisco?

                                 TAYLOR
                        Because I had to get out of my 
                        shithole town, and if I went 
                        anywhere else Nick would quit his 
                        job to track me down.  That was two 
                        questions. 

           Bridgette faces down Taylor, who swipes at the ball.  
           Bridgette pivots away.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Ok, but why now?   

                                 TAYLOR
                        What?

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Your town was a shithole last 
                        month, and the month before that.  
                        Why come now?  What are you running 
                        from?   

           Bridgette fakes a shot.  Taylor bites on the fake and 
           Bridgette drives to the basket and scores.  

                                 BRIDGETTE (CONT’D)
                        Well? 

           Taylor grabs the ball and walks off the court, not looking 
           back.

                                 BRIDGETTE (CONT’D)
                        Oh, I see.  Real mature.  

           Bridgette picks up her stuff and glances at her phone: shit, 
           she’s late.  

           INT. FANCY RESTAURANT - DAY

           Bridgette hurries through a restaurant that overlooks the bay 
           until she spots SCOTT CARLSON, Tyson King’s agent.  She 
           approaches his table, arm outstretched.  
                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Sorry I’m late.  Bridgette Nelson.  

           Scott ignores her hand, focusing instead on his food.

                                 SCOTT
                        Wow - this omelette is amazing.  
                        It’s got a caviar that the 
                        Ukrainians say will make you live 
                        forever.
                             (to waiter, taps his 
                              glass)
                        Another scotch.  Laguvulin.

           Bridgette looks at the menu, but her eyes bulge at the prices 
           and she quickly puts it down.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                             (to waiter)
                        Just coffee for now, thanks.
                             (to Scott)
                        I’ll get right to the point: we 
                        would like to sign your client, 
                        Tyson King.  

                                 SCOTT
                        I’m sure you would.  Unfortunately, 
                        Tyson’s going to sign with Dallas.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        We’d still like the chance to make 
                        our case.  

           Scott puts down his fork and wipes his mouth.  

                                 SCOTT
                        Look, Brenda...

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Bridgette.

                                 SCOTT
                        ...there’s nothing in the world 
                        that I hate more than a cocktease, 
                        so I’m gonna give this to you 
                        straight.  You have no chance of 
                        signing Tyson.  Zero.  Every moment 
                        you imagine the possibility of him 
                        playing for the Warriors is a 
                        pathetic waste of your time.  
                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Why?  We have cap room, young 
                        pieces to contend for the next five 
                        years, a coach with championship 
                        experience...

                                 SCOTT
                        Do you have two other superstars 
                        signing in the same place?  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        No.  But we have tens of millions 
                        of fans in Asia - maybe hundreds of 
                        millions. The difference in 
                        endorsements alone...

                                 SCOTT
                        Look, lady, you’re preaching to the 
                        choir.  You think I want to fly to 
                        some sweaty, southern armpit just 
                        so I can watch fat people eat Chick-
                        Fil-A?  But the money I make from 
                        Tyson King is going to pay for my 
                        next two houses.  So if he wants to 
                        go to Dallas, I’m not gonna piss 
                        him off - because I don’t take 
                        risks with the goose that lays the 
                        golden fucking eggs.  Period.  

           Scott stands.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        So that’s it? You just came here to 
                        drink fifty dollar scotch and say 
                        no to my face?

                                 SCOTT
                        I represent some of the best 
                        basketball players in the world and 
                        you are a second-tier pencil 
                        pusher; I did you a favor by 
                        letting you watch me eat.  
                             (to waiter)
                        She’ll take the check.  

           Scott walks away; Bridgette watches him, feeling equal parts 
           angry and helpless.  The waiter delivers the scotch that 
           Scott ordered, and Bridgette downs it in one swig. 

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY

           Bridgette and Marie sit in a conference room, surrounded by 
           three laptops, two TV’s, and a half-dozen file boxes.
                                 MARIE
                        We’re screwed.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        We’re not screwed; we just have to 
                        regroup.  We’ve got everything King 
                        has done since he was twelve years 
                        old.  There’s got to be something 
                        in here that can help us.  

                                 MARIE
                        We want to sign a player whom we 
                        aren’t allowed to speak to.  I 
                        don’t think video of
                             (reads a DV tape)
                        “South Covington Junior Prom” is 
                        going to make much of a difference.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Maybe Nick will have an idea.

                                 MARIE
                        You mean the guy who’s supposed to 
                        spy on us for his boss?   Hold on, 
                        let me ask him.  Oh, that’s right: 
                        he’s not here.  

           On cue, Nick walks in, leading a pissed-off Taylor.

                                 NICK
                        But he is very, very sorry that 
                        he’s late.  
                             (Nick smiles at Marie, who 
                              rolls her eyes)
                        Marie, this is my sister, Taylor. 

           Taylor pulls out a chair, slamming it noisily.  She turns 
           away from them and buries herself in her phone.  

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        Taylor apparently does not 
                        understand which areas of the city 
                        she can and can not visit by 
                        herself, so she’s going to be 
                        spending the day with us.

                                 MARIE
                        I didn’t realize that we were 
                        running a day care.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        What we’re doing is trying to sign 
                        a star.  Let’s get to it.
           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - HOURS LATER

           The group works silently and intently as video of King 
           playing basketball runs on both TVs.

           Bridgette flips through a pile of old documents, examining a 
           yearbook photo in which King and his high school teammates 
           goof around.

           Marie highlights interview transcripts, sorting them into 
           piles.  She rubs her eyes.  

           Nick compiles a record of King’s life on a whiteboard, titled 
           “Tyson King Timeline,” with portions named “South Covington 
           High,” “Syracuse,” “CAA,” etc.  He periodically gets up from 
           his computer to add to it.  

           Taylor sits to one side, still on her phone.  

           Nick takes a step back, rubbing his eyes.  He turns to get 
           more coffee, but bumps into the table Marie is working on, 
           knocking her piles to the ground.     

                                 MARIE
                        Seriously? Those were organized.  

                                 NICK
                        Then maybe you shouldn’t have 
                        arranged them like you were playing 
                        three simultaneous games of Jenga.

                                 MARIE
                        Oh, you’ve got jokes.  Let’s see 
                        how funny it is when I erase your 
                        precious timeline; then how will we 
                        ever know if Tyson chose macaroni 
                        and cheese over PB and J?

           Bridgette steps between them.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Maybe we should take a break.  

                                 MARIE
                        We don’t have time for a break.  
                        Every hour is one closer to King 
                        signing with Dallas.  And we have 
                        nothing.

           Bridgette tries to think of a response, but Marie’s right.

                                 TAYLOR (O.S.)
                        Why does he do that?  
           Marie, Bridgette, and Nick spin to look at Taylor, who has 
           taken off her headphones and is watching King enter a 
           basketball game.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Why does who do what?

                                 TAYLOR
                        King.  Every time he goes into the 
                        game, he does this thing with his 
                        hand.

           Bridgette rewinds the TV, and they all watch.  As King checks 
           in he does a small, complicated hand gesture before he walks 
           on the court.  Even if you’re looking for it, it’s almost 
           imperceptible.  

                                 MARIE
                        Probably just a superstition - all 
                        players have them.    

           Taylor grabs the remote and rewinds, watching in slow motion.  

                                 TAYLOR
                        Bullshit - that’s sign language.  I 
                        learned it in school.  
                             (re: her brother’s look)
                        What?  It counts as a foreign 
                        language. 

           Marie studies the screen.

                                 MARIE
                        I think she’s right.

                                 TAYLOR
                        Of course I’m right.  That’s an I, 
                        I think, then maybe an M...?

                                 NICK
                        It’s an L.  

           Nick turns a laptop around - it’s got a list of letters in 
           sign language.  The four of them cluster around, looking back 
           and forth between the laptop and the television.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Ok, that’s a V...

                                 MARIE
                        I think it’s a W...

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        What?  Definitely a V.  
                                 NICK
                        What’s that at the end, with the 
                        swoop?

                                 TAYLOR
                        I love you, J.  

           They stop: she’s right.  

                                 NICK
                        Who the hell is J?

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        We better find out.  Marie, call 
                        anyone who’s ever interviewed King, 
                        see if he’s ever mentioned anyone 
                        whose name starts with a J.  Nick, 
                        check property records for 
                        relatives...

           Taylor slips on her headphones and watches, amused, as Nick, 
           Bridgette, and Marie jump into action.

           INT. BRIDGETTE’S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

           It’s still dark.  Taylor drops Bridgette’s pill bottles on 
           the bedside table, waking her.

                                 TAYLOR
                        Which pills?

                                 BRIDGETTE
                             (half-asleep)
                        What?

                                 TAYLOR
                        I helped you yesterday, so you’re 
                        going to help me today - but in 
                        order to do that, I need you to be 
                        functional.  So which pills?

           Bridgette stares at her, then at the bottles.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Two white, one red, two brown and 
                        two black.  
                             (she turns over, holding 
                              her head)
                        Make that three black.  

           Taylor hands the pills to Bridgette with a glass of water; 
           Bridgette swallows them.  
                                 TAYLOR
                        Alright, let’s go.

           Taylor exits.  Bridgette stares after her; she groans and 
           scrapes herself out of bed.

           EXT. BASKETBALL COURT - EARLY MORNING

           Fog envelopes the court.  Taylor stands above the three point 
           line as Bridgette drags a rickety folding chair to one 
           corner.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Today we’re going to work on 
                        passing.  This is your teammate; 
                        her name is Chair.  

                                 TAYLOR
                        I don’t need to work on passing.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        I checked your stats from last 
                        year.  Twelve points a game off the 
                        bench - not bad.  
                             (Taylor smiles)
                        But only six assists.  Not per game 
                        - six for the year.  So I think 
                        passing might be a good place to 
                        start.  We’ll start basic: drive 
                        and kick...

           Taylor ignores her and takes a shot.  Bridgette grabs the 
           ball.  

                                 BRIDGETTE (CONT’D)
                        I didn’t get woken up at the crack 
                        of dawn to get ignored by a 
                        teenager.  

                                 TAYLOR
                        Then shut up about passing and tell 
                        me how you blocked my shots.  

           Bridgette smiles.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Is that what this is about?  Fine.  
                        I blocked your shots because you 
                        only care about scoring.  It’s all 
                        you think about every moment you’re 
                        on the court; 
                                 (MORE)
                                 BRIDGETTE (CONT'D)
                        it’s in your eyes, it’s in how you 
                        dribble the ball, it’s in the way 
                        you hold your breath before you 
                        shoot. And the more you want 
                        something, the easier it is for 
                        someone to take it away. So today, 
                        we are going to learn not to want.  
                        Today, we are going to learn 
                        patience.  

           Bridgette throws her the ball.  

                                 BRIDGETTE (CONT’D)
                        Now drive to the basket, but 
                        instead of shooting, pass it to 
                        Chair.  

           Taylor rolls her eyes.  She dribbles to the basket and lazily 
           throws a pass that hits one of the legs of the chair. 

                                 BRIDGETTE (CONT’D)
                        Ok.  That was awful. 

                                 TAYLOR
                        What?  I passed the stupid ball to 
                        the stupid chair.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Technically, I suppose that’s 
                        correct.  But Chair just happens to 
                        be your best three point shooter.  
                        When you’re shooting, where do you 
                        want the ball?  Here.
                             (she brings the ball to 
                              her waist)
                        It needs to be a hard, crisp pass - 
                        like this.  

           Bridgette rifles a pass which knocks Taylor backwards.  

                                 BRIDGETTE (CONT’D)
                        Again.  

           Taylor rolls her eyes, but drives the lane again; this time, 
           the pass hits the back of the chair.  

                                 BRIDGETTE (CONT’D)
                        Ok, better.  But think about this - 
                        is Chair right-handed or left-
                        handed?  

                                 TAYLOR
                        This is dumb.  
                                 BRIDGETTE
                        You know what, you’re right.  It is 
                        dumb.  

           Bridgette walks off the court.  Taylor watches her go.

                                 TAYLOR
                        Left.
                             (Bridgette stops)
                        Chair is left-handed. 

           Bridgette turns back.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Ok, if Chair is left-handed, she’s 
                        is going to want the ball on the 
                        left side of her body...

                                 TAYLOR
                        Can we stop calling her Chair?  Her 
                        name is Denise.

           Bridgette smiles.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Ok.  Denise is going to want the 
                        ball on the left side...

           INT. BRIDGETTE’S OFFICE - MORNING

           Bridgette stands in front of a white board.  The top reads 
           “Jasmine” and it’s filled with information, lists, and 
           photographs.  

           Bridgette stares at the white board, but her concentration is 
           interrupted by Marie as she bursts through the door.

                                 MARIE
                        We have a problem.  Morgan is going 
                        to make Jackson an offer.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Are you sure?

                                 MARIE
                        Assistant gossip is never wrong.  
                        Except when it is.  But it’s not 
                        this time.  We need to go ahead 
                        with the plan.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        It’s dangerous.
                                 MARIE
                        This whole thing is dangerous - 
                        isn’t that the point?  King’s even 
                        in town, playing at the Berkeley 
                        alumni game.  It’s perfect; we just 
                        need to pull the trigger.  

           Bridgette pauses.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        I need to talk to John.

           Bridgette exits, leaving Marie frustrated.  

           INT. HALLWAY - DAY

           Bridgette catches up with John in the hallway.  They walk 
           quickly.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        He has a daughter, John.  Her name 
                        is Jasmine, and she’s got a rare 
                        heart condition called
                             (flips through papers)
                        Pediatric cardiomapathy.  
                        Cardiomyapothy?  Cardiomyopathy.

                                 JOHN
                        I am rapidly losing interest.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Her doctor lives in Dallas - that’s 
                        why he wants to sign there.  

                                 JOHN
                        So what’s your point?  The guy who 
                        we previously thought was 
                        unattainable is now really, really 
                        unattainable?

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        No, because I talked to the doctor,  
                        He’s willing to relocate here, as 
                        long as we, you know,
                             (quickly)
                        build him a state of the art 
                        medical research facility for him 
                        to continue his work.  

                                 JOHN
                        How state of the art?
                                 BRIDGETTE
                        It’s for sick kids, John.

                                 JOHN
                        Bridgette.  How many zeros?

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Six.
                             (pause)
                        Maybe seven.  
                             (John scoffs, shakes his 
                              head)
                        But we can pay for it out of our 
                        charity fund - and you, of all 
                        people, know that it’s worth it if 
                        it means getting the right star.  

                                 JOHN
                        So what do you want me to do?  
                        March into Morgan’s office by your 
                        side and present this cockamamie 
                        scheme?

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Well... yeah.  

                                 JOHN
                        No - that’s career suicide.  I’m 
                        not doing it, and I’m sure as hell 
                        not letting you do it.  I care too 
                        much about your success to see you 
                        throw it away on something like 
                        this.  And if you go up there 
                        without me, I will cut you loose 
                        and pretend I’ve never heard of 
                        this whole thing.  Your choice.

           John’s phone rings.  Bridgette stops, frustrated, and watches 
           him walk away.  

           INT. BRIDGETTE’S CAR - DAY

           Bridgette sits in her car down the street from Grant’s 
           apartment complex.  She peers in the rearview mirror, 
           studying the front of the building. 

           Suddenly, the passenger door opens and Taylor jumps in.

                                 TAYLOR
                        Yo, what’s up?
                             (Bridgette jumps, 
                              startled)
                        Whoa - jumpy, much?
                                 BRIDGETTE
                        What the hell are you doing here?

                                 TAYLOR
                        What are you doing here?  I have a 
                        feeling you’re not picking up your 
                        dry cleaning.
                             (Bridgette doesn’t 
                              respond)
                        So, who lives here?
                             (still doesn’t respond)
                        The ex, huh?  Probably not a great 
                        idea to stalk him.  You know, 
                        legally.  Just for your FYI.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        How did you find me?

                                 TAYLOR
                        I installed tracking software on 
                        your phone.  I learned it from my 
                        brother, since he does it to me 
                        every time he sees me.  I had to 
                        wipe my phone again this morning.  

           Someone leaves the apartment; Bridgette quickly looks up at 
           the mirror, but it’s just two women in their 60’s. 

                                 TAYLOR (CONT’D)
                        So what are we going to do when we 
                        see him?  Rush out and scare him?  
                        Bring him a cake?  Beg him to take 
                        you back?

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        I come here when I need to think, 
                        ok?  I have to decide if I’m going 
                        to take the biggest risk of my 
                        career.

                                 TAYLOR
                        What’s the payoff?

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        I’m sorry?

                                 TAYLOR
                        You can't decide whether you're 
                        going to take a risk without 
                        calculating the payoff.  Most 
                        people, they just think about the 
                        probability of success.  Oh, it 
                        probably won't work, they say - 
                        it's not worth it.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 TAYLOR (CONT'D)
                        It's one in ten.  But if that one-
                        in-ten chance pays off twenty to 
                        one, that's a good bet.  Make it 
                        enough times, and you'll come out 
                        on top.  But people don't want to 
                        live that way - they don't want to 
                        lose ninety percent of the time.  
                        They're afraid.  And so the 
                        question you have to ask yourself 
                        is: how afraid are you?  

           Bridgette stares at Taylor for a moment - then reaches for 
           the ignition and starts the car.  

                                 TAYLOR (CONT’D)
                        That’s my girl.  

           INT. BERKELEY GYM - DAY

           Bridgette and Taylor enter a half-full gymnasium under an 
           banner that reads “UC Berkeley Alumni Charity Game.”  

           It's still a half hour before tip-off; the players, including 
           TYSON KING (24), warm up on one end of the court in front of 
           a crowd that still hasn't fully arrived.  

           Taylor sees the players and her eyes go wide.

                                 TAYLOR
                        Holy crap, it’s Tyson King.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Yes, it is.  Now go... play or 
                        something.  

           Taylor rolls her eyes and heads to the other side of the gym, 
           which has several unused basketball hoops.  

           Bridgette takes a deep breath and walks towards King - but at 
           the edge of the court, she’s stopped by a security guard.  

                                 SECURITY
                        No fans allowed.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        I’m not a fan.  I work for the 
                        Warriors, and I need to talk to 
                        Tyson.  
                             (the security guard 
                              studies her, skeptical)
                        He’s a friend.
           Bridgette shows her Warriors ID.  The security guard looks at 
           it, then turns back to the court.

                                 SECURITY
                             (calling)
                        Hey, Tyson.
                             (Tyson looks up)
                        This a friend of yours?

           Tyson studies Bridgette.

                                 TYSON
                        Never seen her before.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        No, Tyson...

           Bridgette moves towards Tyson, but the security guard steps 
           in front of her.  

                                 SECURITY
                        No.  Fans.  Allowed.  

           Bridgette takes one last look at Tyson, frustrated, and turns 
           around to take a seat on the bleachers.  

           A woman, AMBER (24), sits down next to her, holding a nine 
           month old baby.  

                                 AMBER
                        Hi, I’m Amber.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Bridgette.

                                 AMBER
                        Hi, Bridgette.  Do you mind telling 
                        me why you’re so interested in 
                        talking to my husband?

           Bridgette looks up, surprised.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Who, Tyson?  Oh, no - it’s not like 
                        that. 

                                 AMBER
                        Then what is it like?

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        I need to talk to him about signing 
                        a contract here, with the Warriors.  
                                 AMBER
                        He’s signing with Dallas.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Because of Jasmine, I know.  
                             (Amber looks up, sharply)
                        I’m not a stalker; we just did our 
                        homework.  Amber, I talked to 
                        Jasmine’s doctor: he’s willing to 
                        come here.

                                 AMBER
                        Doesn’t matter.  We’re going to 
                        Dallas.  

           Bridgette gets frustrated.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Why?  Your whole family is here.  
                        Don’t you want Jasmine to grow up 
                        with them, with that support?

           Amber’s hackles raise.  

                                 AMBER
                        I decide what’s right for my 
                        daughter - not you or anybody else.  
                        And we’ve made our choice.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        You’re right.  I’m sorry.  

           Bridgette, frustrated, looks out on the court.  She sees 
           Taylor on the far side, practicing, and is drawn in:

           Taylor dribbles the ball in the middle of the court against 
           an imaginary defender.  She crosses over and drives to the 
           hoop - but instead of attempting a layup, Taylor throws a 
           pass to the corner, to no one.  

           The ball bounces off the wall, and Taylor retrieves it.  She 
           brings the ball back to the key and repeats the whole 
           process; she’s practicing what Bridgette taught her.  

           Bridgette watches her, and she can’t keep herself from 
           smiling.  She wipes her eyes, embarrassed.

           Amber watches Bridgette watch Taylor.  She softens. 

                                 AMBER
                        Look, it’s not just about the 
                        doctor.  I’ve been to Dallas.  I’ve 
                        met the coaches, I’ve met the 
                        players, I’ve met their wives.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 AMBER (CONT'D)
                        The truth is that this is a man’s 
                        league, and the wives and the 
                        girlfriends and the children - 
                        sometimes we get shut out.  Dallas 
                        made Jasmine and I feel welcome - 
                        like we were part of the team.  

           Bridgette finally tears herself away from watching Taylor.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        I’m sorry, what was that?

                                 AMBER
                        I was talking about how the people 
                        in Dallas respected and listened to 
                        me.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Right.  Sorry.    

           Bridgette turns to face Amber, but still glances away to look 
           at Taylor.  Amber stands, with Jasmine.

                                 AMBER
                        I’ll talk to Tyson - I’ll get him 
                        to at least visit the Warriors. 

           Bridgette’s head snaps back to Amber.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        What?  Why?

                                 AMBER
                        Because I’m looking for someone who 
                        knows what it feels like to be a 
                        mom.
                             (re: Taylor)
                        She looks like she needs someone to 
                        pass to.  

           Amber walks away, leaving Bridgette speechless.  

           INT. BRIDGETTE’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Bridgette and Taylor walk in the front door, excited.  Nick 
           is waiting for them.  

                                 TAYLOR
                        She just said he would come and she 
                        didn’t give you a reason?
                                 BRIDGETTE
                        No, nothing.
                             (sees Nick)
                        Tyson King’s wife said she’ll 
                        convince him to visit.

           Nick nods, but doesn’t smile.

                                 NICK
                        Awesome.  Nice work.  

           Nick turns away.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Nick, this is great news.

                                 NICK
                        Then why didn’t you tell me you 
                        were going?  Seems like something 
                        you might want to tell someone who 
                        helped you come up with the plan in 
                        the first place.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        I’m sorry, do I work for you?

                                 NICK
                        Approaching King face to face is a 
                        pretty big move.  You didn’t tell 
                        me because you don’t trust me.  You 
                        thought I would tell Kendall.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Of course I trust you.

                                 NICK
                        Then where were you this afternoon?  
                        I went by your office, and Marie 
                        said you were out - but she had no 
                        idea where you were.  
                             (Bridgette hesitates)
                        I guess we have different 
                        definitions of the word ‘trust.’ 

           Now Bridgette is pissed - but before she can say anything, 
           Taylor steps between them.  

                                 TAYLOR
                             (to Nick)
                        You want to talk about trust?  
                        Fine.  Did you install tracking 
                        software on my phone?

           Nick hesitates; suddenly, he’s on the defensive.  
                                 NICK
                        It’s for your own good.  I can’t 
                        have you wandering around the city 
                        without knowing where you are.  

                                 TAYLOR
                        You could ask.  Of course, that 
                        would require you to have one 
                        single shred of faith in me.  

                                 NICK
                        Because you’ve done so much to earn 
                        it?  It’s my job to take care of 
                        you.

                                 TAYLOR
                        Then you suck at it.  Do me a favor 
                        and stay away from me while I’m 
                        here - or I’ll ditch the phone and 
                        give you a real reason to worry.  

           Taylor enters her room.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Hey, don’t slam the...
                             (Taylor slams the door)
                        ...door.  

           Nick looks at Bridgette - what the hell was that?  Bridgette 
           shrugs.  

           EXT. OUTDOOR MARKET - EVENING

           Bridgette and Nick browse through a crowded outdoor seafood 
           market, which is stocked with produce and fish.  Nick 
           periodically picks up items and puts them in a basket.  

                                 NICK
                        She’s so volatile - I just don’t 
                        know what to do. 

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        You want my opinion?  Give her some 
                        space.  

                                 NICK
                        Space?  I move away, and she runs 
                        away to follow me.  
                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Taylor looks up to you, and she 
                        wants you to respect her as an 
                        adult.  That’s why it makes her so 
                        mad when you treat her like a kid.  

                                 NICK
                        But she is a kid.  She’s fifteen.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        I know.  And you can still protect 
                        her; just try doing it a little 
                        more like her big brother and a 
                        little less like her dad.  
                             (Nick thinks about this)
                        Give her some space, then take her 
                        to a movie, have some fun.  It’ll 
                        help, I promise.  

                                 NICK
                        Fine. 

           Nick picks up an onion and puts it in the basket.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        I don’t like onions.  

           Bridgette puts the onion back. 

                                 NICK
                        I didn’t realize that I asked for 
                        your opinion.

           Nick picks up the onion.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        You’re cooking me dinner, so I’d 
                        prefer that it not make me gag.  

           Bridgette tries to take the onion back - but Nick holds it 
           out of her reach.  

                                 NICK
                        The question is: do you trust me 
                        that I can cook you something with 
                        an onion that doesn’t taste like 
                        onions.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Jesus.  Not every vegetable has to 
                        be a referendum on our 
                        relationship.
                                 NICK
                        Whoa, did you just refer to fact 
                        that we’re in a relationship?  I 
                        feel like this is moving a little 
                        fast.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        You’re such an asshole.  

           Bridgette tries to steal the onion one more time, but Nick 
           holds it away, kisses her, and pats her on the butt.

                                 NICK
                        Now run off and find me some 
                        capers.  

           Bridgette scowls, then sees someone eating crab legs.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Wait, why are we buying raw food 
                        when they sell cooked food?  What 
                        are we, chumps?

                                 NICK
                        I said I would cook you dinner.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Yeah, well I’m hungry now.  Deal 
                        with it.

           Bridgette grabs him by the hand and pulls him towards the 
           crab stand. 

                                 NICK
                        I’m buying this onion.  You can’t 
                        stop me.  

           INT. APARTMENT, FRONT DOOR - LATE NIGHT

           Bridgette and Nick stumble through the door, kissing.  
           Bridgette glances at Taylor’s room: light streams from under 
           the door.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        You should go.  Space, remember?
                             (Nick nods - he glances at 
                              Taylor’s room)
                        Don’t worry, I’ll check on her. 

           Nick kisses Bridgette one last time and exits.  Bridgette 
           watches him go, then shuts the door behind him.  She 
           approaches Taylor’s door and knocks softly.
                                 BRIDGETTE (CONT’D)
                        Taylor?  You ok in there?  
                             (nothing)
                        It’s past midnight - you should get 
                        some sleep.

           Bridgette opens the door, but the room is empty.  Taylor is 
           gone.  

           INT. BRIDGETTE’S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - 3 AM

           Taylor enters the apartment and is surprised to find 
           Bridgette on the couch, waiting for her.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Morning.  

                                 TAYLOR
                        Morning.  

           Taylor walks to her room.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Oh, don’t go straight to bed.  Come 
                        talk. 

           Bridgette pats the couch next to her.  Taylor sits, cautious.  

                                 TAYLOR
                        What do you want to talk about?

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        You know, girl stuff.  Like where 
                        the hell you’ve been until three 
                        AM.   

                                 TAYLOR
                        And if I don’t want to tell you?

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Then you don’t have to stay here.  

                                 TAYLOR
                        Seriously?  I just saved you from 
                        my brother finding out you’re a 
                        crazy stalker.  I thought we were 
                        friends. 

                                 BRIDGETTE
                             (laughs)
                        Taylor, we’re never going to be 
                        friends.
           Taylor is hurt, but she covers.

                                 TAYLOR
                        Why, because you’re ancient?

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Is that the best you can do?  Come 
                        on, give me your best shot.
                             (Taylor is silent; 
                              Bridgette cocks her head)
                        Or are you not mature enough to 
                        tell people how you really feel 
                        about them? 

           Taylor can’t hold it in; she boils over.  

                                 TAYLOR
                        You want honest?  Seeing you with 
                        my brother is pathetic, desperately 
                        clinging to him in your last few 
                        moments before nobody wants you 
                        anymore.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        How long do you think I can hold 
                        on?

                                 TAYLOR
                        As long as it takes for him to find 
                        a younger, hotter version of you - 
                        one that can have kids, since your 
                        insides must be pretty shriveled up 
                        by now.  

           Bridgette nods. 

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        And then what?

                                 TAYLOR
                        You just keep getting older, until 
                        you die.  Probably in your office, 
                        alone, but it takes a few days for 
                        anyone to notice.  And after your 
                        funeral, everyone stands around and 
                        talks about how you always worked 
                        so hard - how you were an 
                        inspiration.  And then they go home 
                        - back to their lives, their 
                        families, their friends - and 
                        nobody ever thinks about you again.  
                        Just like that, forgotten.  

           Taylor spits out the final word.  Bridgette nods.
                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Good.  That’s how you really hurt 
                        someone.  How did it feel?

           Taylor swallows.

                                 TAYLOR
                        I’m fine. 

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Then I suppose you’re a real woman.  

           Bridgette walks into her room and shuts the door.  

           Taylor looks around, suddenly alone.  

                                 TAYLOR
                        Whatever.  

           Taylor enters her room.

           INT. BRIDGETTE’S APARTMENT, GUEST BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Taylor throws her jacket to one side, angry. She sits on the 
           bed and tries to untie her Chuck Taylors, but her hands are 
           shaking.

           Taylor gives up and tears the shoes off, throwing them 
           against the wall, and buries her head in her pillow.

           INT. BRIDGETTE’S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Bridgette leans against the dresser, taking heavy, uneven 
           breaths.  She opens the liquor cabinet and pulls out a glass - 
           and then pauses, staring at it.  

           INT. BRIDGETTE’S APARTMENT, TAYLOR’S BEDROOM - DAWN

           The lights click on.  Taylor stirs, then squints open her 
           eyes to find Bridgette standing over her.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Get up.  We’ve got practice.

           Bridgette walks out.  Taylor looks at the time on her phone 
           and rolls her eyes - but gets up.  

           EXT. BASKETBALL COURT - EARLY MORNING

           No conversation.  Taylor shoots; Bridgette grabs the ball. 
                                 BRIDGETTE
                        On the line.  

                                 TAYLOR
                        I’m here to play ball, not run 
                        track.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        You get winded after five minutes.  
                        You call that playing ball?  
                             (Taylor doesn’t say 
                              anything)
                        On the line or go home.

           Taylor stares at her, then walks to the line.  

                                 BRIDGETTE (CONT’D)
                        Free throw line, half court, other 
                        free throw line, full court.  Go.  

           Taylor runs as Bridgette watches, stone-faced.  Taylor comes 
           back, breathing heavily.   

                                 BRIDGETTE (CONT’D)
                        There’s more to basketball than 
                        game-winning jumpers.  So which do 
                        you love?  Basketball, or scoring?  
                        Go.

           Taylor takes off again; she’s already struggling.  She comes 
           back and bends over, hands on her knees.

                                 BRIDGETTE (CONT’D)
                        Push-ups.  
                             (Taylor bends over, 
                              catching her breath)
                        Now.  
                             (Taylor gets in push-up 
                              position)
                        You know why I love basketball?  
                        Because teamwork is more important 
                        than in any other sport.  

           Taylor tries to do a push-up, but collapses.  

                                 BRIDGETTE (CONT’D)
                        I said push-ups.    

           Bridgette grabs the back of Taylor’s shirt and pulls her up 
           and down.  Sweat pools beneath Taylor. 
                                 BRIDGETTE (CONT’D)
                        I know you think I’m full of shit.  
                        Baseball and football, those sports 
                        are about teamwork.  A pitcher 
                        cannot pitch without a catcher, and 
                        a running back goes nowhere without 
                        linemen to block for him.  And yet, 
                        in basketball, a player can be 
                        selfish and a team can still 
                        succeed. 
                             (Taylor collapses on the 
                              ground)
                        Sit against the poll.  

           Taylor drags herself to her feet and sits against the pole 
           that the hoop is attached to.  

                                 BRIDGETTE (CONT’D)
                        Lower.
                             (Taylor gets lower)
                        Lower.
                             (Taylor gets lower)
                        Lower.  

           Bridgette pushes Taylor down until her thighs are parallel 
           with the ground.  Taylor’s legs shake.  

                                 BRIDGETTE (CONT’D)
                        In basketball, teamwork is optional 
                        - and that’s why it’s so special, 
                        so beautiful, when a team puts 
                        their egos aside and plays like it 
                        is a single body, communicating 
                        with a language of picks and passes 
                        and glances and fakes.  That’s why 
                        I love the game: because the way 
                        you play says something about who 
                        you really are.     

           Taylor’s legs give out and she collapses on the ground, chest 
           heaving.

                                 BRIDGETTE (CONT’D)
                        So when I see someone play 
                        selfishly, it frustrates me.  
                        Because that person says they love 
                        the game, but they don’t - they 
                        love themselves.  On the line.  
                             (Taylor stays on the 
                              ground)
                        On the line.  

           Taylor struggles to her knees, and then VOMITS all over the 
           blacktop.  
                                 BRIDGETTE (CONT’D)
                        I guess we’re done.  

           Bridgette gathers her things.  Taylor scrapes herself to her 
           feet and stands on the line.  

                                 TAYLOR
                        Say go.  

           Bridgette softens, almost imperceptibly.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Taylor, I said we’re done.   

           Bridgette turns away.

                                 TAYLOR
                        You want to know why I ran away?
                             (Bridgette stops)
                        There was a girl that was picking 
                        on me at school, calling me a 
                        'dyke.'  So I found her boyfriend 
                        at a party, drunk, and I slept with 
                        him.  The next day the whole school 
                        knew.  And when I saw her, crying 
                        by her locker, I said “Guess I'm 
                        not a dyke after all.”  And you 
                        know what she said?  She said 
                        “Nobody likes you.  Not even your 
                        Mom.”

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Taylor.  That's not true.  

                                 TAYLOR
                        I’ve never done a single thing in 
                        my life that she would be proud of.  
                        But she'd be proud of this.  

           Taylor puts her foot on the line.  

                                 TAYLOR (CONT’D)
                        Say 'Go.'
                             (Bridgette looks at her; 
                              now, forcefully:)
                        Say 'Go.'

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Go.

           Taylor takes off running; Bridgette watches her.
           INT. WARRIORS OFFICES - DAY

           Marie is on the phone at her desk, stressed.  Bridgette walks 
           in and Marie hangs up.  

                                 MARIE
                        Where the hell have you been?  I’ve 
                        been calling you for an hour.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        I think my phone is off.

                                 MARIE
                        Your phone is...?  
                             (Marie can’t process this; 
                              she shakes her head)
                        John needs to see you.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Ok, tell him I’m coming...

                                 MARIE
                        In Mr. Morgan’s office.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Mr. Morgan.
                             (Marie nods)
                        Who owns the team.
                             (Marie nods)
                        When?

                                 MARIE
                        In two minutes.  

           Bridgette takes off her heels and RUNS.   

                                 MARIE (CONT’D)
                        Other way.  

           Bridgette runs the other way.  

           INT. MORGAN’S OFFICE

           Bridgette enters, harried, and finds Mr. Morgan and John 
           sitting across the table from Kendall; Kendall makes a show 
           of checking his watch.  

                                 MR. MORGAN
                        Miss Nelson.  Please, sit.  
                             (she does)
                        Can I get you anything?  Water?  
                                 BRIDGETTE
                        I’m fine, thanks.  

                                 MR. MORGAN
                        Then I’ll get right to it.  David 
                        English, our CEO, is being sued by 
                        one of our former employees for 
                        sexual harassment.  He’s been 
                        placed on administrative leave, and 
                        will be fired.
                             (Bridgette looks up, 
                              shocked)
                        I wanted to tell the two of you 
                        personally, because each of you 
                        will be coordinating a visit from a 
                        free agent: Kendall with Devin 
                        Jackson, and Bridgette with Tyson 
                        King.  Any questions?

           Bridgette glances at John, elated.  He nods.  Kendall clears 
           his throat.

                                 KENDALL
                        Yes, actually.  Even allowing for 
                        the possibility that these players 
                        are equally talented - which I’m 
                        not willing to concede - Jackson is 
                        ready to sign.  If we bring in 
                        King, we risk alienating Jackson 
                        and ending up with no one.  It 
                        doesn’t make sense.

           Morgan looks to Bridgette.

                                 MR. MORGAN
                        Bridgette?

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        First of all, there’s a difference 
                        between a player promising to sign 
                        and actually signing - especially a 
                        player as notoriously fickle as 
                        Jackson.  Are you really going to a 
                        let a player who’s not on your team 
                        tell you who you’re allowed to 
                        bring in for a visit?

                                 KENDALL
                        Why not?  This is no time for ego: 
                        we’re trying to win basketball 
                        games.
                                 BRIDGETTE
                        And two seasons ago, Tyson King was 
                        your best chance to do that.  

                                 KENDALL
                        And then last year, he sucked.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        He was playing hurt.  

                                 KENDALL
                        I don’t fucking care.  Give him a 
                        gold star and sign him up for the 
                        special Olympics, but I want guys 
                        who can ball.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        You want ball?  How about the fact 
                        that any sane player in a contract 
                        year would have sat out the season 
                        instead of hurting his own value by 
                        playing at seventy five percent?  
                        Or how about the fact that he was 
                        top five in the league in on-off 
                        court differential and adjusted 
                        plus minus - and that’s while he 
                        was hurt.  He couldn’t throw down 
                        highlight dunks every night, but he 
                        was doing everything possible to 
                        help his team win, every single 
                        night, all while dragging around a 
                        gimpy leg.  So if you ask me, I 
                        can’t think of another guy on the 
                        planet who I’d be prouder to see 
                        with the word ‘Warrior” printed 
                        across his chest.

           Kendall shakes his head, incredulous.

                                 KENDALL
                        I don’t even know how to respond to 
                        this.  The idea that we would 
                        ignore a sure thing in favor of 
                        such an obvious risk...

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        That’s the word, right there.  
                        Risk.  People hate risks - because 
                        they know that if they take enough 
                        of them, sometimes, they’re going 
                        to get burned.

                        And that fear sticks with them, 
                        clouds their judgement, until they 
                        become eternally confined to the 
                        drab sameness of mediocrity.  The 
                        key is to look past the fear and 
                        learn to take the right risks - 
                        because no one ever achieved 
                        greatness by playing scared.  So 
                        the real question is: how scared 
                        are we?

           Morgan contemplates for a long moment, then sits up.  

                                 MORGAN
                        We’ll pursue both Jackson and King.
                             (Bridgette smiles; Kendall 
                              scowls)
                        And just so you both know, in order 
                        to present an image of continuity 
                        I’ve named John acting CEO in 
                        addition to his current role of 
                        General Manager.  If John were to 
                        retain the role of CEO, of course, 
                        we would need a new GM - and we 
                        would look favorably upon anyone 
                        who was able to sign a marquee free 
                        agent.  Am I making myself clear?

           Bridgette is taken aback; she tries to hide her excitement.

           INT. WARRIORS OFFICES, HALLWAY - DAY

           John walks down another hall with Bridgette; they speak 
           quietly and quickly.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Let me get this straight: he’s 
                        saying that if we sign Tyson King, 
                        he’ll make me general manager.  

                                 JOHN
                        Yes.  And he’s lying.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        How do you know?

                                 JOHN
                        I’ve worked for the man for ten 
                        years.  He loves to dangle 
                        promotions in front of people if he 
                        thinks it will serve his purposes.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 JOHN (CONT'D)
                        He’s doing the same thing to me, 
                        but I’m not going to be his puppet 
                        if it means damaging your career.  
                        Which is why I think you should 
                        give up on King.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        But we’re so close.

                                 JOHN
                        No, we’re not.  This lawsuit makes 
                        us look like clowns; nobody will 
                        come close to us, especially King.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        How do you know?

                                 JOHN
                        Because I know people.  King made a 
                        handshake deal with Dallas last 
                        night; it’ll be official when the 
                        signing window opens on Friday.  
                        And when we sign Jackson instead, 
                        who do you think is going to get 
                        that GM job?

           Right on cue, Kendall enters the hallway.  As he passes, he 
           locks eyes with Bridgette, smiles wide, and winks; it takes 
           all of Bridgette’s willpower not to slug him in the mouth.  

           Kendall turns the corner and disappears.

                                 JOHN (CONT’D)
                             (quietly)
                        Give up on King and make nice with 
                        Kendall: in a few weeks, he’s going 
                        to be your boss.  I’m sorry, Bridg - 
                        it’s over.   

           INT. BRIDGETTE’S OFFICE - DAY

           Bridgette sits at her desk, twirling a cigarette between her 
           fingers.  Marie paces in front of her.

                                 MARIE
                        Are you serious?  Does he have any 
                        idea how close we are?

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Of course he knows.  He also knows 
                        that we’re not nearly as close as 
                        we think we are.  
                                 MARIE
                        Bullshit.  He doesn’t want us to 
                        get King.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Of course he does.  His entire 
                        promotion is resting on it.  He’s 
                        helping us despite that.

                                 MARIE
                        Ok, fine.  But why are you 
                        listening?  You’re headed for the 
                        biggest moment of your career, and 
                        one comment from John is enough for 
                        you to call the whole thing off?

           Marie’s voice has started to escalate; Bridgette’s follows.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        John’s been looking out for me 
                        since I was an analyst.

                                 MARIE
                        You’re not an analyst anymore!  
                        You’ve been like this ever since 
                        Grant left, trying to keep 
                        everything exactly how it was...

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        I don’t need a lecture on life 
                        right now. 

                                 MARIE
                        Are you sure?  Because it seems 
                        like you’re too afraid to go after 
                        what you want.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                             (too loud)
                        I want what I had.

           Marie stops.  For a moment, no one says anything.  

                                 BRIDGETTE (CONT’D)
                        Just get out.  Please.    

           Marie walks to the door.  Before she leaves:

                                 MARIE
                        What you had is gone.  At some 
                        point, you’re going to have to deal 
                        with that.  
           Marie exits.  Bridgette is left alone, struggling with what 
           to do; she grabs her things and leaves. 

           INT. BRIDGETTE’S APARTMENT, FRONT DOOR - NIGHT

           Bridgette enters her apartment and is surprised to find Nick 
           waiting for her in the living room.

                                 NICK
                        Where have you been?

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        At work.

                                 NICK
                        Marie said you left three hours 
                        ago.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        I’m sorry, I didn’t realize I 
                        needed to check in with you every 
                        fifteen minutes.  And while we’re 
                        asking questions, why the hell 
                        didn’t you tell me that King made a 
                        handshake deal with Dallas?

                                 NICK
                        What?  I haven’t heard that.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Kendall knew.  I could see it all 
                        over his smug little face.

                                 NICK
                        If he did, he didn’t tell me.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Like how he didn’t tell you that he 
                        was about to sign Jackson the other 
                        day?

                                 NICK
                        Exactly like that, actually.  And I 
                        would appreciate it if you would 
                        said hi to me when you come home 
                        before you accuse me of being a 
                        pathological liar.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        This isn’t your home.  What the 
                        hell are you even doing here?

           Taylor enters from her room.
                                 TAYLOR
                        Nick’s taking me to the movies.  
                        You want to come?

                        BRIDGETTE
                                                          NICK
           I can’t.  
                                              She can’t.

           Taylor looks from Nick to Bridgette.

                                 TAYLOR (CONT’D)
                        What’s going on?

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Nothing.  Have fun.  

           Bridgette exits.  Taylor looks at Nick and shakes her head, 
           pissed.

                                 TAYLOR
                        You’re unbelievable.  

           Taylor follows Bridgette.  

           INT. BRIDGETTE’S APARTMENT, BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Bridgette pulls out a pack of cigarettes, hands shaking.  
           Taylor enters and closes the door.

                                 TAYLOR 
                             (re: cigarettes)
                        Do you have any idea how dumb these 
                        are?

           Taylor grabs the pack, dumps it in the sink, and turns on the 
           water. 

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Trust me, you do not want to mess 
                        with me right now.  

                                 TAYLOR
                        I’m a rebellious teenager with an 
                        invincibility complex who acts like 
                        she’s twelve but thinks that she’s 
                        twenty one.  Make my day.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Just... leave me alone.  I don’t 
                        want to go out with him. 
                                 TAYLOR
                        Then go out with me.  Please please 
                        pretty please, Bridgette, my only 
                        and bestest friend, will you come 
                        to the movies?  So I don’t end up 
                        seeing Kevin James as the voice of 
                        an animated duck with my 
                        overbearing brother?  But mostly 
                        because if you don’t, I will work, 
                        ceaselessly and without remorse, to 
                        make your life a living hell?

           Bridgette laughs, despite herself.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        You owe me a pack of cigarettes.  

                                 TAYLOR
                        You owe me a week of your life.  
                        Now come on.  

           Taylor grabs Bridgette by the wrist and pulls her from the 
           room.

           INT. MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT

           A romantic comedy plays on screen.  Taylor sits between 
           Bridgette and Nick, holding a bucket of popcorn. 

           Taylor looks at Nick, then at Bridgette, bored.  She throws a 
           piece of popcorn at Bridgette, who ignores it.  Taylor throws 
           another piece - Bridgette swats it, annoyed.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                             (whisper)
                        I will ruin you.  

                                 TAYLOR
                             (whisper)
                        Prove it.  

           Taylor throws another piece of popcorn at Bridgette’s face;  
           Bridgette snaps and RIFLES a Skittle at Taylor, who ducks - 
           and the Skittle hits Nick in the temple.  

                                 NICK
                        Ow!  

           A WOMAN (60’s) in front of Nick turns around, angry.  

                                 WOMAN
                        Shhhhhhh.  
                                 NICK
                        Sorry.  
                             (to the girls, angry)
                        Seriously?  

           A beat.  Taylor turns to Bridgette.  

                                 TAYLOR
                             (whisper, mocking)
                        Seriously?

           Bridgette snickers.  Taylor lobs a piece of popcorn at Nick 
           and it gets stuck in his hair.  The girls collapse, giggling.    

           Nick grabs the bucket of popcorn from Taylor, waving his 
           finger at them.

                                 NICK
                        You're obviously not mature enough 
                        to handle this.  

           The woman turns around again, even angrier. 

                                 WOMAN
                        SHHHHHHHH.  

                                 NICK
                             (flustered)
                        Sorry.  

           Bridgette and Taylor giggle even more.  Nick shoots them a 
           death stare, then looks back at the screen. 

           Taylor takes the lid off of her soft drink and reaches 
           inside.  Bridgette grabs her hand - don’t.  Taylor mocks 
           Nick’s pompous finger wagging.  Bridgette laughs and lets go 
           of Taylor’s hand.

           Taylor pretends to yawn, slips her arm behind Nick and drops 
           a piece of ice down the back of his shirt.  

           Nick jumps up - he's lost it.  

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        I guess I need to take this, too.

           Nick takes Taylor’s soda, but she grabs desperately for it.

                                 TAYLOR
                        Nonononono, I'm really thirsty.

           The angry woman turns to shush Nick again.  
                                 WOMAN
                        SHHHHHHH!!!!

           Nick pulls the soda away from Taylor, but in the struggle the 
           drink slips out of his hands and DRENCHES the angry woman.  
           Nick, Bridgette, and Taylor freeze, guilty.

           EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - NIGHT

           Taylor, Nick, and Bridgette walk down the street.  

                                 NICK
                        Fifteen bucks a ticket and kicked 
                        out in half an hour.  

                                 TAYLOR
                        Don’t forget the forty six dollars 
                        you gave that poor woman.

           Taylor and Bridgette can’t keep themselves from giggling.

                                 NICK
                        Oh, I see.  This is funny now.

                                 TAYLOR
                        Absolutely. 

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        The look on your face...

           Bridgette and Taylor are really laughing now.  Nick shakes 
           his head, trying to stay mad.  

                                 NICK
                        You guys are assholes.  

           They arrive at Bridgette’s building.  

                                 TAYLOR
                        Are we seriously going back home?  
                        It’s like eight thirty.  

                                 NICK
                        You have a better idea?

           Taylor smiles.  

           EXT. BASKETBALL COURT - NIGHT

           Bridgette, Taylor, and Nick walk onto the court.  Taylor 
           dribbles a basketball.
                                 NICK
                        What do you want to play?  

                                 TAYLOR
                        How about a little H-O-R-S-E, five 
                        bucks a letter.

                                 NICK
                        Or we could just play for fun.  I 
                        know, I know - crazy idea.

                                 TAYLOR
                        Somebody's afraid he's gonna lose 
                        again.  I'll flip a coin: heads we 
                        play for money, tails we play for 
                        “fun.” 

           Taylor flips the coin high in the air, catches it, and turns 
           it over on the back of her wrist.  She displays the quarter 
           and smiles.  

                                 TAYLOR (CONT’D)
                        Better get out your wallet.  I'll 
                        shoot first. 

           Taylor grabs the ball and walks away. 

                                 NICK
                        Damn coin hasn't come up tails in 
                        ten years.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        And yet you keep letting her flip 
                        it.  

                                 NICK
                        Some things don’t make sense - but 
                        that doesn’t mean they’re wrong.  

           Nick puts his hand on Bridgette's side.  She can’t keep 
           herself from leaning into him, but she looks past him and 
           sees:

           Taylor arguing with a LARGE MAN with a shaved head, who 
           stands in front of two other men.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Taylor’s in trouble.  

           On Taylor: she’s incensed.  

                                 TAYLOR
                        You’ve got three guys - you don’t 
                        need the whole freaking court. 
           Nick and Bridgette approach; Nick positions himself between 
           Taylor and the man with the shaved head.

                                 NICK
                        What’s going on?

                                 TAYLOR
                        Mr. Clean here says we have to get 
                        off the court.  Like they own it.    

                                 NICK
                        Fine.  We’ll get off.  

                                 TAYLOR
                        Seriously?  You’re gonna let the 
                        douchebags win? 

                                 NICK
                        Taylor, it’s not worth it.  

           Nick pulls Taylor away, but she breaks free.  

                                 TAYLOR
                        You sound just like Dad.  And you 
                        know where that got him?  Ten years 
                        of it’s not worth its?  Sitting at 
                        home, alone, waiting to die.  
                        Sometimes, it’s worth it because 
                        it’s not worth it, because today’s 
                        the day you’re going to take a 
                        stand and tell the hulking, 
                        Paleolithic steroid abusers that 
                        you’re not going to take their 
                        bullshit anymore.  So stop trying 
                        to be the bigger man and pick a 
                        side.  

           Nick looks from Taylor to MR. CLEAN, who sets his jaw: he’s 
           definitely not backing down.  

                                 BRIDGETTE (O.S.)
                        How about we play you for it? 

           Everyone turns to look at Bridgette.

                                 BRIDGETTE (CONT’D)
                        Full court, game to nine.  

                                 MR. CLEAN
                             (laughs)
                        Gladly.   

           Taylor turns to Nick.
                                 TAYLOR
                        Please.

           Taylor looks at Nick imploringly.  Nick hands Mr. Clean the 
           ball.  

                                 NICK
                        Here.
                             (Taylor’s face falls)
                        You pick who shoots for ball. 

           A huge smile breaks across Taylor’s face.  Mr. Clean sneers.

                                 MR. CLEAN
                        The girl.  

           Mr. Clean flips the ball to Taylor, who promptly DRAINS a 
           three-pointer.  

           Nick leans towards Mr. Clean.  

                                 NICK
                        Ooh.  Bad choice. 

           Montage:

           Taylor, Nick, and Bridgette play against the three men:

           Mr. Clean dribbles the ball in the post.  He lowers his 
           shoulder into Taylor, knocking her down, and makes a layup.  
           Nick goes after him, but Bridgette pulls him back.  

           Taylor drives to the hoop but, at the last second, kicks it 
           to Bridgette, who hits a shot from the corner.  They give 
           each other a low five as they run back down the court.  

           Bridgette defends Man #2, but Mr. Clean comes over and knocks 
           her over with an ILLEGAL SCREEN.  Man #2 scores easily, 
           giving Mr. Clean a fist bump on the way back down the court.  

           Nick, pissed, dribbles STRAIGHT AT Mr. Clean.  All three guys 
           CONVERGE on him - only Nick drops the ball behind his back to 
           Taylor, who hits a short jumper.  

                                 MR. CLEAN
                        Pussy.

           Man #3, guarded by Nick, dribbles the ball up the court.

                                 MAN #3
                        Eight-seven, game point.  See if 
                        you can handle these quicks.  
           Man #3 shows off, dribbling between his legs and behind his 
           back, but Taylor sneaks up behind him and pokes the ball 
           away.

           Nick collects the ball and takes it in for a layup.  

                                 TAYLOR
                        Make that eight-eight.  Next point 
                        wins.  

           Mr. Clean grabs the ball and dribbles up the court.

                                 MR. CLEAN
                        Alright little girl, you best get 
                        out of the way if you don’t want to 
                        get hurt.

                                 NICK
                        Let me take him.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        No.  

           Bridgette whispers something to Taylor, who nods.  

           Mr. Clean backs into Taylor.  He bumps her once, twice, and 
           then drops his shoulder and charges into her - but at the 
           last second, Taylor STEPS AWAY.  

           Mr. Clean loses his balance, CRASHING to the ground.  
           Bridgette grabs the ball and runs up court with Taylor on a 
           fast break, two on one against Man #3.  

           Bridgette passes to Taylor, who passes back to Bridgette, who 
           passes to Taylor.  Man #3 falls down, and Taylor passes to 
           Bridgette, who lays the ball in.  Ballgame. 

           On the far side of the court, Mr. Clean berates Man #2. 

                                 TAYLOR
                        Hey, pussies.  

           The men look up.  

                                 TAYLOR (CONT’D)
                        Court’s yours.  

           Taylor tosses them the ball, puts her arms around Bridgette 
           and Nick, and walks off.  
           INT. BRIDGETTE’S APARTMENT, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Bridgette and Nick sit on the couch watching ESPN Classic, 
           which is replaying Michael Jordan’s “Flu Game.”  Taylor lays 
           on the ground, swaddled in blankets.  

           Onscreen, Jordan walks off the court, hugging Scottie Pippen 
           for support.  

                                 MARV ALBERT (TV ANNOUNCER)
                        A classic performance by the flu-
                        ridden Michael Jordan...  

           Nick peeks at Taylor, who is fast asleep.  

                                 NICK
                        She must be exhausted; she loves 
                        Jordan more than anything.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Was she even alive when this game 
                        was played?  

                                 NICK
                        My mom was from Chicago.  

           Bridgette nods, but doesn’t say anything. 

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                             (to Bridgette)
                        Thank you, by the way.   

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        For what?

                                 NICK
                        I can't remember the last time 
                        Taylor and I had fun together.  
                             (leans closer)
                        I know I'm not always easy to deal 
                        with; I need to learn to loosen up.    

           Bridgette finds herself leaning towards Nick, despite 
           herself.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        It’s not all your fault.  She can 
                        be... stubborn.  

                                 NICK
                        Luckily, I don’t give up very 
                        easily.  
           Nick kisses her.  Bridgette closes her eyes, enjoying the 
           kiss; she pulls away and puts her head on Nick’s chest, 
           closing her eyes.  Nick puts his arms around her.  

           Taylor opens her eyes, ever so slightly, to watch them.  She 
           smiles.  

           INT. BRIDGETTE’S OFFICE - NEXT MORNING

           Bridgette searches her desk, looking for something.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Marie.  
                             (Marie enters)
                        Can you help me find where I put 
                        Scott Carlson’s number?  

                                 MARIE
                        Is this it?

           Marie picks up a post-it from the center of Bridgette’s desk, 
           right in front of her. 

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Yes.  Thank you.

                                 MARIE
                        You ok?

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        I just need to get this over with.

           Bridgette picks up the phone and dials.

                                 MARIE
                        You’re cancelling the visit.  
                             (Bridgette nods)
                        Probably the right choice.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        You weren’t so sure the other day.

                                 MARIE
                        You were right.  The risk - it just 
                        isn’t worth it.  

           Marie exits.  The last phrase stays with Bridgette; she 
           hardens.  On the other end of line, an assistant picks up. 

                                 ASSISTANT
                             (phone filter)
                        Scott Carlson’s office.
                                 BRIDGETTE
                        This is Bridgette Nelson from the 
                        Warriors, calling regarding Tyson 
                        King’s visit tomorrow.  

                                 ASSISTANT
                        Let me see if I can get Scott.  

           The phone clicks; Bridgette is on hold.  Bridgette studies at 
           the white board in front of her, covered in Tyson King notes, 
           documenting everything they’ve done to get King.

           The phone clicks again: the assistant is back. 

                                 ASSISTANT (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry, I don't have Scott.  
                        Would you like to leave him a 
                        message that you are cancelling 
                        Tyson’s visit?

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        I never said I was calling to 
                        cancel.  I’m calling to confirm.

           The line clicks again: Bridgette is on hold.  Her eyes 
           tighten.  One more click, and the assistant is back.

                                 ASSISTANT
                        I'm sorry, I must have misheard 
                        you.  I will have Scott call you 
                        back as soon as he returns.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Or I could just talk to him now.  

                                 ASSISTANT
                             (confused)
                        I told you, I don’t have him.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        What’s your name?

                                 ASSISTANT
                        Andrew.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Hi, Andrew.  Let me give you a 
                        little tip about being an 
                        assistant.  When you’re lying about 
                        how your boss isn’t there, never, 
                        ever put someone on hold twice.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 BRIDGETTE (CONT'D)
                        After the first time you fail to 
                        reach him, he is then lost deep in 
                        a bottomless black hole that we 
                        cannot penetrate, despite all the 
                        technological marvels of our modern 
                        world. There is no reason to reach 
                        once more into the abyss - unless, 
                        of course, he is standing two feet 
                        in front of you telling you exactly 
                        what to do.  So I’ll say it one 
                        more time before I come down there, 
                        take the headset off your well-
                        gelled head, and shove it up your 
                        well-gelled ass: I want to speak to 
                        Scott.  Now.  

           A long pause; frantic whispering on the other side.

                                 ASSISTANT
                        He just walked in the door.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Did he?  How fortuitous. 

           Intercut with: 

           INT. SCOTT CARLSON’S OFFICE - DAY

           Scott picks up the phone.  As he talks, he compares two huge, 
           garish watches: which to wear?

                                 SCOTT
                        Bridgette.  How nice to hear from 
                        you.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Likewise.  As I told Andrew, I’m 
                        calling to confirm Tyson’s visit 
                        tomorrow.  

           Scott puts one watch on each wrist: Hmm.  Probably not.

                                 SCOTT
                        I’m afraid Tyson won’t be coming.  

           Bridgette tries to keep her voice steady.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Do you mind if I ask why?

           Scott puts both watches on the same wrist; he raises his 
           eyebrows, and snaps at his assistant, who looks up.  His 
           assistant gives him a thumbs-up.  
                                 SCOTT
                        We decided that it was in his best 
                        interest to sign with Dallas, so we 
                        didn’t want to go through the 
                        hassle of bringing him into town...

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        He lives here.  They showed him on 
                        TV at the Giants game last night.  
                        So why don’t you cut the bullshit 
                        and tell me why he’s cancelling?

           Scott takes off one of the watches, annoyed, and carefully 
           places it back in a velvet-lined box next to six other huge, 
           garish watches.  

                                 SCOTT
                        You really want to know?  Beyond 
                        the fact that your front office is 
                        apparently in chaos, I’m just a 
                        little leery of introducing one of 
                        the most talented players on the 
                        planet to a pill-popping psychopath 
                        who stalks her ex-husband in her 
                        free time.  Is that a good enough 
                        reason for you?

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Yes.  That’s exactly what I wanted.  
                        Thank you.  

           INT. WARRIORS OFFICES - DAY

           Bridgette searches the halls, on a mission.  She finds Nick 
           and walks past him.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        My office.  Now.

           INT. BRIDGETTE’S OFFICE - DAY

           Nick enters Bridgette’s office; she’s waiting for him.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Close the door.
                             (he does)
                        Did you tell him? 

                                 NICK
                        What?
                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Did you tell Kendall about my... 
                        issues?

                                 NICK
                        What are you talking about?  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Carlson just cancelled King’s visit 
                        because he said I was Psycho 
                        McNutsinsane, which means Kendall 
                        told him, which means someone told 
                        Kendall.  So my question is: was it 
                        you?

                                 NICK
                        I can’t believe you’d ask me that.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        That’s not an answer.

                                 NICK
                        No. 

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Why should I believe you?

                                 NICK
                        How about because you know me?  
                        Because I care about you more than 
                        I ever cared about my career, or 
                        because I would quit in half a 
                        second if you asked me to.  Because 
                        this - us - means something to me.  
                        But if you don’t know that by now I 
                        guess I’m wasting my breath.  

           Nick blows past Bridgette and out the door.  Bridgette sits 
           at her desk, rubbing her forehead - then grabs her coat.

           INT. CAFE - DAY

           Bridgette sits at a table, sunglasses on, pretending to work.  
           In reality, she’s watching Michelle, Grant’s girlfriend, try 
           to calm her crying DAUGHTER (10 months).

           Michelle paces, shushing the baby, until she’s only a few 
           feet from Bridgette.  Bridgette stares at the baby’s tiny 
           foot, reaching up to touch it...

                                 MICHELLE
                        What are you looking at?
           Bridgette freezes - only to realize that Michelle is talking 
           to her daughter, who has stopped crying and is staring, 
           entranced, at the bracelet on Bridgette’s wrist.

                                 MICHELLE (CONT’D)
                        Are you looking at the nice lady’s 
                        bracelet?  

           Bridgette, relieved, takes the bracelet off and holds it up; 
           the baby reaches for it, giggling.  

                                 MICHELLE (CONT’D)
                        I’m so sorry to bother you.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Don’t apologize.  She’s perfect.
                             (baby talk)
                        You’re the cutest little girl in 
                        the world.  Yes you are.  

           Bridgette nuzzles the baby’s nose - but the baby reaches up 
           and pulls off Bridgette’s sunglasses.  

                                 BRIDGETTE (CONT’D)
                        Oh, no, we don’t need those.

           Bridgette quickly puts the sunglasses back on, but it’s too 
           late.  Michelle studies her.   

                                 MICHELLE
                        Have we met before?

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        No, I don’t think so.  
                        Unfortunately, I’m late...

           Michelle’s face lights up with recognition, then anger.

                                 MICHELLE
                        You’re Grant’s crazy ex-wife.  Did 
                        you follow us here?  

           Bridgette packs up her laptop; her hands have started to 
           shake.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        You must have me confused...

                                 MICHELLE
                        Don’t play dumb - I know it’s you.   

           Michelle grabs Bridgette’s wrist, and Bridgette momentarily 
           loses her balance.
                                 MICHELLE (CONT’D)
                        Are you drunk?
                             (she sniffs Bridgette - 
                              now she’s really angry)
                        You stay away from us, you hear me?  
                        Stay away from my daughter.

           Taylor enters through the front door.  She takes in the 
           situation and makes her way to Bridgette.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        I would never hurt her.  Everything 
                        I gave up in the divorce - I did it 
                        because I wanted her to have it.  

           The baby reaches for Bridgette’s glasses again.  Bridgette 
           touches her hand, but Michelle pushes her away.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Don’t touch her.

           Bridgette stumbles, but Taylor is there to stabilize her.  

                                 TAYLOR
                             (firm, to Michelle)
                        Hey - back off.  

           Michelle’s daughter starts to cry.  Michelle looks from 
           Bridgette to her daughter, angry, and turns to the door.

                                 MICHELLE
                        Get of a life of your own, and stop 
                        clinging to ours.  It’s pathetic.  

           Michelle leaves.  Every pair of eyes in the room is locked on 
           Bridgette; Taylor puts her arm around her.  

                                 TAYLOR
                        Come on - let’s go home.  

           INT. BRIDGETTE’S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - DAY

           Taylor helps Bridgette into her bedroom, where Bridgette 
           collapses onto the bed - she’s really wasted now.  Taylor 
           pulls off Bridgette’s jacket and shoes.

           Bridgette’s shirt has ridden up; Taylor reaches down to fix 
           it, but stops.  She slides the shirt up an inch to reveal a 
           long, purple scar across Bridgette’s stomach: it’s a C-
           section scar.  

           Taylor stares at it for a moment, then pulls the comforter 
           over Bridgette.  She turns off the light and exits.  
           INT. BRIDGETTE’S APARTMENT, KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Bridgette wanders into the kitchen, rubbing her forehead; 
           Taylor sits at the table.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Where the hell are my pills?

                                 TAYLOR
                        I got rid of those - they aren’t 
                        good for you.  Aspirin?

           Taylor holds up a bottle of aspirin; Bridgette grudgingly 
           holds out her hand, and Taylor gives her two aspirin. 

           Bridgette leaves her hand out, staring at Taylor; Taylor 
           gives her two more.  Bridgette swallows them.  

                                 TAYLOR (CONT’D)
                        How are you feeling?  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Like I got wasted and passed out 
                        before noon.   

                                 TAYLOR
                        It’s still early - we could hit the 
                        clubs.  

           Bridgette laughs. 

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Why not?  It’ll be you, underage, 
                        me, crazy psycho, and Nick, hates 
                        my guts.  Maybe we can invite 
                        Kendall and that scumbag Scott 
                        Carlson, and watch him hump young 
                        women all night...

           Bridgette trails off: she just realized something.  She 
           sniffs herself, recoils, and stands.  

                                 BRIDGETTE (CONT’D)
                        I need to shower. 

                                 TAYLOR
                        You have a hot date?

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        If I’m going clubbing, I can’t 
                        smell like stale booze.

           Bridgette exits.  Taylor follows her, confused.  
                                 TAYLOR
                        You know I was kidding, right?

           INT. NICK’S APARTMENT COMPLEX - NIGHT

           Nick approaches his apartment, only to find Bridgette waiting 
           outside his door, dressed in a sleek black dress with an open 
           back.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        I guess you didn’t get my messages.

                                 NICK
                        I’ve been pretty busy. 

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        That’s ok.  I can try again.

           Bridgette pulls out her cell phone and calls.  Nick’s phone 
           rings, but he doesn’t answer.

                                 BRIDGETTE (CONT’D)
                             (motions to her phone)
                        Voicemail.
                             (beat - leaves a message)
                        Hey, Nick.  I just wanted to let 
                        you know that I’m a colossal 
                        asshole, and I don’t deserve you, 
                        and I’m sorry.  Also, that shirt is 
                        hideous, please never wear it 
                        again.  

           Bridgette hangs up; Nick studies her.

                                 NICK
                        I see what you’re doing.  You come 
                        over here, dressed all sexy, 
                        because you know I can't stay mad 
                        at you when you look like that.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Well?  

           Bridgette kisses him - it’s long, and passionate.  She breaks 
           away, leaving Nick reaching for her, and walks down the hall. 

                                 BRIDGETTE (CONT’D)
                        Come on, we’re late.

                                 NICK
                        What do you have up your sleeve?

           Bridgette holds up her arms. 
                                 BRIDGETTE
                        No sleeves.    

           Nick shakes his head, smiles, and follows her.  

           INT. HARLOT CLUB - NIGHT

           One of the most exclusive nightclubs in San Francisco, filled 
           with beautiful and sweaty people.  Bridgette and Nick sit at 
           a private table overlooking the dance floor.

                                 NICK
                        What if he doesn’t show?

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        He had a meeting with me for a free 
                        breakfast; trust me, he’ll show.

           Scott Carlson walks into view; Bridgette waves him over with 
           a smile, and Scott approaches with trepidation.  

                                 BRIDGETTE (CONT’D)
                        Thanks for coming.

                                 SCOTT
                        Let's be clear: I am here to enjoy 
                        bottle service; you being here is 
                        an annoyance that I’m willing to 
                        overlook.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        But surely as you enjoy your drink, 
                        you wouldn’t mind one last pitch as 
                        to why the Warriors are the best 
                        team for Tyson King.  

                                 SCOTT
                        I would mind, actually.  And if 
                        this is just a bait and switch...

           Scott stands, buttoning his coat.   

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        It’s not. Miss?
                             (she flags down an 
                              especially sexy waitress)
                        Can you get my friend a...

           Bridgette looks at Scott.
                                 SCOTT
                             (begrudgingly)
                        Grey Goose and tonic.  From a 
                        freshly opened bottle.

                                 WAITRESS
                        Absolutely.  

           The waitress smiles and leaves.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Now, unfortunately, I have work 
                        that I need to do, but Nick will 
                        make sure you have everything you 
                        need.  Thanks again.

           Bridgette reaches out to shake Scott’s hand, but he’s 
           distracted by two women who walk past.  Bridgette withdraws 
           her hand.

                                 BRIDGETTE (CONT’D)
                        Nick, will you walk me out?

                                 NICK
                             (confused)
                        Absolutely.  

           Bridgette and Nick walk away from the table. 

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                             (whispers)
                        That’s it?  You’re just giving up? 

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        I need you to stay out with him all 
                        night.  Not midnight, not two AM - 
                        all night.  I booked a suite at the 
                        Ritz so you’ll have a place to 
                        bring the girls.  

           Bridgette hands Nick a hotel key.  

                                 NICK
                        What girls?

           Bridgette nods towards Scott, who has already welcomed two 
           attractive women to their table.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Trust me, there will be girls.  

           Nick realizes what’s going on.  
                                 NICK
                        You didn’t want to talk to Carlson - 
                        this is a setup.  He parties all 
                        night, and you meet King in the 
                        morning without him.  Why didn’t 
                        you tell me?

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Because you’re not a good liar, 
                        Nick - and if this all goes to hell 
                        I need you to be able to tell 
                        Kendall that you didn’t know. 

                                 NICK
                        But this had to cost five grand.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        At some point you realize that the 
                        biggest prizes are worth the 
                        biggest sacrifices. 

                                 NICK
                        I already knew that.

           Nick looks Bridgette in the eye; Bridgette looks away.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        About the girls... if something 
                        happens tonight, I understand.  
                        Whatever it takes.  
                             (Nick nods)
                        Good luck.  

                                 NICK
                        I don’t need luck.  I’m Nick Price.

           Bridgette laughs.  Nick kisses Bridgette softly on the cheek 
           and walks back to the table.  Bridgette watches him go, 
           nervous. 

           INT. BRIDGETTE’S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Bridgette lays in bed, staring at the ceiling.  The clock 
           reads 5 AM.  

           Bridgette hears the front door open, then a CRASH: Nick has 
           run into a table.

                                 NICK (O.S.)
                        Ow!  Shit!

           Bridgette rolls over and pretends to be asleep.
           Nick enters the room, wasted, knocking a picture frame off-
           kilter.  He sits on the side of the bed.  

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        Bridgette.  
                             (Bridgette pretends to be 
                              asleep; he shakes her)
                        Bridgette.  

           Bridgette “wakes up.”

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        You’re back.  How did it go?

                                 NICK
                        Nailed it.  That guy’s such a 
                        hornball we had a dozen skanky 
                        girls at our table until, like, 
                        four AM.  Then we left and went to 
                        the hotel.

           Nick collapses on the bed, face down.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        ...and?

                                 NICK
                        And he had a girl, and I had a 
                        girl, and my girl really wanted to, 
                        you know...
                             (whispers)
                        FUCK.  
                             (back to normal voice)
                        And then when we got back to the 
                        hotel, he went to a bedroom with 
                        his girl, but he dropped his phone 
                        and I poured water on it.  Score!

           Nick closes his eyes.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        What else happened?

                                 NICK
                        What do you think?  He had sex with 
                        the girl and passed out - probably 
                        for like twelve hours.

           Bridgette waits a few moments, but she can’t help herself.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        And what about you?  Did you sleep 
                        with your girl?
           Nick doesn’t respond; he’s asleep.  Bridgette touches his 
           shoulder.

                                 BRIDGETTE (CONT’D)
                        Nick.  

                                 NICK
                        Mmm.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Did you sleep with her?

           Nick turns over, half-asleep.  

                                 NICK
                        Of course not.
                             (Bridgette smiles)
                        I love you.  

           Nick rolls over and falls asleep; Bridgette’s smile vanishes.  

           INT. WARRIORS’ CONFERENCE ROOM - MORNING

           Bridgette paces in the conference room; Marie sits in a 
           chair.  

                                 MARIE
                        Of course he loves you.  You gave 
                        him a free pass to sleep with 
                        another woman and he turned it 
                        down.  They should put that shit on 
                        a Hallmark card.
                             (Bridgette laughs, despite 
                              herself)
                        Wait, did you want him to sleep 
                        with her?

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Of course not.  

                                 MARIE
                        So you want him to be absolutely 
                        devoted to you, to put you on a 
                        pedestal, spend all of his time 
                        with you, be your best friend, and 
                        not see anyone else, but you don't 
                        want him to fall in love with you.   

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        One day you’ll realize that there 
                        are some situations that don’t 
                        require the truth.  
                                 MARIE
                        I hope not.  
                             (Marie’s phone buzzes; she 
                              checks it)
                        He’s here.

           Marie leaves.  Bridgette flips through the presentation one 
           last time, forcing herself to focus.  

           INT. WARRIORS’ OFFICES - DAY

           Marie leads Tyson down the hall to Bridgette; she smiles and 
           shakes his hand.   

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Mr. King, it’s a pleasure. Can I 
                        get you anything? 

                                 TYSON
                        How about my agent?  First he tells 
                        me this meeting is cancelled, then 
                        he sends a limo and won’t answer 
                        his phone.  I won’t talk business 
                        without him.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Then let’s not talk business - 
                        let’s talk basketball. 

           Bridgette opens the door to the conference room.  Tyson 
           hesitates, but enters.  

           INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - LATER

           The mood is different, lighter; the projector is off, and 
           Bridgette and Tyson talk to each other.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        ...I mean, the way you set that 
                        back screen - it was perfect. 

                                 TYSON
                        I think that’s the first time in my 
                        life someone has complimented me on 
                        my screens.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Well, they should start.  But can I 
                        tell you my favorite moment from 
                        that series?  Third quarter of game 
                        four, you’re on the wrong side of a 
                        three on one break...  
                                 TYSON
                        Miller’s coming at me with the 
                        ball, Stevens and Alvarez on the 
                        wings.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Exactly.  So you hang back like 
                        you’re going to concede the layup, 
                        then suddenly you lunge at Miller.  

                                 TYSON
                        He panics, throws a bad pass to 
                        Alvarez...

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        ...who’s so off-balance, he puts up 
                        the weakest excuse for a layup I’ve 
                        ever seen.  And the ball is just 
                        hanging there, waiting for you to 
                        spike it into the fifteenth row - 
                        but you don’t.  You somehow see 
                        your teammate trailing the play...

                                 TYSON
                        Rogers, that lazy prick.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        ...and you deflect the ball towards 
                        him, and suddenly you guys have a 
                        four on two.  Corner three, five 
                        point swing, and their momentum is 
                        completely crushed.  That was the 
                        moment you won the series.  

                                 TYSON
                        I got lucky. 

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        No.  You understand the game, 
                        better than most coaches.  Which is 
                        why I can’t see you going to play 
                        in Dallas, on some glorified all-
                        ego team.  

           Tyson opens his mouth to answer, but the door swings open to 
           reveal Scott Carlson and John.    

                                 TYSON
                        Scott, where have you been?  

                                 SCOTT
                        This woman detained me against my 
                        will so she would have the 
                        opportunity to talk to you.  
           Tyson looks back to Bridgette, questioning.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Last night I met Scott at a club, 
                        bought him a drink, and then left.  
                             (she sniffs him)
                        After which he apparently became 
                        very drunk and left with a woman 
                        who was wearing copious amounts of 
                        lavender-peach perfume.  

                                 TYSON
                        Sounds like you detained yourself, 
                        Scotty.  

           Scott’s flustered, but regroups.

                                 SCOTT
                        Doesn’t matter.  What matters is 
                        that I clearly explained to Miss 
                        Nelson that Tyson was no longer 
                        interested in signing with the 
                        Warriors, and instead of abiding by 
                        my wishes, she conspired to meet 
                        with him without me present.

                                 JOHN
                        Bridgette, is that what happened?

           Bridgette hesitates.  Scott smiles and turns to John. 

                                 SCOTT
                        My agency doesn’t just represent 
                        Tyson King.  And I can personally 
                        guarantee that the Warriors will 
                        not sign a single one of our 
                        clients as long as Miss Nelson is 
                        employed here.

                                 JOHN
                        That’s not something you’ll have to 
                        worry about.  Bridgette, my office. 

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        John...

                                 JOHN
                        I’d prefer to do this in private.  

           Bridgette looks at John, then dutifully picks up her things 
           and walks to the door - where she stops.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        St. John's Prep Academy.  
                                 TYSON
                        I'm sorry?  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Your freshman year of high school, 
                        you were recruited by St. John's 
                        Prep Academy.  They’ve produced 
                        five NBA players and had won the 
                        last two state titles.  They were a 
                        dynasty.

                                 TYSON
                        So?

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        So you didn’t go there.  You stayed 
                        at South Covington, with your 
                        friends, and you beat St. John's 
                        for the title.  

                                 TYSON
                        St. John's was too far from my 
                        family.    

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        And two years later, when your 
                        family moved to Modesto, you decide 
                        to stay at Covington?  
                             (Tyson is silent)
                        No, you turned down St. John’s 
                        because you didn't want to play on 
                        some superteam; you wanted to play 
                        with your guys, the right way.  You 
                        could see it on film, even back 
                        then: the way you directed 
                        rotations on defense, or kept your 
                        man from getting the ball in his 
                        favorite spot, or intentionally set 
                        up a cold-shooting teammate for an 
                        easy layup.  You love basketball 
                        more than anyone I’ve ever met.  So 
                        the question is if you’re still 
                        that kid who loves the game - or if 
                        you’ve become a man who’s decided 
                        he’d rather play for St. John’s 
                        Prep Academy.  

                                 SCOTT
                        That’s enough.  Tyson, let’s go.  

           Tyson stares at Bridgette for a long beat.
                                 TYSON
                        Wait.  
                             (everyone stops)
                        I want to talk. 

                                 JOHN
                        Absolutely.  Just let me call Mr. 
                        Morgan...

                                 TYSON
                        No.  I want to talk to her.  

           Tyson points to Bridgette; a wide smile breaks across her 
           face. 

           INT. WARRIORS OFFICES - DAY

           Bridgette and Marie walk down the hall, excited.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Did that just happen?  Tell me that 
                        happened.  

                                 MARIE
                        Oh, it happened.  

           They round a corner towards Bridgette’s office - only to come 
           face to face with Bridgette’s ex-husband, Grant, and his 
           lawyer, Clark.  

           INT. BRIDGETTE’S OFFICE - DAY

           Bridgette and Marie sit across Bridgette’s desk from Grant 
           and Clark.  

                                 CLARK
                        In the interest of safety, we are 
                        strongly tempted to go to the 
                        police.  At the same time, for 
                        personal reasons Mr. Hester would 
                        prefer to be lenient.

                                 MARIE
                        If you’re here to renegotiate, I’d 
                        prefer to skip the monologue and 
                        get right to the number.  

                                 CLARK
                        Seventy five percent of their 
                        shared assets.
           A beat.  Bridgette stares at Grant, who shifts in his chair, 
           uncomfortable.  

                                 MARIE
                        Wow - that is lenient.  I mean, if 
                        your client really feels like his 
                        family’s life is in danger, it’s 
                        good to know the price he’s willing 
                        to put on their safety.

                                 CLARK
                        This is not when you’re allowed to 
                        be holier than thou.  You should be 
                        thanking me...

                                 MARIE
                        Do you even listen to the words 
                        that come out of your mouth?  
                        You’re like a brainless hyena...

                                 BRIDGETTE
                             (bangs her fist on the 
                              table)
                        STOP.  
                             (everyone stops; she nods 
                              towards Grant)
                        I’m not sitting here for another 
                        minute until he says something.

           Marie and Clark turn to look at Grant; he clears his throat.

                                 GRANT
                        What do you want to know?

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        When did it happen?  When did I 
                        stop being enough?

                                 GRANT
                        You were always enough - but the 
                        real you checked out years ago.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        And it was easier to buy a new car 
                        than fix the one that’s totaled.

                                 GRANT
                        I’m sorry. 

           Bridgette takes a deep breath; that meant something to her.  
                                 BRIDGETTE
                        So, what do you want?  I mean 
                        really want, not what this toad is 
                        whispering in your ear.  

                                 GRANT
                        I want to start over, clean slate.  
                        No more surprise visits.  Ever.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Then here’s the deal.  We split 
                        everything, fifty-fifty - but if I 
                        ever bother you again, you get it 
                        all.  That’s my promise that you 
                        will never see me again.

                                                          CLARK
                           MARIE
                 (to Bridgette)
                                                (to Grant)
           It’s too big a risk...
                                              That’s a ridiculous offer...

                                 GRANT
                        Deal.  

           Bridgette and Grant stand and shake hands.

                                 GRANT (CONT’D)
                        So that’s it? 

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Goodbye, Grant.  

           Clark reluctantly follows Grant to the door; Grant pauses.

                                 GRANT
                        You’re not totalled, B.  Not even 
                        close.  

           With that, they leave.  Bridgette drops her head, exhausted.

           INT. BRIDGETTE’S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - DAY

           Nick wakes up to find Bridgette sitting on the side of the 
           bed.  He groans, hung over; Bridgette hands him a cup and 
           some pills.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Take these.  You’ll feel better.

           Nick sits up and takes the pills - and then remembers.  

                                 NICK
                        Wait, what happened?  Did it work?  
                        Did we get him?
                                 BRIDGETTE
                        As of two hours ago, Tyson King is 
                        officially a Warrior.   

                                 NICK
                        Are you serious?  Bridgette, that's 
                        amazing; I can’t believe you pulled 
                        this off. 

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        We pulled it off.  I couldn’t have 
                        done it without you.    

                                 NICK
                        Well, obviously.  So what are 
                        waiting for?  Let’s celebrate.

           Bridgette smiles, but it’s forced.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        First, we should talk.  About how 
                        you told me that you loved me last 
                        night.  

           Nick’s face falls; he looks away.

                                 NICK
                        What do you want me to say?

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Did you mean it?  

                                 NICK
                        Yes.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Then we definitely shouldn't see 
                        each other anymore.  

                                 NICK
                        Why?  Because then you'll have to 
                        admit that you love me too?  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        This was never going to work, Nick.  
                        Our lives... they don’t match up. 

                                 NICK
                        You're scared.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Maybe.  But that doesn't mean I'm 
                        wrong.  
                                 NICK
                        Tell me you don't love me.  

           Bridgette looks Nick straight in the eye.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        I don't love you.  

           Nick searches her eyes; in his, his heart breaks.

           Bridgette kisses Nick on the cheek and walks out the door - 
           running straight to Taylor, who’s been eavesdropping.  

                                 BRIDGETTE (CONT’D)
                        How long have you been listening?

                                 TAYLOR
                        Long enough.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Then I guess you’re all filled in.

           Bridgette walks past her.

                                 TAYLOR
                        Why did you do that?

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        I need to start over, on my own 
                        terms.

                                 TAYLOR
                        You're such a hypocrite, you know 
                        that?  You pretend to be this 
                        strong, independent woman, but when 
                        things get tough you just quit.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Then I guess it's better if you're 
                        not around me anymore.  Maybe you 
                        can find a better role model.  

           Bridgette walks to the front door.   

                                 TAYLOR
                        I saw your scar.  It's from a C-
                        section, right? 
                             (Bridgette stops)
                        That’s why you’ve been watching 
                        Grant.  Watching the baby.
                             (Bridgette still doesn’t 
                              respond)
                                 (MORE)
                                 TAYLOR (CONT'D)
                        You try to project this image like 
                        you’re invincible, like you don’t 
                        need anybody.  But you do.  You’re 
                        just like the rest of us, even if 
                        you don’t want to admit it. 

           Bridgette turns.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        I know you think you need me, but I 
                        can’t make the pain go away.  Your 
                        Mom is gone, and that hole inside 
                        you is going to be there forever.  
                        Until you accept that, you will 
                        always be a child.
                             (tears well in Taylor’s 
                              eyes)
                        Go home, Taylor.

           Bridgette opens the door.  

                                 TAYLOR
                        I guess I'm not the only one who 
                        knows how to hurt people.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        I guess not.  

           Bridgette walks out the door, leaving Taylor alone.  

           As Bridgette walks away, a tear traces down her face, and 
           then another, until they are coming too fast for her to wipe 
           away.

           In her bedroom, Taylor curls up into a ball on her bed, 
           clutching a pillow tightly to her chest.  The tears come now, 
           accelerating into big, choking sobs.  It's over.  

                                                              FADE OUT.

           FADE IN ON:

           INT. PRESS CONFERENCE - DAY

           Tyson King’s introductory press conference teems with fans, 
           reporters and photographers, who fight for position like 
           salmon swimming upstream.

           Tyson sits at the table onstage, flanked by John, Mr. Morgan, 
           and Bridgette; Tyson pulls on a Warriors hat and is bathed in 
           the light of a thousand flashbulbs.  
           From the edge of the room, Nick watches Bridgette; he smiles 
           as she answers a reporter’s question in a way that causes the 
           crowd to laugh.  

           Nick’s smile fades and he exits through the back of the room.

           INT. GENERAL MANAGER’S OFFICE - DAY

           John leads Bridgette into a spacious office with large 
           windows.  She takes it in, slowly; John watches her.

                                 JOHN
                        Not too shabby, huh?  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Not at all.  You sure you want to 
                        leave it behind?

                                 JOHN
                        The more you move up, the more you 
                        have to let go.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Is that true of friendships, too?

                                 JOHN
                        I’m just a few floors away.  
                        Anything you need, don’t hesitate.
                             (Bridgette nods)
                        I’ll leave you to it.

           John turns to leave.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        There is one thing.
                             (John stops)
                        This Kendall situation.

                                 JOHN
                        What about it?

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        When he told Carlson I was crazy, 
                        he didn’t just betray me - he 
                        betrayed the whole organization.  
                        How am I supposed to work with 
                        someone like that?

                                 JOHN
                        You're the boss now.  You won.  You 
                        have to let the old grudges go.  

           Bridgette nods.  
                                 BRIDGETTE
                        You’re right.  Especially since I’m 
                        not even sure that it was him.  
                        After all, when Carlson needed to 
                        stop me from meeting with Tyson, he 
                        didn’t call Kendall.  He called 
                        you.  

           Bridgette turns to John.  He meets her eye; suddenly his 
           persona has hardened.

                                 JOHN
                        Be careful, Bridg.  Just because 
                        you won one battle doesn’t mean you 
                        don’t still need allies.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        The kind of ally that smiles to 
                        your face while conspiring behind 
                        your back?  Like how you told me I 
                        could recruit King ‘in secret.’  Or 
                        how you convinced Morgan to try to 
                        sign Jackson early, just to be 
                        sure.  And then, when I got too 
                        close, you called Carlson and told 
                        him that I was damaged goods.

                                 JOHN
                             (snaps)
                        Well, aren’t you?

           Bridgette takes a deep breath, but never takes her eyes off 
           John.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Was it worth it?  Betraying one of 
                        your friends... for what?

                                 JOHN
                        It’s easy for you to judge; you 
                        can’t imagine anything better than 
                        this job.  Well, I’ve been stuck in 
                        it for eight years.  I didn’t get 
                        into this business to baby sit a 
                        basketball team; I came here to run 
                        a corporation.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        And when you got wind of the 
                        harassment lawsuit, you knew this 
                        was your chance.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 BRIDGETTE (CONT'D)
                        All you had to do was sign a 
                        superstar - sign Jackson, who 
                        wanted to be here - and Mr. 
                        Marshall would move you up to your 
                        rightful place as CEO.

                                 JOHN
                        But you wouldn’t stop talking about 
                        King, and Jackson was going to sign 
                        with Chicago.  We were going to get 
                        dicked - so I did what I had to do. 

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Makes sense.  
                             (beat)
                        Of course, I’m not sure Mr. Morgan 
                        would be as understanding.  

           John laughs mirthlessly.

                                 JOHN
                        Is that a threat?  Because if I go 
                        down, I’m taking you with me.   

                                 BRIDGETTE
                             (shrugs)
                        I’m crazy, remember? 
                             (takes a step towards 
                              John)
                        I’m only going to say this once: if 
                        you ever cross me again - if you so 
                        much as contradict me on a 
                        conference call - so help me God 
                        I’ll burn this whole place down 
                        with us in it.  
                             (she stares John down; he 
                              looks away)
                        Now, if you don’t mind, I have some 
                        work to do.  

           John studies her; he walks to the door.

                                 JOHN
                        I wanted to pick you, but I didn’t 
                        know if you could handle the 
                        pressure.  You can’t do it on your 
                        own forever, Bridg.  And I don’t 
                        want to have to watch you fall 
                        apart again.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        If you have a message for me, you 
                        can leave it with my assistant.  
           Bridgette doesn’t look up.  John drops his head and leaves.  

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL GYM, BASKETBALL TRYOUTS - NIGHT

           Taylor runs drills alongside thirty other girls.

           1) CONDITIONING

           Fifteen girls sprint across the court.  A male COACH (55) 
           stands to one side with a whistle.  Coach looks at his watch.  

                                 COACH
                        Looks like nobody read my offseason 
                        conditioning e-mails.  

           The girls, exhausted, slam into the wall.  The next set of 
           girls, including TAYLOR - sweaty, intense, nervous - waits on 
           the baseline.  

                                 COACH (CONT’D)
                        Next group: ready...

           Coach blows the WHISTLE and the girls take off.  Taylor runs 
           hard, near the front of the pack.

                                 COACH (CONT’D)
                        Come on, come on - you’re lagging.  

           One by one, the girls fall away.  Taylor finishes first, 
           beating the nearest girl by almost half the court.  

                                 COACH (CONT’D)
                        Price wins again.  I’m getting 
                        tired of this, ladies.  Same group - 
                        you’re up.  

           Taylor smiles to herself; two girls nearby glare at her and 
           whisper to each other.  

           The coach blows his WHISTLE and the two girls BUMP Taylor.  
           She stumbles and falls behind, but catches up, giving the 
           other girls a dirty look.  

           2) SHOOTING DRILL

           Taylor runs laterally across the court, receiving passes from 
           other girls and shooting. 

           Taylor swishes the first shot.  Then another.  Then another.  
           She’s feeling it.  

           The next pass comes in way behind Taylor; she reaches back to 
           catch it, but still hits the shot.  
           The next pass is too low; she’s thrown off balance, and 
           misses.  The next goes over her head; she chases it down, but 
           misses again.  Now she’s shaken.  

           Another pass nearly takes her head off, and she airballs the 
           shot.  The drill is over; Coach writes on his clipboard.

                                 COACH (CONT’D)
                        Price, four for seven.  

           Taylor looks at the girls who passed to her, but nobody will 
           meet her gaze.

           3) SCRIMMAGE 

           Five-on-five, full court scrimmage.  

           A missed shot bounces off the rim; Taylor grabs the rebound 
           and dribbles over half court.  Two defenders stand between 
           her and the basket.  

           Taylor crosses over to her left and drives HARD to the hoop, 
           drawing two defenders, then passes the ball to a teammate, 
           who shoots - SWISH.  

           Taylor puts her hand out for a high-five on the way back down 
           the court, but the girl who made the shot ignores her.  

           The opposing point guard, KARA MCKENDRICK, dribbles the ball 
           up the court; Taylor plays tough defense, pressuring her, and 
           STEALS the ball.  

           Taylor drives toward the basket for an uncontested layup when 
           - SLAM! - Kara body-checks her from behind, sending her 
           careening into the wall. 

           Taylor stands up and gets in Kara’s face, pushing her.

                                 TAYLOR
                        What the hell was that?

           Suddenly, Taylor is fighting five girls.  It’s a brawl, and 
           Taylor is getting the worst of it: scratching and punching 
           and hair-pulling.  

                                 COACH
                        That’s enough!  Break it up!  

           Coach grabs Taylor and Kara.  

                                 COACH (CONT’D)
                        Price, McKendrick - you’re done for 
                        the day. 
                                 TAYLOR
                        But Coach...

                                 COACH
                        I said you’re done.  

           Coach nods toward the door; Taylor spikes the ball against 
           the wall and walks off, trying to hide the tears in her eyes.

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL, HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Taylor waits, still in the clothes she wore to the tryout.  
           The locker room door opens and Coach walks out. 

                                 TAYLOR
                        Hey, Coach.

                                 COACH
                        Taylor, I can’t talk to you about 
                        tryouts.  

                                 TAYLOR
                        I know.  

           Coach walks past her; Taylor follows. 

                                 COACH
                        Then why are you following me?

                                 TAYLOR
                        I wanted to apologize.   
                             (Coach stops)
                        I lost my cool and I embarrassed 
                        myself, and the team.  

           Coach studies her.  

                                 COACH
                        And why did you lose your cool?

                                 TAYLOR
                        Because those girls were being 
                        bitches.
                             (catches herself)
                        I’m sorry - I’m not making excuses, 
                        and I know it sounds crazy, but the 
                        girls were messing with me the 
                        whole time...

                                 COACH
                        It’s not crazy.  I saw it.  
                                 TAYLOR
                             (hopeful)
                        You did? 
                             (then, angry)
                        Then why didn’t you stop them?

                                 COACH
                        I’m not gonna sugarcoat this, 
                        Taylor: every girl on this team 
                        hates you.  And I can protect you 
                        maybe forty percent of the time, 
                        but otherwise you’re gonna be a 
                        sheep among wolves.  I wanted to 
                        see how you would handle that.  

                                 TAYLOR
                        How’d I do?  

           Coach hesitates, but sees her smile and realizes that she’s 
           messing with him.  He laughs.  

                                 TAYLOR (CONT’D)
                        I screwed up, and I’m sorry.  But 
                        I’ve changed, and I want to be a 
                        part of this team.  And you and I 
                        both know that I was the best girl 
                        on the court today. 

           Coach pauses, weighing his words.

                                 COACH
                        I’ve been doing this for fifteen 
                        years, and you are by far the most 
                        difficult player I’ve ever had to 
                        coach.  It wasn’t just that I could 
                        count your passes on one hand - it 
                        was that you sent a different 
                        teammate home crying almost every 
                        night.  And when they turned on 
                        you, I couldn’t do anything about 
                        it.  Do you know how it feels, as a 
                        coach, to have absolutely no 
                        control?
                             (Taylor is silent)
                        After I kicked you off the team, we 
                        won eight games in a row.  Eight.  
                        Just like that, we were a team 
                        again.  If I take you back this 
                        year, what does that say to them? 

                                 TAYLOR
                        Maybe that you believe in second 
                        chances.
           Coach shakes his head.  

                                 COACH
                        Let the wounds heal.  Next year, we 
                        can talk.

           Coach walks away.  Taylor watches him go, desperate.

                                 TAYLOR
                        I won’t shoot.  
                             (Coach stops)
                        The whole year, I promise.  

                                 COACH
                        So you’re assuming you’d get to 
                        play?

                                 TAYLOR
                        No.  I’ll sit at the end of the 
                        bench, and I’ll never ask to go in.  
                        I just want to be a part of the 
                        team.  Please.

           Coach studies her for a long moment.

                                 COACH
                        Not a single shot?

                                 TAYLOR
                        Not one.    

           Coach flips through the papers on his clipboard.  

                                 COACH
                        I’m sorry, Taylor.  
                             (her shoulders slump)
                        Says here you want jersey twenty 
                        three.  Jenny Summers wears twenty 
                        three.  You’re gonna have to find a 
                        new number.

           Taylor throws her arms around Coach’s neck. 

                                 TAYLOR
                        Thank you!  Thank you so much!  

                                 COACH
                        Now you’re gonna get me in trouble.  
                        Go home before I change my mind.  

           Taylor runs off. 

                                 TAYLOR
                        You won’t regret it!
           Coach watches her go, laughing to himself.    

           INT. WARRIORS OFFICES - DAY

           Bridgette hurries down the hallway, reading from her phone.  
           As she rounds the corner, she hears a GIGGLE and glances into 
           the mail room - and freezes.   

           Nick and a pretty, young WOMAN are flirting over the copy 
           machine, each trying to keep the other from making copies.

           Bridgette spies on them, her anger growing.

           INT. WARRIORS OFFICES - DAY

           Nick walks down the hall, still flirting with the woman.  
           They part ways, and he enters the elevator.

           The doors close, but at the last moment an ARM stops them.  
           Bridgette steps into the elevator.  

           Nick doesn’t say anything.  An awkward beat. 

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        I saw you talking to Courtney.  
                        She’s pretty. 
                             (Nick is silent)
                        After you’re done with her, there’s 
                        a cute new girl in finance - I 
                        think her name is Erin... 

           Nick pulls the emergency stop.  The elevator SHUDDERS to a 
           halt.  

                                 BRIDGETTE (CONT’D)
                             (re: emergency stop)
                        I thought we decided that was a bad 
                        idea.  

                                 NICK
                        How often do you think about me?

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        I’m sorry?

                                 NICK
                        In a given day, how often do I pop 
                        into your head?

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        I don’t know...
                                 NICK
                        There’s not a single hour that goes 
                        by that something doesn’t remind me 
                        of you.  When I’m ordering 
                        breakfast, or giving a 
                        presentation, or talking to a girl 
                        at a bar.  You’re like the world’s 
                        worst commercial jingle that has 
                        wormed its way into every corner of 
                        my mind.  And that’s not counting 
                        the times I have to actually see 
                        you, a constant physical reminder 
                        of the fact that you don’t want me 
                        the way that I want you.  Do you 
                        have any idea what that’s like?  To 
                        be tormented by the one thing you 
                        want more than anything else, every 
                        day of your life?
                             (Bridgette is silent)
                        Of course you don’t.  Because you 
                        feel nothing.  

           Nick pushes the emergency stop and the elevator lurches into 
           motion.  The doors open with a DING!  

                                 NICK (CONT’D)
                        Never talk to me about another 
                        woman again.  

           Nick walks away, leaving Bridgette alone.  

           EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - NIGHT

           Nick walks down the street.  His phone rings; he looks at it, 
           smiles, and answers.  

                                 NICK
                        If you’re calling because you need 
                        bail money, keep in mind that I’m 
                        broke.

           INT. TAYLOR’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Taylor rolls her eyes, laying on her bed.

                                 TAYLOR
                        You’re hilarious.  

                                 NICK
                        Thank you.  How’s school?
                                 TAYLOR
                        Ugh.  

                                 NICK
                        Basketball?

                                 TAYLOR
                        The other girls and I have stopped 
                        spitting in each other’s Gatorades.

                                 NICK
                        That’s my girl!

                                 TAYLOR
                        What about you?

                                 NICK
                        Well, we won yesterday, so 
                        according to the media we’re the 
                        best team in the world.  Of course, 
                        if we lose tonight we’ll be the 
                        worst, but you gotta live in the 
                        moment.  

           A long beat.  Taylor hesitates.

                                 TAYLOR
                        And how’s Bridgette?

                                 NICK
                        Taylor...

                                 TAYLOR
                        I know, I know, it’s over between 
                        you two.  I just want to know if 
                        she’s ok.  

           Nick pauses.  

                                 NICK
                        Yeah, I think she’s doing better.

                                 TAYLOR

                                 TAYLOR
                        Call me Champ again and I’ll break 
                        your face.  Later later.

                                 NICK

           Nick laughs.

           INT. BRIDGETTE'S APARTMENT, BATHROOM - LATE NIGHT 

           Bridgette enters the bathroom, holding a glass of brown 
           alcohol and smoking a cigarette.  She pulls out a pill bottle 
           from behind the mirror and dumps a few pills into her palm.  

           A POLICE SIREN - nearby, must be on her block - startles 
           Bridgette, and she drops the pills, which clatter down the 
           drain.  

           Bridgette looks at the window, angry, and catches sight of 
           the Golden Gate Bridge, reflected in the waters of the bay.   

           Bridgette stares at the bridge for a moment, then looks at 
           herself in the mirror, the cigarette, the liquor.  She snaps, 
           dumping the whole bottle of pills down the sink. 

           She smiles: that felt good.  

           MONTAGE:

           Bridgette dumps a full pack of cigarettes in the sink.  And 
           another.  And another.  

           Bridgette opens pill bottles, one after another, pouring them 
           on top of the pile of cigarettes.  

           Bridgette enters the bathroom with a bottle of whiskey.  

           A bottle of gin.

           Two bottles of wine.  

           Each goes down the sink, staining the cigarettes and pills 
           into a sopping, coagulated mass.  

           Bridgette pours the last bottle into the sink and drops it in 
           the trash.  She falls back against the wall, still, feeling a 
           sense of accomplishment.
           And then her fingers start to tap against the wall, restless.  
           Bridgette looks out the window: what now?  

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - NIGHT

           The stands are filled with fans; Taylor lines up on the court 
           with the rest of her team.  

                                 ANNOUNCER
                        Welcome to our final Falcons game 
                        of the regular season.  Please give 
                        it up for our seniors!  Each girl 
                        has a special gift for her parents 
                        in appreciation of their love and 
                        support.
                             (reading from a list)
                        Kara McKendrick, Heather Dewers...

           As the announcer calls each name, the girl steps forward and 
           brings a rose to her mother.  Taylor, standing with the team, 
           watches each mother-daughter embrace. 

           Nick, sitting next to their DAD, catches Taylor’s eye.  
           Taylor gives them a small wave, but she can’t keep herself 
           from searching the crowd for Bridgette.

           MONTAGE: 

           The referee throws the ball in the air; Taylor’s team 
           controls the tip, and the game is underway.  

           Taylor stands up from the bench, yelling support to her team.  

           Taylor’s in the game.  She plays aggressive defense, denying 
           a pass and knocking it to a teammate.  

           Nick and his Dad watch, on the edge of their seats; a call 
           goes against Taylor’s team, and they both react, booing.

           Taylor dribbles the ball; her teammate sets a pick on her 
           defender, then rolls to the basket.  Taylor delivers a 
           perfect bounce pass for an easy layup.

           Taylor gets a pass at the three point line: she’s wide open.  
           She hesitates, then passes to a teammate, who misses a jump 
           shot.  

           During a time out, Taylor wipes her forehead with a towel and 
           catches sight of Bridgette in the corner of the gym.  Taylor 
           freezes, then walks back onto the court.
           Taylor plays with wild abandon.  She’s trying too hard, 
           pressing.  She tries for a steal, but instead commits a hard 
           foul, knocking another player to the ground.  

           Two opponents trap Taylor in the corner; she uses a nifty 
           behind-the back dribble to escape, but a defender lunges for 
           the ball and knocks Taylor headfirst into her own bench.  

           Bridgette jumps up, worried.  Coach pulls Taylor back up: 
           “Are you ok?”  She nods and goes back on the court.  

           Taylor, on the bench, cheers for her team, but she can’t help 
           looking over her shoulder at Bridgette. 

           END MONTAGE

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - NIGHT

           Taylor glances up at the scoreboard from the bench, worried: 
           her team is down 55-42 with 2:52 left.  

           The other team in-bounds the ball.  Taylor’s coach stands and 
           screams.

                                 COACH
                        Press!  Press!  

           One of Taylor’s teammates lunges for the ball, but fouls the 
           ball-handler.  The ref blows his WHISTLE.  

                                 ANNOUNCER
                        And that’s the fifth foul on number 
                        sixteen, Heather Dewers; she has 
                        fouled out.  

           Coach turns to Taylor.  

                                 COACH
                        Taylor - you’re in.  

                                 TAYLOR
                        But Leslie’s a senior...

                                 COACH
                        We’re down by thirteen points.  We 
                        don’t need a senior - we need you 
                        to start shooting the damn ball.  

           Taylor hesitates, but her teammate, KARA - the same girl that 
           she fought at tryouts - pulls her aside.  
                                 KARA
                        You can do this, Tay.  We believe 
                        in you.  

           Her teammates pat Taylor on the shoulders, encouraging her; 
           Taylor looks over her shoulder and locks eyes with Bridgette, 
           then walks onto the court.    

           The ref blows the WHISTLE and the other team in-bounds the 
           ball, passing it around the perimeter - but Taylor jumps in 
           front of one of the passes and STEALS it.  

           Taylor dribbles up the court, does a spin move, and lays the 
           ball in.  The crowd goes CRAZY.

           Taylor makes a variety of shots, including:

           A fadeaway jumper on the right baseline.
           A gorgeous reverse layup.
           A jumper after a crossover leaves her defender on the ground.
           A deep, straightaway three-pointer. 

           Bridgette can’t help herself; she jumps to her feet.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Go, Taylor!

           Nick sees Bridgette for the first time.  He says something to 
           his Dad. 

           Taylor’s team is down 60-58 with :36 left.  The team huddles 
           around Coach.

                                 COACH
                        Don’t worry about the score - just 
                        play good basketball.  Let them get 
                        tight.  Because no matter what 
                        happens, when we walk off this 
                        floor, we’re a team.  Falcons on 
                        three: one, two, three:

                                 TEAM      
                        FALCONS!

           The other team dribbles down court.  Taylor guards the ball-
           handler, who tries to back her down, but Taylor successfully 
           keeps her away from the basket.  

           The girl Taylor is defending shoots a fadeaway jump shot - 
           and MISSES.  Taylor’s teammate gets the rebound and passes it 
           to Taylor.  

           Taylor dribbles down court.  
           Bridgette stands, cheering.  Nick can barely watch.  

           Taylor looks up: thirteen seconds left.  She dribbles over 
           half court. An opponent LUNGES for a steal; Taylor shields 
           the ball, pivoting away.  

                Ten seconds left.  

           Another defender attacks Taylor; she does a crossover to her 
           left and the girl falls down. 

                Seven seconds left. 

           Three defenders remain between Taylor and the basket.  She 
           charges at the first, then spins past her.  Two defenders 
           left, waiting at the rim.

                Five seconds left.

           Taylor drives straight to the hoop and JUMPS, hanging in the 
           air.

                Three seconds left.

           Bridgette pulls the ball back - but instead of shooting, she 
           fires a PASS to: 

           Kara, who is absolutely wide open in the right corner.  The 
           pass hits Kara perfectly, right in the hands.

                Two seconds left. 

           Kara rises and SHOOTS.

                Zero seconds left.  BUZZER.

           Everything stops.  Bridgette, Nick, Coach, the girls on the 
           bench, the crowd, Kara, Taylor - all watch as the ball arcs 
           towards the hoop and 

           SWISH.  61-60.  Falcons win.  

           Mayhem.  Kara holds her follow through until she is MOBBED by 
           teammates, a huge crushing ball of exhilaration.  The crowd 
           goes crazy, rushing the court. 

           Taylor celebrates until she sees Bridgette exit through a 
           side door.  Taylor pushes through the crowd to follow her.  

           INT. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY, CONTINUOUS - NIGHT

           Taylor enters the hallway, looking each way for Bridgette 
           amidst the stream of fans filing out.  
           Hands reach out to pat her back, but she ignores them, 
           pushing through the crowd and out the double doors at the end 
           of the hall.  

           EXT. HIGH SCHOOL - CONTINUOUS

           Taylor exits into the cold, night air.  Snow flurries fall 
           around her.  She looks left, then walks right, searching.  
           She turns a corner and stops. 

           Bridgette sits against the wall of the school.  Taylor 
           doesn’t say anything; she slides down the wall next to 
           Bridgette, still wearing her basketball jersey and shorts.  

           Bridgette takes off her coat and slides it around Taylor's 
           shoulders.  Taylor shrugs it off, but Bridgette pulls it 
           around Taylor again, tighter; Taylor lets it stay.  

           They sit, watching the flurries.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        It was an emergency C-section. 

           A long moment.   

                                 BRIDGETTE (CONT’D)
                        The moment I woke up, I felt... 
                        wrong.  Like my entire body was 
                        revolting.  Grant tried to reassure 
                        me, said it was morning sickness, 
                        but I knew.  By the time we made it 
                        to the hospital...
                             (long beat)
                        The ironic part was I wasn't even 
                        going to keep it.  Her.  We were so 
                        young - just getting started.  So I 
                        made an appointment at the clinic, 
                        but I forgot to go.  I forgot twice 
                        more before I could admit to myself 
                        that I wasn’t forgetting.  

           The jacket has slipped off one of Taylor's shoulders; 
           Bridgette pulls it back up.  Taylor pushes her hand away: 
           stop fussing with me.  

                                 BRIDGETTE (CONT’D)
                        After it happened, we decided it 
                        wasn't meant to be, that we should 
                        focus on our careers for awhile.  
                        We never talked about it.  We 
                        didn’t talk at all, eventually.  
                        When he left, I wasn't even mad.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 BRIDGETTE (CONT’D)
                        It was like when your college 
                        roommate says she’s going to live 
                        at her sorority house - just a 
                        matter of calling the movers and 
                        deciding who bought the toaster. 

           They sit for a few more seconds.  Bridgette takes a deep 
           breath and gathers herself, standing.  

                                 BRIDGETTE (CONT’D)
                        I should get going.

                                 TAYLOR
                        Why?
                             (Taylor looks up at her)
                        Why not stay?  Why drive all the 
                        way out here to watch me play, just 
                        to turn around and leave?  

           Taylor looks Bridgette in the eye - but Bridgette looks away.  

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Because every time I look at you, I 
                        see her.  And in that brief, 
                        shining moment, I pretend that 
                        she’s grown up into this strong, 
                        proud, infuriating young woman, and 
                        for a moment it makes me happier 
                        than you can imagine.  But it’s a 
                        lie, and when it slips away the 
                        grief comes flooding back like it 
                        was yesterday.  I can’t do it 
                        anymore.  I can’t live in the past.

           Taylor stands, unable to hold in how she feels.

                                 TAYLOR
                        But you are living in the past.  
                        You’ve crammed the sadness into 
                        your deepest, darkest corner and 
                        hoped it would just go away.  But 
                        that’s not how it works.  The pain 
                        stays, and you can either wake up 
                        every day and say good morning to 
                        it or you can give up and throw 
                        yourself off the nearest bridge.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        I’m sorry, Taylor, you don’t 
                        understand...
                                 TAYLOR
                        I am the only one who understands.  
                        And I am sitting here, right now, 
                        and I’m telling you that I love 
                        you.  And you have to make a choice 
                        - you have to decide if the risk is 
                        worth the payoff.  So what’s it 
                        gonna be?  

           Bridgette considers this, staring into the distance, and then 
           shakes her head; she digs into her purse, as if looking for 
           her keys.  Taylor’s shoulders slump; she’s lost her.

           Bridgette pulls a quarter out of her purse and hands it to 
           Taylor; Taylor looks at it, confused.

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Flip a coin?
                             (Taylor smiles, slowly)
                        Heads, I stay.  Tails, you drive me 
                        to the nearest bridge.  

           Taylor flips the quarter high into the air, catching it and 
           turning it over on her wrist.  She looks at it.

                                 TAYLOR
                        Damn.  Let me see if my Dad will 
                        let me borrow the car...

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Get over here.  

           Bridgette pulls Taylor into a hug.  They stand frozen 
           together for a moment, eyes closed, as the last few cars pull 
           out of the parking lot.

           Bridgette pulls away.   

                                 BRIDGETTE (CONT’D)
                        We should go inside; your brother 
                        has probably reported you missing 
                        by now.

                                 TAYLOR
                        Don’t joke.  One time, he called 
                        the cops when I went to buy milk.  

           Bridgette laughs.  They turn the corner of the building and 
           see Nick and his Dad waiting for them a few hundred feet 
           away.  Taylor waves.
                                 TAYLOR (CONT’D)
                        You realize I’m never going to stop 
                        trying to get the two of you 
                        together, right?

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Yep.

                                 TAYLOR
                        And how often do I get what I want?

                                 BRIDGETTE
                        Always.

                                 TAYLOR
                        Cool.  Just wanted to make sure we 
                        were on the same page.

           Bridgette ruffles Taylor’s hair; Taylor dodges, and they 
           walk, arm in arm, into the night.  

                                 THE END
