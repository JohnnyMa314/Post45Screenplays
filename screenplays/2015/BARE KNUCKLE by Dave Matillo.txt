           “Violence alone does not render bloodsports interesting. 
           Lovers of cockfighting take no pleasure in seeing livestock 
           butchered in slaughterhouses.

           Only violence in the context of fair combat affords genuine 
           displays of fortitude and honor.

           The ability to accept violence yet place limits on it, to 
           order mayhem with rules and a spirit of gallantry is the true 
           measure of a civilization and surest bulwark of freedom”

           --TEXT fades out. 

           From the black we hear two heavy axes chop into thick wood. 

           EXT. NORTHEASTERN FOREST - EVENING

           Four feet off the ground, two men stand on planks notched in 
           a twenty-foot-wide American Chestnut, chopping with vigor. 

           Both Irish. One cut from steel, KIERAN. The other big and 
           burly, GRADY, who begins to tire.  

                                 GRADY
                        I’ll be glad to put these damn 
                        behemoth chestnuts behind me.

                                 KIERAN
                        You’re too good to be joining up 
                        with the Chichesters. A bunch of 
                        thievin’ cutthroats, they are. 

                                 GRADY
                        I live in the slums of Manhattan, 
                        same as you. How else do you ward 
                        off all those bloody top hats? 

                                 KIERAN
                        Trouble’s easy enough to avoid if 
                        you don’t go looking for it. 

           Grady stops chopping, breathing heavy. Kieran’s pace is 
           relentless.

                                 GRADY
                        The states have been at war for 
                        over a year now. The streets of New 
                        York run lawless. Trouble finds ya 
                        all on it’s own. 
                                 KIERAN
                        Keep that axe moving, Grady. My 
                        girl’s got her first singing gig at 
                        the Know Nothings tomorrow and I’m 
                        not missing it on account of your 
                        lazy hide.

                                 GRADY
                        Know Nothings? The saloon for Irish 
                        hating bowery boys? 

           Grady resumes, wincing with every swing.

                                 KIERAN
                        Aye, but it’s good money. Destine 
                        was handpicked by Bad Jack himself. 

                                 GRADY
                        The bare knuckle champion? You’re 
                        the one who needs a gang, lad. 

                                 KIERAN
                        She’ll only be singing for Jack, I 
                        assure you of that.

                                 GRADY
                        Destine has a grand fireside voice, 
                        but don’t ya think maybe he picked 
                        her for those full bubbies and that 
                        round- 

                                 KIERAN
                        You mind your tongue in the matters 
                        of my bride to be. 

                                 GRADY
                        Bride? You sly little lobcock. When 
                        did you propose? 

                                 KIERAN
                        I haven’t, but I aim to tomorrow, 
                        if you got the bottom to finish 
                        this job.

           Grady smiles and heaves his axe into the massive trunk. 

           EXT. STREETS OF NEW YORK - DAY

           Bloodied and maimed working-class laborers are scattered 
           about the streets. The sounds of livestock being slaughtered 
           in public markets and the rotten stench of open sewers fill 
           the air.
           SUPERED BELOW: EAST BOWERY, NEW YORK CITY, 1862

           Amongst the wretched street life is a cluster of innocent 
           children counting out loud, swinging a jump rope for DESTINE, 
           a beautiful French girl in a humble dress. 

           Destine freezes in awe of something and the rope hits her 
           feet. Kieran appears with his axe slung over his shoulder.

           She runs into Kieran’s arms and they kiss as sweethearts. The 
           children giggle. Kieran grabs a little girl and playfully 
           swings her around as the other kids paw for his attention. 

                                 KIERAN
                        You all minding your manners around 
                        my beloved? 

                                 CHILDREN
                        Yes. 

                                 KIERAN
                        Don’t you be lettin’ me hear 
                        otherwise.

                                 DESTINE
                        Alright children. Go play. I have 
                        to talk to Kieran. Go on. 

           The children go back to jumping rope. 

                                 KIERAN
                        What is it?

                                 DESTINE
                        Bad Jack wants me to attend his 
                        fight today. 

                                 KIERAN
                        Not a chance. It’s all crooks and 
                        savages at those bouts. 

                                 DESTINE
                        Surely a strong handsome lumberman 
                        such as yourself can keep me safe.

                                 KIERAN
                        I got no desire in watching that 
                        spectacle for rats.

                                 DESTINE
                        Fine, but if I don’t go, the whole 
                        thing’s off. No money. Nothing.
                                 KIERAN
                             (submits)
                        Alright. Let’s just hope Bad Jack 
                        makes quick work of his man.  

           INT. STONE BASEMENT - DAY

           BAD JACK, bald head, thick mustache, a dirty rotten beast of 
           a man, sits with an American Flag draped over his shoulders. 
           GIDEON, Jack’s greasy-haired corner man, circles him.

                                 GIDEON
                        No man can best you. No one has 
                        your thirst for blood. All men fear 
                        you. That English Nance is no match 
                        for the beast he is to face today! 

           Bad Jack stands with a fury and bellows out a grunt that 
           could only come from a wild thing. Raw emotion and power exit 
           his lungs. Fireworks are coming. 

           EXT. BROKEN DOWN BUILDING - DAY

           Half knocked down stone building packed to the brim with a 
           boisterous fancy(crowd). A mix of pickpockets, gamblers, 
           beggars, and working class men escaping their daily grind. 

           They all huddle around a boxing stage eagerly waiting for the 
           fighters to arrive. 

           Near the back of the fancy, Kieran wraps his arm around 
           Destine, staring with disdain at the devious crowd. 

           Kieran sees a prime viewing spot on a stack of crates. He 
           pulls Destine to it. As they jump up a squirmy SOD takes the 
           spot and pulls a knife.  

                                 SOD
                        Fuck off. 

           Kieran backs away with Destine who looks on disappointed.  

                                 KIERAN
                        What would you have me do? Have it 
                        out with the man right here?

           The mob erupts as the fighters enter. Bad Jack stomps through 
           the crowd with his armed gang of BOWERY BOYS and tosses his 
           hat in the ring. The crowd cheers even louder. 

           Met with strong boos, his opponent VINCENT HAMMOND, the 
           strong jawed British champ, throws his hat in. 
           The crowd is pushed back by grisly men whose job is to keep 
           the mob from climbing in the ring, messing with the fighters. 

           The gamblers hands fly up with cash ready to place their 
           wagers as the fighters peel their layers of clothing off. 

           Jack scans the crowd until he spots Destine. Jack nods at 
           her. She nods back. Kieran doesn’t like it. 

           Bad Jack smiles. He is the cock of the walk and knows it. 
           Jack crosses the ring to Hammond.

                                 BAD JACK
                        Care to make a wager, Englishman? 
                        Bet you three hundred I win. 

                                 VINCENT
                        Piss off, Jack.

                                 BAD JACK
                        Think I’m gonna win as well, do ya? 
                        You English are soft as bread.

           Bad Jack backs up to his corner loosening up. The referee, a 
           white bearded old timer with leather skin, steps in and draws 
           a chalk line in the center of the ring. 

                                 REF
                        This is the Champion of America 
                        facing the Champion of England so 
                        let’s get the rules straight. When 
                        both fighter’s have their foot on 
                        the line, the round begins. When a 
                        fighter goes down the round ends 
                        until both fighters again toe the 
                        line. No hitting a downed opponent. 
                        No head butts. And Jack, no 
                        punching the balls for fuck sake. 
                        Now toe the scratch!

           Bad Jack’s playful manner quickly transitions to focused rage 
           as he puts his foot on the chalk line. Vincent follows and 
           THE FIGHT IS ON. 

           Hammond throws first, but Jack bobs and weaves away from the 
           punches. Hammond chases Jack in circles unable to connect.

                                 BAD JACK
                        I knew you were slow, but come on. 

           Jack plays it up to the crowd, but finally stops and sticks 
           his stubbly chin in the air. 
                                 BAD JACK (CONT’D)
                        Hit me you slow mangy sodomite!

           BAM! Hammond whacks him good with a right cross, then gets in 
           close to land body shots.

           Jack throws Hammond over his leg to the ground ending the 
           first round. Hammond quickly rises and puts his foot on the 
           scratch ready to start the second. 

           Bad Jack licks the blood from his lip. Like a morning shot of 
           whiskey to the alcoholic, the blood gives Jack his FIX. 

           Bad Jack toes the scratch and steam-rolls Hammond with 
           vicious punches to the face. Jack puts his forearm against 
           the Englishman’s throat and pushes him against the ropes.

           Bad Jack busts open Hammond’s face until his fists go wet 
           with blood. The Englishmen goes down.

           As Hammond rises Jack hurls a knee into Hammond’s chest 
           sending him back to the ground. Gamblers rage at the illegal 
           move, barely able to be held back as they bum-rush the ring. 

           Vincent’s second, RICHARD, rushes into the ring and shoves 
           Bad Jack back. 

                                 RICHARD
                        Damned cheater!

                                 BAD JACK
                        Get the fuck out of my ring! 

           Gideon enters the ring and WHAP!, bashes Richard’s skull with 
           his club. Gideon drags him out of the ring. Hammond leaps 
           towards Jack, landing a few unsuspecting blows. 

           Destine grows frightened as the crowd gets more drunk and 
           wild.  

           Bad Jack throws Vincent into the ropes and bashes his face 
           into mush. Jack is a rabid dog unleashing hell. Finally 
           Hammond goes down and Jack backs away laughing. 

           Hammond’s face is disfigured. His teeth are broken, his eyes 
           swollen shut. Jack taunts, pointing and making faces. 

                                 BAD JACK (CONT’D)
                        I don’t remember you being this 
                        ugly when we started. Good thing 
                        you didn’t take the bet. 

           Jack’s laughing subsides as he grabs Hammond’s head.
                                 BAD JACK (CONT’D)
                        How do you like pugilism in 
                        America?

           One last punch and SMACK!

           INT. THE KNOW NOTHINGS SALOON - NIGHT

           Bad Jack, dressed up to the nines in fine gangster attire, 
           stands surrounded by admirers, all piss drunk on whiskey and 
           ale in his large two story saloon.

                                 BAD JACK
                             (hysterical)
                        Did you see that ninny’s face? 

           Jack can barely breathe he is laughing so hard. The extreme 
           sadistic nature of this hysteria is a window into his heart. 

                                 BAD JACK (CONT’D)
                        And the blood...there was so much 
                        blood.

                                 GIDEON
                        To the champion!

           They all toast and chug their drinks. Jack spots LESTER, a 
           uniformed municipal police officer. 

                                 BAD JACK
                        Lester! You sweaty hairy animal.

           An accurate description. Jack puts his arm around the copper.  

                                 LESTER
                        I made a good deal of money on you 
                        today, champ! 

                                 BAD JACK
                        And now you want to spend it. 

           Jack turns around and whistles. A mature, voluptuous woman, 
           HELEN, approaches with her breasts out. 

                                 LESTER
                        No, no. Younger.

           Helen reveals a hint of a smile. 

                                 BAD JACK
                        Look at that. The whore is happy 
                        she doesn’t have to fuck a 
                        festering pig like yourself. 
                                 LESTER
                        You’re a shit, Jack.

           He waves over the youngest whore, ELIZABETH. She cozies up 
           next to Lester. Her innocence accentuates his repulsiveness.

           On the main stage, Destine walks out wearing a low cut dress. 
           Jack stops mid drink, enamored by her beauty.

                                 BAD JACK
                        Everyone quiet. 

           Some quiet, but not all.

                                 BAD JACK (CONT’D)
                        I said shut your fucking mouths!

           Silence.

           Destine looks down to Kieran who is standing near the stage, 
           smiling with encouragement.

           Destine launches into an elegant French song. Her sensual 
           moves drop the jaws of all the nastiest, grimiest men in New 
           York.

           Bad Jack leans against the wall next to Kieran. Kieran double 
           takes looking at the city celebrity.

                                 BAD JACK (CONT’D)
                        That your lady?

                                 KIERAN
                        Yeah, she’s mine.

                                 BAD JACK
                        She a good fuck? 

           Kieran tenses up and holds his stare to Destine.

                                 BAD JACK (CONT’D)
                        Looks like she’d be a right good 
                        lay in the hay. Those tits. Love to 
                        have those bouncing in my face.

           Kieran turns aggressively to Bad Jack.

                                 KIERAN
                        I kindly ask that you mind your 
                        mouth, champion. My lady deserves 
                        respect even from the likes of 
                        pugilistic royalty, aye? 
           Bad Jack sticks his alpha male chest against Kieran and 
           speaks an inch from his ear.

                                 BAD JACK
                        You put your eyes to the floor when 
                        I’m around, you mick sissy.  

           Kieran looks down to the ground, submissive.

                                 BAD JACK (CONT’D)
                        You’re lucky I even let a fobbing 
                        Irishman like you in my club.

           The crowd erupts with applause, breaking the tension as 
           Destine takes her fulfilled bow. Jack reaches out and helps 
           Destine off the stage. 

                                 BAD JACK (CONT’D)
                        Truly breathtaking, darling.

           Jack pulls out a wad of cash and peels off twenty dollars. He 
           hands it to Destine and kisses her hand. 

                                 BAD JACK (CONT’D)
                        Worth every penny.

                                 DESTINE
                        Thank you, Ja-

                                 KIERAN
                        Better be off now.

           Kieran grabs Destine and pulls her away. 

                                 DESTINE
                        But...

           Destine looks back confused as she’s dragged out of the bar. 
           Jack walks to Lester. 

                                 BAD JACK
                        That Irishman with the singer, who 
                        is he?  

                                 LESTER
                        Connelly I think. A nobody, why?

                                 BAD JACK
                        Arrange a meeting with The 
                        Politician. 

                                 LESTER
                        What for?
                                 BAD
                        I believe he owes his country a 
                        debt that must be paid at once. 

                                 LESTER
                        Oh, dear.

           INT. CHURCH BASEMENT - NIGHT

           Moonlight shines through the lone window into the cold damp 
           dwelling, where Kieran is stacking logs on a fire. Destine 
           puts the twenty dollars into a small purse of mostly coins. 

                                 DESTINE
                        It wasn’t proper to leave so 
                        abruptly. Not after Jack paid such 
                        a high sum. 

           Kieran pulls Destine down next to the fire with him.

                                 KIERAN
                        Enough about Bad Jack. 

                                 DESTINE
                        But I don’t see why-

                                 KIERAN
                             (in French)
                        Listen, please. 

           Destine smiles in shock hearing Kieran speak French. He 
           proceeds with shaky nerves.

                                 KIERAN (CONT’D)
                             (in French)
                        You are all that I love. I have no 
                        one but you and I want you forever. 
                        Will you take my hand in marriage?

           Tears of joy pool in Destine’s eyes. 

                                 DESTINE
                        My love. I also have no one but 
                        you. Yes, you can have me forever.

           She grabs his face and kisses him. Kieran picks her up and 
           carries her to their wooden bed. He lays her down softly with 
           one hand while unlacing her dress with the other. 

           Destine unbuttons his shirt. Each layer of clothing comes off 
           until they are naked in each other’s arms, making love. 
           INT. CHURCH BASEMENT - MORNING

           Feeble light peaks in. Destine and Kieran lie naked still, 
           staring, caressing each other. 

                                 DESTINE
                        Why did you choose me?

                                 KIERAN
                        How do you mean?

                                 DESTINE
                        I was rotting away in the streets, 
                        dirty and alone. Starving. No one 
                        cared if I lived or died. No one 
                        but you.

                                 KIERAN
                        I only wanted to bed you.

           She pinches him harsh. He tickles her, which she hates. 

                                 KIERAN (CONT’D)
                        I tried hard to rid myself of ya, 
                        but you won’t go away. 

           Kieran finally stops tickling, and holds Destine.

                                 KIERAN (CONT’D)
                        You will never starve again. 

                                 DESTINE
                        Promise me our children wont. I do 
                        not want to raise them in squalor. 

                                 KIERAN
                        Nor do I. I will build us a house 
                        with a big lot of land. We’ll have 
                        an orchard with more fruit than you 
                        could ever eat. 

                                 DESTINE
                        On a lumberman’s wage? 

                                 KIERAN
                        I’ll find a way. There’s nothing I 
                        wouldn’t do for you. 

                                 DESTINE
                        Do for me what you did last night.

           She kisses Kieran when suddenly, BAM, the door is kicked in. 
                                 KIERAN
                        Who goes there? 

           Kieran quickly throws on trousers as men stomp down the 
           stairs. Destine wraps her naked body with a blanket.

                                 LESTER
                        Kieran Connolly? 

           The copper Lester arrives with a band of goons behind him.

                                 KIERAN
                        Aye, that’s me.

                                 LESTER
                        Can’t evade your duty any longer. 

           Lester holds up a piece of paper. 

                                 LESTER (CONT’D)
                        This document states you are an 
                        official volunteer in the Union 
                        Army. Signed by your own hand.

                                 KIERAN
                        You’re mistaken. I never signed- 

                                 LESTER
                        Maybe you were drunk like every 
                        other Irishman in New York when you 
                        signed it. 

           Lester motions, and one of his minions steps out and bashes  
           Kieran’s temple with an iron hammer. Destine screams in 
           horror. 

           They drag Kieran up the stairs, his head hitting every step. 

                                 DESTINE
                        You can’t do this!

           Lester rushes to Destine with a balled fist.

                                 LESTER
                        You don’t want to be interfering 
                        with the law, I assure you. 

           Destine cowers. Lester backs off and searches around.

                                 LESTER (CONT’D)
                        What a shit sty. 

           He pulls open a drawer and finds the purse. Destine leaps to 
           her feet.
                                 DESTINE
                        NO!

           She tries to grab the purse, but Lester pushes her back and 
           grabs the blanket. She falls naked. 

                                 LESTER
                        Mmmm, you are one curvy delight. 

           He savors the sight, then drops the blanket and exits with 
           the money.

           EXT. WATERFRONT - MORNING

           Through hazy eyes we see Kieran’s POV go in and out of 
           consciousness, being carried through the crowded docks.

                                 MINION 1
                        This bloke is still awake.

                                 MINION 2
                        After that bash to the head? 

                                 MINION 1
                        Thick skull, small brain.

                                 MINION 2
                        I’ll put him out. Bad Jack sends 
                        his regards.

           The minion viciously smashes his hammer down on Kieran.

           EXT. STEAMBOAT - DAY

           The sun is at its peak, beating down on Kieran, as his eyes 
           slowly open. His vision clears and he inspects his clothes. 

           He is dressed in a formfitting dark blue wool jacket with 
           “Excelsior” stamped on the buttons. His blue wool trousers 
           are held up by fabric suspenders. 

           From a higher deck an Irish soldier, CILLIAN, spies down on 
           Kieran while polishing the barrel of his Breechloader rifle. 

           Kieran shakes his head in disbelief, still trying to regain 
           his full awareness. All around him are Union soldiers dressed 
           just as he is.

           Kieran investigates the knapsack laying at his feet. Cillian 
           approaches.
                                 CILLIAN
                        A plate, knife, fork, spoon. You 
                        got a tin cup and a canteen. A wool 
                        blanket for the cold nights. 

                                 KIERAN
                        Where am I?

                                 CILLIAN
                        On a steamboat carrying the 88th 
                        regiment of the Irish Brigade.

                                 KIERAN
                        This is an outrage.

           Kieran rises to his feet and scrambles through the Union 
           soldiers. Cillian follows.

                                 CILLIAN
                        Where ya going?

                                 KIERAN
                        To find an officer and get off this 
                        ship.

                                 CILLIAN
                        Kieran!

           Kieran stops in his tracks. 

                                 KIERAN
                        How do you know my name?

                                 CILLIAN
                        The lads that inducted you like 
                        weren’t too subtle about it. The 
                        officers are the ones that ordered 
                        ya dressed and such. Question them 
                        and you’re likely to get another 
                        gash on your head.  

           Kieran touches his head, feeling the wound. 

                                 KIERAN
                        Thanks for the warning, but I’m not 
                        supposed to be here. 

           Kieran bolsters off through the crowd.

                                 CILLIAN
                        Those boys hit pretty hard!
           INT. THE POLITICIAN’S OFFICE - EVENING

           In the illustrious Tammany Hall sits THE POLITICIAN, a 
           menacing dark shadow with red eyes smoking a cigar, wearing a 
           large top hat. 

           A skinny secretary, TWIG, pops his head in.

                                 TWIG
                        Mr. Politician sir, that French 
                        woman is back. Shall I have her 
                        thrown out of the city?

                                 THE POLITICIAN
                        Send her in. 

           The secretary escorts Destine in and quickly exits. 

                                 THE POLITICIAN (CONT’D)
                        The French dog who won’t stop 
                        scratching at my door. What do you 
                        want? 

                                 DESTINE
                        My husband, well soon to be husband 
                        was taken by a copper. 

                                 THE POLITICIAN
                        Taken where?

                                 DESTINE
                        Off to war I believe. They said he 
                        signed a document to be a soldier, 
                        but I know he never did. 

                                 THE POLITICIAN
                        We all must do our duty to serve 
                        New York and the Union. You should 
                        be proud of your soon to be 
                        husband. He is a patriot. Good day.

           The Politician takes another large puff from his fat cigar 
           sending smoke swirling around the room.

                                 DESTINE
                        That’s it? But it’s wrong what was 
                        done. You have to do something!

           The Politician rises with furious command. Spit flies from 
           his mouth as he berates. 

                                 THE POLITICIAN
                        You dare tell me what I have to do! 
                        This is my city you manky pratt! 
                                 (MORE)
                                 THE POLITICIAN (CONT'D)
                        Get out of my sight before I have 
                        you shipped back to France! TWIG!

           Twig rushes in and quickly ushers Destine out. He drags her 
           through the office and pushes her outside.

           EXT. TAMMANY HALL - CONTINUOUS

           Destine falls into a puddle of mud.

                                 TWIG
                        Don’t come back! 

           Twig slams the door shut. Destine picks herself up from the 
           mud and wipes off her dress. 

           Bad Jack is conveniently leaning back in a chair, eating an 
           apple with a large knife, watching Destine in despair. 

                                 BAD JACK
                        Don’t mope for that bastard. 

           Destine embarrassedly looks up wiping her eyes. Jack rises, 
           offering a slice of apple from the tip of his blade. 

                                 BAD JACK (CONT’D)
                        Hungry?

                                 DESTINE
                        Bad Jack?

           He pushes the fruit forward. She takes it. Jack helps clean 
           off some mud from her dress as she eats. She smiles. 

                                 BAD JACK
                        Why don’t you tell me your troubles 
                        over dinner at my saloon.

           Destine gives a look of severe skepticism. Jack returns it 
           with a toothy smile.

           INT. STOCKADE - NIGHT

           Kieran sits in an iron cell holding a cloth over a fresh 
           wound on his cheek. Cillian stands rolling a cigarette. 

                                 CILLIAN
                        Name’s Cillian. I’m sorry it didn’t 
                        go your way. 

                                 KIERAN
                        What do you care about it anyway? 
                                 CILLIAN
                        We’re headed to Richmond to sack 
                        the Confederate capitol and end the 
                        war. We’re gonna need every soldier 
                        to do it.

                                 KIERAN
                        I didn’t sign up for this brigade. 

                                 CILLIAN
                        Some high up people aim to keep ya 
                        here, so maybe it best you stop 
                        thinking about how to get out and 
                        start thinking of how to survive.   

                                 KIERAN
                        The Irish are brought to the front 
                        lines to do one thing -- die. 

                                 CILLIAN
                        It just so happens you’re talking 
                        to the man who’s figured out the 
                        key to beating the odds and making 
                        it out.

                                 KIERAN
                        What key is that?

                                 CILLIAN
                        Become really good at killing. 

           This grabs Kieran’s full attention.

           INT. KNOW NOTHINGS SALOON - NIGHT

           Destine is right drunk now as she and Bad Jack laugh 
           hysterically at the bar. 

                                 BAD JACK
                        See here wait Madame, I’ve found a 
                        button in my salad. That’s all 
                        right, Sire, it’s part of the 
                        dressing. 

           They continue to laugh as the bartender pours them another 
           shot of whiskey and clears their empty plates of food. 

                                 BAD JACK (CONT’D)
                        Okay, I remember, I remember. 

                                 DESTINE
                        Let’s see.
                                 BAD JACK
                        Un, deux, trois!

           They take the shots. Destine spills a little down her chin. 
           Jack wipes it with his finger and stares at her. 

                                 DESTINE
                        Thank you for the food. 

           Jack moves in for a kiss, but Destine turns her cheek. 

                                 DESTINE (CONT’D)
                        Je suis desolee, I cannot. I belong 
                        to another. 

           She hops off her bar stool and Jack quickly grabs her arm. 

                                 BAD JACK
                        I do not see your Irish mate.

                                 DESTINE
                        He’s at war. 

                                 BAD JACK
                        Then he’s as good as dead.

                                 DESTINE
                        You do not know him. Nothing will 
                        stop him from coming back to me.

           She squirms her arm away and runs out of the bar. 

           Jack will not stoop to chase. He picks up a stool and heaves 
           it across the bar. The patrons stop and stare.

                                 DRUNKARD
                        Why don’t ya just drag her upstairs 
                        and have your way with her?

                                 BAD JACK
                        ‘Cause I don’t get my kicks from 
                        rape like you, ya rat-eating 
                        shanker. Gideon!

           Gideon comes rushing up from the crowd.

                                 BAD JACK (CONT’D)
                        Spread the word. No man gives her 
                        work. I want every door in New York 
                        slammed in her face! 

           Gideon nods and runs off.
           EXT. HENRICO COUNTY VIRGINIA - FIELDS - DAY

           BOOM! Clouds of smoke and bursts of light. Sounds of gunfire 
           and death. Kieran and Cillian stand shoulder to shoulder 
           firing volleys at the Confederate forces across a field.

           Kieran trudges through the twelve step process of reloading 
           his musket while Cillian simply puts a new cartridge in the 
           trough of his breechloader and fires.

           INT. RUNDOWN SALOON - EVENING

           Destine sheepishly walks through a shoddy saloon full of 
           thieves and miscreants. She approaches the bartender.

                                 DESTINE
                        I was inquiring if you need some 
                        female entertainment.

                                 BARTENDER
                        Maybe, gorgeous. What’s the name?

                                 DESTINE
                        Destine.

                                 BARTENDER
                        Can’t help ya.

           He turns his back. Destine backs away confused and 
           downtrodden.

           EXT. URBANA - EVENING

           Kieran sits alone against a large Oak tree a couple hundred 
           feet from the Union tents. Rows of cannons and stacks of 
           cannon balls surround the encampment. 

           The setting sun gives just enough pink light for Kieran to 
           put ink to paper. His hands are marked with blood yet to be 
           washed off. 

                                 KIERAN (V.O.)
                        My dearest Destine, how I miss you  
                        my love. 

           VARIOUS SHOTS - DESTINE AND KIERAN’S STRUGGLES

           --Kieran and his men march through the forests of Virginia.
                                 KIERAN (V.O.)
                        I have become a soldier. I march. I 
                        practice loading my musket and I 
                        march some more. It feels like I’ve 
                        walked across the entire world.

           --Destine talks to a man in the doorway of his saloon, but he 
           shuts the door on her.

                                 KIERAN (V.O.)
                        I hope our savings is keeping you 
                        well fed and warm. Or perhaps your 
                        singing career has blossomed. 

           --Blood turns the fields red as men fall dead around Kieran’s 
           firing regiment.

                                 KIERAN (V.O.)
                        There is only death here. I cannot 
                        count how many men have been cut 
                        down at my side. I’m not ashamed to 
                        say I fear that soon I could find 
                        myself amongst the slain.

           --Destine pleads with the owner of a chicken factory but is 
           sent away. 

                                 KIERAN (V.O.)
                        That fear is only a whisper when 
                        compared to the bellowing worry I 
                        have for your safety. It was Bad 
                        Jack who sent me here. I know he 
                        wants you for his own. 

           --Kieran weaves his way through soldiers and drops his letter 
           in the postman’s bag just before he rides off.

                                 KIERAN (V.O.)
                        Stay clear of Bad Jack at any cost. 
                        All my love, Kieran.

           EXT. MALVERN HILL - SUNRISE

           The birds are singing atop a large hill full of small trees 
           and bushes. Kieran stares out over the mass of sleeping and 
           wounded soldiers. 

           Cillian approaches from behind.

                                 CILLIAN
                        Does it taste the way you thought? 

           Kieran turns to Cillian standing behind him. 
                                 KIERAN
                        What?

                                 CILLIAN
                        Killing.

                                 KIERAN
                        It’s like I’m not myself anymore. I 
                        think of my old life...it seems 
                        like a dream. 

           Cillian sits and lights a cigarette. 

                                 CILLIAN
                        It was. Now you’re awake and will 
                        never sleep again. 

                                 KIERAN
                        I feel Godless.

                                 CILLIAN
                        That’s good. 

                                 KIERAN
                        Good?

                                 CILLIAN
                        Those who will survive are the 
                        fastest, smartest, the most 
                        ruthless. God has nothing to do 
                        with it. 

                                 KIERAN
                        And if a stray bullet was to blow a 
                        hole in your leg or a cannonball 
                        roll you over, I wonder if you 
                        would sing this same song. 

                                 CILLIAN
                        Hasn’t happened yet. 

                                 KIERAN
                        You’re wrong about one thing. I 
                        will sleep again. Beside my woman I 
                        will lay, and this war will be the 
                        dream. 

                                 CILLIAN
                        Ten thousand Confederates will 
                        surround this hill before the month 
                        is out. Your focus must remain on 
                        nothing but blood. Because the 
                        blood of your enemies is the only 
                        thing that can get you back to her.
           This sparks a sharpness in Kieran.

                                 KIERAN
                        Then I shall paint these lands red. 

           INT. CHURCH BASEMENT - NIGHT

           Destine grabs the only item left on her kitchen shelf. She 
           opens the jar of maple syrup and scrapes the last drop onto 
           her tongue. 

           She takes off her dress. Her ribs are poking through her 
           pasty skin. She puts on her dressing gown and lays her 
           emaciated body in bed. 

           She clasps her hands and closes her eyes to pray. 

                                 DESTINE
                        Please God, do not let me fall into 
                        darkness. Do not let me starve 
                        again as I have before. Anything 
                        but that. Please. 

           CRASH! A burning torch flies through the window. 

                                 UNIDENTIFIED VOICE (O.S.)
                        GO BACK TO IRELAND YOU WHORES OF 
                        BABYLON!!

           The wooden walls catch fire. Smoke fills the basement. 
           Destine rushes from the burning building. 

           EXT. ST. JOSEPH’S CHURCH - CONTINUOUS

           She joins the other scattering occupants of the church who 
           gaze upon their home now engulfed in flames. FATHER JOSEPH 
           has a musket and he swings it around in every direction. 

                                 FATHER JOSEPH
                        Where are you cowards? I’ll blast a 
                        hole through the lot of ya!

           The flames grow bigger. A shadow catches Destine’s eye. A 
           brief moment of focus and she sees Lester. He stares at her 
           with menacing eyes. Then slyly walks off. 

                                 DESTINE 
                        They burn our church and you do 
                        nothing! Nique ta mere! (fuck your 
                        mother) Nique ta mere. 
           The wind changes and the smoke swells over Destine. She drops 
           to her knees, hacking, trying to crawl away.

           EXT. MALVERN HILL - NIGHT

           The Irish Brigade are firing volley after volley into the 
           Confederate lines mounting there way up the hill. 

           Cannon fire is exploding in both directions. The lines of 
           Kieran and Cillian’s formation are scattered.

           The determined Confederate foot-soldiers weave their way to 
           the Union outfit. Cillian pulls out his bayonet and wields it 
           like a knife. Kieran readies himself with his bayonet 
           attached to his musket. 

                                 CILLIAN
                        No hesitation. Be vicious. 

           Cillian runs to a large leafy tree and puts his back to the 
           trunk. Kieran and the rest of their brigade hit the 
           Confederate forces head on and engage in hand to hand combat.  

           Cillian leaves the tree and slays two enemy soldiers from 
           behind. His moves are calm, calculated, and deadly accurate. 

           Kieran grunts as he takes on attacks from all angles. He 
           smacks the butt of his gun against a Confederate’s chin then 
           turns and buries his bayonet into the guts of another. 

           From behind a Confederate wraps a rifle firmly against 
           Kieran’s throat. Kieran is dragged back weaponless, his 
           musket still attached to the dead man’s stomach. 

           They struggle and fall to the ground. Kieran is being choked 
           and is quickly running out of breath. 

           He reaches around in all directions with panic. His hands 
           find nothing. He gives one last shot at elbowing his enemy’s 
           ribs, but the grip stays tight. 

           As the light begins to fade on Kieran’s life, an unmanned 
           horse dragging a shattered wooden coach runs rampid towards 
           the entangled soldiers. 

           As the wild horse passes by, Kieran reaches out and grabs the 
           trailing wagon. Both men are dragged and the Confederate 
           soldier’s gun is flung to the grass. 

           He brazenly holds on to Kieran, not wanting to let his enemy 
           get away. Kieran viciously elbows him in the face and finally 
           the enemy falls and rolls through the field.  
           Kieran pulls himself up onto the carriage and leaps onto the 
           back of the horse. He pulls the reigns.

                                 KIERAN
                        Woah, woah! 

           The horse stops and Kieran looks around at the carnage. 
           Across the way he sees a bevy of enemy soldiers bearing down 
           on Cillian. 

           He scans the field with haste for a weapon. He looks back 
           into the wagon. Under a mess of supplies is an AXE. 

           Cillian lowers his stance ready to take on the Confederate 
           mob. He blocks the first man’s strike with his bayonet and 
           throws him to the ground. 

           The second man bull rushes him, but Cillian stays on his feet 
           and struggles with him. Three more soldiers reach them and 
           they put Cillian flat on his back. 

           BAM! A musket smashes Cillian’s face. The soldier picks up 
           Cillian’s bayonet and raises it high overhead ready to plunge 
           it in Cillian’s heart. 

                                 KIERAN (CONT’D)
                        HEY!!!

           Riding at full steam Kieran leaps from his horse’s back and 
           buries his axe into the almost killer’s chest. 

           Kieran moves swiftly, blocking several swipes from the angry 
           infantry and countering with devastating blows. 

           He swings his axe with the precision only a lumberman could. 
           Cillian watches this display of bloody heroism from his back. 

           Blood soaks the grass where the chopped up Confederates lay. 
           Kieran helps Cillian to his feet.

           Kieran stands, looks, and breathes as a beast. He and Cillian 
           move out into the fray ready for more. 

           EXT. STREETS OF NEW YORK - NIGHT

           Destine huddles behind a crate in the putrid streets where 
           men piss in corners and whores fuck in alley ways. 

           Destine curls up in a ball shaking, alone and afraid.
           EXT. MALVERN HILL - NIGHT

           Kieran sits by a fire, his skin, even his face, coated in 
           blood. He uses his bayonet to carve notches into the handle 
           of his bloody axe. Cillian watches from the shadows.

                                 CILLIAN
                        What are those for then?

                                 KIERAN
                        Each man I kill is a lesson. I want 
                        to remember all I learn here.

           EXT. ST. JOSEPH’S CHURCH - MORNING

           All that remains of the church is black rubble. The postman 
           walks up to the ruins with Kieran’s letter in his clutches. 
           He reads Destine’s name and looks around confounded.

           EXT. STREETS OF NEW YORK - DAY

           Destine’s filthy withered body lays against a brick warehouse 
           baking under the sun. A PASSER BY weasels up to her. He puts 
           his stinking hands on the collar of her dressing gown and 
           pulls it down to take a peek. 

           WHAP! The man’s head is kicked into the bricks. Two strong 
           hands grab Destine and pick her up.

                                 BAD JACK
                        I got ya now. Jack’s gonna make 
                        everything alright.

           INT. BAD JACK’S SUITE - EVENING

           Destine is freshly bathed, ravaging a feast of chicken and 
           vegetables in Jack’s giant apartment above the saloon. He has 
           lavish furniture, paintings, a large piano, and the best 
           linens money can buy. 

           Jack’s cock of the walk confidence he portrays in the ring is 
           just as effusive in his bedroom with a woman. 

                                 BAD JACK
                        I see you’re enjoying the food. 

                                 DESTINE
                             (mouth full)
                        Very much. Thank you. 
           She washes the bite down with wine. Her plate is clean. Jack 
           immediately fills her empty glass with more wine. 

                                 BAD JACK
                        Drink up and forget the pains of 
                        your former life. 

                                 DESTINE
                        Former life?

                                 BAD JACK
                        I thought this was clear. I mean to 
                        have you for my own. 

           Destine gulps her wine as her demure turns reticent. 

                                 DESTINE
                        I told you, I am promised to 
                        another.

           Jack stalks his prey. 

                                 BAD JACK
                        Can you not see, I only want what’s 
                        best for you. Your circumstance is 
                        quite dire. Without me you’ll end 
                        up dead or selling your fruitful 
                        vine for nickels? Is that what you 
                        want?

                                 DESTINE
                        No.

           He strokes her hair and touches her face. She lets him.

                                 BAD JACK
                        I’ve never seen such a precious 
                        thing in all my life. I will give 
                        you everything. Let me take your 
                        troubles away. 

                                 DESTINE
                        I cannot give you something I do 
                        not have. My heart is with Kieran. 
                        It forever will be. 

                                 BAD JACK
                        If your man is still alive, do you 
                        not think he is doing whatever it 
                        takes to get back to you, no matter 
                        how ugly, no matter how hard. His 
                        hands are not clean either.

           Destine turns away. Jack leads her face to look at his.
                                 BAD JACK (CONT’D)
                        If you truly loved him, you would 
                        do whatever it takes to survive 
                        until his return.

           Jack moves in and kisses her. She lets him. He backs away.

                                 BAD JACK (CONT’D)
                        Then we are clear? 

                                 DESTINE
                             (painfully)
                        Yes.

           Jack lifts her out of her seat and carries her to his bed. He 
           throws her down and rips her dress from her body. He pulls 
           his trousers down, turns her over, and mounts her from 
           behind. 

           She digs her fingernails into the fine sheets as she is taken 
           roughly. She lets her mind go, separating it from her body. 
           She goes blank as she says goodbye to that former life and 
           painfully embraces a new one. 

           EXT. UNION CAMP - DAY

           WHACK! An axe explodes through a log sending the two pieces 
           flying off the chop. Close in on the blood stained metal. 
           Then move up the handle with over a hundred notches.

           Kieran now with long hair and beard sets up another log and 
           smashes through it with his favored killing weapon. Patches 
           of melting snow are scattered around his feet. 

           He stops and turns hearing soldiers yell and cheer on the 
           other side of camp. A crowd has formed to watch something. 
           Kieran goes to inspect, taking his axe with him. 

           CROWD

           Kieran moves through the crowd to the center where rowdy 
           soldiers are bare knuckle boxing. 

           An overexcited spectator rushes back, knocking into Kieran, 
           bouncing backwards off Kieran’s strong Irish frame. 

           Kieran grabs the soldiers collar. The soldier looks down at 
           Kieran’s notched axe with fear and tries to remove Kieran’s 
           grip, but it is too strong. Kieran stares like a madman.

                                 CILLIAN
                        Kieran! Come watch from up here!
           Kieran sees Cillian and a few soldiers atop barrels of 
           provisions. Kieran releases his grip and the soldier scurries 
           away. Kieran jumps atop the barrels next to Cillian. 

                                 CILLIAN (CONT’D)
                        An entire winter fighting in 
                        Virginia has taken its toll. 

           The soldiers below are punching each other bloody and loving 
           it. 

                                 KIERAN
                        A bunch of cockered louts, wasting 
                        their energy.

           A giant brawny soldier stands looking for an opponent. 

                                 GIANT
                        Who wants to fight?

                                 CILLIAN
                        They saw the headline and decided 
                        this was the best way to get out 
                        their frustrations. 

           Cillian grabs the HERALD laying on an ammunition crate and 
           hands it to Kieran.  

                                 CILLIAN (CONT’D)
                        Bad Jack won again. Bloody killed 
                        the man. 

           Kieran looks at the nearly full page picture of Bad Jack 
           raising his hand in Victory. 

                                 CILLIAN (CONT’D)
                        A true farewell fight for James 
                        Sullivan.

           Kieran looks closer to see Jack accepting a KISS FROM 
           DESTINE. 

                                 GIANT
                        Nobody? 

           Kieran’s eyes go red with rage. He jumps off the barrels and 
           paces with fury, taking deep breaths of violent anger. 

                                 GIANT (CONT’D)
                        Bunch of Ninny’s! 

           The anger seethes and grows until it boils over. Kieran 
           pushes through the soldiers to the giant. 
                                 KIERAN
                        I’ll fight you!

           Kieran digs a line in the dirt with his axe, then tosses it 
           aside and toes the scratch.

           The second the giant’s foot hits the line, Kieran unleashes a 
           fury of cracks to his jaw. The giant throws back, but is slow 
           and Kieran dodges. 

           Three full power haymakers send the giant flopping to the 
           mud. The soldiers hoot and holler with bluster.

                                 KIERAN (CONT’D)
                        Get up, ya dandy!

           The giant flings some dirt into Kieran’s eye and whacks him 
           with a heavy punch to the temple. 

           Kieran shakes it off and returns fire, smashing the flubby 
           soldier’s face until he falls on the flat of his back. He 
           scoots away, wanting no more from the lumberman. 

                                 KIERAN (CONT’D)
                        Who’s next! I said who’s next!

           None of the soldiers dare engage with this barbarian. Kieran 
           stares with an unrelenting need for violence.

           INT. KNOW NOTHINGS SALOON - NIGHT

           A bunch of drunkard gamblers crowd the stage at Bad Jack’s 
           saloon, getting their kicks from TOPLESS WOMEN BOXING. 

           Wearing gloves, the women bounce up and down with no skills, 
           just instincts. Blood and spit fly as they batter each other. 

           Bad Jack sits with Destine. Lester is reading The Herald just 
           behind them.

                                 BAD JACK
                        How do you like the new business? 

                                 DESTINE
                        I prefer the cocks.

                                 BAD JACK
                        You cheeky beauty. 

           Jack grabs the low cut collar of Destine’s dress and pulls 
           her in for a sloppy drunken kiss. 
                                 BAD JACK (CONT’D)
                        Anything about me in the herald 
                        today, Copper?

                                 LESTER
                        It’s been nothing but war 
                        propaganda all winter. Headline is 
                        about a lumberman who uses his axe 
                        to chop off Confederate heads in 
                        the night. Puts a notch on the 
                        handle for every kill.

                                 DESTINE
                        A lumberman?

           Jack snatches the paper from Lester and scans the article. 

                                 LESTER
                        It’s all bollucks. Doesn’t even 
                        give his name. 

           One of the rowdy gamblers is pushed back into Destine, 
           hitting her harshly. Jack drops the paper and rises.  

                                 BAD JACK
                        You spongy maggot-pie!

           Jack violently smashes his head into the gamblers nose over 
           and over until they are both covered in blood and the man 
           falls limp to the ground. He looks dead. 

                                 BAD JACK (CONT’D)
                        Get this glock out of my saloon! 

           Gideon runs up and drags him away. Jack looks at Destine.

                                 BAD JACK (CONT’D)
                        Are you alright? 

           Destine shakes her head “yes.” Jack looks down at his blood 
           drenched clothes.

                                 BAD JACK (CONT’D)
                        Fucking hell.

           Jack strips off his clothes and head upstairs to change. 
           Destine picks up the Herald and tucks it under her arm.

           Lester sits next to Destine. She does not hide her disdain 
           for him. Her body language is crystal clear. 

                                 LESTER
                        I’ve never seen Jack go all 
                        deranged for a woman. Not ever.

                                 LESTER (CONT'D)
                        You got some kind of magical muff 
                        down there?

           Lester touches Destine’s hair. She knocks his hand away.

                                 DESTINE
                        Don’t you ever touch me, pig. 

                                 LESTER
                        You have grown confident since Jack 
                        shoveled you up off the streets. 
                        Make no mistake, lass, Bad Jack is 
                        a grizzly bear. It feels safe 
                        behind those deadly fangs of his, 
                        but one day you’ll wake up and 
                        those teeth will be gnawing at your 
                        flesh, eating you alive.

           Destine sneers and turns back to the female boxers who 
           continue beating the piss out of each other.

           EXT. ONE MILE OUTSIDE THE UNION CAMP - NIGHT

           Kieran is leading a horse though the woods, careful to be 
           quiet, constantly looking over his shoulder. 

                                 CILLIAN
                        They hang ya for stealing horses 
                        ‘round here. 

           Kieran sighs seeing Cillian waiting for him with a satchel.

                                 KIERAN
                        Don’t try and stop me. I’ve made my 
                        decision. 

                                 CILLIAN
                        And here I was thinking you had 
                        become a true blue patriot.

                                 KIERAN
                        I have no choice. I won’t let my 
                        woman get used up and tossed away 
                        by Bad Jack. 

                                 CILLIAN
                        You aim to desert then? 

                                 KIERAN
                        Desert? I am not capable of 
                        desertion. I am not a soldier, I am 
                        a prisoner.

                                 KIERAN (CONT'D)
                        I have fought every battle beside 
                        you as if I were a member of this 
                        brigade. Have I not earned the 
                        right to go save her? Tell me I do 
                        not deserve that and I will stay.  

                                 CILLIAN
                        You won’t get ten miles in that 
                        uniform. 

           Cillian holds out the satchel. Kieran takes it and pulls out 
           the plain clothes inside. He changes quickly. 

                                 CILLIAN (CONT’D)
                        There’s no point in killing Bad 
                        Jack if his boys are going to put 
                        you down right after. Be smart. 

           They embrace as brothers. Cillian nods to Kieran’s axe.

                                 CILLIAN (CONT’D)
                        The story of the lumberman and his 
                        notched axe has become legend. 
                        Careful not to be drawing any 
                        unwanted attention.

                                 KIERAN
                        Aye.

           Kieran mounts the horse.

                                 CILLIAN
                        I’m taking furlough back to my farm 
                        at the end of spring. The address 
                        is in your trouser pocket. 

                                 KIERAN
                        You’re a farmer?

           Cillian slaps the horse’s haunch and Kieran bolts off into 
           the black night.

           INT. BAD JACK’S SUITE - NIGHT

           Destine gets out of Jack’s bed, tiptoeing as not to wake him. 
           She pours herself a large chalice of wine, drinks half the 
           glass, and fills it up again. 

                                 BAD JACK
                        Still not comfortable in my bed?

           She turns with jump. 
                                 DESTINE
                        Thirsty is all. 

                                 BAD JACK
                        Pour me one.

           She does and hands him the glass. She sits back against a 
           window and they look at each other. 

                                 BAD JACK (CONT’D)
                        Do you want to know how I got the 
                        name Bad Jack?

                                 DESTINE
                        From prize fighting?

                                 BAD JACK
                        No. It’s a much darker tale.

           Jack chugs his wine. 

                                 BAD JACK (CONT’D)
                        I never met my mother. She died 
                        during my birth. My father blamed 
                        me. Said I murdered his wife. From 
                        my first breath, and every one 
                        after, the only thing he felt for 
                        me was hate. 

           For the first time, Destine looks at Jack with pity.

                                 BAD JACK (CONT’D)
                        He would lock me in a cage like an 
                        animal. I was six years old and I’d 
                        been locked up for three days 
                        without being aloud to relieve 
                        myself. I cried for him to let me 
                        out. I held it as long as I could 
                        until I...

           Jack hesitates to continue. Destine’s sympathy permits him. 

                                 BAD JACK (CONT’D)
                        I pissed and shit all over myself. 
                        When he saw, there was no pity, 
                        only shame. He dragged me out by my 
                        hair. Took off his belt and whipped 
                        me with the metal buckle until my 
                        flesh was scraped down to the bone. 
                        All the while yelling, bad Jack, 
                        bad Jack, bad Jack. 

           Destine is nearly crying hearing this tale. 
                                 BAD JACK (CONT’D)
                        I’ve never told anyone that before. 

           Destine sets down her chalice and climbs into bed on top of 
           Jack, hovering over his body, her lips inches from his.

                                 DESTINE
                        My heart would weep for you, but it 
                        is still far away...with him. 

           She kisses Jack, then rolls off him, laying with her back to 
           him. Jack reaches out to grip her throat, but instead drapes 
           his arm over her, holding her body tight to his.

           EXT. NEW YORK CITY OUTSKIRTS - DAY

           Kieran ties up his horse to a tree just outside the main 
           streets of the city. He looks at his trusty axe. He leaves it 
           and pulls his bayonet from his satchel and slides it down the 
           side of his trousers, concealing it with his shirt. 

           EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREETS - DAY

           Walking by a hat merchant, Kieran quickly looks over the 
           inventory, and buys a flat cap. He pulls it down low to hide 
           his face and continues to walk through the impoverished city. 

           EXT. KNOW NOTHINGS SALOON - EVENING

           Kieran sits across the street from the familiar saloon. He 
           watches as men enter and exit the seedy watering hole. 

           He has a good view through the front door, the open window, 
           and the balcony above. He scans for any sign of Bad Jack. 

                                 PASSER BY
                        Shit, God damn fucking horses!

           Kieran looks at the old codger get livid after stepping in 
           horse manure. He drags his boots across the ground. 

           Kieran looks back to the balcony to see BAD JACK, peering out 
           over the streets. Kieran ducks his head and lowers his hat. 

           Seeing Jack sparks a rage in Kieran. He wants to climb the 
           walls and kill him where he stands. He slows his breathing 
           and walks across the street into the bar. 
           INT. KNOW NOTHINGS SALOON - CONTINUOUS

           Kieran tucks himself in the corner, hidden behind the gruff 
           crowd of drunkards. He waits and observes. A waitress 
           approaches. 

                                 WAITRESS
                        What are ya having? 

           Not wanting to look suspicious Kieran orders.

                                 KIERAN
                        Whiskey. 

           She grabs a bottle and pours it. He takes the prop. 

           After a few moments, with his hat down, he makes his move 
           towards the stairs. 

           Engrossed in the wildness of a cock fight, no one notices as 
           Kieran clears the top step and sneaks down the hallway 
           towards Bad Jack’s suite. 

           INT. OUTSIDE BAD JACK’S SUITE - CONTINUOUS

           Kieran peaks in through a small crack in the door. He sees 
           only darkness. He pulls his bayonet from his trousers. 

           Kieran slips through the door ready to bury his blade in 
           Jack’s heart. From the shadows, five bowery boys jump out and 
           attack Kieran. Jack lights a lantern and watches.

           Kieran unleashes the beast, a scary sight to behold. He 
           blocks the first mans attack and slashes his face open. 

           Another goon hits Kieran with a club, sending Kieran flying 
           into another man, spearing him with his bayonet. 

           Kieran straight kicks a cutthroat to the ground and slices 
           open another one’s arm, but Lester approaches from behind, 
           pointing his pistol at Kieran’s head. 

                                 LESTER
                        I’d stop right there unless you 
                        want a hole through your melon!

           The henchmen quickly grab Kieran, take his bayonet, and hold 
           his arms behind him. 

           Jack moves to Kieran, who even with a gun to his head is 
           barely able to be held back by the now four men with one 
           laying dead on the ground.   
                                 BAD JACK
                        You thought you could get the drop 
                        on me in my city?! This is New 
                        York! Everyone is under my thumb!

           Bad Jack clocks Kieran across the face, but it does not have 
           the intended effect on the lumberman’s thick skull. 

                                 KIERAN
                        I’m gonna eat your bloody heart!

           Kieran head-butts one of the goons and tries to get to Jack, 
           but the other three hold their grip tight. Lester pistol 
           whips Kieran across the face. He feels it. 

                                 LESTER
                        Don’t test me, sonny. I’ll shoot ya 
                        dead right here. 

                                 BAD JACK
                        You survived the front lines. How 
                        impressive.

                                 KIERAN
                        Where is she?!

           Jack pulls out dirty brass knuckles from his drawer. 

                                 BAD JACK
                        Let me put your mind at ease. I’m 
                        taking great care of that sweet 
                        cunny of hers.

           WHACK! Bad Jack smashes the brass across Kieran’s jaw.

                                 KIERAN
                             (spitting up blood)
                        You sent me to war you coward! Call 
                        off your thugs and let’s settle 
                        this!

           POW! Another punch. Kieran head now droops almost limp.  

                                 BAD JACK
                        Only time an enemy faces me alone 
                        is in the ring. This is America. It 
                        doesn’t matter what’s right or 
                        wrong. The meanest son of a bitch 
                        willing to slit any man’s throat 
                        who gets in his way -- he wins -- 
                        every time. 

           Jack smashes his heavy knee into Kieran’s face and the goons 
           let him fall to his back. He mumbles to himself.
                                 KIERAN
                        Destine -- Destine. 

           Bad Jack moves to Lester.

                                 BAD JACK
                        Take him to the woods, gut him, and 
                        bury him. 

           Lester smiles at the request. 

           EXT. STREETS OF NEW YORK - NIGHT

           The henchman drag a nearly unconscious Kieran outside to a 
           horse drawn wagon fitted with steel bars for transporting 
           prisoners.  

           Lester walks to the wagon driver, a fellow copper. 

                                 LESTER
                        It’s a shame, I don’t think this 
                        one is going to make it. 

           Lester winks at the driver who nods back with acknowledgment. 

           One of the thugs bashes in Kieran’s ribs with his club. 
           Kieran falls to the ground as the bullies laugh. 

                                 LESTER (CONT’D)
                        Quit messing about and get him 
                        chained up back there. 

           As they lift him up, Kieran’s blood filled eyes open just 
           enough to see Destine crossing the road towards him. A surge 
           of energy rushes through him.

                                 KIERAN
                        DESTINE!

           Destine’s gaze snaps to attention. She squints to see who has 
           called her name. 

           The thugs struggle to keep hold of Kieran. Lester grabs 
           Kieran and throws him in the wagon, slamming the door shut. 
           Kieran reaches his arm through the bars.

                                 KIERAN (CONT’D)
                        DESTINE!

           Getting closer, Destine finally sees it is Kieran calling her 
           name. She can’t believe her eyes. 
           One of the goons jumps on board with the driver as Lester 
           slaps the horse and they rush off. 

                                 DESTINE
                        Kieran? KIERAN!

           She gives chase, bounding after the wagon. Lester jumps in 
           her path. He wraps her up tightly holding her back.  

                                 DESTINE (CONT’D)
                        Let me go. KIERAN!

                                 LESTER
                        Get a hold of yourself woman. 

           She squirms even more ferociously. 

                                 LESTER (CONT’D)
                        God damn it! Settle your hysteria! 

           He shakes her firmly. Destine spits in his face and wriggles 
           free. She runs down the street after a hope that is gone. 

           I/E. WAGON - NIGHT

           In the back of the wagon Kieran is elbowing and kicking wood 
           with all his might. 

                                 DRIVER
                        Settle down back there, cock robin. 

                                 KIERAN
                        I’ll kill all of you!

           He continues to bang and kick. 

                                 DRIVER
                        I said shut your hole! 
                            (to the goon)
                        Stupid Irish prancer.

           Kieran stifles his rage. He scans around. Shackles lay empty 
           on the ground. 

           He puts the iron cuffs around his wrists. He clangs the 
           shackles against the steel bars.  

                                 KIERAN
                        Come shut it for me you rump-fed 
                        codpiece! 

           He continues to make noise with the shackles.
                                 KIERAN (CONT’D)
                        Take these chains off and see what 
                        happens. I’ll rip off those pint 
                        size twiddle-diddles and shove them 
                        down your fucking throat! 

           The horse clamors as the driver pulls harshly on the reigns 
           until the carriage halts. The driver pulls out a billy club. 

                                 GOON
                        Wait ‘til we get to the woods. 

           The driver leaps from the wagon and puts the key in the door.

                                 DRIVER
                        Ready to take a nap, boy. 

           As the driver flings the door open, Kieran furiously leaps 
           out of his cage sending the unexpected copper on his back. 

           The goon pulls a knife and jumps off the wagon onto Kieran’s 
           back. Kieran catches his arm just inches before the blade 
           slices his throat. 

           Kieran rolls on his back with the driver still beneath him. 
           The driver wraps his arm around Kieran’s neck. The goon 
           pushes with all his might to put the blade in Kieran’s neck. 

           Kieran thrusts his head back into the driver’s nose. Two more 
           times until his grip loosens. He pushes his thumb deep into 
           the goon’s eye. 

           Kieran grabs the driver’s pistol, and POW! The goon looks 
           down in horror at the hole blown through his chest. 

           Kieran stands over the barely conscious copper who looks up 
           at Kieran with trepidation. 

                                 KIERAN
                        You lose.

           BOOM! The shot echoes through the starry sky. 

                                 STREETWALKER
                        Help! Somebody help! Police!

           An onlooker spots the chaos. Kieran jumps on the carriage and 
           bolts away as torches light up across the way and chase him. 

           EXT. NEW YORK CITY OUTSKIRTS - NIGHT

           Kieran rides hard towards the tree and his tied up horse. He 
           jumps off the moving wagon and rolls through the dirt. 
           He mounts his horse and watches the torches stay on the trail 
           of the wagon, then he rides off the other way 

           INT. BAD JACK’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Glossy eyed drunk, Jack sits at the edge of his bed putting a 
           wet washcloth to fresh bloody wounds on Destine’s face.  

                                 BAD JACK
                        You shouldn’t have ran after him. 
                        What did you feel when you saw him? 

                                 DESTINE
                        Intense pleasure. Something you 
                        could never give me. 

           Jack rubs her busted lip harshly. Destine winces.

                                 BAD JACK
                        War has mangled the mans mind. He 
                        is no longer the man you loved. 

                                 DESTINE
                        Where did your men take him?

                                 BAD JACK
                        It was not my men. The law took 
                        him. He is off to die a deserter’s 
                        death. 

           Destine looks away, trying to fight back her tears, not 
           wanting to cry in front of Jack. 

                                 BAD JACK (CONT’D)
                        Don’t be sad. Now your heart is 
                        free for me to capture. 

           Destine looks at Jack with pure malice.  

                                 BAD JACK (CONT’D)
                        Easy my dear. We don’t always 
                        choose where we end up. Fate has 
                        brought you and I together and we 
                        are going to see it through. 

           Jack gently pulls her bloody face into his chest and strokes 
           her hair.

                                 BAD JACK (CONT’D)
                        That means there will be no more 
                        running off. No more teasing. And 
                        not one word about your Irishman. 
                        You’re mine now. In every way. 
           Tears pour down Destine’s face, soaking Jack’s vest through.

                                 BAD JACK (CONT’D)
                        You hurt me tonight. Don’t do it 
                        again.

           EXT. PHILADELPHIA BROTHEL - MORNING

           Kieran trots, exhausted, to a brothel in the heart of 
           Philadelphia. Flies buzz, landing on his crusty wounds.  

           Kieran drops from his horse and submerges his head in a troth 
           of dirty water. 

           JUST DOWN THE WAY

           A beautiful black harlot, EMILY, is scurrying away from a fat 
           grisly monster of a man, GRISLY. 

                                 EMILY
                        Now I done told ya, I ain’t gonna 
                        lay with you again. Not after all 
                        them bruises you left last time.

                                 GRISLY
                        Listen whore, I want that black ass 
                        bouncing on my cock and that’s 
                        exactly what I’m going to get.

                                 EMILY
                        I’m sorry I can’t oblige. Plenty of 
                        other girls can attend to you. 

           As they approach the front of the brothel, near Kieran, the 
           grisly man grabs Emily’s arm and violently spins her around. 

                                 GRISLY
                        Nobody says no to me. Especially 
                        not some blackie whore. 

           He balls his hand into a fist. Emily looks around with 
           fright. She spots Kieran.

                                 EMILY
                        I’m not saying no, sir. I’ve 
                        already been paid for the entire 
                        morning. 

                                 GRISLY
                        By who?
                                 EMILY
                        Why he’s right over here. 
                            (to Kieran) 
                        There you are. You finally arrived. 

           Kieran looks around befuddled and is shocked when he realizes 
           she is talking to him. 

                                 EMILY (CONT’D)
                        Now we can go inside. 

           Emily wraps her arm around Kieran and helps him to his feet.

                                 GRISLY
                        This red haired piece of horse 
                        dung? He can barely stand, how is 
                        he supposed to fuck? 

                                 EMILY
                        Oh, we’ll manage. 

                                 GRISLY
                        I’ll double what he’s paying and 
                        that’ll be the end of it. 

           Kieran is finally figuring out the situation. 

                                 EMILY
                        I can’t back out on this fella. 

                                 GRISLY
                        I’m not going to-

                                 KIERAN
                        The lady made herself quite clear, 
                        so why don’t you be on your way. 

                                 GRISLY
                        Do you know who you’re talking to?! 
                        I’ll finish the job somebody else 
                        started on that face.

           Kieran musters up all the strength he has left and pulls his 
           axe from under his gear.

                                 KIERAN
                        Finish it then! 

           Grisly looks at the notches. 

                                 GRISLY
                             (to himself)
                        The lumberman.
           Kieran steps aggressively forward.

                                 KIERAN
                        Go on! 

                                 GRISLY
                        Apologies. She’s all yours, sir.

           Grisly cowers off down the street. 

                                 EMILY
                        Thank you mister. I’m sorry to drag 
                        you into my mess.  

                                 KIERAN
                        It’s quite al-

           Kieran get’s dizzy. The light-headedness takes him over and 
           he collapses. 

           INT. KNOW NOTHINGS SALOON - DAY

           Amongst the clangorous drinkers, Bad Jack sees Lester walk 
           in. He waives him over. 

                                 BAD JACK
                        Is it done? Connelly?

           FLASHES OF LESTER FINDING HIS MEN DEAD AND THE WAGON EMPTY.

                                 LESTER
                        Course it’s done, Jack. You know 
                        you can always count on me. 

           Jack shakes Lester with jubilation.

                                 BAD JACK
                        What a great fucking day!

           Lester can only fake joy, knowing the truth. 

           Destine watches from the stairs above with a full chalice of 
           liquor, keeping herself numb with drink. She stares with 
           blank eyes over the crowd. 

           INT. EMILY’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Kieran wakes in a cast iron bed to Emily nursing his wounds. 

                                 KIERAN
                        Have I...how long was I out? 
                                 EMILY
                        All day. Here.

           She grabs a cup of water. Kieran sits up and takes a sip. 

                                 EMILY (CONT’D)
                        That man has caused me a lot of 
                        grief. I don’t reckon he’ll be back 
                        any time soon.

                                 KIERAN
                        I’m glad I could help, but I can’t 
                        lay up here in your room. I have no 
                        means to pay you. 

                                 EMILY
                        You don’t worry about that. 

                                 KIERAN
                        You can’t make any money with a 
                        bloodied up Irishman in your bed.

           Kieran stands up, but struggles to gain his bearings. Emily 
           looks with wonder at a man without judgement, only concern 
           for her pocketbook.

                                 KIERAN (CONT’D)
                        I have to find a bare knuckle club.  

           Kieran stumbles and grabs the wardrobe for balance. Emily 
           runs to his aide. 

                                 KIERAN (CONT’D)
                        I’m going to become champion of 
                        Philadelphia.

           He gets woozy and Emily helps him back into her bed. 

                                 KIERAN (CONT’D)
                        I have to fight Bad Jack for the 
                        title. 

                                 EMILY
                        Honey, Bad Jack’s the hardest man 
                        alive, you don’t want to fight him.

           Emily looks at all the gashes on his head.

                                 EMILY (CONT’D)
                        Somebody did a number on you. 

           She puts a wet washcloth on his head. Kieran goes 
           unconscious.
           INT. THE POLITICIAN’S OFFICE - DAY

           SMACK! Bad Jack slams his fists down on The Politician’s 
           desk. The Politician and Lester stand close. 

                                 BAD JACK
                        That cock loving sissy! Calling me 
                        a dandy in the fucking Herald! 

                                 THE POLITICIAN
                        Con Orem is no sissy. He’s 
                        mastered. 

                                 BAD JACK
                        I will bash that minnow’s face in 
                        and feed him to the fishes.

                                 THE POLITICIAN
                        I want insurances, Jack. We can’t 
                        have the champion of the west 
                        coming into my city and winning. 
                        Only thing worse would be a filthy 
                        Irishman. Can you imagine every red 
                        bearded leach thinking he could 
                        rise up and join our ranks of 
                        power? This is no game. 

                                 BAD JACK
                        Do not forget, the last man I faced 
                        now lies in the dirt. 

                                 THE POLITICIAN
                        He was well past his prime and your 
                        bottom is not what it used to be.

           Jack raises his finger, walking aggressively towards The 
           Politician. Lester steps in.

                                 LESTER
                        Settle it down now, Jack.

                                 BAD JACK
                        My bottom will not be tested in the 
                        least! I’ll mash him up in less 
                        than ten.

                                 THE POLITICIAN
                        I do not care what you think! I 
                        will have my insurance! When Orem 
                        arrives, have your slimy friend 
                        round him up. 

           Jack stares at The Politician, hinting at something sinister 
           to come.
           INT. EMILY’S ROOM - DAY

           BANG, BANG, BANG, BANG! Kieran wakes to the sounds of a 
           headboard slamming against the wall from the next room. 

           Moaning from the man and woman penetrate his ears. He gets 
           out of bed with new vigor. His energy is back and he doesn’t 
           intend to spend it listening to that. He rushes out.

           HALLWAY

           Kieran walks past corset wearing busty women scattered about 
           drinking and smoking, who all perk up at Kieran’s presence.

           Kieran pays no attention as he heads for the door. Emily, 
           sweaty and out of breath, pops out into the hall.

                                 EMILY
                        Hey!

           Emily runs up to him, tieing up her dress, walking alongside 
           him as they exit the brothel.

           EXT. BROTHEL - CONTINUOUS

                                 EMILY
                        Where are you going?

                                 KIERAN
                        I told ya, to fight bare knuckle. 

                                 EMILY
                        You were serious? I’ll go with you.

                                 KIERAN
                        These clubs are for the lowly scum. 
                        Not a place for a lady.

                                 EMILY
                        I’ve laid with all those fellas. I 
                        know just where to go and I can 
                        even steer you with the fightin’. 

                                 KIERAN
                        You don’t owe me anything.

           Emily grabs his arm and stops him.

                                 EMILY
                        I want to. I feel safe around you. 

                                 KIERAN
                        Fine. Lead the way.
           Emily smiles.

           INT. SONNY’S TAVERN - NIGHT

           The fancy is out and yearning for blood at this large 
           Philadelphia tavern. The people create the ring as they group 
           around two fighters in a bare knuckle match.

           Kieran and Emily hug the edges of the mob, sitting on the 
           window near the front door. Emily holds onto Kieran’s arm to 
           keep the drunkards at bay. The TAVERN OWNER approaches. 

                                 TAVERN OWNER
                        You’ve got the next fight. Against 
                        Jim Burke. 

                                 EMILY
                        The giant?! Can’t he start with a 
                        normal size man?

                                 KIERAN
                        It’s fine. 

                                 TAVERN OWNER
                        What’s the name?

           Kieran thinks for a moment.

                                 KIERAN
                        The lumberman.

           Emily looks curiously. 

                                 TAVERN OWNER
                        Alright lumberman. If you win I’ll 
                        get you another fight. Now get 
                        moving. 

           The owner looks to the ring where the huge, six foot five, 
           Burke stands, waiting to fight. Kieran and Emily move through 
           the crowd towards him. 

                                 EMILY
                        Burke talks in bed more than any 
                        other man. Always bragging about 
                        how no man can take his left. 

           Kieran takes off his shirt and enters the circle. 

                                 KIERAN
                        Time to test the mettle.
                                 EMILY
                        Stay away from his left! 

           Kieran walks to the chalk line drawn on the wood floor. His 
           toe touches it and Burke throws a lightning fast left to 
           Kieran’s jaw, dropping him. Emily winces.  

           Burke smiles watching Kieran shake off the punch and get up. 
           Kieran toes the line and they engage. 

           Burke’s height makes it hard for Kieran to land anything, but 
           easy for Burke to pummel Kieran’s head from above. The 
           lumberman goes down again.  

                                 EMILY (CONT’D)
                        His head is too high! Go for the 
                        body! 

           Kieran rises to the start the new round. 

                                 BURKE
                        No shame in staying down, mate.

           Kieran wobbles to the line. He covers his face with his arms 
           as Burke goes to work again, punching fiercely.

                                 EMILY
                        Fight back, lumberman! Hit him!

           Finally Kieran takes a quick step back causing Burke to take 
           a huge swing and a miss leaving him nearly turned around. 

           Kieran winds up as if he was going to take a chop at a 
           sycamore and heaves a left hook into Burke’s liver.

           Burke winces in pain. Kieran digs in another shot and 
           continues to attack the body as if he were chopping down a 
           tree until Burke goes down hard. 

           Kieran waits for him with his foot on the scratch. Burke 
           takes a few seconds to stand, his insides all mashed up. 

           Burke steps on the line and Kieran quickly goes back to 
           working the body. Burke can’t put anything on his punches. 

           Kieran dismantles him, moving from body shots to uppercuts to 
           the face. The beast in Kieran is unleashed, growling as he 
           turns Burke into a bloody mess, putting him down for good.

           The referee raises Kieran’s hand in victory. Emily 
           celebrates.

           VARIOUS SHOTS - KIERAN FIGHTING
           --Kieran faces various opponents, giving it as good as he 
           gets it, carried through by his hard head. 

           --Kieran takes out each opponent with vicious body shots. 
           Everyone focuses on the head while he crushes the organs. 

           --His hand is raised half a dozen times in victory, but each 
           paying a price of more cuts and wounds.

           --Kieran fighting a man twice as thick as he. Twice as slow 
           too. Kieran finds a groove, smashing his bare knuckles into 
           the wide man’s nose, sternum, kidneys. 

           The tavern owner walks to Emily. 

                                 TAVERN OWNER
                        I’ve never seen a man with such a 
                        bottom, as if he will never get 
                        tired. 

                                 EMILY
                        Think about him fighting Mike 
                        McCoole. 

                                 TAVERN OWNER
                        That would be a blood bath. A damn 
                        money brewing blood bath. 

           They smile at each other and both look to Kieran who knocks 
           the thick man on his ass and has his hand raised yet again. 

           INT. EMILY’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Emily and Kieran sit on her bed, sharing a bottle of whiskey.

                                 EMILY
                        That’s why you have to fight Bad 
                        Jack in the ring. 

                                 KIERAN
                        Only way to get to him without his 
                        bowery boys and coppers. 

                                 EMILY
                        If he knew you were alive he’d...

                                 KIERAN
                        Likely send a war party after me. 

                                 EMILY
                        Destine is a lucky woman. 
                                 KIERAN
                        How do you mean?

                                 EMILY
                        She’s got a man willing to fight 
                        the nastiest, hard-nosed brawlers 
                        to get back to her. 

           Kieran hands Emily the whiskey bottle. And crawls to a quilt 
           and pillow on the floor. 

                                 KIERAN
                        She’s my reason for breathing. I’m 
                        going to bed.  

           Emily stares wanting, jealous of such a love. 

           INT. SALOON BASEMENT - NIGHT

           Lester and one of his goons drag a man down the basement 
           stairs of Jack’s saloon. He has a potato sack on his head, 
           and something in his mouth preventing him from talking.  

           They sit him in a chair and tie his arms and legs tightly 
           with rope. He struggles mightily.

                                 LESTER
                        Calm yourself you dumb ox, or I’ll 
                        smash your skull in. 

           They get him secured. Bad Jack and The Politician are waiting 
           calmly, each with a drink in hand. 

           The Politician walks to the mysterious prisoner. 

                                 THE POLITICIAN
                        You listen good you so called 
                        champion of the west. These boys 
                        are going to say some things, and 
                        you’re going to follow every word 
                        as if it was God himself in your 
                        ear. You cross me and I’ll turn 
                        your insides out. Your friends, 
                        your family, any whore you ever put 
                        that needle dick in will be dead.

           The Politician takes a sip of whisky and winks at Jack as he 
           heads up the stairs. Jack throws back his drink and gives the 
           go ahead for the goon to take off the potato sack. 

           He does, exposing CON OREM, with a metal chain wrapped in his 
           mouth. Jack steps forward with a greasy smirk. 
                                 BAD JACK
                        Con Orem. I hear you’re mastered. 
                        But you ain’t too smart. Nobody bad-
                        mouths me in the papers.  

           Jack pulls out a mallet from the back of his trousers. Orem’s 
           eyes go wide with horror.  

           INT. JACK’S SUITE - NIGHT

           Destine stumbles out of Jack’s suite with an overflowing cup 
           of wine spilling about. Gideon is standing just outside the 
           door and he grabs her arm.

                                 GIDEON
                        Not tonight. Jack wants you here 
                        when he gets back. 

                                 DESTINE
                        Perhaps I don’t want to be here 
                        when Jack gets back. 

           Destine tries to wiggle free but Gideon’s hand is clamped 
           down like a vice grip. He pushes her back into the room.

                                 GIDEON
                        Just do as your told!

           He slams the door shut. 

           INT. SALOON BASEMENT - NIGHT

           WHACK! Jack slams the mallet down on Orem’s left hand. Orem 
           screams through his chain. 

                                 BAD JACK
                        Who’s a dandy now?!

           CRUNCH! He slams the mallet down again on the same hand. Bad 
           Jack tosses the weapon to the ground.

                                 BAD JACK (CONT’D)
                             (to Lester)
                        Let him know. 

           Jack walks off up the stairs. 

                                 LESTER
                        You have a week before the fight. 
                        The swelling will have gone down by 
                        then. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 LESTER (CONT'D)
                        If you let on to anybody about 
                        this, if the mob finds out, well -- 
                        I think you know.

           INT. OUTSIDE JACK’S SUITE - NIGHT

           Jack walks to his suite. Gideon stops him and whispers in his 
           ear. Jack grimaces.

                                 BAD JACK
                        I’ll take care of it. 

           INT. INSIDE JACK’S SUITE - CONTINUOUS

           Jack enters to see his room in a dark disarray. Dresser 
           drawers broken on the floor, furniture knocked over, clothes 
           strewn about, and Destine staring at him with defiant eyes 
           while slowly sipping her wine. 

                                 BAD JACK
                        Another fit of ill temper? 

                                 DESTINE
                        Did you do it?

                                 BAD JACK
                        Did I do what?

                                 DESTINE
                        Smash that boxer’s hand? 

           Jack moves to Destine. 

                                 DESTINE (CONT’D)
                        I have ears, you know.

           Jack pulls her up off the bed by her neckline. 

                                 BAD JACK
                        Careful, darling. Your lips can be 
                        your doom or your salvation.  

           He moves in for a kiss, but Destine springs away.

                                 DESTINE
                        I never thought the mighty Bad Jack 
                        would be afraid to fight fair.

           Jack snatches the glass from her hand.
                                 BAD JACK
                        I see you’ve drunken yourself into 
                        hysterics again.

                                 DESTINE
                        Give it back.

           She tries to take the chalice from Jack but he pushes her to 
           the ground and drinks the remaining wine himself. 

           Destine rises and pushes Jack. 

                                 DESTINE (CONT’D)
                        You won’t fight a grown man honest, 
                        but you’ll fight me?! 

           She pushes Jack again and again.

                                 DESTINE (CONT’D)
                        You’re not half the man Kieran was.

           BAM! Jack thumps her with an open hand across the mouth. 

                                 BAD JACK
                        I’m gonna have to call the fuckin’ 
                        head doctor on you. 

           Jack kicks his boots off and takes off his trousers in a 
           huff. He gets in bed and blows out the bedside lantern. 

           Destine crawls into the bed. She lays her arm affectionately 
           on Jack. He shoves it off and gives her his back. 

           Avoiding Jack’s affection, Destine smiles in satisfaction 
           with a mouth full of blood.

           INT. WASHROOM - DAY

           Kieran sits in the tub of the brothel washing himself. Emily 
           walks in wearing a towel which is quickly discarded leaving 
           her naked. Kieran covers up his man parts. 

                                 KIERAN
                        What in God’s grace are you doing?

           She quickly jumps in the tub with him.

                                 EMILY
                        Bath water don’t come cheap. Gotta 
                        share all we can. 

           She playfully splashes him and starts scrubbing herself. 
                                 KIERAN
                        Take my winnings. How much bath 
                        water will that buy? 

                                 EMILY
                        Don’t be teasing me now.

                                 KIERAN
                        I’m not. I can’t have you off 
                        working. I need you with me, 
                        guiding me and such.  

           Kieran makes a quick jerking movement. 

                                 KIERAN (CONT’D)
                        Watch where you put your feet.

                                 EMILY
                             (smiling)
                        Sorry. 

                                 KIERAN
                        Tell me about this bloak, Mike 
                        McCoole.

                                 EMILY
                        He’s stronger than a bull. When he 
                        fucks, I end up thrown all over the 
                        bed like some child’s doll. 

           Emily bites her lip thinking about it. 

                                 KIERAN
                        You like that sort of thing, do ya? 

                                 EMILY
                        Maybe. 

                                 KIERAN
                        If I beat McCoole, will I get a 
                        shot at Philadelphia’s champion?

                                 EMILY
                        Mordecai “the man killer” Murdoch? 
                        Coburn is set to fight him next, 
                        but if you beat McCoole in 
                        convincing fashion, I might be able 
                        to jump you up.

                                 KIERAN
                        What’s convincing?

                                 EMILY
                        Less than ten rounds. 
                                 KIERAN
                             (squirming)
                        Feet!

                                 EMILY
                        Ooh, my sincerest apologies. 

           INT. FARMHOUSE - NIGHT

           Lanterns and torches light the scene as the fancy surround a 
           structured ring, where hats already lie. Kieran takes off his 
           shirt. Emily stands behind him. 

                                 KIERAN
                        Less than ten rounds against him?

           They look over to a bearded Goliath of a man, MIKE MCCOOLE, 
           whose muscles sit on top of other muscles.

                                 EMILY
                        Forget his frame. Men say the soft 
                        spot is his floating rib. 

           McCoole stretches his hands over his head and his bottom 
           “floating” rib pops out distinctly. 

                                 EMILY (CONT’D)
                        Break that and you break him. 

           Kieran puts on his game face, his war face. 

                                 REFEREE
                        Toe the scratch!

           Each step furiously to the line and the fighting commences. 
           Kieran takes two shots to the face getting inside, but he 
           batters away at McCoole’s ribs. 

           McCoole slams his fists down on the back of Kieran’s neck. 
           Kieran almost goes down, but saves his balance. 

           Kieran bellows out a battle cry and rushes in, mashing up 
           McCoole’s ribs with blinding hooks. McCoole throws uppercuts, 
           but Kieran dodges and pounds McCoole’s face. 

           RIGHT, LEFT, RIGHT, LEFT he tears his enemy down with vicious 
           wrath. McCoole’s hands go up to protect his face. Kieran 
           loads up and smashes his fist into McCoole’s floating rib. 

           McCoole falls to the ground. The fancy boos and curses, most 
           of them having their money on the favorite. They look on 
           waiting for him to get up.
           The referee jumps in to examine the fighter. McCoole is 
           curled up, twitching. He can’t continue.

                                 REFEREE (CONT’D)
                        It’s over!

           The crowd goes silent. They all look to each other in wonder. 

                                 RANDOM MAN
                        One round? 

                                 ANOTHER MAN
                        One round?

                                 EMILY
                        ONE ROUND! 

           Kieran raises his hand in triumph. The crowd quickly cheers 
           realizing they have witnessed something spectacular, once in 
           a lifetime. Emily runs into the ring and hugs Kieran. 

                                 KIERAN
                        That convincing enough?!

           Kieran picks up Emily and spins her around.

           INT. KNOW NOTHINGS SALOON - NIGHT

           Bad Jack stands over a congregation of his feral Bowery boys 
           and drunkard admirers, all holding up libations. 

                                 BAD JACK
                        Let’s be honest, that milk-livered 
                        Orem never really stood a chance, 
                        did he? 

                                 LESTER
                        You trounced him good, Jack! 

                                 GIDEON
                        To the champion!

           They all drink and cheer. Destine wears the only frown in the 
           joint, drinking alone in the corner. Jack walks to her.

                                 BAD JACK
                        What will it take to put a smile on 
                        that fine face? An English country 
                        dance?

           Jack kicks his feet and spins around clapping. Destine 
           doesn’t even smile. Jack moves in for a hug.  
                                 BAD JACK (CONT’D)
                        There must be something I can do to 
                        make you-

           Jack catches a whiff of something foul. He backs away.

                                 BAD JACK (CONT’D)
                        You reek of shit, woman. 

                                 DESTINE
                        My apologies. Should I just go 
                        upstairs then?

                                 BAD JACK
                        Upstairs?

           Bad Jack smolders. 

                                 BAD JACK (CONT’D)
                        You must really think I’m daft. 

           Jack grabs her and jerks her to the stage. 

                                 BAD JACK (CONT’D)
                        Look here lads! We got some new 
                        entertainment. 

           Jack rips off Destine’s dress leaving her in nothing but a 
           corset and bloomers. He hurls her onto the stage and pulls 
           his pistol from his belt.

                                 BAD JACK (CONT’D)
                        Let me hear one of your French 
                        numbers.

           Destine slowly rises to her feet. BAM. Jack fires a hole 
           through the ceiling. 

                                 BAD JACK (CONT’D)
                        Sing!

           With a shaky voice, Destine sings a French song. Jack grabs a 
           nearby pitcher and flings the ale onto Destine.

                                 BAD JACK (CONT’D)
                        You can do better than that!

           Destine sings louder, but other men begin to chuck ale at her 
           as well. One drunkard throws an empty bottle crashing against 
           the wall behind her. 

           Destine continues to sing while being pelted with peanuts, 
           food, and drink. She cringes with humiliation, trying 
           desperately not to sob. 
                                 BAD JACK (CONT’D)
                        Enough!

           The mob stops as Jack jumps onto the stage. 

                                 BAD JACK (CONT’D)
                        I trust now you’ll bathe.

           Destine rushes off upstairs. 

           EXT. DOCKS - NIGHT

           This is the biggest, most rowdy, and ruthless fancy we have 
           seen since Bad Jack’s opening fight, all here to see the 
           championship of Philadelphia.

           Two teenagers push each other in argument.

                                 TEENAGER 1
                        The lumberman has no chance! The 
                        Man Killer is going to trounce him 
                        good I tell ya!

                                 TEENAGER 2
                        The lumberman beat McCoole in one 
                        round you twat. He’s mastered! No 
                        man can beat him! 

           The liquored up gamblers all scream out wagers for The 
           Lumberman and MORDECAI THE MAN KILLER MURDOCH, a dark hairy 
           stud with a broad formidable chest and long muscular limbs. 

           Emily stands outside of the ropes rubbing Kieran’s shoulders.

                                 KIERAN
                        Why is he called man killer?

                                 EMILY
                        He’s killed men in the ring?  

                                 KIERAN
                        Fitting title. Any advice? 

                                 EMILY
                        Don’t give up first.

           Both fighters walk to the line and IT’S ON. Kieran ducks 
           under the Man Killer’s hooks and pushes him back on his heels 
           before unloading an arsenal of uppercuts. 

           What proceeds is a symphony of blood. Fists smashing against 
           flesh, against bone, back and forth, round after round as 
           both men refuse to wear down. 
           Mordecai’s right eye is swollen shut, Kieran’s left eye is. 
           Both fighters are red and bruised all over. 

           They smash against each other like butting rams, throwing all 
           their grit an determination into every punch. Kieran is 
           hammered across his chin and falls to his back. 

           He rolls to his side, his head stuck to the floor like glue. 
           He gets an arm under him and tries to push up, but his 
           strength fails him. 

           The crowd cheers for him to get back to his feet. Kieran 
           pushes with his head and manages to get to his knees. 

           Kieran puts one foot on the ground and pushes himself up to 
           his feet, somehow finding the strength to go on. The crowd 
           explodes with noise. 

           Murdoch stands sluggish, exhausted, devastated that Kieran 
           didn’t stay down. 

           Kieran shakes out his arms trying to get the blood flowing 
           ready for another painful round. 

           The fighters drag themselves to the scratch and Murdoch 
           immediately ties up Kieran and tries to throw him down. 

                                 EMILY (CONT’D)
                        The body! Hit the body!

           Kieran musters his last ounce of strength digging his right 
           hand into the Man Killer’s body. 

           Murdoch holds on to Kieran’s neck. Kieran grinds out a few 
           more body shots and strips his opponents grip. 

           Murdoch stumbles forward trying to grab Kieran for support, 
           then staggers backward toward the ropes. Finally the man 
           killer face-plants onto the floor. 

           Kieran watches, desperately hoping it’s over, as the ref 
           flips Murdoch on to his back. The referee waives his arms in 
           the air. Kieran falls to his knees in victory.

           Emily rushes into the ring, throwing herself into Kieran’s 
           arms as the crowd goes wild. 

           INT. JACK’S SUITE - WASHROOM - NIGHT

           Jack sits on a stool next to the tub where Destine soaks.
                                 BAD JACK
                        I hate hurting you. All I want is 
                        for us to be together and care for 
                        each other. Why won’t you let us?

           Destine keeps her eyes forward. She won’t even look at Jack. 
           He rises knocking his stool back against the wall and exits.

           INT. EMILY’S ROOM - NIGHT 

           Kieran lays on the floor. Emily, wearing only her knickers, 
           looks down from her bed.

                                 EMILY
                        The champion of Philadelphia 
                        shouldn’t be sleeping on the floor. 

                                 KIERAN
                        I don’t mind. You got word to the 
                        paper, the Herald? 

                                 EMILY
                        I did. Maybe I mind you sleeping 
                        down there.  

           She jumps off her bed and lays beside Kieran who stirs with 
           heavy thoughts. 

                                 EMILY (CONT’D)
                        What’s wrong? You did it. You won. 
                        You should be happy. 

           Kieran turns to her. 

                                 KIERAN
                        I’m the champ of all that is wrong 
                        in our society. Bare knuckle boxing 
                        takes the people’s good moral 
                        fibers and turns them rotten.

                                 EMILY
                        Then stop fighting.

           She kisses him. He pulls away.

                                 KIERAN
                        What are you doing?

                                 EMILY
                        We made enough money to go anywhere 
                        we want. You don’t have to fight 
                        Bad Jack to have me.
           She reaches her hand down to his manhood and kisses him 
           again. It feels good. He doesn’t want to stop but has to. He 
           pulls away.

                                 KIERAN
                        We can’t.

                                 EMILY
                        Can you not love me because I’m a 
                        whore? 

           Kieran strokes her face.

                                 KIERAN
                        You are more than worthy of my 
                        love. It’s a wonder that every man 
                        who shares your bed doesn’t ask for 
                        your hand in marriage.    

           Emily’s heart melts and she wants Kieran even more for his 
           words. She tucks herself into his arms.

                                 EMILY
                        Can I sleep beside you, and pretend 
                        I’m yours.

                                 KIERAN
                        Come here.

           Kieran wraps his arms around her. 

           INT. KNOW NOTHINGS SALOON - DAY

           Gideon bursts through the front door in a huff.

                                 GIDEON
                        Jack! Jack!

           Jack is sitting at the bar with Destine. 

                                 GIDEON (CONT’D)
                        Have a look at this. 

           He hands him a paper. Jack looks. He turns flush with malice.

                                 BAD JACK (CONT’D)
                        Again! Calling me out in the God 
                        damn Herald! Who the fuck is this, 
                        this lumberman?! 

           All the patrons watch Jack explode with anger. 
                                 GIDEON
                        Nobody knows his real name, sir. 

                                 DESTINE
                        Lumberman? Like the killer from the 
                        war. 

                                 GIDEON
                        That’s right.

                                 BAD JACK
                        Won’t have no axe in the ring with 
                        me. Talk to The Politician. Set the 
                        fight. 

           Gideon runs off.

                                 BAD JACK (CONT’D)
                        Gideon! We fight here, in New York.

           INT. EMILY’S ROOM - DAY

           Emily is packing clothes into a knapsack. Kieran enters.

                                 KIERAN
                        What do you think you’re doing?

                                 EMILY
                        Getting ready for New York. 

                                 KIERAN
                        You can’t come with.

                                 EMILY
                        I ain’t gonna put any moves on ya. 

                                 KIERAN
                        It’s too dangerous. 

                                 EMILY
                        That’s why you need me. And I 
                        figure maybe I can start a new 
                        life. Go where nobody knows me as a-

                                 KIERAN
                        You risk too much for me. 

                                 EMILY
                        I want to see you get back to your 
                        woman, Kieran Connelly. I won’t 
                        rest ‘til that comes true. 

           Kieran hugs her tight. 
           EXT. ROAD - DAY

           Rain pours down, thunder roars, and lightning strikes as 
           Kieran steers a wagon with Emily laying in the back covering 
           up. He turns the wagon down a small path.

                                 EMILY
                        Stay straight. This road leads 
                        directly to the city. 

                                 KIERAN
                        We can’t go into the city just yet. 

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY

           The harsh storm makes the midday seem like night. 

                                 KIERAN
                        Wait here.

           Kieran gets out of the wagon. Emily curls up under a blanket. 

           Kieran walks around the back of the farmhouse to see a man 
           chopping wood. As Kieran approaches, the man stops mid swing. 

                                 MAN
                        State your business. 

                                 KIERAN
                        Blood. 

           The man turns revealing himself to be Cillian. They shake 
           hands and hug. Cillian examines the wounds and new scars on 
           Kieran’s face.

                                 CILLIAN
                        What the devil have you been doing? 
                        Wrestling with wolves?

           Kieran laughs.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Kieran and Cillian approach the wagon. 

                                 KIERAN
                        Emily, meet Cillian. The man who 
                        got me through the war. A real hero 
                        he is.

           Emily crawls out of the wagon to shake Cillian’s hand.
                                 EMILY
                        Pleasure to make your acquaintance.

                                 CILLIAN
                        I assure you the pleasure is mine. 
                        Let’s get you out of this rain. 

           INT. CILLIAN’S FARMHOUSE - DAY

           Emily warm herself by the fireplace drinking coffee staring 
           through the window at Cillian with girlish eyes.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - CONTINUOUS

           Kieran and Cillian are chopping wood. Cillian is good, but 
           can not match the intensity of the lumberman’s stroke. 

                                 CILLIAN
                        You aim to hide out ‘til the fight?

                                 KIERAN
                        I aim to announce myself right out 
                        in the open like. 

                                 CILLIAN
                        If Jack sees you alive, he’ll kill 
                        you, as sure as I’m standing here.

                                 KIERAN
                        Not if we rally the people. All the 
                        Irish in New York are treated like 
                        dirt. When they see one of their 
                        own risin’ up from nothing, not 
                        afraid to take on Jack and his top 
                        hats...we’ll have a horde of 
                        protectors at our back. 

                                 CILLIAN
                        Putting your life in the hands of 
                        the people is a mighty risk.

                                 KIERAN
                        Bad Jack thinks he’s untouchable 
                        like some kind of King. I’m going 
                        to burn his castle down. 

           INT. BAD JACK’S SUITE - NIGHT

           Jack stumbles in his room, visibly drunk. He takes off his 
           shirt and trips on the foot of the piano. His pistol falls 
           from his belt and slides across the floor. 
           Destine stirs and wakes. Jack takes down his trousers and 
           tosses them. 

           Destine slinks back against the headboard as Jack pounces 
           onto the bed. He climbs on top of her.

                                 BAD JACK
                        You’re not getting away tonight. 

           Jack shoves his tongue down Destine’s throat. He feels her up 
           then reaches down in between her legs. 

                                 BAD JACK (CONT’D)
                        Give me that quim. I need it.

           Destine stops his hand. Jack grabs both of her wrists and 
           slams them against the headboard. 

                                 BAD JACK (CONT’D)
                        Don’t make me force you or I’ll tie 
                        ya up on stage and let every hard 
                        cock in the points have a go at 
                        you!  

           Destine turns her head and lets Jack take her. Her eyes lock 
           on an item on the floor. Jack’s PISTOL. 

           She stares at it as Jack pounds her from the top. Each thrust 
           feeds her vengeance and sharpens her focus on the gun. 

           INT. WASHROOM - NIGHT

           Kieran sits with a fresh haircut, Emily now shaving his 
           beard. 

                                 EMILY
                        Your war hero friend, Cillian, does 
                        he have a woman? 

                                 KIERAN
                        Why, do you fancy him? 

                                 EMILY
                        You hush. You didn’t tell him about 
                        my former work in Philadelphia, did 
                        you?

                                 KIERAN
                        Any man who looks down on you for 
                        that, doesn’t deserve you. 

           Emily smiles and scrapes the last bit of his beard. She wipes 
           clean the loose hairs and shaving cream.
                                 KIERAN (CONT’D)
                        And no, I didn’t tell him. 

           Kieran looks in the mirror. He stares at all his scars. 

                                 KIERAN (CONT’D)
                        I wonder if she’ll recognize me.

                                 EMILY
                        You’re as handsome a man as I’ve 
                        ever seen. ‘cept maybe for Cillian.

           Cillian pops through the door and Emily blushes. 

                                 CILLIAN
                        I made a bed up for you Miss Emily. 
                        I hope it’s suitable. 

           Cillian extends his arm and Emily takes it. He leads her out. 
           Kieran gives one last stare into the mirror. 

           INT. BAD JACK’S SUITE - MORNING

           Destine lays beneath Jack’s heavy body, draped on top of her. 
           She attempts to slide from beneath him, but his arms are 
           wrapped tight around her.  

           She lifts his arm to roll him off and suddenly he pops up 
           awake. He looks at Destine then sits up off the side of the 
           bed, shaking his head. 

                                 BAD JACK
                        Bloody southern whiskey. 

           He looks at his trousers on the floor and stands to get 
           dressed, but Destine pulls him back to the bed.

                                 DESTINE
                        Lay back now. I’ll fetch you some 
                        ale to cure that queasiness. 

           Jack grabs her arms and examines her. 

                                 DESTINE (CONT’D)
                        I don’t want to be on that stage 
                        ever, Jack.

           She kisses him. He releases her and lays back, rubbing his 
           eyes and smiling. 

           CLICK. Jack looks up to see Destine pointing his cocked 
           pistol at him. He quickly stands up.
                                 DESTINE (CONT’D)
                        Stay right there! 

           Jack stops and stares with anger.

                                 BAD JACK
                        You’re going to shoot the only man 
                        who cares for you? 

                                 DESTINE
                        You will never hurt me again. 

           Jack steps closer to her.

                                 BAD JACK
                        Go on then. Put me out of my 
                        misery. 

           She closes her eyes and squeezes the trigger. Nothing. The 
           gun is not loaded. Destine’s courage is gone in an instant. 
           Now only sadness.

                                 DESTINE
                        No. 

           Jack slowly closes in.

                                 BAD JACK
                        I told you not to hurt me again. I 
                        warned you.

           WHAP! He smashes his fist into Destine’s face, knocking her 
           out cold. 

           INT. SALOON BASEMENT - DAY

           Destine sits tied to a chair. Her right eye is swollen shut. 
           Lester, Gideon, and Bad Jack stand across from her. 

                                 BAD JACK
                        What do you think I should do with 
                        her, Lester? 

                                 LESTER
                        I think she’d fit in just fine with 
                        the topless lady fighters. 

                                 BAD JACK
                        With those tits. She would bring in 
                        a crowd, indeed. 
                                 GIDEON
                        I could take her off your hands. 
                        I’d take proper care of her. 

                                 BAD JACK
                        HA! Take her for your own? 

           Jack sits on Destine’s lap facing her. 

                                 BAD JACK (CONT’D)
                        It seems the power of your beauty  
                        is still in tact, even if your face 
                        is not. A power that even now, 
                        after your betrayal, I cannot seem 
                        to shed. 
                             (to the men) 
                        Leave us.

           Lester and Gideon exit. Jack softens, touching her skin.

                                 BAD JACK (CONT’D)
                        Why am I so impossible for you to 
                        love? Other women crave to lay with 
                        the champion. But not you. Not the 
                        one I want. 

                                 DESTINE
                        You’re an animal. A disgusting rat.   

                                 BAD JACK
                        You never felt anything? Not even 
                        in the beginning?

                                 DESTINE
                        Never.

           Jack begins breaking down.

                                 BAD JACK
                        I’m too at home around pain. I’m 
                        lost without it. I’ll never be Good 
                        Jack. My father should have killed 
                        me.   

           He blubbers all over her. 

                                 BAD JACK (CONT’D)
                        What if I still took care of you? 
                        No priggin’ or nothing. We could 
                        just lay with each other.  

                                 DESTINE
                        I’d rather die. 
           Destine’s words hit Jack harder than any fighter could. He’s 
           crushed. He floods with rage. He grabs Destine’s face and 
           squeezes hard. 

                                 BAD JACK
                        How would you like to go?

           Gideon enters the basement.

                                 LESTER
                        Jack! The lumberman’s here. In 
                        Paradise square. 

           Destine smiles wide. Even laughs a little.

                                 BAD JACK
                        You got nothing to smile about?

                                 DESTINE
                        I read all about The Lumberman. 
                        They say he cannot be killed. That 
                        he drinks the blood of his enemies. 
                        Soon he will drink yours. 

                                 BAD JACK
                        We’ll see about that.

           Jack pushes Destine to the floor by her face and stomps up 
           the stairs.

           EXT. PARADISE SQUARE - MIDDAY 

           Hundreds of enthused fans stand around a stage with a tent 
           behind it. A banner reads “Bad Jack versus The Lumberman.” 

           Emily addresses the mob.  

                                 EMILY
                        Ladies and Gentlemen, I present to 
                        you the man who bested twenty of 
                        Philadelphia’s finest pugilists in 
                        one night! The beast who put down 
                        Mike McCoole in one round!

           Bad Jack and Gideon push through the crowd. 

                                 EMILY (CONT’D)
                        He beat Mordecai the Man Killer 
                        Murdoch. Now he will best Bad Jack 
                        for the championship of America!

           Jack jumps onto the stage and the cheering fancy go quiet. 
                                 BAD JACK
                        Where is he?! This man who is 
                        assured to beat me? 

           INT. TENT - CONTINUOUS

           Kieran leans over a table steadying himself for this epic 
           reunion. He looks at the notches on his axe.

                                 BAD JACK (O.S.)
                        You dare make the champion wait! 
                        I’ll have your head on a stake, 
                        Lumberman! Do not forget what city 
                        you stand in. 

           EXT. STAGE - CONTINUOUS

           Kieran bursts out of the tent carrying his axe. The crowd 
           unleashes a deafening roar, the two boxers now face to face. 

           Shock and disbelief shroud Jack seeing a man who should be 
           dead standing before him. Confusion. Rage. 

                                 BAD JACK
                        Connelly?  

                                 KIERAN
                        Ready to pay for your wrongs? The 
                        price is blood. 

           A sketch artist draws the scene. Jack looks at the axe. 

                                 BAD JACK
                        You’re the mad lumberman? 

                                 KIERAN
                        With just enough room on my axe for 
                        one more notch.  

                                 BAD JACK
                        For me? I hope you brought your 
                        brigade ‘cause it’s gonna take an 
                        army to stop me from butchering 
                        you. 

           Kieran turns from Jack, out to the fancy.

                                 KIERAN
                        I may fight out of Philadelphia, 
                        but I come from NEW YORK!

           The crowd is all ears and excited.
                                 KIERAN (CONT’D)
                        You have read about my exploits in 
                        The Herald, but before the war I 
                        labored as a lumberman while living 
                        underneath St. Joseph’s church. 
                        Like you, I walked these streets 
                        bowing my head to the corrupt top 
                        hats. I bow no more. My name is 
                        Kieran Connelly! I FIGHT FOR THE 
                        IRISH!

           The crowd goes off. It is an overwhelming ruckus and an 
           inspiring sight. Kieran holds the axe high over his head.

                                 BAD JACK
                        Well played, Lumberman.  

           INT. KNOW NOTHINGS SALOON - DAY

           Jack walks up to Lester who is sweating all over an innocent 
           young lady, crudely caressing her.

                                 BAD JACK
                        Lester, I’ve been meaning to ask 
                        you. Which man killed Destine’s old 
                        sweetheart Kieran Connelly? 

                                 LESTER
                        Umm, that would be Ed Ward. 

                                 BAD JACK
                        Could you round him up for me? 

           Jack lifts a pistol from behind his back and scratches his 
           forehead. Lester quivers. 

                                 LESTER
                        I would if I could, but he was 
                        murdered just last month. 

                                 BAD JACK
                        You don’t say? 

                                 LESTER
                        Yeah, stabbed by a couple of 
                        niggers if I remember correctly. 

                                 BAD JACK
                             (facetious)
                        Oh those pesky niggers. What did he 
                        do with Connelly’s body? 
                                 LESTER
                        What’s this about, Jack?

                                 BAD JACK
                        Where’s his body?!

                                 LESTER
                        S-sold it. He said he sold it. 

                                 BAD JACK
                        That’s odd seeing as how the man I 
                        am to fight for the title of 
                        America, the killer lumberman, is 
                        Kieran fucking Connelly, you laced 
                        up pigeon lover!

           The butt of Jack’s pistol flies towards Lester’s face. SMACK! 

           EXT. PARADISE SQUARE - EVENING

           With Lester, busted up from Jack’s pistol, and Gideon, Bad 
           Jack marches towards the mob with fifty heavily armed Bowery 
           boys, pulling Destine whose arms are tied behind her back. 

           ON THE STAGE

           Enthusiastic patrons of the fancy surround Kieran. Emily 
           stands back at the steps.  

                                 FANCY 1 
                        I was at the McCoole fight, sir. 
                        You were magnificent.  

                                 KIERAN
                        Thank you. 

           Jack and his gang become visible behind Kieran.

                                 BAD JACK
                        Lumberman!

           Kieran ignores Jack and continues shaking hands.

                                 FANCY 2
                        Let me be the first to buy you a 
                        pint in New York. 

                                 KIERAN
                        That’d be great.

                                 BAD JACK
                        Lumberman!
           Still Kieran ignores.  

                                 DESTINE
                        KIERAN!

           Kieran turns around and looks out over the crowd. Destine can 
           hardly believe her eyes as she and Kieran finally lay eyes on 
           one another. 

           Jack grabs Destine harshly around her throat.

                                 BAD JACK
                        I thought maybe you would want to 
                        meet my woman. Unless, wait, do you 
                        two already know each other?

                                 KIERAN
                        You call her your woman, but it is 
                        my name she screams! 

           The crowd looks on in awe. Behind Jack, Gideon ties a noose 
           around a wooden street awning. 

                                 BAD JACK
                        You want her back? Come get her! 

           Jack viciously throws Destine on a chair and pulls the noose 
           tight around her neck.

           Kieran grabs his axe and leaps off the stage into the crowd. 
           Jack kicks the chair and Destine dangles by her neck. 

                                 EMILY
                        Kieran, no! They’ll kill you.

           Kieran doesn’t flinch. Lester sees Emily. He looks at her 
           familiarly.

                                 LESTER
                             (to himself)
                        Can’t be.

           Kieran barrels his way through the crowded square towards the 
           Bowery Boys. Jack grips his pistol behind his back. 

                                 BAD JACK
                        Come on, lad. Come on. 

           Kieran readies his axe as he closes in on Jack’s gang, all 
           ready to kill the lumberman.

           Suddenly a gunshot rings out. Destine’s rope breaks and she 
           falls to the ground. 
           All stop and look to Cillian, whose face is hidden dark by a 
           cloak, holding his smoking breechloader, standing beside 
           GRADY and his gang of CHICHESTERS.

           Cillian quickly reloads, as Grady moves up just behind 
           Kieran.

                                 CILLIAN
                        Next one is through your skull Bad 
                        Jack.

                                 GRADY
                        What’s the matter champ? Too afraid 
                        to face an Irishman in the ring? 
                        Gotta mob deep on him in the 
                        streets?

                                 BAD JACK
                        Come a little closer and say that, 
                        fat man. I fear nothing!    

                                 KIERAN
                        Then let’s fight. You and me. Right 
                        here, right now. 

                                 BAD JACK
                        With pleasure. Circle it up! 

           The crowd forms a circle around the fighters. Jack hands 
           Gideon his pistol and pulls his shirt off. Kieran follows. 

           Lester grabs Destine and drags her to the front row. Gideon 
           draws the scratch with the barrel of the gun, then backs 
           away.

                                 GIDEON
                        Toe the scratch!

           No hesitation. Kieran and Jack walk to the line with 
           conviction. Just as they reach it:

           KABOOM! A canon fires a lead ball through the air, smashing 
           into the brick wall of a neighboring building.

           THE POLITICIAN stands with a darkly dressed militia, all 
           pointing rifles and pistols at the scene. 

                                 THE POLITICIAN
                        Nobodies turning the championship 
                        of America into a side street 
                        brawl. Disperse! The lot of you!

           The crowd breaks up, and the masses flee the scene.
           INT. THE POLITICIAN’S OFFICE - NIGHT 

           Smoke swirls as The Politician fumes.  

                                 THE POLITICIAN
                        God damn you Jack. You have run 
                        wild for too long. Hanging his 
                        woman in the square!

                                 BAD JACK
                        I should have strung them both up. 

                                 THE POLITICIAN
                        Connelly has the Irish gangs at his 
                        back, which means you’re going to-

                                 BAD JACK
                        You’re afraid of the Irish gangs? 

                                 THE POLITICIAN
                        You’re going to let him alone to do 
                        promotions so that every Irishman 
                        in the city will bet on him! You 
                        saw them. They think he’s their 
                        savior. When you beat him, it’ll be 
                        the biggest purse in history. 

                                 BAD JACK
                        Unlike you fat cat, I don’t care 
                        about money.  

                                 THE POLITICIAN
                        Do you wish to make an enemy of me? 

                                 BAD JACK
                        I wish to cut off Frenchy’s head 
                        and send it to that blockhead on a 
                        fucking platter! 

                                 THE POLITICIAN
                        If she’s dead Connelly won’t fight! 
                        The bout is only two God damn days 
                        away so put your rage to bed for 
                        Christ sake! 

           Jack stares down the tubby top hat.

                                 BAD JACK
                        My rage does not rest. 

                                 THE POLITICIAN
                        Do not fuck with me on this.

           Jack spits on the floor and exits.
           INT. HOTEL BATHROOM - NIGHT 

           Kieran sits in a bath. Emily pours water over him. 

                                 KIERAN
                        I keep imagining what he is doing 
                        to her. Hurting her, or worse. 

                                 EMILY
                        Hush now. She’s gonna be fine.

           Emily kisses Kieran’s shoulder and holds him tight. 

                                 KIERAN
                        Part of me wants to walk into his 
                        saloon and bury my axe in his 
                        heart. Let his men kill me and meet 
                        Destine in the afterlife.  

           Emily strokes his back to calm his dark thoughts. 

           INT. KNOW NOTHINGS BASEMENT - NIGHT

           Destine lays sleeping. A pebble hits her face and she stirs.  
           A larger pebble strikes her and she wakes to see Gideon 
           sitting across from her with a handful of stones.

           She lunges at him, but her hands shackled and chained to 
           metal rings in the wall

                                 GIDEON
                        That’s right. Jack doesn’t want you 
                        going anywhere. 

           Destine responds with a cold stare. 

                                 GIDEON (CONT’D)
                        I remember that first day you was 
                        singing on the stage up there. You 
                        sure was beautiful. 

           Gideon wipes the grease dripping on his forehead. 

                                 GIDEON (CONT’D)
                        If Jack didn’t make a move I think 
                        I was gonna have to. Do you 
                        remember seeing me that night? 

                                 DESTINE
                        I make it a point not to remember 
                        sewer garbage. 

           Gideon heaves the entire handful of rocks at Destine’s face.
                                 GIDEON
                        I take back everything I said! 

           He pulls out his knife.

                                 GIDEON (CONT’D)
                        You’re gonna start being nicer to 
                        me. 

           INT. JACK’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Lester pours Jack and himself a glass of whiskey. 

                                 BAD JACK
                        That Jack-Rabbit politician putting 
                        money before my pride.

                                 LESTER
                        Best the lumberman in the ring and 
                        then we can get nasty. What’s the 
                        problem?

                                 BAD JACK
                        The problem is I want Connelly in 
                        agony now!  

                                 LESTER
                        I’ll do anything to help you, Jack. 

                                 BAD JACK
                        That doesn’t ever need be said out 
                        loud. It’s a given. 

                                 LESTER
                        What about his black lady friend? I 
                        could pay the bobtail a visit. Take 
                        a stroll down her cock alley or 
                        maybe even her blind cupid?

           Jack nods with permission. Lester is giddy at the thought.

           EXT. KINGS HOTEL - DAY

           Emily adjusts Kieran’s coat on the front steps of the hotel. 

                                 KIERAN
                        Don’t leave the hotel for anything. 

                                 EMILY
                        I’d feel safer going with you.

           Cillian approaches in his cloak. 
                                 CILLIAN
                        Destine is locked up in the 
                        basement of Jack’s saloon.

                                 EMILY
                        You been out all night? 

                                 CILLIAN
                        There’s only a few guards.

                                 KIERAN
                        Grady’s at the square. Let’s get 
                        him and-

                                 CILLIAN
                        This is a job for a ghost, not a 
                        gang, so do your promotions as 
                        scheduled. Emily, you stay in the 
                        hotel like Kieran says. 

           Emily huffs.

                                 CILLIAN (CONT’D)
                        Promise me.

           Emily is turned on by Cillian’s care for her safety.

                                 EMILY
                        I promise. 

           Cillian moves off down the road. Kieran walks the other way, 
           immediately swarmed by a flock of devoted Irishmen. 

           Pulling back we see Lester watching from a distance. He 
           stares deviously at Emily who walks back into the hotel. 

           EXT. PARADISE SQUARE - DAY

           A huge crowd surrounds the stage where Kieran and Grady put 
           on boxing gloves. 

                                 KIERAN
                        Thanks for having my back, Grady. 

                                 GRADY
                        You fight for the Irish and we 
                        fight for you. 

           INT. KINGS HOTEL - DAY

           Lester walks up the stairs with a cocky grin. He lurches down 
           the hallway, scraping his billy club along the wall.
           He stops at a door and knocks. 

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Emily quickly pops up from laying on the bed. She looks 
           around not sure what to do. More knocking.

                                 LESTER (O.S.)
                             (soft tone)
                        It’s the police. We have questions 
                        for the occupant of this room. 

           Instantly Emily puts her hand over her mouth in a panicked 
           attempt to stay quiet. Her eyes go bugged with fear. More 
           knocking. 

           She curls herself into a ball, frightened to the core. 

                                 LESTER (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Anyone there? Nobody is in. I guess 
                        we’ll be off then. 

           A few silent moments pass. She puts her ear to the hinge of 
           the door. Nothing. She peeks through the keyhole. 

           BOOM! The door is kicked open, smashing Emily’s face, sending 
           her flying to the ground. Lester kicks the door shut behind 
           him and stalks towards her.

                                 LESTER (CONT’D)
                        Hello dear. Recognize me? 

           Emily is dazed from the blow and struggles to gain focus.

                                 LESTER (CONT’D)
                        Last time I was in Philadelphia, my 
                        brother and I went to this proper 
                        bawdy house, no dirty puzzles or 
                        nothing. I had me this sweet 
                        freckled beauty who gobbled up my 
                        cock like it was a Thanksgiving 
                        feast. And if I’m not mistaken, my 
                        brother had you. 

           Emily wipes blood from her face, looking up in terror. 

                                 LESTER (CONT’D)
                        He said you bounced that buttered 
                        bun on his whore pipe like no one 
                        he’s ever seen. I told him there 
                        was no way some blackie was as good 
                        as my redhead, but he insisted. 
                        Today I find out. 
                                 EMILY
                        No, please.

           She scoots back and puts her hand up in defense.

           EXT. PARADISE SQUARE - DAY

           Kieran demonstrates punching on Grady for the crowd. 

                                 KIERAN
                        I use my legs and hip, driving 
                        forward just as if I was chopping  
                        with my axe.

           Kieran delivers a left hook softly to Grady’s abdomen. 

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY

           Lester delivers a left hook harshly to Emily’s face. He bends 
           her over the bed and, rips her undergarments to shreds. 

                                 LESTER
                        What are you crying for? This is 
                        your profession. 

           EXT. PARADISE SQUARE - DAY

           Grady takes off his gloves and turns to the crowd.

                                 GRADY
                        Who has the sand to go a round with 
                        the undefeated Irishman? 

           Hands go up in droves, all wanting a piece of the spotlight. 

                                 GRADY (CONT’D)
                        You sir. Come on up.

           A short stubby man, HORATIO, quickly jumps on the stage and 
           snatches the gloves from Grady. Horatio immediately swings on 
           Kieran who quickly bobs out of the way.

                                 KIERAN
                        Woah, calm down, lad. 

           Horatio is dead serious, flailing away. Finally, BAM! Kieran 
           punches the wild man’s liver, dropping him. The crowd roars 
           with excitement. 

                                 KIERAN (CONT’D)
                        You asked for it. 
           INT. KNOW NOTHINGS SALOON - DAY

           No longer cloaked, Cillian walks through the front door of 
           the saloon as Bad Jack is walking out. They hit shoulders. 

                                 CILLIAN
                        Sorry about that, champ.

           Jack exits. Cillian heads upstairs where Gideon is hand 
           feeding the roosters, his companions closest in intellect. 

                                 CILLIAN (CONT’D)
                        Who’s the toughest of the lot?

                                 GIDEON
                        I got my money on this one.

                                 CILLIAN
                        Why is that?

                                 GIDEON
                        Look at the size of him. 

                                 CILLIAN
                        Not always the biggest cock that 
                        wins. 

                                 GIDEON
                        That’s not what the whores say. 

           Gideon laughs at his own lame joke. 

                                 CILLIAN
                        What about the French whore?

           Gideon’s head snaps up.

                                 GIDEON
                        What do you know about her? 

                                 CILLIAN
                        Nothing, but I heard you do. I’ll 
                        pay ya to let me see her. 

           Gideon hesitates. Cillian pulls out a stack of bills.

                                 CILLIAN (CONT’D) (CONT’D)
                        You want to make some money or not? 

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY 

           Lester is pulling up his trousers. Emily lays half naked on 
           the floor, in a mess of blood. 
           Lester reaches into his pocket.

                                 LESTER
                        That’s the great thing about 
                        trollops. You can’t rape ‘em. You 
                        just owe them money after. 

           He throws a few coins at Emily, then exits. 

           INT. SALOON BASEMENT - DAY

           Gideon leads Cillian down into the basement.

                                 GIDEON
                        Have your look, but make it quick. 

           Cillian slowly moves to Destine. Her posture turns defensive, 
           examining Cillian’s motives. 

                                 DESTINE
                        Who are you?

           He moves closer.

                                 CILLIAN
                        I’ll pay ten dollars to see her 
                        naked. 

                                 DESTINE
                        You keep away from me.

           Gideon walks up behind Cillian.

                                 GIDEON
                        Ten dollars? Give it here.

           Instead of cash, Cillian pulls out a blade and slashes 
           Gideon’s throat. He holds the back of Gideon’s head leading 
           him silently to the ground. Cillian eyes Destine’s shackles.

                                 CILLIAN
                        Kieran sent me to get you out. 

           Destine smiles at her good fortune. Cillian rifles through 
           Gideon’s pockets. He looks under his collar. 

                                 CILLIAN (CONT’D)
                        Where is the key? 

                                 DESTINE
                        I don’t know.

           He pulls off Gideon’s boots. No key. The door creaks open. 
                                 GOON
                        Gideon! One of your damn roosters 
                        is running amok out here. 

           The goon heads down the steps. Each footstep clamors doom. 
           Cillian grips his blade. 

                                 GOON (CONT’D)
                        Gideon? 

           Off the last step the goon sees Gideon dead. Cillian rushes 
           him from behind and digs the blade into the goon’s ribs. The 
           goon backhands Cillian to the ground.

           The gorilla pulls the blade from his side as if it were a 
           needle prick and runs after Cillian.

                                 CILLIAN
                        Shyte. 

           The goon grabs up Cillian and smashes him against the wall 
           then bashes his heavy foot into Cillian’s face. 

           Destine kicks the goon from behind. The monster turns to 
           crush Destine when Cillian grabs Gideon’s club and smashes 
           the goon in the balls. 

           The monster goes down and Cillian bashes his head until he is 
           sure there is no coming back.

           Cillian rushes to Destine and tries to break the chain with 
           the club. He kicks the metal ring, but it is solid. 

                                 CILLIAN (CONT’D)
                        I have to go before more come. 

           He backs away.

                                 DESTINE
                        No, don’t go. Please.

                                 CILLIAN
                        I’m sorry. 

           Cillian exits, leaving Destine laying beside two dead men. 

           INT. KING’S HOTEL - EVENING 

           Kieran walks down the hall tired from the long day of 
           promotion. He comes upon the splintered hotel room door. 

                                 KIERAN
                        Emily?!
           INT. HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Kieran rushes in to see Emily tucked in the corner between 
           the bed and the wall, wrapped in a bloody sheet. 

           Kieran takes her in his arms and lays her across his chest. 

                                 KIERAN
                        What happened? Look at me, Emily. 
                        Look in my eyes.

           Emily stares blankly, traumatized. 

                                 KIERAN (CONT’D)
                        You’re safe now. I’m here. Say 
                        something. Look at me, please.

           Emily doesn’t move. Feeling helpless, Kieran hugs her tight.

                                 KIERAN (CONT’D)
                        This is all my fault. 

                                 CILLIAN
                        Who did this? 

           Sadness and anger shroud Cillian who charges to Emily’s side. 
           Seeing Cillian breaks Emily’s anguish. She finally blinks her 
           eyes. She clears her throat.

                                 EMILY
                        The c-copper. Lester. 

                                 KIERAN
                        That crook-pated bastard! 

                                 CILLIAN
                        You need stitches. 

           Cillian takes her from Kieran and carries her to the 
           washroom. Kieran follows.

                                 KIERAN
                        She’ll be alright? I mean you know 
                        how to...

                                 CILLIAN
                        Yeah.  

           Cillian cleans the blood off Emily’s face with a towel. 

                                 CILLIAN (CONT’D)
                        I’m gonna stitch you up and you’ll 
                        be as beautiful as ever. 
                                 KIERAN
                        You come alone -- without Destine. 

                                 CILLIAN
                        I tried. I killed Jack’s man 
                        Gideon, but I could not free her. 

           Kieran’s rage rises, passing the point of control. He grunts 
           as a beast and exits. 

           EXT. KNOW NOTHINGS SALOON - NIGHT

           Kieran walks down the dark sultry streets with is axe in 
           hand. He approaches the gang of three hundred cutthroats 
           standing guard outside of Bad Jack’s saloon. Some hold 
           torches, all hold weapons. 

                                 KIERAN
                        JACK! -- JACK! 

           After a moment, Jack slithers out to the balcony. 

                                 BAD JACK
                        Come to mope about your dark 
                        skinned friend? I hear she’s the 
                        best grind in town. 

           Jack laughs, taunting Kieran. 

                                 KIERAN
                        You want to know how I got all 
                        these notches on my axe? The 
                        Confederates would set up pickets. 
                        An outpost of three or four men to 
                        give warning if they saw Union 
                        soldiers marching. I’d wait until 
                        the night was at its blackest. Then 
                        ffftt fft. Dead before they even 
                        knew they were under attack.

                                 BAD JACK
                        You saying I should sleep with one 
                        eye open?

                                 KIERAN
                        No, you can rest easy tonight, 
                        Jack. I want the entire city 
                        watching when I put you down.

                                 BAD JACK
                        No you don’t. You only want her 
                        watching. But that’s not going to 
                        happen see. I already killed her.
           Kieran’s heart drops into his stomach. 

                                 BAD JACK (CONT’D) (CONT’D)
                        Only fair after your man got my 
                        second Gideon. 

           INT. WASHROOM - NIGHT

           Cillian cleans Emily’s freshly stitched wounds.

                                 EMILY
                        I thought he was gonna kill me. 

                                 CILLIAN
                        I know where he sleeps. He will not 
                        live through the night.

                                 EMILY
                        Do not steal my revenge. I want to 
                        fight like Kieran does. Like you 
                        do.

                                 CILLIAN
                        I will not risk your safety. 

           He strokes her face.

                                 CILLIAN (CONT’D)
                        I won’t allow you any more harm. 

                                 EMILY
                        Then help me. Help me kill him. 

           EXT. KNOW NOTHINGS SALOON - NIGHT

           Kieran stares up at Jack, his heart still melting. 

                                 BAD JACK
                        Don’t cry now, I’m only fibbing.
                        I have a place all picked out for 
                        Destine.

                                 KIERAN
                        When I win, she goes with me.  

                                 BAD JACK
                        When you win? Don’t tell me you’re 
                        starting to believe your own 
                        legend? I piss on McCoole. He’s 
                        nothing. The man killer ducked 
                        every one of my challenges. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 BAD JACK (CONT'D)
                        I’m going to give you a beating you 
                        will never forget. 

                                 KIERAN
                        When I’m done with you, you’ll be 
                        the one keeping your eyes to the 
                        floor.

                                 BAD JACK
                        Enough talk, Connelly. Off with ya. 
                        I’ve got a French slave who needs 
                        whipping.   

                                 KIERAN
                        This ends tomorrow.

           INT. LESTER’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Lester rouses from his slumber face to face with the barrel 
           of Cillian’s rifle. 

                                 LESTER
                        You don’t want to be doing this boy-

                                 CILLIAN
                        Shhh. 

           Lester slowly reaches under his pillow. 

                                 CILLIAN (CONT’D)
                        Looking for this? 

           Cillian raises Lester’s pistol, now pointing two guns.

                                 CILLIAN (CONT’D)
                        You’ve dug a hole there’s no 
                        getting out of, Copper.

           From a dark corner Emily steps out and buries a long knife 
           into Lester’s chest. Cillian rises to hold Lester down. 

                                 CILLIAN (CONT’D)
                        Deeper.

           Emily uses all her might to sink the blade all the way to the 
           handle. 

                                 EMILY
                             (to Lester)
                        That’s the great thing about skeevy 
                        raping bastards. You can’t murder 
                        them. You only bring them to 
                        justice. 
           She watches with great pride as the light indeed fades out of 
           Lester’s dark eyes.

           Emily and Cillian share an intimate moment in the midst of 
           their murder. Their lips move closer, until over Lester’s 
           dead body they kiss in the darkness.

           INT. KINGS HOTEL - NIGHT

           Kieran sits in perilous thought. Cillian and Emily enter. 

                                 KIERAN
                        I thought someone had gotten you.

                                 EMILY
                        Lester’s dead.

                                 CILLIAN
                        There’s no walking away now. Lose 
                        and we’re all dead. Our fate lies 
                        with your bare knuckles.

                                 KIERAN
                        The spectacle for rats is the only 
                        door to salvation. After what I’ve 
                        seen...what we’ve seen...maybe 
                        pugilism is not the plague on 
                        society I once thought. Maybe it is 
                        a most graceful thing.   

           Cillian, with his arm around Emily, moves to the bed. Kieran 
           ponders the weight of tomorrow.

           EXT. FORREST - MORNING

           Two Irishmen are sawing lumber. 

                                 IRISHMAN 1
                        The Lumberman’s the victor today.

                        One punch. 

                                 IRISHMAN 2
                        Out like a lantern. 

           EXT. PARADISE SQUARE - DAY

           High class and low, men and women, cutthroats and royalty are 
           lined up for a mile in every street of the five points, all 
           out placing bets. The Know Nothings is in the background.

           Kieran marches out with Cillian and Emily. The fanatics try 
           and touch their new hero. Kieran embraces them. 

           Destine sits in a steel cage high on the wall like a princess 
           locked in a tower. Kieran and Destine lock eyes. He tosses 
           his flat cap in the ring as Bad Jack walks out. 

           Jack’s Bowery Boys knock his fans out of the way clearing a 
           path to the ring. Grady and the Chichesters look on nearby.

           Jack throws his top hat in the ring and the fighters strip 
           down.

           Emily gets in Kieran’s ear.  

                                 EMILY
                        Expect to be hit when your down, 
                        have your eyes gouged, and God 
                        knows what else.

                                 KIERAN
                        I’m ready for anything. 
                                 EMILY
                        Good will overcome. You believe it?

                                 KIERAN
                        Aye.

                                 EMILY
                        Then rip his fucking head off! 

           THE RING

           Bad Jack strides confidently to Kieran.

                                 BAD JACK
                        Care to make a wager Irishman? Or 
                        do you think I’m going to win as 
                        well?

                                 KIERAN
                        You have no cutthroats to hide 
                        behind. You finally face me on your 
                        own. Nothing can save you now, 
                        Jack. 

           The large referee steps in and draws the chalk line. 

                                 REFEREE
                        To your corners gentlemen! 

           Jack backs up into his corner. Both fighters are ready.

                                 REFEREE (CONT’D)
                        This is for the Championship of 
                        America, so I don’t expect to have 
                        to explain the rules. We go until 
                        one man stops. Toe the scratch! 

           The crowd goes silent as each man makes his way to the line. 
           THEY TOE THE LINE. THE FIGHT BEGINS.

           Kieran throws a hard right. Jack ducks under and slams his 
           fist into Kieran’s manhood. Kieran takes a knee.

                                 EMILY
                        HEY! 

                                 KIERAN
                        No honor. 

                                 BAD JACK
                        No need for it. 

           They return to the scratch. Jack, throws haymakers with full 
           power. Kieran evades and dodges, blocks and back-peddles. 
           Jack is relentless, a machine. A few punches make it through 
           and smash Kieran’s left eye, opening up a cut. Jack hammers 
           his fist into the cut and blood sprays across the crowd.

           Destine cries out at the gore. 

           Bad Jack smiles at the sight, but he needs his fix. He stops 
           his attack and sticks his chin in the air. 

                                 BAD JACK (CONT’D)
                        Hit me lumberman! Come on! 

           Kieran wastes no time. He winds up holding his eyes at Jack’s 
           face, but chops away at Jack’s lungs. Kieran pounds the 
           champions ribs until Jack grabs hold of Kieran.   

           Kieran throws Jack over his leg to the ground. 

                                 KIERAN
                        Come on Bad Jack! Let’s see how bad 
                        you are. 

           Emily grabs Cillian’s face and kisses him with excitement. 

           Destine nods up to God with thanks.

           Jack gets up and walks to the scratch. Kieran rushes Jack 
           with a flurry of punches. Jack slips and moves out of the way 
           still getting his wind back. 

           Kieran punches upstairs causing Jack to cover his face, then 
           hits him downstairs with kidney shots. Jack goes down again. 

           Jack holds his side as he walks to the line. Again Kieran 
           gives chase and again Bad Jack moves swiftly escaping damage. 

           Then Jack stops and brings his arms down. Kieran punches away 
           at the body but is mostly hitting Jacks arms. He continues to 
           punch ineffectively to the ribs before finally throwing a 
           right hook to the jaw. 

           Jack falls down again and the crowd’s excitement mounts 
           seeing the challenger getting ever closer to victory. 

           Blood seeps from Bad Jack’s mouth. He licks his wound. He 
           gets his fix and rises a new man. A SAVAGE. 

           Jack puts his toe to the scratch. Kieran attacks with a fury 
           but Jack walks through his punches as if they were nothing. 

           Bad Jack returns fire and crushes Kieran’s nose with a right. 
           Then smashes a left into Kieran’s teeth sending him down.  
           With no regard for the rules Jack jumps on top of Kieran and 
           rains down punches. 

                                 GRADY
                        Bloody cheater!

           Kieran kicks Jack off him and rises.

                                 KIERAN
                        Not gonna be that easy, Jack. 

           They toe the line and Jack takes heavy shots to the body, but 
           grabs the back of Kieran’s head and bashes his knuckles into 
           Kieran’s eyes, over and over, mashing up his face. Kieran 
           goes down hard. 

                                 BAD JACK
                        You sure about that?

           What transpires over the next several rounds is Kieran 
           falling to the floor, each time bloodier than before. Over 
           and over he is put down by his seemingly invincible opponent. 

           It is pure domination. Jack pounds Kieran’s flesh with a 
           merciless fervor, savoring every second. 

           Even Kieran’s hard head can’t save him as Jack pummel’s 
           Kieran’s ears sending him crashing down to the canvas. 

           Destine cries in her cage, her fate looming ever closer.

           Kieran grabs the rope, trying to get up, but doesn’t have the 
           strength and falls back down

           Emily can’t watch. She buries her head into Cillian’s chest.  

                                 BAD JACK (CONT’D)
                        Get up Lumberman! I’ve still got 
                        punishing to do.

           Kieran grabs the ropes again. He pulls himself up to his feet 
           and faces Jack. Kieran trudges back to the line barely able 
           to lift his arms.

           Jack bulldozes Kieran with punches then pushes him against 
           the ropes. Kieran bounces off and Jack heaves an uppercut 
           into Kieran’s chin sending him flying through the air.

           Kieran lands as if he was throw from a ten story building. 
           Cillian runs around the ring to Kieran who barely moves.

                                 CILLIAN
                        Don’t give in, Kieran! You can’t! 
                        You’ve got more in you, I know it! 
                                 (MORE)
                                 CILLIAN (CONT'D)
                        Remember the war, the focus, the 
                        rush when it’s life or death! Get 
                        up Lumberman! This man won’t best 
                        you today! Get up! Rise and fight!

           Kieran stares into Cillian’s eyes and sees true faith. Over 
           Cillian’s shoulder Destine comes into focus. Kieran gets that 
           rush. He rolls himself over and stands. 

           Jack waits with his foot on the scratch. 

                                 CILLIAN (CONT’D)
                        Bring the beast!

           Kieran shakes his head regaining focus. He wipes the blood 
           out of his eyes and blinks quickly sharpening his sight. What 
           Kieran does next utterly shocks the crowd. 

           Kieran runs full sprint to the scratch. He lowers his 
           shoulder as his foot hits the line, barrelling into Jack, 
           sending him staggering back into the ropes. 

           Kieran heaves a straight right to the face, imploding Jack’s 
           nose, sending blood gushing down his face and splashing into 
           his eyes. 

           Blinded by his own blood, Jack fails to defend as Kieran 
           bashes Jack’s face with barbaric rage. 

           Jack slides out from the ropes, flailing blindly, wiping 
           blood from his face with his forearms. Kieran pursues, but 
           Jack throws a couple stiff jabs that land, backing Kieran up.

           They engage toe to toe in the center of the ring. There is no 
           more defense, only blood and sweat cascading through the air 
           as the fighters trade punches. Both throwing with a fury, 
           landing at will. 

           Jack starts to get the better of it, backing Kieran up. Then 
           Kieran surges back, putting Jack on his heels. A powerful 
           left hook sends Jack to the ground, dazed.  

                                 EMILY
                        Yes!

           Jack is taking his time getting up, trying to get his wits 
           back. Kieran grabs him by the neck and throws him to the 
           scratch. 

           The moment Jack’s foot touches the line, Kieran throws 
           everything he has into Jack’s ribs. 

           Jack lowers his arms to protect his ribs so Kieran moves up 
           to the head. CRACK, CRACK, CRACK! 
           Kieran shatters the bones of Jack’s jaw. Jack tries to 
           stagger away, but Kieran throws him back into the ropes. 

           Destine stands in anticipation of victory.

                                 DESTINE
                        Do it, Kieran! Finish him!

           Kieran holds Jack steady with his left, and hammers Jack’s 
           already mashed up face with his right. It is gruesome as 
           Kieran pounds away at Jack’s flesh.

           Jack is out on his feet. Kieran backs away and Jack stumbles 
           forward. Kieran gets a running start and the biggest overhand 
           right the world has ever seen. 

           Jack crashes to the ground LIMP. OUT COLD. The referee takes 
           one look and waives his arms. KIERAN WINS

           Never has there been a more uproarious crowd, irrepressible 
           in their cheering. Grady and the Chichesters go mad.

           Emily and Cillian stand full of pride. 

           The ref grabs Kieran’s arm to raise it in victory but Kieran 
           shrugs him off.

                                 KIERAN
                        DESTINE! DESTINE! 

           Destine reaches out through the bars and yells back, but 
           their cries are lost in the fancy’s roar. Kieran rushes out 
           of the ring and pushes through the crowd.

           Kieran reaches the steps where two Bowery Boys stand guard. 

                                 KIERAN (CONT’D)
                        Give me the key. 

           The Boys hesitate, unsure what to do without Jack ordering 
           them. Grady and the Chichesters step up behind Kieran. 

                                 GRADY
                        Hand ‘em over! 

           The Bowery Boy takes the rope with the key off his neck and 
           Kieran snatches it and runs up the steps. 

           SLOW MOTION as Kieran slides the key in and unlocks the door. 
           Destine rushes into Kieran’s arms. The reunion is whimsical, 
           magical, beautiful. 

           Emily and Cillian smile from below watching Kieran and 
           Destine kiss with unwavering passion, high above the fancy. 
           Suddenly the celebration turns dark. The Know Nothings saloon 
           is set ablaze behind them. The bowery boys and the Irish men 
           begin to battle. 

           Kieran grabs Destine and carries her down the stairs to Emily 
           and Cillian. Destine notices the copper’s pistol hanging out 
           of Cillian’s trousers. 

           They make their way through the crowd, away from the mayhem. 

                                 BAD JACK 
                        Lumberman!

           They all turn to see Bad Jack pointing his pistol at the 
           group. He barely has the strength to stand. 

                                 BAD JACK (CONT’D)
                        America remember. Where the meanest 
                        son of a bitch who is willing to- 

           Destine grabs the gun from Cillian’s belt. Two gunshots ring 
           out. Smoke fills the air. As it clears we see Jack fall to 
           his knees, DEAD. Destine unscathed, holding the shaking gun.

           JUSTICE. 

           The foursome put their arms around each other and proceed 
           away from the chaos.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. CILLIAN’S FARM - DAY

           Kieran and Destine lay in the flowers holding hands, stroking 
           each other’s arms. Kieran touches her pregnant belly.

                                 KIERAN
                        I told you I would do it.

                                 DESTINE
                        Do what?

                                 KIERAN
                        Build us a house on a big lot of 
                        land to raise our children. 

           She looks back at the newly constructed home next to 
           Cillian’s farmhouse. On the porch Cillian holds Emily as a 
           lover. 

                                 DESTINE
                        What about my orchard?
           Kieran tickles her. 

                                 KIERAN
                        You might have to roll up your 
                        sleeves and plant it yourself.

           Kieran stops tickling and they stare at each other. 

                                 DESTINE
                        Was it all worth it? 

           He touches her face.

                                 KIERAN
                        The war, the boxing...that was the 
                        easy bit. The hardest to bear was 
                        the pain inside from not being near 
                        you. 

                                 DESTINE
                        Let us never be apart again.

           They kiss.

                                 THE END
