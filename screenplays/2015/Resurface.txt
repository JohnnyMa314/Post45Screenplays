           THE SKY

           Still. Blue. Scattered clouds below -

                                35,000 FEET ABOVE SEA LEVEL

           An AIRBUS A380 roars past -

                                    MINUS 62° FAHRENHEIT

           And then it's gone. The sky frenzied in its trail -

                                ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE 3.4 PSI

           We’re descending rapidly now -

           Breaking through clouds -

           Plummeting faster -

           Towards a speck in the middle of the ocean -

           Getting closer -

           Enough to make out its shape -

           It's a ship -

           Anchored in calm waters -

           A 600ft research vessel. High tech. Modern -

           Name and port painted on the stern -

           IORV PICCARD-WALSH GUAM

           The deck a workshop of submersibles and ocean gadgets -

                      INTERNATIONAL OCEAN RESEARCH VESSEL PICCARD-WALSH

           ENGINEERS performing maintenance on the equipment -

                              SEA LEVEL, WESTERN PACIFIC OCEAN

           The CHIEF ENGINEER walking and talking with more ENGINEERS -

                                      91° FAHRENHEIT

           The CHIEF MATE going over plans with DIVERS at the port side -

                               ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE 14.7 PSI

           Down a ladder to a diving platform closer to the water -

           Another group of DIVERS safety checking each others’ gear -

           One SCUBA DIVER steps forward and pin drops into -
           THE OCEAN

           Bubbles blanket the SCUBA DIVER before rushing to the surface -

           He swims towards another crew of DIVERS working on the hull -

           But we’re descending past that -

           Past a bale of SEA TURTLES, circling close to the surface -

           More DIVERS studying the ocean life at depth -

           A pod of BOTTLENOSE DOLPHINS breaking a school of MACKEREL -

           Down past floating JELLYFISH and gliding STINGRAYS -

           The light from the surface fading now -

           A flotilla of SWORDFISH -

           Darker still -

           A huge SPERM WHALE hunting a shoal of large SQUID -

           Then nothing -

           Just darkness -

           Until a small light appears -

           An ANGLERFISH attacking SHRIMP -

           An EEL passes by the Anglerfish’s bioluminescent light -

           Then it all fades back to -

           Deep -

           Dark -

           Nothing -

           For -

           Miles -

           But then -

           Faint light down below -

           Vaguely making out five tiny objects, all lit up -

           In one tiny section of a massive trench -

           43 miles just in width. Bigger than Grand Canyon massive -

           Closing right in on the illuminated -
           TRENCH DIVE SITE

           One tall structure in the middle. Floodlights on -

                                SIRENA DEEP, MARIANA TRENCH

           Four smaller subs working different parts of the site -

                                35,200 FEET BELOW SEA LEVEL

           The seabed more like thick soup than sand -

                                      34° FAHRENHEIT

           But still there is life -

                              ATMOSPHERIC PRESSURE 15,656 PSI

           SEA CUCUMBERS and PALE SHRIMP scattered around -

           The tall structure in the middle -

           SUPPLY LANDER

           Missile-shaped. Encasing a titanium Sphere near the bottom -

           Floodlights and cameras all over. A hatch on the Sphere -

           Close by is the first sub -

           CRAWLER ONE

           Trawling the seabed -

           The subs are all identical. Spheres in a cuboid shell -

           Thrusters. Robotic arms. Lights. Cameras. Viewing windows -

           Further away -

           CRAWLER TWO

           Drilling into the seabed with one robotic arm -

           Bolting down a monitoring instrument with the other -

           Further still -

           CRAWLER THREE

           Thrusting its way up a steep ridge -

           A radar instrument rotating underneath the sub -

           A broken thruster splutters to a stop -

           And over by the trench wall -
           CRAWLER FOUR

           Lighting up the face of the rocky surface -

           Robotic arms carefully scraping and vacuuming samples -

           A muffled Rolling Stones song vibrating from inside -

                                 JOSH (PRE-LAP)
                        Okay. Petri dish with one bacteria. 
                        Splits into two cells every sixty 
                        seconds. Start at 3pm. At - and this is 
                        important, so pay close attention - at 
                        3:23pm, the petri dish is half full -

           The crew visible through the Sphere hatch window -

           CRAWLER FOUR SPHERE

           Cramped 3.5ft radius. Wires. Monitors. Computers. Lights -

           Fold-down seating for the two crew members -

                        3:24pm...

                                 JOSH
                        Wow. Didn’t even blink. Damn.

                                 HANNAH
                        It doesn’t matter what time the dish is 
                        half full - it will always be completely 
                        full exactly one minute later. But it was 
                        a nice touch trying to get me to focus on 
                        the specific time...

           A voice over the intercom -

                                 TOM (COMMS)
                        Face facts, son - she’s smarter than you.

                                 JOSH
                        By a point. One point...

           CRAWLER ONE SPHERE

           Similar interior. All of these Crawlers are almost identical -

           TOM STRAND. 50s/60s. American. Relaxed at the controls -
                                 TOM
                        It only takes one. If you actually 
                        believe IQ tests mean anything...

           RUSS HORN. 40s. Australian. Working at his Laptop -

                                 HANNAH (COMMS)
                        Did you raise him this defiant, Tom?

                                 TOM
                        His Mother raised him. But she was worse.

                                 JOSH (COMMS)
                        That’s true...

                                 TOM
                        So, you're in a cold dark room. There's a 
                        candle, a fireplace and a lantern. But 
                        you've only got one match -

           CRAWLER FOUR SPHERE

                                 TOM (COMMS)
                        - which do you light first?

           Without a second thought -

                                 JOSH & HANNAH
                        The candle.

           Then pondering -

                                 JOSH
                        The candle. You won't be able to see what 
                        you're doing otherwise, and the other two 
                        are harder to light blind...

                                 TOM (COMMS)
                        Wrong. You light the match first...

           Rolling eyes. Oh, come on -

                                 JOSH
                        That’s not a logic puzzle -

           CRAWLER ONE SPHERE

                                 JOSH (COMMS)
                        - that’s a cheap trick.

                                 HANNAH (COMMS)
                        Hear, hear...

                                 RUSS
                        Mate, cheap tricks are the worst kind to 
                        fall for. I wouldn’t go around admitting 
                        to that at all...
                                 TOM
                        Especially for a pair of paper geniuses 
                        like yourselves. You just got outsmarted 
                        by an old man with a lowly IQ of 102...

           Mock sympathy on the Comms -

                        Don’t feel bad, Josh - it’s only a 35 
                        point difference...

                                 JOSH
                        IQ tests don’t mean anything anyway...

                                 TOM (COMMS)
                        As a wise man once told you...

                                 JOSH
                        No, it was just you...

                                 TOM (COMMS)
                        Hannah, you are go to flick his ear...

                                 HANNAH
                        Copy that...

           Hannah reaches over to flick Josh’s ear -

                                 JOSH (COMMS)
                        Ow!

           They laugh -

                                 TOM
                        Get back to work.

           Russ flicks a switch on the Comms Panel -

                        Yoshio, we’re clear now. How long until

                        We have an attenuation stability issue,

                        stretch them up there. You could get you

                        Aw, it’s okay, Joshy - bacteria are 
                        pretty cool too...

                                 JOSH
                        They are cool. I don’t need that snide 
                        condescension. One of my bacteria may 
                        cure cancer. You don’t know...

                                 HANNAH
                        Or wipe out the human race...

                                 JOSH
                        Either way, I look forward to celebrating 
                        my achievement by dipping yours into 
                        cocktail sauce...

           Brief laughter, interrupted by -

           CRAWLER ONE SPHERE

           Feeling it too. Hands off the controls -

           Rocking a little more than the others. Tense -

                        Bloody hell. I think my heart stopped for 
                        a minute there...

                                 JOSH
                        You just broke your tremor cherry. Third 
                        base on your fifth dive. That’s a record. 
                        I got mine first time down...

           Josh checks their SYSTEMS PANELS -

           Russ checking their own systems as reports come in -

                                 SIMON (COMMS)
                        All right here. Our other thruster is 
                        actually working now. Cheers, sea gods.

           Tom looks to Russ -

                                 RUSS
                        We’re all good as far as I can see.

           Tom picks up a TWO-WAY RADIO -

                                 TOM
                        Crawler One to Surface. Come in...

                                 SURFACE (2-WAY)
                        This is Surface, Crawler One. Go ahead...

                                 TOM
                        We’ve just had a tremor down here. Have 
                        you registered anything?

                                 SURFACE (2-WAY)
                        Uh, we had a brief spike to three-point-
                        four. Do you have a damage report?

                                 TOM
                        No damages. Do you have instructions? 
                        Crawler Two is still installing at the 
                        first site. I don’t know if they’ll even 
                        get to site two today...

                                 SURFACE (2-WAY)
                        We would advise resurfacing, but we don’t 
                        know the conditions. It’s your call, Tom.

           Tom puts the radio back. Looks to Russ -

           Hannah works on calming her breathing -

                                 JOSH
                        Just remember - we’re right in the middle 
                        of the deepest trench in the ocean, along 
                        the largest subduction zone on Earth. But-
                                 HANNAH
                        Not helping...

                                 JOSH
                        - BUT! In more than four hundred years of 
                        recorded history, there has never been a 
                        major quake. That was pretty much as bad 
                        as it gets down here, okay?

           Nods. Sure -

                                 JOSH
                        Okay...?

                                 TOM (COMMS)
                        Guys and girls, I think we’re going to 
                        wrap it up for today and resurface. Pull 
                        your gear in, run down your systems 
                        checks and drop weights at your earliest 
                        convenience...

           Sighs. Thank God -

                                 JOSH
                        Now that’s what I’m talking about - 
                        quitting early and jump-starting the 
                        weekend! Drinks are on me, rookie...

                                 HANNAH
                        Good, because I plan on getting 
                        completely plastered after that...

                                 JOSH
                        That’s the spirit. Get those arms in and 
                        secure the payload. I’ll start on 
                        checks...

                             (Japanese, Subtitled)
                        We have a stable signal!
                                 TOM (COMMS)
                        Yoshio, I need you to stop work and 
                        prepare to resurface...

                                 YOSHIO
                        We can not do that. The first module has 
                        only started transmitting and we do not

                        Too bad for them. We can’t go until 
                        they’re ascending. And I don’t want to 
                        sit here through aftershocks while they 
                        get it together, do you?

           Tom flicks the Comms on again -

                                 TOM
                        Negative, Yoshio. We all have to ascend. 
                        We can’t risk quake damage...

                        This is why we are here, Tom. If you were 
                        installing technology to predict 
                        earthquakes and tsunamis that threaten 
                        the United States, you would find more 
                        time to finish...

           Extended silence. Daiki watches Yoshio -

                                 TOM (COMMS)
                        I’m not getting into it with you down 
                        here, Yoshio. This is an International 
                        project, and surface has made the 
                        recommendation to begin ascent. They know 
                        your progress...

           Yoshio shakes his head again. Angrier -

                                 TOM (COMMS)
                        If you have a problem with it, take it up

                        Crawler One, Surface. We’ve got a problem 
                        down here. The Japanese crew are refusing 
                        to resurface and have switched off their 
                        Comms...
                                 SURFACE (2-WAY)
                        I know, Tom. I’ve been in radio contact 
                        with Yoshio and he’s explained their 
                        situation. We’ve given the go ahead to 
                        complete the work at their site, then 
                        ascend...

           That son of a bitch -

                                 RUSS
                        He went over you...

                                 TOM
                        So, we’re meant to sit down here and risk 
                        damage in possible aftershocks?

                                 SURFACE (2-WAY)
                        Tom, I’m on your side. But the call has 
                        been made. Yoshio estimates ten to 
                        fifteen minutes. It’s expensive equipment 
                        they’re installing...

           Russ rolls his eyes. Who gives a shit? -

                                 SURFACE (2-WAY)
                        It will take them longer to pull out what 
                        they’ve done so far than to just finish 
                        the installation. They either have to 
                        complete or pull the equipment...

                                 RUSS
                        This is a joke...

           A STREAM OF BUBBLES ERUPTS FROM THE SEABED -

           CRAWLER THREE SPHERE

           Simon and Leah are thrown around the Sphere -

           SCREAMING. Sheer terror. Rolling out of control -
           CRAWLER FOUR

           Slams against the rocky trench wall -

           CRAWLER FOUR SPHERE

           The horrendous sound of scraping metal -

           Josh and Hannah thrown around violently -

           CRAWLER FOUR

           Pieces of plastic and foam breaking off -

           Hydraulic fluid spraying out into the water -

           CRAWLER FOUR SPHERE

           The entire system and lights go out -

                                 HANNAH
                        Oh no oh no oh no...

           Nothing left but the light from a Laptop on battery life - 

           CRAWLER THREE

           On its side on the seabed -

           Still being thrashed around wildly -

           CRAWLER THREE SPHERE

           Leah unconscious and bleeding from a head wound -

           Simon struggling to hold on -

           TRENCH DIVE SITE

           Large sections of the trench wall breaking away -

           Huge clouds of sediment rising from the seabed -

           But then - it just stops...

           A few smaller pieces of trench wall tumble down -

           Sediment blankets the whole site like a fog -

           CRAWLER FOUR SPHERE

           Heavy breathing. Just shadows moving in dim light -

           Then a bright light. Josh holds up an LED Wand -

                                 JOSH
                        Are we okay?
           They’re both banged up. Cuts. Scrapes. Bruises. But alive -

                                 HANNAH
                        What the hell was that if the last one 
                        was ‘as bad as it gets’?

                                 JOSH
                        That was history being written. The whole 
                        plate shifted. We probably just 
                        experienced ten thousand years worth of 
                        subduction movement in two minutes...

           CRAWLER THREE

           Still on its side. Lights flickering through the hatch -

           CRAWLER THREE SPHERE

           Creaking. Cracking. Lights flicker. Sparks. Smoke -

           Simon coughs and pulls himself over to Leah -

           Checks her pulse -

           Slumps back. Stares at her lifeless body -

           Flicks the Comms switch with his foot -

                                 SIMON
                        Hello...?

           Nothing. Just the Sphere C R E A K I N G -

                                 SIMON
                        Hello...? Is anybody out there still on 
                        Comms...?

           Nothing. Until -

           A short, sharp CRACK -

           Simon looks over to the hatch -

           A fracture in the outer glass -

           CRACK CRACK CRACK - three more splintering off the first -

                                 SIMON
                        Oh, come o-

           CRAWLER THREE

           C R U N C H -

           The Sphere IMPLODES in an instant -

           Another lump of titanium in a cloud of blood and oil -
           CRAWLER FOUR SPHERE

           Josh waves the LED Wand over the controls -

           Tries a few buttons and switches -

                                 JOSH
                        We’ve got nothing. There’s no way the 
                        entire battery array was destroyed. The 
                        circuit must be broken somewhere...

           Hannah peers out through the hatch window -

                                 HANNAH
                        It looks like a milkshake out there. 
                        There’s light, but nothing’s moving...

           Josh pulls another two LED Wands out of a bag -

                                 JOSH
                        Here - hang this up...

           They both hang their lights from loose wires -

           Brighter, but still eerie -

                                 HANNAH
                        What now?

                                 JOSH
                        Our weights should have dropped as soon 
                        as the power failed...

           Josh checks his Laptop -

           A diagram of their Crawler. Red crosses everywhere -

                                 JOSH
                        My Laptop’s on a full charge here, but 
                        Surface Comms are down too. We can’t even 
                        text them for an acoustic release...

                                 HANNAH
                        Won’t they send one if they don’t hear 
                        anything from us?

                                 JOSH
                        Sure. If they can. And if we can actually 
                        receive it...

           Hannah hunches forward. We’re going to die down here -

                                 JOSH
                        Hey, Hannah...

                                 HANNAH
                        What?
                                 JOSH
                        I leave home for a minute. But when I 
                        return, a masked man is waiting for me. 
                        What am I doing, who is the masked man 
                        and where’s the safest place I can go?

           Shakes her head. I’m not exactly in the mood -

                                 HANNAH
                        I don’t know, Josh...

                                 JOSH
                        Well, figure it out, genius. Don’t let a 
                        little quake stop you from dangling your 
                        superior intelligence above me...

           She sits up. Laughs halfheartedly -

           Looks back out the hatch window. A moving light somewhere -

                                 HANNAH
                        Someone’s moving...

           Josh grabs one of the LED Wands -

                                 JOSH
                        Turn those two off.

           She does -

           Josh holds the LED Wand at the window -

           Starts switching it on and off repeatedly -

           On. Off.

           The moving light continues on outside -

           On. Off.

           The moving light stops -

           Josh and Hannah crowding around the window -

           Nothing. Then -

           The light outside flashes back -

                                 HANNAH
                        Who is it?

           The sediment is clearing, but not enough yet -

           The light outside flashes back a pattern -

                                 JOSH
                        Morse code...
           TRENCH DIVE SITE

           Three vague shapes starting to appear through the sediment -

           Two Crawlers and the Supply Lander -

           One Crawler flashing the other in pattern -

           CRAWLER FOUR SPHERE

           Hannah deciphering the code in her head -

                                 HANNAH
                        ...Eleven. Two-way eleven...

                                 JOSH
                        There should be a portable Two-way in the 
                        black case near the First Aid Kit...

           Leaning back, moving gear aside -

           She finds the case and opens it -

           They huddle together and tune it to channel 11 -

                                 JOSH
                        This is Crawler Four...

           Static for a second, then -

                                 TOM (2-WAY)
                        Oh, thank God -

           Elated at the sound of Tom’s voice -

           CRAWLER ONE SPHERE

                                 TOM
                        - we thought you were gone. Your vitals 
                        have been offline since the quake...

           Their own Sphere is banged up, but still operational -

                                 JOSH (2-WAY)
                        We’re completely cut off. We’re not even 
                        getting backup power here...

           They know it’s bad -

                                 TOM
                        Okay, we’re on our way to take a look...

           TRENCH DIVE SITE

           Sediment clearing up slightly -

           Crawler One thrusting towards Crawler Four -
           CRAWLER FOUR SPHERE

           Big smiles all around as the lights approach -

           Hannah takes the radio -

                                 HANNAH
                        Tom, how are the others?

           CRAWLER ONE SPHERE

           Tom and Russ exchange a grim look -

                                 TOM
                        They’re lost...

                                 HANNAH (2-WAY)
                        Maybe they’re offline too? There are 
                        other lights...

           CRAWLER FOUR SPHERE

           Josh stops Hannah -

                                 JOSH
                        Lost is a nice way of saying dead...

                                 TOM (2-WAY)
                        We saw the wreckage. Both Crawlers 
                        sustained hull breaches. They’re gone. 
                        I’m sorry about Simon...

           Hannah sits back in shock -

           TRENCH DIVE SITE

           Crawler One slows its thrust as it reaches Crawler Four -

           CRAWLER ONE SPHERE

           Tom crouches down and looks out the hatch window -

           The two Crawler hatches are aligned -

           Josh appears in the other window. They smile -

                                 TOM
                        Of all the messes you’ve gotten yourself 
                        into, kid...

                                 JOSH (2-WAY)
                        Me? You gave me this job. Technically, 
                        you got me into this mess...

           CRAWLER FOUR SPHERE

           Josh can see Tom laughing -
                                 JOSH
                        What does surface say?

           Tom shakes his head -

                                 TOM (2-WAY)
                        We can’t raise them on Comms, Two-Way or 
                        Text. We’ll keep trying while this soup 
                        settles. How are you two holding up?

                                 JOSH
                        We’re... okay...

           Josh looks at the Laptop screen -

                                 JOSH
                        Scrubbers are down, but our CAMS is on 
                        backup battery. We’re just under twenty-
                        one oxygen, point-five CO2...

                                 TOM (2-WAY)
                        Air’s probably worse in Miami right now. 
                        Quit your bitching...

           Both laugh -

                                 JOSH
                        So, what do you think?

           CRAWLER ONE SPHERE

           Tom moves back to the controls -

                                 TOM
                        We’re going up to take a look. Sit tight.

           CRAWLER ONE

           Thrusting vertically. Lights tilting down on Crawler Four -

           An arm with a camera extending out -

           CRAWLER ONE SPHERE

           Tom looking at the video feed on a monitor -

                                 TOM
                        We’re on top of you now...

           CRAWLER FOUR SPHERE

           Reflexively looking up and waiting -

                                 TOM (2-WAY)
                        You’ve got one hell of a cavity on your 
                        starboard. Sending the camera in...
           CRAWLER ONE

           Lights focused down on Crawler Four -

           The camera arm maneuvers down the side of Crawler Four -

           CRAWLER ONE SPHERE

           Watching the monitor. The entire starboard side is missing -

           Wreckage everywhere. Plastic. Foam. Metal. Wires. Fluid -

                                 RUSS
                        Their hull is right up against the rock. 
                        If we get an aftershock -

                                 TOM
                        I know...

           Tom picks up the radio -

                                 TOM
                        It’s not good...

           CRAWLER FOUR SPHERE

           Their faces drop -

                                 TOM (2-WAY)
                        Your antennas and beacons are completely 
                        gone. You’re missing an arm and gushing 
                        hydraulic fluid. Half your battery array 
                        is gone. The other half could be fine, 
                        but your Penetrator is severed...

                                 JOSH
                        Where?

                                 TOM (2-WAY)
                        At the base...

           That’s not what Josh wanted to hear -

                                 HANNAH
                        What? What does the Penetrator do?

                                 JOSH
                        Not much. It’s just the umbilical port 
                        that seals the entire battery and systems 
                        array into our Sphere...

           Hannah covers her face. Forget I asked -

                                 JOSH
                        Theoretically, if the seawater erodes the 
                        inside of the Penetrator, it could cause 
                        a hull breach...
           Back to the radio -

                                 JOSH
                        Russ, how long before the backup release 
                        wires on our weights corrode?

                                 RUSS (2-WAY)
                        Maybe three or four hours. But you’re 
                        kissing the rock right now. We need to 
                        get you off that wall before we can do

           Solemn mood. They need a fast solution -

                                 TOM
                        Can we pull them out?

                                 RUSS
                        We could try, but we’d probably rip the 
                        arms off doing it...

           Looking around the Crawler for something. Anything -

                                 JOSH
                        Hannah, you’re in a titanium Sphere at 
                        the bottom of the ocean, rubbing up 
                        against a rock wall, with your main power 
                        completely out of commission. How do you 
                        get away from the wall?

           She’s got nothing -

                                 HANNAH
                        Magic?

           Josh smirks at her -

           Leaning next to the CENTRAL ATMOSPHERE MONITOR SYSTEM -

           He lights up and raises the radio -

                                 JOSH
                        Guys, what about the CAMS Battery? It’s 
                        on a full charge and lasts a day off 
                        power. Can we wire it directly and at 
                        least get enough juice to start ascent?

           Static crackling -

                                 RUSS (2-WAY)
                        Maybe. The voltage is too low for the 
                        whole system, but you might be able to 
                        power one or two things at a time...
           CRAWLER ONE SPHERE

           Josh’s voice infectiously excited -

                                 JOSH (2-WAY)
                        Okay, so - we wire it temporarily and 
                        maybe get the thrusters going. If we can 
                        do that, you’ll have to guide us out, 
                        because we’ll be completely blind...

           Russ nods to Tom. This could work -

                                 TOM
                        Do it...

           CRAWLER FOUR SPHERE

           Excitement now. Hope -

           Josh lifts the CAMS unit on to a seat -

           It’s a rectangular metal box with vents and filters -

           Gloves on, he starts unscrewing the back plate -

                                 JOSH
                        Cut that umbilical...

           Josh takes a folding knife from his boot -

           Hands it to Hannah -

           Josh takes off the CAMS back plate -

           Hannah grabs a flexible black pipe entering the Sphere -

           Josh lifts the battery out of the CAMS -

           Hannah saws through the pipe with the knife -

           Josh disconnects the CAMS wiring from the battery -

           Hannah pulls the pipe away from the wall by its exposed end -

           Josh puts the CAMS unit aside -

           Hannah strips the pipe, exposing a bundle of wires -

           Josh sorts through the wires -

                                 JOSH
                        Get the extinguisher in case this goes 
                        really bad...

           Hannah picks up a small CO2 Fire Extinguisher -

           Josh strips the plastic off two brown wires -
           He loops them to make a noose at the end of each wire -

                                 JOSH
                        Okay...

           Josh carefully lowers the wire nooses towards the battery -

           Puts the wire nooses over the battery terminals -

           Hannah nervously wields the Fire Extinguisher -

           Josh quickly pulls back on the wire nooses -

           ZAAAAP - they connect and tighten. Sparks fly briefly -

           Hannah ready to spray -

                                 JOSH
                        Stop! I think we’re okay...

                                 HANNAH
                        How do you know?

                                 JOSH
                        It didn’t explode in our faces...

                                 HANNAH
                        Well, that’s some barometer of relative 
                        danger you’ve got there, Josh...

                                 JOSH
                        Let’s just hope we didn’t fry the battery 
                        or the wiring...

                        as I don’t blow us all up, then we should 
                        be able to drop and go shortly...

           Tom smiles -

                                 TOM
                        Good. I’m proud of you. You never know

                        Blech. Be a man, Dad. Save all that

                        What about your shot? They’re both on the

                        either, then it might be worth a try 
                        wiring it again...

                        Those weights aren’t coming off without 
                        force. They won’t have time to wait for 
                        the release wire to go. If we get 
                        alongside, I can drill the release wires 
                        and hopefully they’ll snap loose...

           Tom on the radio -

                                 TOM
                        Okay - we’re going to drill your release 
                        wires manually. If we can get them to 
                        snap, you’ll start ascent. Sit tight...

           CRAWLER ONE SPHERE

           Back at the controls. Pushing on the Vertical Thrusters -

           C R E E E A K -

           Tom shakes off the horrible sound -

           Pushing on the Horizontal Thrusters -

           CRAWLER ONE

           All thrusters spinning -

           Just kicking up sediment -

           CRAWLER FOUR SPHERE

           Listening to the struggle outside -

                                 TOM (2-WAY)
                        We’re spinning, but we’re not moving...

           Their faces drop -

                                 TOM (2-WAY)
                        We still have arm movement. We’ll drill 
                        this wire and then you’ll have to use 
                        your own thrust to turn around so we can 
                        drill the other...

           No way -

                                 JOSH
                        We’re not leaving you pinned down here...

           Tom playing the situation down -

                                 TOM
                        You’re a lot worse off than us. We still 
                        have all our systems. The Ballast took 
                        most of the hit. We’ll be fine...

                                 JOSH (2-WAY)
                        You didn’t leave us...
           C R E E E E E E E E E A K -

                                 TOM
                        You wouldn’t have been alive by the time 
                        a surface crew got back down here. This 
                        is different. We’re fine. Now let’s ge-

           CRAWLER ONE

           C R U N C H -

           Imploded. Gone. Blood. Oil. Metal. Rock -

           CRAWLER FOUR SPHERE

           Josh still on the radio. Hannah already knows -

                                 JOSH
                        What was that, guys?

           Hannah covers her mouth. Tears in her eyes -

                                 JOSH
                        Hey. What was that? Come in...

           Nothing -

                                 JOSH
                        Dad... Russ... Come in...

           Josh’s hand trembles on the radio -

                                 JOSH
                        Answer...

           He grips it harder -

                                 JOSH
                        ANSWER!

           Josh lets the radio fall from his hand -

                                 HANNAH
                        I’m so sorry, Josh...

           He slides down the Sphere. Expressionless -

           TRENCH DIVE SITE

           The Supply Lander casts light around the site -

           Three areas of Crawler wreckage -

           Crawler Four with a lonely glow from its hatch window -
           CRAWLER FOUR SPHERE

           Josh sits and stares at the top of the Sphere -

           Hannah sits opposite, taking her pulse -

           Condensation has formed on the windows -

           Their breath is visible in the cold air -

                                 JOSH
                        Are you cold?

                                 HANNAH
                        Not yet. This is an English springtime 
                        for me. My pulse and respiration are up 
                        though. The CO2 levels are just going to 
                        compound from here...

                                 JOSH
                        Is it a peaceful way to go?

           Hannah is taken aback -

                                 HANNAH
                        Are you serious? No. It’s not. It’s a 
                        horrible, slow and painful way to go.

                                 JOSH
                        So it’s not like drifting into a dream?

                                 HANNAH
                        Not unless you drift into a dream with 
                        extreme headaches, nausea, convulsions 
                        and asphyxiation, no...

                                 JOSH
                        Man, we really have nothing at all going 
                        for us right now, do we?

           Another extended silence -

           Then something goes off in Hannah’s head -

                                 HANNAH
                        Baseball. You’re playing baseball...

           Josh lowers his head. What? -

                                 HANNAH
                        You leave home - the home plate. When you 
                        come back home, a masked man is waiting 
                        for you - the catcher. You’re playing 
                        baseball, right? So, the safest place for 
                        you to go is back to third base...

           Son of a bitch -
                                 JOSH
                        Do you know how long that took me to 
                        figure out? Two weeks...

           He leans his head back against the Sphere -

                                 JOSH
                        My Dad told me that one when I was 
                        twelve. Refused to give me the answer 
                        too. Asshole...

           Hannah smiles. That definitely sounds like Tom -

                                 JOSH
                        And that was pre-internet. Couldn’t even 
                        look it up. I had so many weird and 
                        complex scenarios I ran through - for two 
                        weeks - drove me crazy...

           She catches him smiling -

                                 JOSH
                        And then we’re at a baseball game. And he 
                        keeps glancing at me and smirking. He 
                        knows I’m going out of my mind. And 
                        still, it does not trigger at all. I 
                        think he’s rubbing salt in the wound...

           He laughs -

                                 JOSH
                        ...But he was just trying to give me a 
                        hint. Ugh, so obvious now. Then we get up 
                        at the end and he says “Come on - let’s 
                        go home.” Boom. Wasn’t even trying to 
                        drop hints at that point. It just went 
                        off in my head. Like that -

           He clicks his fingers -

                                 HANNAH
                        And you felt like you’d just taken a piss 
                        after holding it in for two weeks?

           Josh closes his eyes and laughs out loud -

                                 JOSH
                        Yeah. It did. It definitely did. Like 
                        taking a piss. Very classy, Bradford...

           She laughs too. I have my moments -

                                 JOSH
                        And he was over the moon. He was ready to 
                        put me out of my misery in the car on the 
                        way home. But I got in under the wire...
           The smile melting a little -

                                 JOSH
                        He wasn’t even big into baseball either. 
                        He only took me to see if it would help 
                        me figure out this stupid logic puzzle...

           The smile is gone -

                                 HANNAH
                        That’s nice...

                                 JOSH
                        Yeah...

           He puts his head back and stares up at the cut umbilical -

                                 HANNAH
                        You’re in a titanium Sphere at the bottom 
                        of the ocean. You have no power, no life 
                        support, a dodgy battery system hooked up 
                        to half broken thrusters and early stage 
                        Carbon Dioxide poisoning. How do you get 
                        back to the surface alive?

           He looks at her. And begins to nod slowly -

           CRAWLER FOUR

           The severed umbilical sticking out of the Penetrator -

           Bubbling. Copper fibers breaking away -

           CRAWLER FOUR SPHERE

           Looking over all of their equipment -

                                 JOSH
                        I don’t suppose you want to be one of the 
                        first humans to try an emergency free 
                        ascent from thirty five thousand feet in 
                        an uncontrolled Sphere?

                                 HANNAH
                        Is that possible?

                                 JOSH
                        Sure. Fire up the frangibolts, they’ll 
                        break us out of our Ballast and send the 
                        Sphere straight to the surface...

           Hannah looks hopeful -

                                 JOSH
                        Have you ever been on one of those human 
                        gyroscope rides at a carnival?
                                 HANNAH
                        Yes...

                                 JOSH
                        Have you ever been in one that lasted 
                        over an hour, with another person, no 
                        restraints and going at least four times 
                        as many revolutions per minute as the 
                        fastest maximum setting?

           She scoffs -

                                 HANNAH
                        Yes, Josh. Of course I bloody have...

                                 JOSH
                        We’ll keep that plan in reserve...

           Hannah runs down the problem -

                                 HANNAH
                        So... We can't drop the weights... The 
                        surface might be sending an acoustic 
                        release signal, but our antenna is 
                        destroyed, so we couldn’t receive it 
                        anyway...

           Looking down -

                                 HANNAH
                        The emergency release wire still has 
                        hours left to corrode, but the Carbon 
                        Dioxide build up and cold will probably 
                        kill us before then...

           She stops for clarification -

                                 HANNAH
                        Is there any possibility they are sending 
                        a crew down for us?

                                 JOSH
                        Not if they think we're already dead. On 
                        their screens, we're a salvage operation. 
                        They wouldn't risk more people if the 
                        area is still seismically active...

           Not what she wanted to hear -

                                 JOSH
                        And even if they were stupid enough to 
                        send more people down here right now, it 
                        would still be at least ninety minutes 
                        before they reached us...

           Hannah crouches down near the hatch window -
                                 JOSH
                        We also have no idea what's going on up 
                        there. That plate shift could have set 
                        off a tsunami. Then, we'd be the absolute 
                        last of their problems...

           Hannah stares out in defeat -

                                 HANNAH
                        Maybe we should just open the bloody 
                        hatch and get it over with...

           Josh says nothing. But he was thinking it too -

           Outside, the sediment has settled. The Lander in the distance -

           A flashing red beacon at the top -

                                 HANNAH
                        The Supply Lander...

           Looks at Josh. This could be something -

                                 HANNAH
                        What's in there?

                                 JOSH
                        Nothing we can use here...

                                 HANNAH
                        Not to use. To get rid of. We shift its 
                        supplies over here and use the Lander to 
                        resurface...

                                 JOSH
                        It's a supply sub. It's not designed to 
                        transport people. There's no life 
                        support, no temperature control, no 
                        ascent control -

                                 HANNAH
                        We don't have any of that stuff here 
                        right now either. But it's pressurised. 
                        It has trapped air...

           Let’s not get too optimistic just yet -

                                 JOSH
                        Okay. But it's fully automated. It 
                        resurfaces once a week on a timer...

                                 HANNAH
                        I've seen the Engineers run diagnostics 
                        on it from a Laptop on the ship. That

                        somewhere and at least a chance at wired 
                        access to its network, right?
                                 JOSH
                        Right...

           She’s absolutely right -

                                 JOSH
                        Right. It sends intermittent data to the 
                        surface, so there’s gotta be a way to get 
                        a message through...

                                 HANNAH
                        Then they can recall us manually, right?

                                 JOSH

                        the bottom of the bloody ocean...?

           Hey, you have to laugh at luck this bad -

                                 JOSH
                        This is the ‘my cell has no signal’ part 
                        of the movie based on the book based on 
                        the true story of our heroic survival...

                                 HANNAH
                        Forget it. We’ll do it ourselves then...

           Josh opens a window showing a DIAGRAM of the Supply Lander -

                                 JOSH
                        Everything is here. We transfer anything 
                        we can’t use to the Crawler, drop weights 
                        and cross our fingers. You didn’t happen 
                        across a couple of rebreathers, did you?

                                 HANNAH
                        No. But we do have two full tanks of 
                        Carbon Dioxide for putting out fires...

           Defeatist sarcasm -

                                 JOSH
                        Of course we do...

           Suddenly S H A K I N G -

           They’re both knocked off their feet -

           Josh’s Laptop falls and smashes beside them -

           They look up at the hatches in fear -

           Please -

           Hold -

           Then it stops -

           That was close -

                                 HANNAH
                        We need to move. Now...

           Josh nods -
           TRENCH DIVE SITE

           A low cloud of sediment swirling around the docked subs -

           CRAWLER FOUR

           The wiring is gone now -

           Just a stream of fluid and bubbles from the Penetrator -

           CRAWLER FOUR SPHERE

           The Sphere quickly filling up with unneeded supplies -

           Josh pulls another box through the hatch -

           SUPPLY LANDER SPHERE

           Hannah passing a bag through her side -

                                 HANNAH
                        How much more can you take?

           CRAWLER FOUR SPHERE

           Josh pulls the bag in and looks around -

                                 JOSH
                        Not much. We still need room for the 
                        hatch to close...

           He wipes sweat from his forehead -

           Fluid leaking from the CAMS Battery and pooling at the base -

           He stares at the dead systems for an extended beat -

           Then picks up one of the Two-Way Radios -

           SUPPLY LANDER SPHERE

           C L A N K -

           Hannah turns to see the Two-Way Radio on the floor -

           C L U N K -

           She crouches down toward the hatches to see -

           The Crawler hatch closed and Josh winding it to lock -

           She scrambles to pick up the radio -

                                 HANNAH
                        What are you doing, Josh...?
           CRAWLER FOUR SPHERE

           Josh finishes locking the hatch -

           Then picks up his radio -

                                 JOSH
                        We both get in there, they’re opening a 
                        coffin on the surface. You know that...

                                 HANNAH (2-WAY)
                        We go together...

           They stare at each other through the hatch window -

                                 JOSH
                        You’re meant to be the smart one. I know 
                        just enough about Physics and Biology to 
                        know you can't bend it by will...

           SUPPLY LANDER SPHERE

           Hannah confused and desperate -

                                 HANNAH
                        We'll figure it out-

           Josh shakes his head and smirks -

                                 JOSH (2-WAY)
                        Get to the surface and send someone back 
                        down for me. With you not sucking up all 
                        my air in here, I may even be alive when 
                        they arrive...

           CRAWLER FOUR SPHERE

           He watches her trying to put it together - 

                                 JOSH
                        We both stay, we both die. We both go, we 
                        both die. That’s the reality. Do the 
                        math. I’ve already done it. There’s no 
                        logic trick. Let’s run through it -

           SUPPLY LANDER SPHERE

           Hannah stares and listens -

                                 JOSH (2-WAY)
                        - We’ve got, maybe, four feet internal 
                        radius? With the stuff we couldn’t get 
                        rid of, we’re looking at about two 
                        hundred cubic feet of air, right?

                                 HANNAH
                        Maybe. Maybe more...
                                 JOSH (2-WAY)
                        My pulse was ninety one last I checked. 
                        Respiratory rate was twenty three. My 
                        resting rates are seventy and eighteen -

           CRAWLER FOUR SPHERE

           He could almost be mistaken for being smug right now -

                                 JOSH
                        - That’s a twenty five percent increase. 
                        Where does that put our CO2 levels?

           She runs the numbers in her head -

                                 HANNAH (2-WAY)
                        One percent...

                                 JOSH
                        Bingo. The more CO2 we breathe, the 
                        faster our heart rate. The faster the 
                        heart rate, the faster the respiratory 
                        rate. The faster the respiratory rate, 
                        the more CO2 we breathe...

           SUPPLY LANDER SPHERE

           Not wanting to admit he’s right -

                                 HANNAH
                        There are a hundred different -

                                 JOSH (2-WAY)
                        Two hundred cubic feet of air, two 
                        people, starting at one percent CO2 and 
                        compounding from there. How long does 
                        that give them until they reach toxicity?

                                 HANNAH
                        I don’t know. I don’t know wha-

                        Best guess. Ballpark it...

           Adding it up -

                                 HANNAH
                        Ninety minutes. Maybe a little more...

           CRAWLER FOUR SPHERE

           Josh nods -

                                 JOSH
                        That’s not going to work. That thing 
                        resurfaces in two hours...
           Brutal truths laid out -

                                 JOSH
                        With the weight we just shifted, maybe 
                        shave fifteen minutes off that. There’s 
                        still fifteen minutes there. Those 
                        fifteen minutes can mean the difference 
                        between seven percent and ten percent...

           Hannah shakes her head -

                                 HANNAH (2-WAY)

                        Do you really want to debate variables? 
                        One person gets a comfortable ride with 
                        excellent chances at survival, or two

           Hannah lingers -

                                 JOSH (2-WAY)
                        We’re wasting time. I’ll talk you through 
                        the preparation...

           She scowls -

                        Don’t bother. I’ll figure it out. Only 
                        one of us is a blithering idiot...

           She stands sharply -

           CRAWLER FOUR SPHERE

           That was brutal, but it had to be done -

           Then he sniffs the air -

           And again -

           He leans forward and follows the smell -

           Finds the leaking CAMS Battery -

           SUPPLY LANDER SPHERE

           Hannah has her Laptop connected and the SYSTEMS PANEL open -

                                 JOSH (2-WAY)
                        Hannah, you need to close your hatch 
                        right now...
           She ignores him, continues typing -

                                 JOSH (2-WAY)
                        Hannah, I’m not screwing around - the 
                        CAMS Battery is leaking. If it fails, the 
                        Crawler will undock and you’ll implode...

           She grabs the radio and snarls -

           Josh grunts and looks at the battery -

           Then at the hatch -

           Hannah still typing -

           The Crawler hatch opens -

           Josh shakes his head -

           He reaches up and begins to pull the Lander hatch down -

           They scowl at each other as they exchange positions -

           Josh picks up the Laptop -

           Clicks on the WEIGHTS option on the Systems screen -

           It gives him access immediately -

                        Not now, Josh...

                                 JOSH
                        No, this is a real one that needs to be 
                        figured out very quickly...

           She turns to him. He’s got ten seconds -

                                 JOSH
                        Two Spheres connected by an air lock. You 
                        need to undock, but you can only 
                        disengage the lock from the opposite 
                        Sphere of the one you want to be in. 
                        While maintaining airtight seals on both. 
                        With a leaking battery that might fail at 
                        any second...

                                 HANNAH
                        Wait for the battery to fail and it sorts 
                        itself out...

                                 JOSH
                        It could fail at any second. It could 
                        also fail in an hour. Or a day...

           Okay, that sucks -

                                 JOSH
                        And the primary lock is powered, but the 
                        secondary lock is mechanical. Those bolts 
                        have to be withdrawn first, no matter 
                        what happens with the magnetic seal...

           She looks around the Sphere -

                                 JOSH
                        Now you understand why I had to -

                                 HANNAH
                        Shhh...

           She starts rummaging through the remaining supplies -

                                 JOSH
                        What are you thinking?

                                 HANNAH
                        I’m not telling you. I’m going to do it 
                        myself, in case you get any more stupid 
                        heroic ideas...

           She takes one of the LED Wands and opens it -

           Puts the two D-cell batteries in her pocket -

           Forcefully rips out a length of thin wire -
                                 HANNAH
                        Make yourself useful - strip the plastic 
                        off this...

           Hannah rips a few pages from a legal pad -

           Josh uses his teeth to strip the plastic from the wire -

           Hannah overlaps the pages lengthways and starts rolling them -

           Josh finishes stripping the wire down to its copper -

           Hannah finishes rolling the pages into a long tube -

           Then twists it from top to bottom to make a fuse -

           She takes the wire from Josh -

                                 JOSH
                        Whatever you’re planning on doing -

           She moves past him towards the hatches -

                                 HANNAH
                        I’ve got it...

                                 JOSH
                        Hey...

           She turns to see the sincerity on his face -

                                 JOSH
                        Please be careful...

           She lets him off the hook -

                                 HANNAH
                        I will. I’ve got it. Help me with the 
                        hatches...

           CRAWLER FOUR SPHERE

           The muffled sounds of mechanical cranking -

           The hatch opens and Hannah slides in -

           She shuffles around the pile of discarded supplies -

           She looks down to see the battery still leaking -

           Then leans over to the DOCKING PANEL -

           Hits the BOLTS button -

           SUPPLY LANDER SPHERE

           W H I R R R R - the bolts retracting -
           Josh braces the hatch with white knuckles -

                                 HANNAH (O.S.)
                        Bolts out. Magnet is holding...

           A small sigh of relief -

           CRAWLER FOUR SPHERE

           Hannah with a nervous and delicate touch -

           Ties one end of the paper fuse to the CAMS Battery wire -

           Then ties the other end around the length of copper wire -

           She bends the wire up into a U shape -

           Takes one of the D-cell batteries from her pocket -

           SUPPLY LANDER SPHERE

           Josh wracked with anticipation. What is she doing in there? -

                                 HANNAH (O.S.)
                        Get ready...

           He’s ready already -

           CRAWLER FOUR SPHERE

           Hannah holds one end of the copper wire to the D-cell battery -

           The the other to the opposite end -

           The wire starts heating up and glowing -

           A lingering beat -

           Then the paper fuse catches fire -

           She drops everything and heads for the -

           SUPPLY LANDER SPHERE

           Josh moves aside as Hannah scurries inside -

                                 HANNAH
                        Close them!

           Josh crawls between the hatches -

           CRAWLER FOUR SPHERE

           Josh gets a quick look at the paper fuse burning down -

           He pulls the hatch down quickly -
           SUPPLY LANDER SPHERE

           C L U N K - Crawler hatch closed -

           Hannah stands by as Josh furiously cranks the handle -

           Then he shuffles out -

           CRAWLER FOUR SPHERE

           The fuse already down to the wires -

           A muffled C L U N K from the Lander -

           SUPPLY LANDER SPHERE

           Josh cranking the Lander hatch to lock -

           CRAWLER FOUR SPHERE

           Z A A A P - the fuse burns through the CAMS Battery wire -

           SUPPLY LANDER SPHERE

           Josh and Hannah feel the magnet lock fail -

           They look out the hatch window -

           Crawler Four has moved off slightly -

                                 HANNAH
                        And I almost made that fuse shorter...

           Josh laughs. He’s glad she didn’t -

           TRENCH DIVE SITE

           Crawler Four slowly sliding away from the Supply Lander -

           CRAWLER FOUR SPHERE

           Flames and black smoke everywhere. The supplies are on fire -

           Worse, so is the leaking CAMS Battery. BUBBLING and HISSING -

           SUPPLY LANDER SPHERE

           Josh and Hannah watch the fiery glow from the Crawler hatch -

                                 JOSH
                        To be honest, I feel slightly emasculated 
                        right now. That was the most MacGyver

           B O O O O M - muffled by titanium and seawater, but -

           They see the Crawler shake violently -
           CRAWLER FOUR

           F S S S S H - a jet of air shoots from the Penetrator -

           TRENCH DIVE SITE

           C R U N C H -

           Crawler Four implodes into a cloud of debris -

           SUPPLY LANDER SPHERE

           Josh and Hannah jolt back in shock -

                                 HANNAH
                        That wasn’t meant to happen...

                                 JOSH
                        That’s six million dollars you just blew 
                        up, Bradford...

           She sits back, shaking her head, breathless -

                                 JOSH
                        I won’t tell...

           He stands up and picks up the Laptop -

                                 JOSH
                        Gotta keep the momentum. We can rest on 
                        the way up...

           She nods in agreement -

           Then hoists herself up -

           TRENCH DIVE SITE

           Lingering on the stillness -

           The Lander all alone beside the Crawler wreckage -

           Then the Floodlights start shutting off -

           From the top down -

           Leaving just the bottom row illuminated -

           SUPPLY LANDER SPHERE

           Josh at the Laptop, running through checks -

           The new CAMS is now connected to the Communications Box -

                                 JOSH

           Josh pulls up the CAMS PANEL -

                        CAMS online...

           Hannah looks over the readings -

           Wait, is that right? -

                                 HANNAH
                        We’re already at two percent...

           Josh resizes the three panels next to each other -

                                 JOSH
                        Worry about it later. If we just sit and 
                        try to keep respiration down, we can see 
                        how far it stretches...

           He brings up the LANDER DIAGRAM PANEL -

                                 JOSH
                        Do you believe in luck?

                        It doesn’t carry shot. The trim is all 
                        automated. It’s basically a drone...

           But wait a minute -

           He pulls up the LANDER DIAGRAM PANEL again -

           Points to the bottom -

                                 JOSH
                        The Payload Bay. It’s carrying a lot of

                        gear. The Crawlers can dump their Payload 
                        Bays in an emergency. We can probably 
                        dump this one too...
           He clicks around the PAYLOAD BAY functions -

                                 HANNAH
                        Will it affect stability?

                                 JOSH
                        It shouldn’t. We’re connected directly to 
                        the top foam Ballast. So is the Payload 
                        Bay, but we’re not connected to that...

                        The Ballast’s buoyancy is slightly 
                        greater than the Sphere buoyancy. As long 
                        as we’re attached securely to the

                        I’ve never been slapped before. Punched,

           A beat as they listen to the rushing water outside -

                                 HANNAH
                        I guess we should get comfortable...

           Yes. Yes, they should -

           SUPPLY LANDER

           Rocketing up through dark waters -

           Illuminated only by its remaining Floodlights -

           The Sphere secured to the Ballast by a web basket -

           A series of straps criss-crossed and bolted to the Ballast -

           But ONE BOLT is already BENDING under the strain -

           SUPPLY LANDER SPHERE

           Josh and Hannah sit at opposite sides of the Sphere - 

           Both wrapped in Mylar Space Blankets in the cold air -

           ‘Go Your Own Way’ by Fleetwood Mac plays from the Laptop -

           Hannah sits quietly and listens -
           Josh braids strands of wire together -

                                 JOSH
                        This song is so brutal...

           Sacrilege -

                                 HANNAH
                        What? I love this song...

                                 JOSH
                        So do I. But think about it - you’re in a 
                        band with your boyfriend, you have a 
                        nasty breakup, he writes a not very 
                        flattering song about you, and you have 
                        to play the tambourine and sing backup 
                        vocals to it live on stage a hundred 
                        times a year...

           When you put it like that -

                                 HANNAH
                        That is pretty brutal, yeah. Bloody 
                        artists, hey? Just have to get their 
                        feelings out in a marketable format. 
                        Couldn’t just tell her to piss off in a 
                        text...

           They laugh -

                                 JOSH
                        I prefer somewhere in between hate 
                        texting and chart-topping single, I have 
                        to say...

                                 HANNAH
                        What a man. Might I say though, you are 
                        uncannily excellent at braiding...

           She watches him braiding the wire -

                                 JOSH
                        I have to be - I braid my little sister's 
                        hair all the time...

                                 HANNAH
                        Oh, that's sweet. I think. Wait - how old 
                        is she?

                                 JOSH
                        She's six...

                                 HANNAH
                        Okay, that's not creepy then. Six? Were 
                        you that horrible a child you put your 
                        poor parents off another for thirty 
                        years?
                                 JOSH
                        No. Third wife. My Dad has a high burn 
                        rate. This one is two years younger than 
                        me though. Very awkward...

                                 HANNAH
                        Holy crap. Tom, you old tomcat...

                                 JOSH
                        I'll say. Terrible role model, but 
                        clearly he has something working for him.

           Oh, wait a minute -

                                 JOSH
                        Had...

           Hannah determined not to let him linger on the sad pause -

                                 HANNAH
                        He said your mother raised you. I didn’t 
                        know that...

                                 JOSH
                        Yeah. He never did get a handle on the 
                        fatherhood thing until Bess came along. I 
                        didn’t even reconnect with him until I 
                        was twenty five, so that was a good 
                        thirteen years or so between visits...

                                 HANNAH
                        Wow. But you’re so funny together. You 
                        joke around like brothers...

                                 JOSH
                        Well, he was still mentally twenty five 
                        when we met up again, so that helped...

           She laughs. That sounds very plausible -

                                 JOSH
                        He was a good friend. I get him. But he 
                        was just a paper father to me. If he 
                        tries anything paternal now, it just 
                        weirds me out. Couldn’t take it serious. 
                        And that frustrated him, I think. But 
                        what can you do? It was what it was...

           No stopping this sad pause -

           Josh looks at the Laptop -

                                 JOSH
                        We just hit three percent CO2...

                                 HANNAH
                        Vitals?
           Checks his watch -

                                 JOSH
                        Pulse one forty four. Blood pressure one 
                        thrity over eighty five. Body temperature 
                        just over ninety nine. I’m respirating at 
                        about thirty six...

           Not great -

                                 HANNAH
                        Where are we?

                                 JOSH
                        We’re at twenty three thousand, five 
                        twenty three feet. Speed five Knots...

           Hannah leans her head back -

           Josh goes back to braiding -

           A long silence -

           Then Hannah sits back up, half panicked -

                                 HANNAH
                        I can’t die down here...

           Josh slaps his knee -

                                 JOSH
                        Well, that settles it then...

                                 HANNAH
                        I’m serious. It’s my sister’s wedding in 
                        two weeks. If I die today, there’s no way 
                        they would go ahead with it...

                                 JOSH
                        I would hope not...

           No, he doesn’t understand -

                                 HANNAH
                        She’s been planning this bloody thing 
                        since she was ten years old. I’m telling 
                        you, she had a meltdown at her sixteenth 
                        birthday party because I got food 
                        poisoning and ruined it for her. It took 
                        all of the attention away from her. This 
                        would definitely top that...

           Of all the things to worry about right now -

                                 JOSH
                        I had no idea you were that selfish...
           She laughs hopelessly -

                                 HANNAH
                        Tell me about it. I’m terrible...

                                 JOSH
                        Everybody complains about living in 
                        someone else’s shadow, but nobody stops 
                        to think how the shadow caster might 
                        feel...

           Both laughing now -

                                 HANNAH
                        Stop it. It’s not funny.

           They laugh until it naturally dies off -

           Then a silence -

                                 HANNAH
                        What are you going to do if we get out of 
                        this, Josh?

                                 JOSH
                        Nothing...

                                 HANNAH
                        Nothing?

                                 JOSH
                        Nothing. My dream has always been to make 
                        enough money to retire and do nothing but 
                        whatever I feel like...

           Is he serious? -

                                 HANNAH
                        Well, that’s certainly ambitious - 
                        retirement at thirty six...

           He’s clearly thought about all this before -

                                 JOSH
                        You gotta do what makes you happy. What 
                        makes me happy is sleeping in, late 
                        breakfasts, fresh roasted Kona coffee, 
                        diving, fishing, dinners by the beach and 
                        staying up late. I can do all of that in 
                        Hawaii for under a hundred dollars a day. 
                        If I live to a hundred and one, I just 
                        need two million, three hundred and 
                        seventy two thousand, five hundred 
                        dollars...

                                 HANNAH
                        Oh, is that all?
           He’s really not joking -

                                 JOSH
                        Maybe less if I put half that in a long 
                        term interest account and live off the 
                        growth...

                                 HANNAH
                        Wow...

           What else is there to say to that? -

                                 JOSH
                        What’s you master plan then?

                                 HANNAH
                        I don’t know. But there has to be 
                        something more than that...

                                 JOSH
                        Why? Strip everything away and that’s all 
                        there is. What do you want most in the 
                        world right at this very second?

           That’s easy -

                                 HANNAH
                        To get the hell out of here...

                                 JOSH
                        Why? To not die, right?

                                 HANNAH
                        Yes...

           He shrugs sincerely -

                                 JOSH
                        That’s what I want to do for as long as I 
                        can. Not die and be happy doing it...

           She considers it -

           Then smiles -

                                 HANNAH
                        That’s sweet. It’s bollocks, mind you - 
                        but it’s very sweet bollocks...

           He shrugs. That’s him. Take it or leave it -

                                 JOSH
                        I’ll remember that if you’re ever in 
                        Hawaii and need a place to crash...

           She laughs until it fades back to silence -
           SUPPLY LANDER

           Still rocketing up through dark waters -

           The Web Basket holding, BUT -

           THREE MORE BOLTS are starting to bend under the strain -

           Slowly being ripped from their holdings -

           SUPPLY LANDER SPHERE

           Hannah curled up in her blanket -

           Josh with the Laptop in front of him, hiding his concern -

           The SYSTEMS PANEL reads -

           He pulls up iTunes over the systems panels -

           Out of sight, out of mind -

           Hannah stares aimlessly at the hatch window -

                                 JOSH
                        I think I found us an air supply...

           That breaks her gaze -

                                 HANNAH
                        What...?

           Josh clacks away on the Laptop, then -

           ‘All Out Of Love’ by Air Supply starts playing -

                                 HANNAH
                        Oh, you wanker...
           She throws a rolled up cable at him -

                                 JOSH
                        Hey, this is your collection, not mine...

           She sits up -

                                 HANNAH
                        Give it here. At least put something 
                        cheerful on...

           He passes the Laptop across to her -

           Watches her scroll through her playlist -

           She smiles every now and again -

           Then stops -

                                 HANNAH
                        Oh, this is my favorite song...

           ‘Summer Rain’ by Belinda Carlisle starts playing -

           Wait, what? -

                                 JOSH
                        Your favorite song is Summer Rain by 
                        Belinda Carlisle?

           She doesn’t need to defend her taste -

                                 HANNAH
                        So what? I was an 80’s child. My sister 
                        and I loved Belinda Carlisle...

           She’s happy. She starts singing -

           Her voice a little strained and breathless, but pleasant -

                                 HANNAH
                        Whispering my goodbyes,
                        Waiting for the train,
                        I was dancing with my baby,
                        In the summer rain,
                        I can hear him saying,
                        "Nothing will change,
                        Come dance with me, baby,
                        In the summer rain"

           She leans forward and mocks sultriness -

                                 HANNAH
                        I remember the rain on his skin,
                        And his kisses hotter,
                        Than the Santa Ana winds,
           She stops and rolls her eyes with a laugh -

                                 HANNAH
                        Who the hell knows what the Santa Ana 
                        winds are? What an obscure metaphor to 
                        put into a song...

           She leans back, still singing confidently at him -

           He smiles. He loves it -

                                 HANNAH
                        I remember laughing til we almost cried,
                        There at the station that night,
                        I remember looking in his eyes,

           She closes her eyes. Shaking her head. Giving it her all -

                                 HANNAH
                        Oh, my love, it's you that I dream of,
                        Oh, my love, since that day,
                        Somewhere in my heart I'm always,
                        Dancing with you in the summer rain,

           Her eyes dart open like a wave just rose up inside her -

                                 HANNAH
                        Oh, bloody hell. I just got a chill up my 
                        spine. Like you’re listening to a song, 
                        and you’re suddenly back to a place you 
                        remember. You ever have that?

                                 JOSH
                        Sure. Not to Belinda Carlisle, but sure.

                                 HANNAH
                        My sister and I put on a concert at 
                        Christmas lunch and we sang this for all 
                        of our relatives. The dance moves from 
                        the film clip and everything. So tragic.

           She looks down, nodding and concentrating on the lyrics -

           Locking in on that memory -

                                 HANNAH
                        I can hear the whistle,
                        Military train,
                        I was dancing with my baby,
                        In the summer rain,
                        I can hear him singing,
                        "Ooh love is strange,
                        Come dance with me, baby,
                        In the summer rain"

           She puts her head back and closes her eyes -
           She’s 9 years old again. Tears rise up over her eyelashes -

                                 HANNAH
                        I remember the rain pouring down,
                        And we poured our hearts out,
                        As the train pulled out,
                        I can see my baby,
                        Waving from the train,
                        It was the last time that I saw him,
                        In the summer rain,

           The tears roll down from the corners of her eyes -

                                 HANNAH
                        Oh, my love, it's you that I dream of,
                        Oh my love, since that day,
                        Somewhere in my heart I'm always,
                        Dancing with you in the summer rain,

           She opens her wet eyes and looks at him. Maybe through him -

                                 HANNAH
                        Doesn't matter what I do now,
                        Doesn't matter what I say,
                        Somewhere in my heart I'm always,
                        Dancing with you in the summer rain,

           She wipes her eyes with her palms -

                                 HANNAH
                        Why am I crying?! It’s about some bird 
                        sending her guy off to war and 
                        remembering them dancing around in the 
                        rain like a pair of idiots. How stupid...

                                 JOSH
                        Obviously not that stupid to you...

           She trembles with a quiet laugh -

           Then closes her eyes again. Singing softer. But heartfelt -

                                 HANNAH
                        Every time I see the lightning,
                        Every time I hear the thunder,
                        Every time I close the window,
                        When this happens in the summer,
                        Oh, the night is so inviting,
                        I can feel that you were so close,
                        I can feel you when the wind blows,
                        Blows right through my heart,

           Eyes still wet. But she’s smiling. Laughing inside -

           And Josh is in love -

           She’s a mess, but a sincere one -
                                 HANNAH
                        Oh, my love, it's you that I dream of,
                        Oh, my love, since that day,
                        Somewhere in my heart I'm always,
                        Dancing with you in the summer rain,
                        Every night and every day now,
                        Though I know you've gone away,
                        Somewhere in my heart I'm always,
                        Dancing with you in the summer rain...

           She opens her eyes as the music fades out -

           They stare at each other -

                                 HANNAH
                        I can’t die here...

           She means it -

                                 JOSH
                        I know...

           She nods -

           But this all got too serious for a minute there -

                                 HANNAH
                        So, a cowboy rides into town on Thursday, 
                        stays for six nights and then rides back 
                        out of town on Thursday. How is that 
                        possible?

           So easy. Elementary stuff -

                                 JOSH
                        Thursday is the name of his horse. Nice 
                        try though...

           She smiles and sits back -

                                 HANNAH
                        I love that one. If I had a horse, I’d 
                        name it Thursday...

                                 JOSH
                        Beats the hell out of Chester...

                                 HANNAH
                        Hey!

           She throws another cable at him -

           Then a silence -

                                 JOSH
                        I’m really tired...
                                 HANNAH
                        Don’t go to sleep. If it’s the CO2, you 
                        might not wake up...

           He nods. He knows that. He’s not stupid -

           SUPPLY LANDER

           Continuing its rapid ascent -

           The Web Basket still holding, BUT -

           ALL THE BOLTS are now bending under the strain -

           And then SNAP -

           One of the bolts shoots off -

           The strap it was securing now loose -

           SUPPLY LANDER SPHERE

           Hannah and Josh are both asleep, curled up in their blankets -

           The Sphere JOLTS and wakes Josh and Hannah -

           They look around and wait -

           Nothing. Did they just dream it? -

                                 HANNAH
                        I told you not to fall asleep!

                                 JOSH
                        Hey, you were asleep too!

           He rubs his eyes and grabs the Laptop -

                                 HANNAH
                        Where are we?

                                 JOSH
                        Twenty three hundred feet. Six and a half 
                        percent CO2...

           She sits up, already panicked. That is not good -

                                 JOSH
                        I know. But we’re nearly there. We knew 
                        it was going to get close to this...

           She has tears of frustration in her eyes -

                                 HANNAH
                        How did we fall asleep? That could have 
                        been it for us... 
           He needs to calm her, or they’ll burn Oxygen faster -

                                 JOSH
                        Just breathe...

           He leans over and puts his hand on her leg -

                                 JOSH
                        Breathe...

           She puts her head down and tries to control her breathing -

           But then -

           A muffled SNAP and the Lander JOLTS -

           They look at each other. That wasn’t a dream -

                                 HANNAH
                        Wha-

           Another SNAP and the Lander JOLTS again -

           SUPPLY LANDER

           Still rocketing up through the water, BUT -

           Three straps from the web basket have broken from the Ballast -

           SNAP - another one goes -

           The Sphere drops a little further away from the Ballast -

           SNAP -

           SUPPLY LANDER SPHERE

           They’re jolted around again -

                                 HANNAH
                        What is it?

           They’re both panicked now -

                                 JOSH
                        I don’t know... I don’t know if we’re 
                        hitting something or-

           Another SNAP and JOLT -

           SUPPLY LANDER

           Half the straps are broken now -

           The umbilical connecting the Sphere to the Ballast stretched -

           SNAP - another strap goes -
           The Sphere drops again -

           SUPPLY LANDER SPHERE

           They hold on to the shelves, exchanging a look of dread -

           Another SNAP and JOLT -

           This absolutely sucks -

           And now the Sphere is starting to SPIN -

           SUPPLY LANDER

           The Sphere only connected to the Ballast by three straps -

           The umbilical still attached, but strained -

           The web basket holding the Sphere stretched as -

           The Sphere’s own buoyancy kicking in -

           Causing the Sphere and Ballast to spin uncontrollably -

           Weight and counterweight, tilting both -

           SUPPLY LANDER SPHERE

           Josh and Hannah grip the shelves, eyes closed -

           Shielding themselves from the loose and tumbling supplies -

           The whole Sphere almost horizontal from before -

           Spinning wildly and SNAP -

           SUPPLY LANDER

           Another strap goes and the umbilical stretches further -

           The Sphere moves further away from the Ballast -

           The momentum increasing as they orbit each other -

           Sending them wildly off course -

           Hurtling towards a ROCK WALL -

           SUPPLY LANDER SPHERE

           Josh and Hannah almost blacking out from the G-force -

           The loose supplies now firmly plastered against the Sphere -

           Then C R U U U N C H -

           Time almost stands still as the Sphere stops brutally -
           Josh and Hannah weightless for a few seconds -

           The supplies flying around them -

           SUPPLY LANDER

           Crashed against the rock wall -

           But still ascending -

           SCRAPING against its craggy surface -

           SUPPLY LANDER SPHERE

           C R E E E E E E E E E E A K -

           Almost ear-piercing as the Sphere rolls -

           Josh, Hannah and the supplies like laundry in a tumble dryer -

           SUPPLY LANDER

           Scraping along the rock wall -

           A SNAP as another strap rips from the Ballast -

           Heading towards a slight overhang above -

           SUPPLY LANDER SPHERE

           Still tumbling, Hannah has blacked out -

           Then CRACK -

           The Sphere jolts to a stop -

           Sending everything brutally upwards for a split second -

           Then CRASHING back down -

           The Sphere vertical once again, but upside down -

           SUPPLY LANDER

           The Sphere and Ballast snagged on a small overhang -

           Floating next to each other like balloons -

           Anchored only by the umbilical and straps caught on the rock -

           SUPPLY LANDER SPHERE

           Hannah GASPS for breath as her eyes shoot open -

           Josh next to her in a pile of supplies, holding his side -

           The Sphere bobbing and swaying -
                                 HANNAH
                        What happened?

           Josh dazed -

                                 JOSH
                        I don’t know...

           He winces and reaches for the Laptop -

           Opens it up and looks at the SYSTEMS PANELS -

                                 JOSH
                        We’re at six hundred and eighty feet...

                        Approaching eight percent CO2...

           This is just too much -

           Then a final SNAP and a JOLT -

           Hannah SCREAMS in frustration -

           SUPPLY LANDER

           The Ballast holding on only by the umbilical -

           C R E E E A K -

           But this time from inside the Sphere -

           They look over to see the COMMUNICATIONS BOX rattling -

           Then T W A N G -

           The umbilical erupts from below them -

           Sending supplies flying as it rips off its wall fasteners -

           Hannah and Josh shuffle to either side -

           Staring at the taut and straining umbilical -

           A straight line from the PENETRATOR to the -

           Communications Box, RATTLING and CREAKING -

           Josh reaches out and rips the Laptop’s Ethernet cable -
           Just as S N A P -

           The umbilical breaks free from the Communications Box -

           Violently whipping and snaking its way down to the Penetrator -

           Then disappearing completely -

           SUPPLY LANDER

           The Ballast takes off like a rocket -

           The umbilical whipping like a tail behind it -

           Leaving just the Sphere still floating in the snagged webbing -

           Josh leaps into action -

                                 JOSH
                        Get blankets, tape, whatever... we need 
                        to plug that hole before the Sphere 
                        pressurizes...

           Hannah digs through the supplies -

           Josh throws stuff aside to get to the Penetrator -

           Water lapping the hole like a Moon Pool -

           Hannah starts stuffing a SPACE BLANKET into it -

           Josh bites off strips of ELECTRICAL TAPE -

           Hannah folds another space blanket on top and -

           Josh starts securing its edges with Electrical Tape -

           It bulges a little with pressure, but Hannah holds it flat -

           While Josh finishes taping it secure -

           Then they both fall back in a pile of supplies -

           Breathing rapidly -

                                 HANNAH
                        Will it hold?

           Josh wants to lie, but -

                                 JOSH
                        No...

           Hannah leans her head back and closes her eyes -
           Josh looks around as shock sets in -

           SUPPLY LANDER

           The Sphere floating and swaying in the snagged webbing -

           Almost serene -

           SUPPLY LANDER SPHERE

           Stillness, soundtracked only by the rapid breathing -

           Josh stares up at the bottom of the Sphere -

           Then sits up to look at Hannah -

           Her eyes find his, but she doesn’t sit up -

           He shakes his head. It’s just no use -

                                 JOSH
                        We’re out of time...

           She breathes rapid and heavy, but nods slowly -

           Josh opens the Laptop and shuffles around -

           Clicks on the iMovie icon -

           The program opens to a video view of himself -

           He stares at the screen and Hannah behind him -

           He shakes his head. Can’t believe it actually came to this -

           Then he hits RECORD -

           A pause before sighing and launching into it, clinically -

                                 JOSH
                        Guys... we did everything we could. It 
                        was just one of those one in a million 
                        things. Don’t let it stop you from coming 
                        down here. There is so much left to see 
                        and find, and looking at it on a screen 
                        is nothing like seeing it with your own 
                        eyes. Don’t stop...

           Hating this part -

                                 JOSH
                        Mom, I love you. You already know that. 
                        I’m sorry for the past few years. Nothing 
                        was anybody’s fault. We’re just different 
                        people, I guess. But I do appreciate 
                        everything you ever did, and I do love 
                        you, okay? No matter what...
           Solemn and serious -

                                 JOSH
                        Kathy, Dad went quick and painless. He 
                        wouldn’t have even known it was coming. 
                        And he went trying to bail us out, so be 
                        proud of him. Tell Russ’s family the same 
                        thing. They did everything right...

           Then he perks up a lot -

                                 JOSH
                        Bess, little girl, you look after your 
                        Mom. You’re a super amazing little sister 
                        and you’re going to be kick-ass at 
                        whatever you decide to do. You’ve got 
                        Strand family DNA inside you, which is 
                        practically a super power. Love you, 
                        monkey. Be strong...

           He kisses two fingers and touches them to the camera -

           Then sniffs and wipes his face as he backs away -

           He nods at Hannah as she approach the Laptop slowly -

           She adjusts the camera and gives a sad smile -

           A deep, brave breath and then -

                                 HANNAH
                        Hello, family. Not an ideal way to say 
                        goodbye, I know, but it’s all we can do 
                        at the moment...

           Trying to sound cheerful -

                                 HANNAH
                        Mom and Dad, you were right - I should 
                        have stayed in Dartford and gone into 
                        General Practice. Instead, I just had to 
                        go gallivanting around the bloody world, 
                        looking for adventure. Typical Hannah, 
                        hey? Following her heart into trouble...

           She laughs sadly then pleads -

                                 HANNAH
                        Em, don’t cancel your wedding. Promise 
                        me. Just stick a photo on my seat and a 
                        bottle of Red in front of it. Sorted. 
                        You’ll hardly know I’m missing. When the 
                        relatives get knackered and start 
                        waffling, just send them over to me. I’ll 
                        be the designated drunk talking post...

           Then remembers -
                                 HANNAH
                        Oh, and make the DJ play ‘Summer Rain’. I 
                        listened to it earlier and it gave me 
                        goosebumps. It was honestly like you were 
                        here with me, dancing like a twit. Make 
                        them play it, and I swear I’ll be there 
                        too...

           The mask slips and tears well up in her eyes -

                                 HANNAH
                        I just wanted you all to know that I 
                        wasn’t alone...

           Josh watches and listens, tears forming as well -

                                 HANNAH
                        I wasn’t alone. Josh was with me the 
                        whole way. You’d probably hate him, 
                        because he’s incredibly smart but 
                        incredibly lazy and loud. So American. 
                        But he made me laugh all through it...

           She wipes her eyes and smiles -

                                 HANNAH
                        We really did try. We really did. I’m 
                        quite chuffed we got as far as we did, 
                        all things considered. It was just 
                        really, really crap luck. The worst...

           Josh shakes his head in the background -

           Hannah takes a resigned breath and sighs -

                                 HANNAH
                        I don’t want to blather on. I love you 
                        guys. Anyone who wants my stuff can have 
                        it, but please make sure that Chester 
                        goes to Nan. She’s the only one he seems 
                        to like, so he would be -

           Josh steps forward -

           And turns the Laptop camera towards himself -

                                 JOSH
                        Okay, Bradfords - firstly, I’m not lazy. 
                        I’m just a really laid back guy...

           Hannah laughs. Probably true -

                                 JOSH
                        Secondly, fuck everything she just said - 
                        we’ll see you on the surface...

           Josh stops the recording and closes the Laptop -
           Hannah is shocked-

           But he launches straight into it -

                                 JOSH
                        How’s your diving?

                                 HANNAH
                        Oh God...

                                 JOSH
                        That good?

                                 HANNAH
                        I did the training for the job...

                                 JOSH
                        Okay. Well, it’s better than nothing, I 
                        guess. We have to get out of here. We can 
                        get out of here. A straight shot up...

           She stands, not believing what she’s hearing -

                                 HANNAH
                        We’re at six hundred and seventy feet...

           But he has resolutely decided on optimism -

                                 JOSH
                        The world record for freediving is seven 
                        hundred feet...

                                 HANNAH
                        Well, I’m not a bloody freediver, are 
                        you...?

                                 JOSH
                        I do blue water spearfishing at depth...

                                 HANNAH
                        How deep?

                                 JOSH
                        Fifty, sixty feet. I went down to one 
                        twenty off Mexico though...

                                 HANNAH
                        Oh God...

           She leans back against the Sphere, shaking her head -

                                 JOSH
                        The principle is the same. Hold your 
                        breath at depth, and then exhale slowly 
                        as your resurface...

           The negatives race through her brain -
                                 HANNAH
                        I can’t hold my breath that long. It will 
                        take ten minutes to surface from this 
                        depth. And we’ll have decompression 
                        sickness and no equipment to deal with 
                        it. That’s if we even make it. If we bail 
                        out here, the pressure will collapse our 
                        lungs, our eardrums will implode, our -

                                 JOSH
                        Not if we pressurize first and make a 
                        Lift Bag...

           She doesn’t even know what to say -

                                 JOSH
                        My grandfather did the same thing in a 
                        scuttled sub in World War II. Went out a 
                        torpedo tube and used a bag of air to 
                        ascend...

                                 HANNAH
                        At what depth?

                                 JOSH
                        Four hundred feet...

                                 HANNAH
                        You’re getting closer...

                                 JOSH
                        Man, it’s really ocean-half-empty with 
                        you, huh?

           She desperately wants his optimism -

                                 HANNAH
                        Okay - go...

           He leans in. He knows this stuff -

                                 JOSH
                        We’re above the thermocline, so the water 
                        temperature out there is going to be 
                        brisk but tolerable...

           He picks up one of the MYLAR SPACE BLANKETS -

                                 JOSH
                        We can wrap and tape the thermal blankets 
                        into makeshift dry suits. It’s not ideal, 
                        but we just need to keep our core 
                        temperatures as stable as possible to 
                        avoid hypothermia until we’re up into the 
                        warmer waters. Then we make an open 
                        bottom Lift Bag out of this - 
           He picks up the WATERPROOF BAG of spare clothing -

                                 JOSH
                        - and then flood the Sphere. It should 
                        take less than a minute to equalize the 
                        pressure...

           She’s taking it in, and it’s starting to feel plausible -

                                 JOSH
                        Then we take a breath, bail out and 
                        exhale until we get to the surface...

                                 HANNAH
                        How long?

                                 JOSH
                        A minute. Maybe two...

                                 HANNAH
                        Maybe two?

                                 JOSH
                        Probably two. Let’s just call it two...

           She slides down the Sphere into a squat -

                                 JOSH
                        We can do this. You already know how to 
                        control your breathing -

                                 HANNAH
                        I know how to breathe in for three 
                        seconds, hold it for seven and exhale for 
                        eight to calm my nerves, but that’s -

                                 JOSH
                        Eight seconds, one hundred and twenty - 
                        they’re practically the same...

           She laughs nervously -

                                 HANNAH
                        I don’t know if I can do it. Actually, I 
                        know I can’t do it. I’m rubbish at 
                        holding my breath. We used to -

           He cuts her off and gives it to her cold and straight -

                                 JOSH
                        I don’t care. Even if you can’t, you’ll 
                        have a shot of being revived on the 
                        surface. Down here, there’s nothing. This 
                        here is death. For certain. We are 
                        already dying. Right now...

           She knows that much -
                                 JOSH
                        If that’s what you want, just sit down 
                        and ride it out. I’ll stay with you. But 
                        I don’t want to die. And I know you don’t 
                        want to die. This is not that complex of 
                        a decision...

           She stares up at him sadly -

                                 JOSH
                        Let me put it another way...

           He squats down in front to her -

                                 JOSH
                        Two people are trapped in a watertight 
                        Sphere seven hundred feet below the 
                        surface of the ocean. Carbon Dioxide 
                        poisoning is about five minutes away from 
                        rendering them unconscious, after which 
                        they’ll die within another ten minutes. 
                        All they have is a waterproof bag. How do 
                        they get out alive?

           She stares at him for a beat -

           Then gives in to the logic -

                                 HANNAH
                        They trap air in the bag and use it to 
                        float to the surface...

           He smiles and nods -

                                 JOSH
                        You bet they do...

           He stands up and holds out his hand -

           She takes it -

           Josh starts wrapping the thermal strips around his middle -

           Over the already multiple layers of clothing -
           Overlapping them like bandages -

           Hannah patches them at the ends with Electrical Tape -

                        We need to keep the wrists and neck 
                        loose. The drop in water pressure when we 
                        ascend is going to make the air in our

                        out...

           She tapes the wrist slightly loose -

           He notices her squinting and heavy breathing -

                        This is actually quite toasty...

           He finishes taping loosely around her neck -

                        Toasty and catwalk ready...

           She laughs -

           He smiles and reaches for the spool of SHIELDED WIRE -

           Unravelling it from the end -
                                 JOSH
                        Put your arms out to the side...

           She does -

           He loops the wire around her waist -

                                 HANNAH
                        Let’s not get inappropriate here, 
                        Captain...

           Another pass around the waist -

                        This is just the start. A five-point

                        Well, let’s both agree to keep it above 
                        board then...

           He starts looping the wire over her shoulder -

           Bringing them close face-to-face -

           The humor masks not completely hiding the fear -

           Tired eyes, sweating, rapid breathing -

           They may as well be looking in a mirror -

           Josh loops DATA CABLES through the end of the Waterproof Bag -

           Some through the manufactured D-rings -

           Some he has cut into the fabric itself for reinforcement -

           The Data Cables securely tied to a TRIPLE BRAIDED WIRE CORD -

           Hannah braids the strands at the other end of the cord -

           Their harnesses are crude, but finished -
           They both have an LED Wand taped to their forearm -

           They’re exhausted and struggling to concentrate -

           Hannah notices Josh’s determination -

                                 HANNAH
                        I’m sorry I mocked your dream. It 
                        actually sounds really lovely...

           He laughs. He never cared about that anyway -

                        Don’t worry about it...

           He pulls on the cables to test the knot strength -

                        Hey if we do get out of this, then we can 
                        co-author a book about it. We’ll ask for 
                        five million dollars and split it...

                                 JOSH
                        Now you’re using that brain. How’s your 
                        writing?

           Hannah ties up the end of the braided cord -

                                 HANNAH
                        Rubbish. We’ll have to pay somebody else 
                        to sex it up, I suppose. Or you could do 
                        my half. I know you’re quite good at

           Josh stands up and puts his hand out -

                        The best there is. Give me a topic and

           Hannah hands him the other end of the cord -

                        I don’t doubt it...

           He starts bundling the cord into a loop -

           He looks up at top of the shelves -

           Josh slowly cranks the handle on the hatch -

           Hannah has removed the top shelf to make room -

           And has wedged herself as high up as possible -

           Josh ties a length of Data Cable around the handle -

           Feeds it some slack as he climbs the shelves -

           Hannah helps pull him up -

           He manages to squeeze into the tiny space -

           They’re both contorted well beyond comfort -

                        of the hatch and compress all the air up

                        need a few minutes...

           Josh gives the Data Cable one huge tug -

           The handle turns that last rotation and -

           B O O O M - the hatch explodes open -
           F W O O O S H - the jet of incoming water rattles the Sphere -

           Josh almost falls -

           But Hannah grabs him -

           The water filling the Sphere very quickly -

                                 HANNAH
                        I didn’t think it would be this fast...

           They hold on amidst the shaking -

           The water already at mid hatch height now and still filling -

                                 HANNAH
                        What if it doesn’t stop?

                                 JOSH
                        It has to stop. There’s nowhere else for 
                        the air to go...

           The water rises above the hatch so fast -

           Boxes, bags and components floating to the surface -

                                 HANNAH

           The water reaches their legs -

           They flinch at the cold -

           Josh visibly concerned now. Did he just kill them? -

           But then the water slows -

           And stops a few inches above the top of the hatch -

                                 JOSH

           An uneasy laugh -

                        Every minute we spend at this pressure is 
                        a decompression debt we owe at the top -

           Josh stuffs the FIRE EXTINGUISHER into the LIFT BAG -
                                 JOSH
                        - and we do not want that. Take this...

           He passes the Lift Bag and Cord to Hannah -

           Then shuffles into position -

           And begins lowering himself into the water -

           His mouth instinctively shoots open when he feels the cold -

                                 HANNAH
                        Are you all right?

           Deep breaths -

                        It’s cold - it’s really cold...

           Hannah watches in sympathy -

           He drops in all the way up to mid chest -

           His teeth chatter, breathing accelerates -

           Hannah passes down the Lift Bag -

           She nods as he turns on his LED Wand -

           Takes a huge breath -

           Then ducks underwater -

           Swimming through the floating supplies -

           Josh pulls himself out of the open hatch -

           He notices the turning and closing gap -

           He drags the bag in his hand, trailing the cord behind -
           It’s dark, but his light gives just enough visibility -

           Another larger rocky overhang above -

           Doing everything he can to hold the breath -

           Pulls himself up the rock face, clear of the Sphere -

           Braces his legs in a squat against the rocks -

           Then kicks himself out into open water -

           He swims up towards the tip of the large overhang -

           Clutching the Lift Bag -

           Getting closer -

           Reaches out and grabs a rock -

           Uses it to pull himself up to the ledge -

           He sees a hole between two rocks wedged together -

           Passes the loose end of a Data Cable through the hole -

           Loops it back and ties a secure knot -

           He pulls on the makeshift tether as hard as he can -

           It holds -

           He opens the bag and takes out the Fire Extinguisher -

           Inserts the extinguisher horn into the Lift Bag -

           Then presses down on the lever -

           F W O O O S H -

           The bag immediately begins to rise like a kite -

           Displaced water rushing out the bottom -

           The cords and tether are both taut -

           But they hold -

           He puts the horn back in and continues filling -

           F W O O O O O O O O O O O S H -

           More water flowing out, replaced by Carbon Dioxide -

           Then it’s done -

           He looks it over -
           It’s just a big long balloon tethered to a rock -

           Floating in the open water -

           He tests the tether again, pulling it hard -

           It holds -

           But he’s really losing this breath now -

           Starts to exhale bubbles -

           So he turns and uses the cord to guide his swim back -

           Hannah shivering and watching the water below -

           Nothing -

           She’s starting to panic -

           Then a light appears, entering the hatch -

           She’s overjoyed -

           Josh stands up in the water -

           And vomits a mouthful of seawater -

                        Oh no - are you all right...?

           Coughing and spluttering water everywhere -

                                 HANNAH
                        Give me your arm. I’ll help you up -

           He shakes his head, coughing again -

                                 JOSH
                        We don’t have time. We can’t stay any 
                        longer at this pressure without getting 
                        decompression sickness on the surface, 
                        and the Sphere is rotating. We need to 
                        move before it blocks the hatch against 
                        the wall...

           She’s worried -

                                 JOSH
                        I’m not going to lie to you - it sucks. 
                        It really, really sucks. It is 
                        unbelievably cold and when you’re in it, 
                        it feels like there’s a freaking anvil on 
                        your chest. But this is it. We have to go 
                        now...
           He puts his hands up -

           Hannah shakes, but accepts -

           He helps lower her slowly down into the water -

           Her mouth shooting open instinctively too -

           Gasping for breath -

                                 JOSH
                        I know...

                                 HANNAH
                        Oh my God...

                                 JOSH
                        I know...

           They’re both shivering uncontrollably -

           Blue lips trembling -

                                 JOSH
                        Just look at me and breathe. I have to 
                        tether us...

           They stare each other in the eyes -

           Steadying their breathing -

           Josh weaves the end of the cord through their harnesses -

                                 HANNAH
                        I feel really light-headed, Josh...

                                 JOSH
                        Like you’re drunk?

           Her eyes roll around as she nods -

           He nods, still securing them tightly together -

                                 JOSH
                        It’s the pressure narcosis. Do you have 
                        tunnel vision...?

           She nods again, dreamily -

           He loops the cord around her waist -

                                 JOSH
                        Okay. Don’t think of anything but 
                        breathing. One simple thing. That’s all 
                        you need to concentrate on...

           She blinks rapidly and concentrates on his face -
                                 HANNAH
                        You’re blurry...

           He threads the cord through their harnesses again -

           Her eyes starting to wander -

                                 JOSH
                        Hannah!

           She snaps focus back to him -

                                 JOSH
                        Hannah, you really need to concentrate. 
                        Don’t let your mind wander. Focus on me.

           She tries her best -

           He ties off the cord -

           They are firmly secured together now -

           Face to face -

                                 JOSH
                        We’re going to take three long, deep 
                        breaths. Okay?

           She nods, still groggy -

                                 JOSH
                        What did I say?

                                 HANNAH
                        Three long deep breaths...

                                 JOSH
                        Good. On the third, we go. I’ll lead you 
                        out. You just hold that breath until we 
                        get to the bag. Then what?

                                 HANNAH
                        Exhale slowly until the surface...

                                 JOSH
                        See? Easy...

           She nods dreamily -

                                 JOSH
                        It’s time to go. One...

           Josh and Hannah take a long, deep breath -

           Hold it -

           Then let it out -
                                 JOSH
                        Two...

           Long, deep breath -

           Hold it -

           Then let it out -

                                 JOSH
                        And three...

           Long, deep breath -

           Hold it -

           And they duck under the water -

           Swim towards the hatch -

           SUPPLY LANDER

           Josh and Hannah pull themselves out through the hatch -

           It's a tight fit, but they squeeze their way -

           Just as the hatch rotates on to the rock wall -

           They made it with no time to spare -

           They follow the same path Josh took earlier -

           Pulling themselves up the rock wall -

           Launching off from a squat -

           Using the cord to pull themselves up towards the overhang -

           Grabbing hold of rocks on the ledge -

           Josh loops the loose trailing cord around their waists -

           They look at each other -

           Nod -

           Josh reaches up with his knife -

           Cuts the tether with one brutal swipe -

           The buoyancy of the Lift Bag jerks them into motion -

           And they begin their rapid ascent through -

           THE OCEAN

           The Lift Bag shoots up like a rocket -
           Bubbles flow out the bottom as the air inside expands -

           The braided cord taut like piano wire -

           Josh and Hannah, illuminated by the LED Wands -

           An arm around each other’s waist -

           Their other arms gripping the cords -

           Eyes scrunched closed in concentration -

           Exhaling a tiny stream of bubbles through pursed lips -

           Slow -

           Steady -

           Release -

           Bubbles escaping the loose hems of their suits -

           Rising -

           Fast -

           A glimpse of surface light now -

           Still far above -

           But brightening with each passing second -

           The Lift Bag trailing bubbles -

           Josh and Hannah exhaling bubbles -

           The suits releasing bubbles -

           So fast, they‘re rising faster than the bubbles -

           Which hang around their feet like a cloud -

           Rising with them -

           They look like a blue firework shooting through the sky -

           Rising -

           Fast -

           Their grips tightening on the cords -

           Getting brighter still -

           Hannah peeks out through scrunched eyes -

           Josh exhaling in spurts -
           Then stops -

           He opens his eyes and looks at her -

           Shaking his head -

           Looks up towards the surface -

           She shakes his shoulder -

           He looks at her -

           She’s still exhaling, giving him the look -

           You hold the fuck on or else -

           Josh stares at her -

           Concentrating -

           The Lift Bag wrenching them violently upwards -

           They are now a column of bubbles heading to the surface -

           Josh struggling to keep his mouth closed -

           Hannah grips his arm -

           She exhales the last of her breath -

           They look up -

           Almost there -

           Rising -

           Bursting through a school of SCATTERING FISH -

           Staring at each other -

           Eyes open -

           Mouths closed -

           No breath -

           A serene and peaceful moment -

           Lingering -

           Almost there, but as close to death as they’ve been yet -

           Then -

           S P L O O O O S H -

           The Lift Bag breaks the -
           SURFACE

           - and shoots up high out of the water momentarily -

           Followed quickly by Josh and Hannah -

           They throw their heads back and gasp for air -

           It’s almost horrendous in its desperation -

           Gulping deep breaths -

           Josh grabs the Lift Bag and holds the end closed -

           Pulls it up to their chests -

           Hannah places her hand above his on the bag -

           Floating -

           Holding each other -

           That’s when they notice they’re both crying -

           And they let it happen -

           They grip the Lift Bag and hug -

           Heads on each other’s shoulder -

           Still crying, Hannah blurts out -

                                 HANNAH
                        I love you...

           Josh’s tears turn to laughter -

           He pulls back and looks at her -

                                 JOSH
                        That's just the narcosis talking. But 
                        don't think for a minute that I won't 
                        remind you of that a thousand -

           She grabs his head and kisses him passionately -

           He lets it happen -

           He shouldn’t, but this has been a hell of a day -

           Then they have to stop for deep breaths -

                                 JOSH
                        Okay, okay. Cool off, lady...

           She laughs -
                                 JOSH
                        Give it thirty minutes and if you still 
                        feel like aggressively probing my mouth, 
                        I'll know I'm not taking advantage...

           They laugh together, eyes still watering -

           Staring for a beat -

           It’s all rushing in at once -

                                 HANNAH
                        We did it...

           Josh nods -

                                 HANNAH
                        We did it.

           He nods again, eyes tearing up more -

                                 JOSH
                        We did it.

           They did it -

           But it gets better -

           H O O O O O O O O N K -

           They both turns their heads -

           The IORV PICCARD-WALSH about a hundred feet away -

           Heading straight towards them -

           They smile -

           And then hug -

           Heads on each other’s shoulder -

           They close their eyes -

           Listening to each other’s breathing -

           Just floating.

                                          THE END
