          The following is inspired by true events...
          But if you're a Cubs fan, you don't need me to tell you that...
           FADE IN ON:

           CHICAGO’S WRIGLEY FIELD

           We’re flying high over “The Friendly Confines.” Past the many 
           landmarks of one of baseball’s most treasured ballparks.

           --The iconic IVY-COVERED OUTFIELD WALLS. 

           --The CENTER FIELD BLEACHERS and HAND OPERATED SCOREBOARD. 

           --The ADDISON STREET L TRAIN rumbling in the distance.

           --Two WORLD SERIES FLAGS flying proudly -- 1907 and 1908.

           --And the RED NEON STADIUM MARQUEE. Lit up and reading:

                                  WRIGLEY FIELD
                                         HOME OF
                                    CHICAGO CUBS

           And underneath it, a DIGITAL CRAWL for tonight’s game...

                                   CUBS VS MARLINS
                                      GAME 6 NLCS

                                 OCTOBER 12, 2003  7:15PM

           Game time is approaching, as the OUTFIELD LIGHTS burst to 
           life, and we...

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. LITTLE LEAGUE BASEBALL FIELD - SUNSET

           No outfield lights to be found out here. 

           Just the last rays of sunlight falling on a team of LITTLE 
           LEAGUERS (The Renegades) shagging fly balls off the bat of...

           STEVE BARTMAN. 

           A wiry 26-year-old frame and a bespectacled face you can’t 
           imagine getting angry. If you rear-ended Steve in traffic, 
           he’d turn around and apologize to you.

                                 STEVE
                        Alright, lemme see ten pop flies 
                        without one hitting the grass and 
                        we’re outta here.
           Steve peppers the field with fly balls to every position, 
           sending his Little Leaguers scampering after each one, until--

                                 RON (O.S.)
                        Stevie!

           Steve turns to the quaint TWO-STORY HOUSE directly adjacent 
           to the old ball field, where his father, RON BARTMAN, late 
           60s, labors onto the front porch.

                                 RON
                        Hour forty-five ‘til first pitch, 
                        son. Better get a move on!

                                 STEVE
                        On my way, Dad!
                             (back to the Little 
                              Leaguers)
                        Let’s go, five more. Come on.

           OUTFIELD GRASS

           Steve walks off the field, carrying a bag of bats and a 
           bucket of balls, alongside his young TEAM.

                                 SKINNY KID
                        Hey, Coach B -- You think you’re 
                        gonna be on TV tonight?

                                 STEVE
                        I mean, they’re pretty good seats. 
                        Right on the left field foul line. 
                        You never know.

                                 TALLEST KID ON THE TEAM
                        Yo, Coach B, when the Cubs make it 
                        to the World Series, you’re gonna 
                        take us all with you, right?

                                 STEVE
                        If the Cubs make it to the World 
                        Series, and if you didn’t just jinx 
                        it for us -- Then we’ll talk.

                                 TALLEST KID ON THE TEAM
                        Man, we’re going. Quit lying, we’re 
                        going.

           Steve turns to the rest of the team.
                                 STEVE
                        First Renegade to get Stackhouse to 
                        shush up and stop jinxing the Cubs 
                        is coming with me to the World 
                        Series -- If we make it tonight.

           The kids let out a RALLY CRY and DOG PILE onto their mouthy 
           teammate -- Rolling on the grass, laughing their asses off.

           Steve joins in and “referees” the wrestling match, as the sun 
           slowly sets over Lincolnshire, Illinois.

           INT. STEVE’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           A shrine to the Chicago Cubs and the game of baseball.

           Cubs PENNANTS from every era line the walls. Old TICKET STUBS 
           framed behind glass. AUTOGRAPHED BASEBALLS and JERSEYS from 
           countless Chicago greats -- Santo, Banks, Sandberg, Sosa...

           And FRAMED PHOTOS all over chronicling Steve’s life as a 
           baseball fanatic:

           A young boy sitting with Ron behind home plate at Wrigley... 

           Smiling at Cubs spring training in Arizona with his MOTHER... 

           Swinging away at age 12 in his old Renegades uniform...

                                 RON (O.S.)
                        Stevie! Your friends are here!

                                 STEVE
                        Be right down!

           Steve opens a desk drawer and pulls out an old WALKMAN.

           He places the headphones over his ears. Puts FRESH BATTERIES 
           inside. Flips on the AM radio and tunes it to...

                                 CUBS RADIO ANNOUNCER (OVER WALKMAN)
                        ...And if you’re lucky enough to be 
                        headed to the ballpark tonight, 
                        you’re looking at a chance to 
                        witness baseball history. One more 
                        win gives the Cubs a chance to take 
                        home their first World Series title 
                        since 1908 -- Sure, it’s only been 
                        95 years, but it’s felt a heck of a 
                        lot longer to me...

           Steve flips off the Walkman and heads downstairs. Ready to go.
           INT. BARTMAN LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           CLOSE on Ron Bartman’s face -- Trying to hold back a smile as 
           he recites a story he’s told a thousand times...

                                 RON
                        And Steve’s mother, rest her soul, 
                        she’s seven months pregnant at the 
                        time. And for a split-second, all I 
                        can hear is my wife SCREAM. Now I 
                        don’t know how long you two have 
                        been together -- But if it’s any 
                        longer than ten seconds, you know 
                        that’s a sound you never want to 
                        hear. So I do the only thing I can: 
                        I pull Kathy close to me with one 
                        arm, and I reach up towards the 
                        clear blue sky with the other -- 
                        And when I finally open my eyes...
                             (beat)
                        I’ve got this waiting for me in my 
                        hand.

           PULL BACK to reveal resting in Ron’s hand: A BASEBALL.

           Decades old, dingy beige, and scuffed to shit. 

           But the way Ron holds it, you can tell this is the man’s most 
           prized possession.

                                 RON
                        Go ‘head, hold it.

           Ron hands the ball over to MARK AINSLEY and LORI YATES.

           Both mid 20s, newly dating, and trying to feign a level of 
           interest in this ugly foul ball that matches Ron’s.

                                 MARK
                        That’s a heck of a story, Mr. 
                        Bartman. You tell it even better 
                        than Steve does.

                                 LORI
                        Wow. You must really love baseball. 
                        I feel so bad, I feel like you 
                        should be taking my ticket tonight.

           Ron LIMPS over to his favorite recliner. Clearly struggling 
           to get around, but too proud to ask for help.

                                 RON
                        No, no -- I’ve been to more than any 
                        man’s fair share of Cubs games...
           Steve comes bounding down the stairs and hurries to help 
           lower his father into his chair.

                                 STEVE
                        Dad, wait-- Here...

                                 RON
                        I got it, I got it.

           Ron finally eases himself into the recliner, smiling through 
           the pain.

                                 RON
                        But I’ll tell you one thing: If the 
                        Cubbies win tonight -- You’ll see 
                        me at Wrigley for every goddamn 
                        inning of that World Series.

           Steve gets his father a blanket and the remote, as Mark grabs 
           Steve from behind -- Lifting him up in an excited BEAR HUG.

                                 MARK
                        Stevie! Ready to make history 
                        tonight? Lookin’ sharp, by the way.

           Mark sets Steve down, giving everyone a good look at his 
           gameday attire:

           Old Renegades sweatshirt, green turtleneck, Cubs hat, Walkman.

                                 STEVE
                             (no clue he’s being teased)
                        Thanks, man. You too.

                                 LORI
                        Wait. What’s the Walkman for?

                                 MARK
                        So he can listen to the game.

                                 LORI
                        You mean you’re gonna listen to the 
                        game on the radio... while you’re 
                        at the game?

           Ron MUTES the TV, reaches for an OLD STEREO SYSTEM -- And 
           turns on the CUBS AM RADIO STATION.

                                 RON
                        That’s how you know he’s a real 
                        fan...

           Mark and Lori wave goodbye and hand Ron’s beloved foul ball 
           to Steve.
                                 RON
                        Be safe tonight, pal. I love you.

                                 STEVE
                        Love you too. Oh, and Dad... 

           Steve tosses the baseball to his father -- Who catches it 
           with one hand like an old pro.

                                 STEVE
                        Look for me on TV.

           Ron Bartman gives his son a proud smile as Steve hustles out 
           the door.

           INT. MARK’S CAR - NIGHT

           Mark drives through the streets of Chicago, approaching an 
           upcoming L TRAIN STATION.

           Lori sits shotgun, listening to Steve hold court in the back.

                                 STEVE
                        ...So now it’s 1945, the last time 
                        the Cubs even appeared in a World 
                        Series -- And a tavern owner named 
                        Billy Sianis wants to bring his pet 
                        goat into Wrigley, but the goat 
                        smells so bad that they’re both 
                        kicked out of the stadium. So then 
                        Sianis declares: “Them Cubs, they 
                        ain’t gonna win no more!” and 
                        cursed the team never to make 
                        another World Series ever again.
                             (beat)
                        Hence... “The Curse of the Billy 
                        Goat.”

           Lori turns to Mark -- Ready for him to admit this is bullshit.

                                 LORI
                        Come on... Seriously?

                                 MARK
                        No, it’s true. See, being a Cubs 
                        fan is no joke. There’s black 
                        magic, dark forces...

           Mark glances up at Steve in the rear-view.

                                 MARK
                        Hey, Steve. You alright, buddy?
           Steve breathes a little heavier -- Starting to sweat now.

                                 STEVE
                             (wiping his forehead)
                        Yeah. Yeah, sorry, I’m... I’m just 
                        excited.

           Countless CUBS FANS fill the streets around them. Decked out 
           in jerseys and hats, ready for action.

           Up ahead, you can just barely make out the distant glow of 
           WRIGLEY FIELD -- Lighting up the north side of the city.

                                 LORI
                        Are you sure? ‘Cause we can pull 
                        over if you need to--

                                 MARK
                        --He’s just nervous. He gets like 
                        this before all the big games.
                             (calling back to Steve)
                        Hey Steve, get yourself some fresh 
                        air, ok? We need you at full 
                        strength tonight.

           Mark rolls down the window -- Letting in a cool breeze and 
           the sounds of CHEERING and SINGING from the nearby FANS.

           Steve looks out at them, breathing easier now. 

           Calmed by the rising euphoria of the herd of Cubs fans 
           growing BIGGER and LOUDER by the second. 

                                 MARK
                        Better?

           Steve nods. Feeling right at home again.

                                 STEVE
                        Yeah. Much better.
                             (deep breath)
                        This is gonna be awesome.

           EXT. WRIGLEY FIELD - NIGHT

           Mecca for any Chicago Cubs fan.

           And it’s never looked more beautiful than tonight. 

           FANS file through the gates, BUZZING with excitement--

           Ready for a celebration.
           Steve approaches alongside Mark and Lori, trying to soak up 
           every moment, as a CRAZED FAN comes SCREAMING in his face--

                                 CRAZED CUBS FAN
                        NINETY-FIVE YEARS, MAN! NINETY-FIVE 
                        FUCKING YEARS!!
                             (jumping up and down)
                        THIS IS THE YEAR! THIS IS THE 
                        NIGHT!!! WOOOOO!!!

           The Crazed Fan runs away and SPRINTS into the stadium.

           Steve smiles big and makes a tiny fist-pump as he follows the 
           herd inside.

           INT. WRIGLEY FIELD - LEFT FIELD SEATS - NIGHT

           Aisle 4. Row 8. Seat 113.

           Steve arrives at his seat, right at the edge of the wall in 
           shallow left field.

           He’s close enough to have a conversation with LEFT FIELDER, 
           MOISES ALOU, #18, warming up on the grass.

                                 STEVE
                        HERE WE GO, MOISES!!
                             (turning to Mark and Lori)
                        Can you guys believe this view??

           Mark and Lori slide in beside Steve -- Feeling the rush of 
           being so close to the action. 

                                 MARK
                        Holy shit, Steve -- These are the 
                        best seats you’ve ever gotten us. 
                        Nice work, dude.

                                 LORI
                        Yeah, thank you so much for getting 
                        these tickets. This is amazing.

                                 STEVE
                        No problem. Just glad you guys 
                        could make it so I didn’t have to 
                        be here all alone. My Dad hasn’t 
                        made it back to Wrigley since his 
                        surgery -- But he said he’d disown 
                        me if I ever missed a game like 
                        this...

           Mark and Lori are too busy taking in the sights and sounds to 
           hear him. Steve leans in a little closer.
                                 STEVE
                        Hey-- You guys need anything? Hot 
                        dogs, sodas, peanuts?

           Still no response. Mark and Lori are in their own world now.

           But Steve takes no offense. He just scans the outfield stands 
           around him, suddenly locking in on--

           A FATHER AND SON.

           A young Dad and the little boy who idolizes him. Wearing 
           matching Cubs hats and jerseys. Sharing a FUNNEL CAKE and a 
           father/son moment that they’ll remember their whole lives.

           Steve stares longingly at the two of them, feeling himself 
           transported back to a familiar place, until--

                                 STEVE
                        I got it.
                             (back to Mark and Lori)
                        Funnel cakes.

           INT. WRIGLEY FIELD - CONCESSIONS STAND - NIGHT

           Steve holds three plates of perfect funnel cakes, doused in 
           powdered sugar, and heads back to the seats with his WALKMAN 
           HEADPHONES on.

           The CUBS RADIO BROADCAST plays in his ears...

                                 CUBS RADIO ANNOUNCER (OVER WALKMAN)
                        ...You can physically feel the 
                        electricity in the Wrigley seats 
                        tonight. Forty-one thousand people -- 
                        Waiting for this moment their 
                        entire lives. To share something 
                        magical with each other...

           INT. BARTMAN LIVING ROOM - SAME

           Ron’s eyes are glued to the TV, clutching his foul ball for 
           good luck, as the radio broadcast plays through the stereo... 

                                 CUBS RADIO ANNOUNCER (OVER STEREO)
                        ...Because win or lose, on a night 
                        like tonight -- It feels a lot less 
                        like a stadium full of baseball 
                        fans. And more like... A family.

           Ron cracks a smile and grips his lucky baseball a little 
           tighter, as we get ready to--
                                 HOME PLATE UMPIRE (PRE-LAP)
                        PLAY BALL!

           EXT. WRIGLEY FIELD - HOME PLATE - NIGHT

           And Cubs PITCHER, MARK PRIOR, #22, fires STRIKE ONE to 
           FLORIDA MARLINS leadoff batter, JUAN PIERRE.

           Steve claps loudly while chewing a mouthful of funnel cake.

                                 STEVE
                        Atta boy, Mark! All day, baby, ALL 
                        DAY!

           He turns to Mark and Lori -- Unknowingly SHOUTING at them 
           because of the Walkman headphones over his ears.

                                 STEVE
                        PRIOR’S STUFF IS UNBELIEVABLE! HE’D 
                        BE THE CLEAR FAVORITE TO WIN THE CY 
                        YOUNG AWARD IF HE DIDN’T MISS THREE 
                        STARTS IN JULY DUE TO INJURY.

                                 MARK
                             (gesturing to Steve’s 
                              headphones)
                        You don’t have to shout, Steve -- 
                        We’re right here.

                                 STEVE
                             (still can’t hear them)
                        SORRY, WHAT?

           The crowd CHEERS as Pierre pops out to SHORTSTOP, ALEX 
           GONZALEZ, #8, and we move to the--

           BOTTOM OF THE FIRST INNING

           Where the Cubs have a MAN ON SECOND BASE and slugger SAMMY 
           SOSA, #21, at the plate.

                                 STEVE
                        C’mon, Sammy -- C’mon, Sammy -- 
                        C’mon--

           CRACK! Sosa rips a DOUBLE to right field -- Giving the Cubs 
           their first run of the game.

                                 STEVE
                        YES! YES-YES-YES-YES-YES!!

           Steve HIGH-FIVES Mark, Lori, and every STRANGER within reach.
           INT. BARTMAN LIVING ROOM - SAME

           Ron claps his hands and stomps his feet, watching the action 
           on TV.

                                 CUBS RADIO ANNOUNCER (OVER STEREO)
                        ...Kenny Lofton wheels around to 
                        score from second and the Cubs draw 
                        first blood! And I can’t tell you 
                        the last time I heard Wrigley Field 
                        this darn loud!

           EXT. WRIGLEY FIELD - LEFT FIELD SEATS - NIGHT

           The ROAR in the stadium is deafening as the HAND OPERATED 
           SCOREBOARD changes to read:

                               FLORIDA 0   CUBS 1

           Mark taps Steve on the shoulder and pulls his headphones down.

                                 MARK
                        Hey Steve -- Show Lori that trick 
                        you can do. The win probability 
                        thing.

                                 STEVE
                        Oh, I don’t know, it’s the first 
                        inning, I don’t wanna jinx any--

                                 LORI
                        --No, come on, what is it?

           Steve hesitates, then relents. He doesn’t want to be rude.

                                 STEVE
                        Ok, well, it’s nothing really. It’s 
                        just a method of using situational 
                        statistics to come up with a rough 
                        estimate of a team’s chances of 
                        winning based on the current game 
                        conditions.

           SMACK! Next batter, the left fielder we saw earlier, MOISES 
           ALOU, beats out an INFIELD SINGLE for another hit.

           The crowd’s loving it. Nearby FANS are leaning over Steve’s 
           shoulder -- Listening in on his statistical breakdown.

                                 LORI
                        So what’re the chances we’re gonna 
                        win now??
                                 STEVE
                        Uh, well, bottom of the first, up 
                        one-nothing, two men on, one out.
                             (doing the math in his 
                              head)
                        I’d say right now, it’s about a 68 
                        percent chance that we win.

           The cluster of nearby fans BUZZES at Steve’s prediction. 

           Already feeling the World Series within their grasp.

                                 MARK
                        What’d I tell you? Can you believe 
                        this guy? He’s got a fuckin’ 
                        computer in his head. That’s why we 
                        call him “The Terminator” at work, 
                        right Steve?

           Steve just smiles bashfully and puts his headphones back on, 
           enjoying the back pats from Mark and the rest of the crowd.

           TOP OF THE FOURTH 

           The Marlins are at the plate with the score still 1-0.

           Mark Prior is dealing now -- Tearing through batters.

           Lazy POP FLY to center -- STRIKEOUT swinging -- Another 
           STRIKEOUT swinging.

           Steve high-fives Mark and exhales hard. 

           Five more innings to go.

           BOTTOM OF THE SIXTH

           Almost two-thirds of the game have gone by and the Cubs have 
           TWO OUTS and Sammy Sosa standing on THIRD BASE...

           BARTMAN LIVING ROOM

           Ron leans in, nails digging into the hide of his foul ball, 
           watching ERIC KARROS, #32, stand at the plate--

                                 RON
                        C’mon, Eric -- C’mon, Eric--

                        ...The pitch is in and-- It gets 
                        away from Rodriguez! 
                                 (MORE)

                        The ball gets by Pudge Rodriguez 
                        and Sosa comes in to score! Giving 
                        the Cubs a two-zero lead here in 
                        the sixth!

           Ron lets out a WILD HOLLER, as we go back to--

           WRIGLEY FIELD - LEFT FIELD SEATS

           Where Steve is LOSING HIS MIND! Mark, Lori, and the other 
           nearby fans all turn to him, waiting for...

                                 STEVE
                        Uh... 80 percent. No-- 83 percent!

           More CHEERS from Steve’s new friends as the scoreboard reads:

                               FLORIDA 0   CUBS 2

           BOTTOM OF THE SEVENTH

           CRACK! Cubs SECOND BASEMAN, MARK GRUDZIELANEK, #11, smacks a 
           hard single to center field--

           --Bringing PAUL BAKO, #9, around to SCORE!

           Steve and the others are GOING NUTS. Full on HUGGING 
           strangers now -- Feeling like this is it.

           This is destiny.

                               FLORIDA 0   CUBS 3

           TOP OF THE EIGHTH

           Mark Prior is still on the mound for the Cubs -- Over 100 
           pitches in but still going strong.

           Steve holds his breath, listening to his Walkman, as...

                                 CUBS RADIO ANNOUNCER (OVER WALKMAN)
                        ...And the pitch to Mordecai is 
                        popped up, lazy fly to Alou in 
                        left, he snags it. And that’s one 
                        down in the eighth, bringing the 
                        Cubs five outs away from the World 
                        Series -- Five outs away from our 
                        wildest dreams coming true...
           Steve pulls down his headphones, already knowing the 
           surrounding section is waiting for him to chime in.

                                 STEVE
                        94 percent.

           Nobody speaks. They just nod and watch, as--

           WHACK! Juan Pierre slashes a DOUBLE down the left field line.

           Steve quickly puts his headphones back on. He doesn’t want to 
           talk, feeling his temperature slowly rise once again.

                                 MARK
                             (hand on Steve’s shoulder)
                        Hey. It’s alright, man. We got 
                        this. Just... Try to have fun.

           Steve forces a smile and turns back to the action.

           Marlins SECOND BASEMAN, LUIS CASTILLO, #1, is at the plate.

                                 CUBS RADIO ANNOUNCER (OVER WALKMAN)
                        ...Prior deals and-- Strike one. 
                        Right down Broadway.

           BARTMAN LIVING ROOM

           Ron watches, holding his breath for the next pitch--

                                 CUBS RADIO ANNOUNCER (OVER STEREO)
                        ...And that’s strike two. Right on 
                        the outside corner.

           WRIGLEY FIELD - LEFT FIELD SEATS

           Steve rocks back and forth, desperately hoping this next 
           pitch is Castillo’s last, as--

           CRACK! The ball jumps off Castillo’s bat -- Floating sky-high 
           towards FOUL TERRITORY on the left field side--

                                 NEARBY FANS
                        Oh shit! It’s coming this way! 
                        Heads up!!

           And suddenly -- TIME SLOWS. 

           The stadium goes SILENT.

           Steve tracks the ball in flight -- Falling straight to him.
           BARTMAN LIVING ROOM

           At the same time, Ron watches Moises Alou closing in on the 
           left field wall -- Ready to JUMP INTO THE STANDS for the ball.

                                 CUBS RADIO ANNOUNCER (OVER STEREO)
                        ...Fly ball to left, heading 
                        towards the foul line, Alou’s 
                        giving chase, does he have room?...

           WRIGLEY FIELD - LEFT FIELD SEATS

           But Steve doesn’t see Alou.

           No one does, as every pair of hands in Aisle 4 REACHES UP, 
           desperate to bring home this priceless memory--

           Steve stands and REACHES too -- Over the OUTSTRETCHED GLOVE of 
           Moises Alou, who LEAPS above the left field wall, just as--

           THE BALL BOUNCES OFF STEVE’S HANDS.

           BARTMAN LIVING ROOM

           Ron winces as the ball bounces away from Alou’s grasp.

                        ...Alou leaps and cannot make the 
                        play -- And Moises is livid with a 
                        fan! He’s screaming at a fan in the 
                        stands right now!

           The TV cameras hold on Alou, GOING BALLISTIC on the field--

           RANTING, SCREAMING, and POINTING INTO THE STANDS.

           WRIGLEY FIELD - LEFT FIELD SEATS

           And now time UNFREEZES for Steve Bartman, as he sees the foul 
           ball roll across the floor of the left field seats, and...

           The play-by-play of the moment rings out in Steve’s ears:

                                 CUBS RADIO ANNOUNCER (OVER WALKMAN)
                        ...Because he knows if that fan 
                        just gets his hand out of the way, 
                        Moises makes the catch! That ball 
                        was headed right into his glove, 
                        but the fan knocked it away!...
           Steve and the rest of Aisle 4 are too confused to realize 
           exactly what’s happened yet-- 

           --Until Steve looks out onto the field and sees:

           MOISES ALOU SCREAMING AT HIM.

                                 MOISES ALOU
                        FUCK! CHINGATE! FUCK! FUCK!

           There’s no mistaking it now. 

           Alou is pointing at Steve, looking him dead in the eyes. 

           Telling the world... It was HIM.

                                 CUBS RADIO ANNOUNCER (OVER WALKMAN)
                        ...And boy, you just have to hope a 
                        play like that doesn’t come back to 
                        bite the Cubs down the line...

           Steve shrinks back into his seat, suddenly numb, as CUBS 
           PLAYERS and COACHES all point towards him--

           The stadium ERUPTS IN BOOS, raining down on Steve--

           BARTMAN LIVING ROOM

           Ron watches the slow-motion REPLAY on TV. 

           In panic and disbelief at the sight of his son knocking the 
           ball from Alou’s grasp.

                                 RON
                        Oh my God...

           WRIGLEY FIELD - LEFT FIELD SEATS

           The next throw from Prior is a WILD PITCH -- Sending Pierre 
           to THIRD BASE and Castillo to FIRST.

           The BOOS get LOUDER now.

           Steve’s in a state of shock -- All he can do is turn to Mark 
           and Lori and ask:

                                 STEVE
                        Did I... Do you think I did 
                        anything wrong?
                                 MARK
                        No, no way, man. I would’ve done 
                        the same thing. We all would.

           Steve nods. Turns up the volume on his Walkman to drown out 
           the BOOS.

           But he still hears them. 

           And we realize that for the rest of our time in this stadium 
           with him...

           We’re in a fucking horror movie.

           BARTMAN LIVING ROOM

           Ron is on his feet now, in pain, SHOUTING at the TV as the 
           cruel REPLAYS of his son keep coming--

           One after another after another...

                                 RON
                        No! Get him off the screen! You 
                        sons of bitches! Leave him alone!

           The camera finally cuts away from Steve just in time for--

           CRACK! IVAN RODRIGUEZ, #7, RIPS a single into left.

                                 RON
                        GODDAMMIT!

           WRIGLEY FIELD - LEFT FIELD SEATS

           Pierre scores from third and the scoreboard changes to:

                               FLORIDA 1   CUBS 3

           Steve just stares straight ahead. On an island in a stadium 
           full of 40,000 people.

                                 CUBS RADIO ANNOUNCER (OVER WALKMAN)
                        ...You can feel the momentum 
                        shifting in the stadium, and boy is 
                        this crowd letting that poor fan in 
                        left know how they feel about that 
                        foul ball...
                             (beat)
                        Actually, they’re serenading him 
                        with a chant that I can’t repeat on 
                        the air without losing my job...
           Steve pushes back his headphones -- Getting his first clear 
           sound of the stadium crowd CHANTING...

                                 STADIUM CROWD
                        ASSHOLE!... ASSHOLE!... ASSHOLE!...

           Steve puts his headphones back on -- Praying for a swift end 
           to this personal hell.

           It’s not coming.

           Next batter, MIGUEL CABRERA, #20, hits an easy GROUNDER to 
           Cubs SHORTSTOP ALEX GONZALEZ -- A sure DOUBLE-PLAY BALL...

           And Gonzalez drops it. Everybody’s safe on the ERROR.

           Bases loaded now.

           Next pitch, DERREK LEE, #25, rips a DOUBLE to left field.

           Two runs score. Tie game.

                               FLORIDA 3   CUBS 3

           Steve sits perfectly still. The BOOS are deafening now.

                                 NEARBY FANS (O.S.)
                        Who was it?! Who the fuck touched 
                        that fucking ball?!

           FANS standing mere feet away from Steve POINT HIM OUT -- More 
           than happy to give him up to the growing MOB.

           Steve turns to Mark and Lori -- They don’t even look at him. 

                                 ANOTHER FAN (O.S.)
                        Hey, what’s the win probability 
                        now, jerkoff?! FUCK YOU!

           And what happens next is all a blur, for Steve, his father, 
           and every Cubs fan, as the onslaught continues:

           --A SACRIFICE FLY to right...

                               FLORIDA 4   CUBS 3

           --A BASES LOADED DOUBLE off the ivy-covered wall...

                               FLORIDA 7   CUBS 3

           --A line-drive SINGLE to right field...
                               FLORIDA 8   CUBS 3

           And now Steve can hear the chants BOOMING from every seat in 
           the stadium...

           All the way to the ROWDY CROWD outside on SHEFFIELD AVENUE...

                                 STADIUM CROWD
                        ASSHOLE!!...  ASSHOLE!!... 
                        ASSHOLE!!!...  ASSHOLE!!!

           Suddenly, DEBRIS starts raining down on Steve’s head.

           Bottles... Trash... Anything they can get their hands on...

           SECURITY GUARDS try to keep the crowd at bay, to little avail.

                                 MARK
                        Steve, this is really fucked up, I 
                        think we need to get outta here.

                                 LORI
                        Me too, what if someone tries to--

                                 PISS-DRUNK FAN (O.S.)
                        --Where is he? Where’s the asshole?!

           A PISS-DRUNK FAN with a 6’3” frame and nothing to lose SHOVES 
           his way into Aisle 4, searching for Steve.

           Steve turns to his aggressor, trying to explain--

                                 STEVE
                        Hey, listen-- I didn’t--

           The Piss-Drunk Fan THROWS A FULL BEER right in Steve’s face.

                                 PISS-DRUNK FAN
                        Enjoy the game, you fuckin’ faggot!

           BARTMAN LIVING ROOM

           Ron sits nearly comatose in front of the TV -- Watching his 
           son wipe the beer off his face, showing no emotion.

           Not a word comes out of Ron’s mouth. 

           He just gets up, limps to the fireplace... And places his 
           foul ball on a display stand atop the mantel.

           His heart is broken.
           WRIGLEY FIELD - LEFT FIELD SEATS

           Finally, a team of SECURITY GUARDS escorts Steve, Mark, and 
           Lori out of the stands.

           The CHORUS OF BOOS is overwhelming as they walk up the stairs--

                                 FURIOUS FANS
                        We’re gonna kill you, 
                        motherfucker!/You’re fucking dead!!

           Steve marches through a TUNNEL on the way into the CONCOURSE-- 

           Fans up above throw TRASH, BEER, even SPIT at him as he goes.

           Steve never reacts. He never looks up. He just takes it.

           STADIUM CONCOURSE

           And here it gets even worse.

           DRUNK FANS are waiting for Steve, crowding around his flimsy 
           security escort--

           PUSHING -- SHOVING -- TAKING WILD SWINGS AT HIM.

                                 MORE FANS
                        You’re gonna die tonight!/I’ll put 
                        a 12 gauge in your mouth and PULL 
                        THE TRIGGER!!

           And now the NEWS MEDIA has found Steve. 

           CAMERAS dive in from every angle, getting close on his face, 
           demanding to know his name...

           Steve covers his face with his sweatshirt and follows the 
           Security Guards up a STADIUM RAMP, away from the mob-- 

           They finally find refuge outside a ROOM marked “DISPATCH.”

                                 SECURITY GUARD
                        In here, get in here, quick!

           Steve looks back at Mark and Lori.

                                 STEVE
                        Wait-- My friends. My friends are 
                        coming too.

           Mark and Lori hang back as security pushes Steve in the room.
                                 MARK
                        Steve, just go-- We’ll wait for

                        --What?

                                 MARK
                        We’ll wait for you, ok? Just go 
                        inside and we’ll--

           SLAM! The door shuts in Steve’s face, cutting him off from 
           Mark and Lori, sealing him inside the--

           DISPATCH ROOM

           Where Steve finds himself alone, save for a Wrigley Security 
           Guard named AMANDA, mid 30s, trying to keep it together.

                                 AMANDA
                        Jesus Christ. Are... Are you ok?

                                 STEVE
                        Yeah. I’m... Yes.

           Steve scans the room -- Full of LIVE FEED MONITORS showing 
           every angle of the stadium and game broadcast.

           REPLAYS of Steve’s foul ball blunder play over and over.

                                 AMANDA
                        You’re sure? No injuries? You’re 
                        not bleeding?

                                 STEVE
                        Why would I be bleeding?

                                 AMANDA
                        Sir, people were trying to attack 
                        you. Throwing objects, they--

                                 STEVE
                        --Do you have a phone?

           Amanda nods and pulls a cell phone from her hip.

                                 STEVE
                        Thank you.

           Steve dials and holds Amanda’s phone to his ear. 

           It STICKS against his beer-spattered skin.
           He wipes the phone down with his shirt as it rings.

                                 STEVE
                        I’m sorry... And maybe a towel?

           Steve takes a seat and stares transfixed at the many LIVE 
           REPLAYS still running on the monitors in front of him.

           Other TVs are tuned to ESPN and the LOCAL NEWS-- 

           All deep-diving into coverage of Steve’s foul ball fiasco.

                        someone to make sure they’re--

                                 AMANDA
                        --They left. 

                                 STEVE
                        What?

                                 AMANDA
                        I radioed in to check on them while 
                        you were on the phone. I know you 
                        wanted them here with you, but they 
                        had already...
                             (beat)
                        I’m sorry.

           Steve blinks to the floor. Hurt, but trying to hide it.
                                 STEVE
                        It’s ok, they... They’re not... I 
                        just work with one of them.

           They both stand silent for a long beat.

                                 STEVE
                        I’m sorry, what’s your name?

                                 AMANDA
                        Amanda.

                                 STEVE
                        Amanda, how long do I have to stay 
                        here?

                                 AMANDA
                        Until it’s safe for you. When the 
                        game ends and the crowd clears out. 

                                 STEVE
                        How long does that take?

                                 AMANDA
                        Little less than an hour usually. 
                        But tonight...

           Amanda looks at one of the SECURITY MONITORS-- 

           Showing a FURIOUS CROWD lined up outside Addison Avenue.

                                 AMANDA
                        They’re already waiting for you.

           Steve nods. He watches another REPLAY on the ESPN feed. 

           Finally letting what happened tonight sink in.

                                 STEVE
                        Do you think I did anything wrong?

                                 AMANDA
                        No. No, no, no. You did what... Any 
                        fan would do.
                             (beat)
                        Don’t worry. It wasn’t your fault 
                        they lost. Everyone’s gonna realize 
                        that soon.

           EXT. WRIGLEY FIELD - NIGHT

           It’s HOURS LATER now and there are still pockets of FANS 
           waiting outside the stadium, desperate for a shot at Steve.
           Amanda and three more SECURITY GUARDS surround Steve -- Now 
           DISGUISED in the same sky blue “Stadium Security” uniform 
           that the Wrigley crew wears.

                                 AMANDA
                        Follow me. First cab you find, flag 
                        it down and don’t let it get away.

           Steve nods and scans the streets for any sign of a cab.

           Finally, they find one. A Guard WHISTLES and WAVES.

           The cab whips around and approaches, but not before--

                                 WAITING FAN
                        Hey! That’s him! That’s the 
                        motherfucker right there!

           The Fan TAKES OFF RUNNING towards Steve -- Followed by a 
           small POSSE, all still out for blood.

                                 AMANDA
                        Shit, just go, just go!

           Steve SPRINTS as fast as he can -- Turning back to see Amanda 
           and the other Guards intercepting the night-stalking fans-- 

           But before Steve can get away, his WALKMAN flies off his hip -- 
           Falling to the pavement.

           One of the furious fans pounces on the Walkman and HURLS IT 
           as far as he can.

                                 FURIOUS FAN
                        If you ever come back to Chicago 
                        we’ll kill you! You fucking hear 
                        me, you fucking bitch!!

           Steve dives in the cab as his Walkman SMASHES to the ground.

           He looks back to see the Guards struggling to hold the fans 
           at bay. Amanda turns and locks eyes with him before he goes.

           Steve gives her a kind “thank you” wave as the cab departs...

           Disappearing into the Chicago night.

           EXT. BARTMAN HOUSE - NIGHT

           The cab pulls up to Steve’s house in the middle of the night.

           He gets out and approaches the front door, checking over both 
           shoulders -- Still on high alert.
           INT. BARTMAN LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Steve enters the house and double-locks the door. 

           He makes sure all the windows are locked too -- Then finds 
           his father asleep in his chair. He waited up all night.

           The soft hum of the CUBS RADIO STATION can still be heard.

           Steve walks over to the stereo, turns the radio off, and 
           looks down at his sleeping father.

                                 STEVE
                        I’m home, Dad.

           Ron just keeps sleeping. Steve pulls the blanket up over his 
           shoulders and walks upstairs in the dark.

                                                               FADE TO:

           INT. STEVE’S BEDROOM - MORNING

           The first rays of daylight crack through Steve’s window. His 
           crooked body lays splayed out across the bed.

           Obviously the worst night’s sleep of his life.

                                 RON (O.S.)
                        Steven. Wake up.

           Steve’s eyes crack open at the sound of his father’s voice.

                                 STEVE
                             (wiping his eyes)
                        Dad?... What’re you--?

                                 RON
                        --You’re gonna be late for work.

                                 STEVE
                        Work? Are you--? I can’t go to work 
                        after what happened last--

                                 RON
                        --I don’t give a damn about last 
                        night. Today’s another day, and 
                        nobody’s gonna make my boy a 
                        prisoner in his own home.

           Steve sits up. 

           Realizing his father’s stern tone is in support of his son, 
           not anger.
                                 RON
                        This’ll all be over by tomorrow. 
                        We’re gonna win Game Seven tonight, 
                        then we’re gonna win the Series, 
                        and anybody who tells you 
                        different...
                             (beat)
                        They’re obviously not a real fan.

           INT. STEVE’S CAR - DAY

           Steve drives his Honda Accord to work, still looking like 
           shit, but doing his best to hold himself together.

           He flips on the car stereo -- SPORTS TALK RADIO fills the air.

                                 SPORTS TALK HOST (OVER RADIO)
                        ...So you believe it was the fan 
                        who cost the Cubs the game last 
                        night? It was all his fault?

                                 SPORTS TALK CALLER (OVER RADIO)
                        You’re damn right I think it was 
                        his fault! He stole the ball right 
                        outta Alou’s hands, and if I had 
                        the little punk right here in front 
                        of me, I’d stomp his teeth in and--

           Steve stabs at the stereo button -- Turning it OFF and 
           speeding down the road as quickly as possible.

           INT. BUILDING HALLWAY - MORNING

           The elevator doors open and Steve moves down the hall, 
           towards the glass office doors of HEWITT ASSOCIATES.

           It finally starts to feel just like any other day -- Until 
           the glass doors open and out steps... 

           A POLICE OFFICER.

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        You the guy?

                                 STEVE
                        What guy?

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        Bartman.

                                 STEVE
                        Uh, yeah... I’m sorry, is something--
                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        --Follow me, please.

           Steve does as he’s told, stepping inside--

           HEWITT ASSOCIATES OFFICES

           Grey-walled, fluorescent-lit, cubicle-filled...

           But today, the room is also CRAWLING WITH COPS. 

           Taking notes, checking under desks, interviewing CO-WORKERS.

           I.T. GUYS are hunched over every computer workstation, 
           frazzled and irate.

           Steve’s BOSSES huddle in the corner with a POLICE SERGEANT, 
           presumably getting some pretty shitty news.

           Finally, Steve makes it to his WORK CUBE--

                                 STEVE
                        Oh-my-God.

           Which is, to put it mildly -- A DISASTER AREA.

           Papers everywhere -- Computer smashed to pieces -- Mugs and 
           photos shattered -- Cube walls kicked in...

           And every piece of Cubs memorabilia completely destroyed.

                                 STEVE
                        What-- What happened? Who--

                                 MARK (O.S.)
                        --Steve. Hey.

           Steve looks up to find Mark standing over the wreckage. 

           Looking like he’d rather be anywhere but here right now.

                                 STEVE
                        Mark, who did this? How did this--

                                 MARK
                        --Take a breath, Steve. You’re 
                        getting red.

                                 STEVE
                        Why didn’t anyone tell me about 
                        this? No one called, I’m supposed 
                        to just walk straight into a--
                                 MARK
                        --Nobody thought you’d come in 
                        today, man. Besides, we have bigger 
                        problems. Someone’s making 
                        anonymous threats to hack our 
                        servers. We had to take email down, 
                        confidential accounts could be 
                        compromised, it’s--

                                 STEVE
                        --Where’d you go last night?

           That question hangs in the air for a long beat. 

           Mark measures his response.

                                 STEVE
                        After the game. You guys said you 
                        would wait for me.

                                 MARK
                        Steve, Lori was scared, it was 
                        late, you were in there for a long--

                                 STEVE
                        --I asked them to check on you. It 
                        couldn’t have been longer than five 
                        minutes. You were already gone.

           Mark steps closer to Steve. Speaking in a hushed tone now.

                                 MARK
                        Look man, this is really bad. I 
                        think you should take the rest of 
                        the day off. Stay home. Sleep. Wait 
                        for this all to--

                                 STEVE
                        --I’m being sent home? Am I--
                             (beat)
                        Am I gonna lose my job over this?

           Mark’s eyes twitch towards the BOSSES watching from afar. 

           Steve clocks the silent exchange between them.

                                 MARK
                        Steve, listen, Mitch and Nancy just 
                        wanted me to talk to you, calm you 
                        down, they know we’re friends--

                                 STEVE
                        --You said I didn’t do anything 
                        wrong last night. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 STEVE (CONT'D)
                        Did you tell them that? You said 
                        you would’ve done the same--

                                 MARK
                        --Please, I think you should take 
                        the rest of the day--

                                 STEVE
                        --Just tell me if I’m gonna lose my 
                        fucking job over this fucking foul--

                                 MARK
                        --Steve, you’re putting me in an 
                        uncomfortable position right now--

                                 STEVE
                        --Oh, you’re in an uncomfortable 
                        position?

                                 MARK
                        Yes, I feel like this is getting 
                        very--

                                 STEVE
                             (getting pissed now)
                        --You’re in an uncomfortable 
                        position?

           Mark stops. Takes a long breath. 

           Angles Steve towards the exit as best he can.

                                 MARK
                        Look, you didn’t do anything wrong, 
                        man. I would tell you if I thought 
                        you did. But just... Take the rest 
                        of the day, ok?
                             (beat)
                        Besides, if the Cubs win tonight... 
                        Nobody’s gonna give a shit about 
                        last night ever again.

           That’s the one comforting thought Steve’s had in the past 12 
           hours. He takes it in, nods.

                                 STEVE
                        You’re right, you’re right-- I’m 
                        sorry, I’m still just all...

           Mark walks Steve to the glass doors, opens them for him.

           Steve steps into the hall, walks to the elevator, then turns 
           back. Mark is still at the glass doors.
                                 STEVE
                        Hey, so, uh... You wanna come over 
                        to the house tonight? Watch Game 
                        Seven with us? I just think it’d 
                        really help a lot if--

                                 MARK
                        --I gotta check with Lori. 

           That’s it. No promises beyond that.

                                 STEVE
                        Oh. Yeah, of course. Just, uh, 
                        gimme a call, ok? See ya.

           Mark nods as Steve hits the elevator button and the doors 
           open up again.

           Steve nods back, forces a smile, and steps inside.

           INT. STEVE’S CAR - DAY

           Steve drives back home, in growing paranoia-mode now.

           He ducks his head at every red light and stop sign, nervously 
           checking to make sure no passing motorists recognize him.

           Then, as Steve makes his way back to the SUBURBAN STREETS of 
           Lincolnshire, he looks up in the sky and notices--

                                 STEVE
                        What the hell?...

           A HELICOPTER.

           Way up in the sky, looking like it’s circling...

           THE BARTMAN HOUSE

           Now more closely resembling the outside of a crime scene than 
           the only home Steve Bartman has known in his life.

           COP CARS and NEWS VANS as far as the eye can see.

           Steve rolls into the driveway, immediately SWARMED by media--

                                 CHICAGO MEDIA
                        Steve, what can you tell us about 
                        that play?/Do you feel you’re 
                        responsible for the team’s loss?/If 
                        you could say one thing to Cubs 
                        fans nationwide, what would it be?
           Finally, Steve just abandons the car halfway into his 
           driveway and jumps onto the front lawn.

           MICROPHONES and RECORDERS jab at Steve from every angle as he 
           races to--

                                 MOLLY (O.S.)
                        STEVE!

           Steve looks up at the front door and sees his older sister, 
           MOLLY, early 30s, five months pregnant, waving him inside 
           like he’s outrunning a tornado.

                                 MOLLY
                        Get in! Hurry!

           Steve bursts inside the house and Molly SLAMS the door-- 

           Shutting all the media outside. 

                                 STEVE
                             (huffing and puffing)
                        What is this?!... How do they--?

           Ron Bartman is sitting in his usual seat, eyes on the floor.

           Beside him is Molly’s husband, JACOB, mid 30s, built like a 
           linebacker with the heart of a teddy bear.

                                 JACOB
                        The Sun-Times published this 
                        article this morning...

           Jacob spins around a LAPTOP -- Revealing a CHICAGO SUN-TIMES 
           ARTICLE with the headline:

                       “Man in Stands Described as Diehard Fan”

           Steve reads it, jaw dropping more with every word.

                                 MOLLY
                        They printed your name, hometown, 
                        the firm where you work...

                        gone viral -- The cops outside have

           The nearby phone RINGS -- Steve instinctively reaches for it--
                                 RON
                        --No, Steve, don’t answer that!

           Too late. The phone’s already at Steve’s ear. 

           Just in time for him to hear:

                                 MAN’S VOICE (OVER PHONE)
                        I’m gonna fucking kill you.

           Steve’s face goes white. Too stunned to hang up or even move.

                                 MAN’S VOICE (OVER PHONE)
                        You hear me? I know where you live, 
                        I know where you sleep at night, 
                        and if we don’t win tonight -- I’m 
                        gonna come in your house and CUT

           SLAM! Steve throws down the phone, badly shaken.

                        next time the phone rings: You let 
                        ‘em talk to ME.

                                 JACOB
                        Steve, I know this is a lot, but we 
                        really oughta think about getting 
                        you a lawyer, man.

                                 STEVE

                        lawyer?

                                 JACOB
                        Well, yeah, but... I do mostly 
                        personal injury stuff--

                                 STEVE
                        --Well, that sounds like the kind 
                        of lawyer I need. There’s about ten 
                        million people in this town who 
                        wanna personally injure me right 
                        now!

           Ron’s heard enough. 
           He sees how scared his family is, so he pulls himself out of 
           his chair and stomps over to a CLOSET.

                                 MOLLY
                        Dad? Dad, what’re you--?

           Ron reaches to the top back corner of the closet, pulling out 
           a LOCK BOX. 

           He spins the lock OPEN, revealing...

           A HANDGUN.

           Ron pulls it out, checks the chamber, makes sure it’s loaded.

                                 MOLLY
                        Oh-my-God. Dad, what the fuck?!

           Ron puts the gun back inside the lock box and carries it back 
           to his recliner. 

           Eyes locked straight ahead on the front door.

           HOURS LATER

           Steve sits frozen in front of the TV, flipping through 
           channel after channel...

           His face is EVERYWHERE. National news now. 

           On WGN, he sees an interview with his LITTLE LEAGUE TEAM. The 
           Renegades.

           The boys all hold SIGNS of support and chant “Go Coach B!”

           Ron just shakes his head at the insanity of it all. Molly and 
           Jacob peer outside.

                                 JACOB
                        There’s another chopper in the air.

                        arrived too. One of the guys

           When Ron talks, everyone else shuts up.

           The silence hangs over the room for a long beat.

           Molly nods to Jacob, who follows her into the KITCHEN.

           Leaving Steve and Ron alone for the moment.

                        ...And believe it or not, there are 
                        still angry fans waiting outside 
                        Wrigley, just hoping that Steve 
                        Bartman will return to the scene of 
                        the crime.
                             (beat)
                        And I hate to say it, but if the 
                        Cubs don’t win tonight... The 
                        torches and pitchforks may never be 
                        put away.

           BAM! Ron PUNCHES the stereo, shutting it OFF as well.

                                 RON
                        Guess they’ll put any asshole on 
                        the radio now too.
           Ron, Molly, and Jacob all settle in to watch the game, while 
           Steve stands in the BACK HALLWAY, holding the house phone.

                                 STEVE
                             (into phone)
                        Hey, yeah, Mark -- It’s Steve. 
                        Listen, I don’t know if you were 
                        still available to watch the game 
                        tonight... Maybe you tried to call 
                        earlier, the phone’s been ringing 
                        off the hook, I’m sorry about that. 
                        Anyways, it’d be great if you could 
                        still make it. I just-- Really feel 
                        like the support’ll help, you know?
                             (beat)
                        Oh, and I know you had to talk to 
                        Lori and everything, please tell 
                        her she’s more than welcome. My 
                        sister’s here too, so... Yeah, just 
                        gimme a call when you figure out 
                        your plan. Ok? Thanks man.

           Steve hangs up and brings the phone into the living room, 
           where everyone sits -- Watching the game in TOTAL SILENCE.

           TWO MARLINS are already on base, as Cubs PITCHER, KERRY WOOD, 
           #34, hurls a pitch--

           And 20-year-old MIGUEL CABRERA CRUSHES A THREE RUN HOMER into 
           deep left center field. 

           Gone from the moment it hit the bat.

                                 STEVE
                        Oh God...

           FLASHBULBS pop from outside the front windows-- 

           Desperately trying to get an angle on Steve’s reaction.

                                 MOLLY
                        Steve. Maybe you should sit over 
                        here by us where nobody can--

           Steve can’t hear her. 

           He just stands there, barely breathing-- 

           Paralyzed with fear as the FLASHBULBS outside keep POPPING...

                               FLORIDA 3   CUBS 0
           BOTTOM OF THE SECOND

           The Cubs are at the plate now -- Men on SECOND and THIRD. 

           DAMIEN MILLER, #27, chops a ground ball to third--

           Bringing in the first run for the Cubs.

                                 MOLLY
                        Wooo! YES!

                                 RON
                        Atta way! We’re chipping away here, 
                        we’re chipping away!

                                 JACOB
                        THAT’S WHAT I’M TALKING ABOUT! 
                        C’MON!!

           Steve’s the only one who stays quiet.

           Watching pitcher Kerry Wood step into the batter’s box.

                                 STEVE
                        Ok, this is good, Kerry swings a 
                        solid bat for a pitcher. Worst 
                        case, we burn the number nine spot 
                        to end the inning and get to the 
                        third at the top of the--

           CRACK! At least, that’s what it would sound like if the 
           Bartman’s were watching with any sound on. 

           But either way-- 

           Kerry Wood DRILLS A HOME RUN OVER THE CENTER FIELD IVY!

                                 STEVE
                        What?! Are you kidding me?!

                                 JACOB
                        HOLY SHIT! THE PITCHER! THE FUCKING 
                        PITCHER!

                                 RON
                        Jake, language!

                        RUN THOSE GODDAMN BASES, KERRY!

           The family trades high-fives and yelps, as the Cubs draw even.

                               FLORIDA 3   CUBS 3
           BOTTOM OF THE THIRD

           Now MOISES ALOU -- Steve’s nemesis from last night -- stands 
           at the plate with a man on FIRST, and...

           ABSOLUTELY CRUSHES A HOME RUN.

           Out of the stadium and onto Sheffield Avenue.

           Steve is beside himself -- Feeling the shackles of last night 
           being lifted at last.

                               FLORIDA 3   CUBS 5

           While the others all high-five and fist pump -- Steve picks 
           up the PHONE. Dialing Mark again...

                                 MOLLY
                        Hey. Who’re you calling?

                                 STEVE
                        No one. Just a friend of mine.

           Steve waits as the phone RINGS and RINGS... No answer again.

           TOP OF THE FIFTH

           The Marlins are at the plate and quickly come roaring back.

           A pair of WALKS -- Then a two-run DOUBLE -- A run-scoring 
           SINGLE -- And all of the sudden, it’s...

                               FLORIDA 6   CUBS 5

           The room is deflated. Feeling like cruel fate is here again.

                                 RON
                        Still five more innings, Stevie. 
                        That’s why they play all nine.

           Steve forces a nod. Trying to keep it together, as--

           THE PHONE RINGS.

           Steve grabs it, hoping to hear Mark on the other line--

                                 STEVE
                        Hello?

                                 DIGITALLY SCRAMBLED VOICE (OVER PHONE)
                        I will bury you.
           Steve freezes. The terrifying voice BREATHES HARD in and out.

                                 DIGITALLY SCRAMBLED VOICE (OVER PHONE)
                        If we lose this game, I will shoot 
                        you in the skull and bury you.

           CLICK. 

           The voice is gone, but the game continues...

           TOP OF THE SIXTH

           --A Marlins SINGLE, scoring ANOTHER RUN.

                               FLORIDA 7   CUBS 5

           The phone RINGS again.

           BOTTOM OF THE SIXTH

           The Cubs go down in order. 

           An easy 1-2-3 inning for Florida, as...

           The phone RINGS once more.

           TOP OF THE SEVENTH

           --Another DOUBLE, scoring TWO MORE RUNS for the Marlins.

                               FLORIDA 9   CUBS 5

           It’s all slipping away now, as the phone RINGS again.

           This time, Ron grabs the phone on the first ring and shouts-- 

                                 RON
                        Fucking, what?!
                             (beat)
                        FUCK YOU!

           At his breaking point, Ron RIPS the cord out of the wall and 
           THROWS the phone across the room.

                                 MOLLY
                        Dad!

                                 RON
                        I don’t wanna hear it! There’s 
                        still three more innings!
           But everyone in the room knows -- The whole city knows...

           The end is near.

           BOTTOM OF THE NINTH

           Last stand for the Cubs. 

           Down to their final out, with PAUL BAKO at the plate--

           Who hits a lazy FLY BALL to left. It lands easily in the 
           THIRD BASEMAN’s glove. 

           And just like that, FINAL SCORE:

                               FLORIDA 9   CUBS 6

           The entire Marlins team SPRINTS onto the field -- SCREAMING, 
           LAUGHING, DOG PILING on top of each other in celebration.

           Steve watches his father drop his lucky ball -- Head hanging 
           towards the floor, until he finally looks up, and we see...

           He has tears his eyes.

           Not just for his team, or for the loss, but for his son... 

           Whose life may never be the same.

                                 STEVE
                        Dad. Dad, I...

           Ron pushes back the tears-- 

           Refusing to let them spill in front of his family.

           He pulls himself up, stands beside Steve, and HUGS him.

                                 RON
                        No matter what, you’re my boy, 
                        Stevie. You’re my only boy. 
                             (kisses Steve’s head)
                        I love you. Always. There’s nothing 
                        this world can do to change that.

           Ron holds Steve close, desperate to protect his son. Unable 
           to hold back his emotions any longer -- Until finally... 

           Steve PULLS AWAY from his father. 

           Too ashamed to even look Ron in the eye right now.
           Ron nods and lets Steve go. He limps back towards his bedroom.

           Before he goes, he turns back around and says...

                                 RON
                        They’re gonna win someday, son. 
                        We’re gonna see ‘em win it someday.

           And with that, Ron walks into his bedroom and closes the door.

           HOURS LATER

           It’s the middle of the night now. 

           Steve sits holding his father’s foul ball, lit only by the 
           glow of the TV -- Still showing REPLAYS of him from Game 6.

           Finally, Steve gets up, ready to stop torturing himself, 
           until he looks down and sees...

           The house phone.

           Still unplugged and thrown aside.

           Steve bends down and picks up the phone, staring at it, 
           wishing he had someone to reach out to on the other line.

           But he doesn’t. 

           So he just plugs the phone back in, turns to go upstairs, 
           until--

           THE PHONE RINGS.

           Steve picks it up. Just needing to hear another human voice 
           right now, no matter who it is.

                                 STEVE

                        Who... Who’s calling please?

           Just short, nervous breaths on the other end for a beat.

                        My father has been a Cubs fan for 
                        seventy-four years. He’s the 
                        biggest fan I’ve ever met. He can 
                        tell you just about every player on 
                        just about every team in Cubs 
                        history. And he lived every day of 
                        his life without ever seeing them

                        And he promised me tonight that 
                        he’ll make it to next season, that 
                        he’ll hang on no matter how long it 
                        takes, but... We both know tonight

           The stranger’s gone.

           Leaving Steve to absorb that body blow in any way he can.

           Finally, Steve feels himself about to break, so he yanks the 
           phone cord out of the wall and races up the stairs, as we...

                        organization, Ron Santo, Ernie 
                        Banks, and Cub fans everywhere...

           Ron peers inside one of the boxes, sees an OLD FRAMED PHOTO. 

           It’s Ron and a 10-year-old Steve sitting behind home plate at 
           Wrigley together. Father and son. 

                                 JACOB (V.O.)
                        I am so truly sorry from the bottom 
                        of this Cub fan’s broken heart.

           Ron stares at the photo, holding in his pain, then puts it 
           back in the box. He turns off the light and closes the door.

           INT. STEVE’S CAR - NIGHT

           Steve drives into the night. 

           Lost in thought, the Chicago lights receding in the distance.

           As Steve Bartman disappears and escapes, we PUSH IN CLOSE on 
           his sullen face... Dissolving into a series of--
           INTERNET MEMES

           --Steve’s face photoshopped in the hole where Saddam Hussein 
           was captured with the caption: FOUND HIM.

           wall -- CHICAGO CUBS FOAM FINGERS pointing at him from every

           Next, it’s Steve at the center of countless--

           VIDEOS AND NEWS REPORTS

           --ESPN personalities TONY KORNHEISER and MICHAEL WILBON 
           trashing Steve on “Pardon the Interruption”:

                        Can this kid even live in Chicago 
                        anymore after all this, Tone?

                                 TONY KORNHEISER
                        Oh no. Let me tell you something:

                        appearances, interviews, even Super 
                        Bowl commercials. He never took a

                        picked it up after the ball’s 
                        unfortunate bounce off Bartman’s 
                        hands -- has sold the cursed piece

                        Steve Bartman on the other hand? 
                        Your guess is as good as mine.

           Finally, the reports on Steve come to a merciful end, and we--

                                                               FADE TO:

           THE BALTIMORE INNER HARBOR

           An early morning bird’s eye view of the city skyline.

           Shimmering water meets docks, boats, and high-rises. 

                                   BALTIMORE, MARYLAND

                                      YEARS LATER...

           INT. STEVE’S OFFICE - DAY

           A grey-walled cube farm not unlike the last office we saw 
           Steve in, only this one’s over 700 miles away.

           Sitting at a barren workstation, typing away, we find an 
           almost unrecognizable STEVE BARTMAN.

           Several years older, 20 pounds heavier, beard, no glasses.

           If you didn’t know this guy intimately all those years ago, 
           you’d never guess it was the same Steve Bartman from Game 6.

           INT. STEVE’S OFFICE - BREAK ROOM - DAY

           Steve eats lunch alone, surfing an ONLINE DATING SITE.
           He cycles through the PROFILE PICS of a cute woman named 
           KATIEKAT79.

           Steve goes through picture after picture of her -- Doing 
           cartwheels on the beach, hugging her dog, sipping margaritas 
           with her girlfriends -- liking what he sees, until he gets to:

           A picture of her in a Cubs hat.

           Steve feels a wave of anxiety and quickly hits the “X” atop 
           the woman’s profile.

           DO YOU WISH TO REMOVE KATIEKAT79 FROM YOUR LIST OF MATCHES?

           Steve hits “YES” -- The profile DISAPPEARS -- He exhales.

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Hey, Ronny?

           Steve doesn’t look up -- Then realizes...

                                 STEVE
                        Oh, uh-- Yeah?

           A sweet OFFICE MOM-type stands in the doorway.

                                 OFFICE MOM
                        Bunch of us are going to 
                        O’Sullivan’s for happy hour after 
                        work. Just wanted to see if you--

                                 STEVE
                        --Oh, you know what Diana, I have a--

                                 OFFICE MOM
                        --Doctor’s appointment, teeth 
                        cleaning, oil change? C’mon, Ronny, 
                        you gotta get some new material.

           Steve just forces a smile back at her. Busted.

           INT. O’SULLIVAN’S BAR AND GRILL - DAY

           Steve sits at a high-top table amongst a group of CO-WORKERS, 
           nursing a beer and picking at an appetizer sampler in silence.

           Left out of the conversation, Steve glances up at the ROW OF 
           TVs positioned over the nearby BAR.

           ESPN’s “BASEBALL TONIGHT” plays on every one.

           Steve starts to get a little twitchy.
           He gets up and approaches the BARTENDER.

                                 STEVE
                        Hey, uh, excuse me... You think you 
                        could maybe change the channel for 
                        me?

                                 BARTENDER
                        No problem. What’re you looking 
                        for?

                                 STEVE
                        Oh, anything’s fine. Thank you.

           The Bartender grabs a remote, changes the closest TV to FOX 
           SPORTS ONE.

           Wouldn’t you know it? More baseball.

                                 STEVE
                        Actually, uh, maybe something other 
                        than sports? If that’s cool.

           The Bartender nods and puts on a random COOKING SHOW.

                                 BARTENDER
                        We good?

                                 STEVE
                        Yeah. Thank you so much.
                             (awkward beat)
                        And, uh... Sorry, do you think you 
                        could maybe switch all the other 
                        TVs too? If you have a chance?

           The Bartender looks up at the ROW OF TVs above the bar. 

           All still tuned to ESPN.

                                 BARTENDER
                        Hey man. You got a TV over at your 
                        place? ‘Cause they let you watch 
                        whatever you want over there.

           INT. STEVE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           To answer the bartender’s question, no, Steve does not have a 
           TV at his place.

           Actually, Steve’s place doesn’t have much of anything, save 
           for cottage cheese ceilings, an IKEA coffee table, and...

           His father’s old FOUL BALL.
           Up on the mantel, where Steve looks at it from the kitchen. 

           He smiles sadly -- A nice memory just popped in his head.

           Then he opens his FREEZER -- Nothing inside but a single 
           shitty Lean Cuisine. Frost-bitten and inedible.

           Steve throws away the Lean Cuisine and heads out the door.

           INT. GROCERY STORE - NIGHT

           Steve stands in the frozen food aisle -- Loading up on Lean 
           Cuisines, six for $10... 

           He turns and sees a WOMAN standing next to him. Also with 
           frozen dinners on her shopping list.

           Her name is ANNIE, mid 30s, and she glances up at Steve with 
           one of those smiles men think about for days.

                                 ANNIE
                        Any suggestions?

           Steve’s a little tongue-tied, so he just reaches in his 
           basket and hands her TWO BOXES OF...

                                 STEVE
                        I like the Lemongrass Chicken.

           Annie takes them -- Charmed by Steve’s grocery store chivalry.

                                 ANNIE
                        Oh. Thank you.

                                 STEVE
                        No problem.

           She looks into his eyes. Just long enough for Steve to worry:

           Shit, does she recognize him?

           He blinks away and strides to the SELF-CHECK OUT STANDS. 

           Swiping bar codes -- Almost sweating now -- as he looks back 
           towards Annie...

           Smiling at him again before he hurries away.

           EXT. GROCERY STORE PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER

           Steve unlocks his beat-up Accord, ready to head home, until--
                                 ANNIE (O.S.)
                        --I’m so sorry.

           Steve turns around -- Immediately panicked at the sight of 
           Annie again.

                                 STEVE
                        Excuse me? You’re... Sorry for--?

                                 ANNIE
                        --For staring. Just now in the 
                        store. That was rude, I’m ok 
                        admitting that, I just thought you 
                        had a nice face, sweet eyes, and I 
                        just... Couldn’t help it I guess.

           Steve nods and opens his car door. In a hurry now.

                                 STEVE
                        That’s ok. Don’t worry about it.

           Annie’s face bunches up as Steve climbs into his Accord--

                                 ANNIE
                        --Wait, what? Um, that wasn’t, 
                        like... A legitimate apology, you 
                        know? I’m trying to flirt with you.

                                 STEVE
                             (genuinely confused)
                        I’m sorry?

                                 ANNIE
                        Flir-ting. It’s this age-old social 
                        ritual where two people engage in a 
                        kind of casual banter with each 
                        other in the name of--
                             (stopping herself)
                        Hold on, why aren’t you 
                        interrupting me yet? Why are you 
                        just standing there letting me 
                        explain the concept of flirting to 
                        you like you have literally no idea 
                        what flirting is, oh my God, this 
                        is humiliating, I have to--

                                 STEVE
                        --No, no, wait! I’m sorry, I’m 
                        sorry -- I’m interrupting you, I’m 
                        interrupting you now.
                             (quick breath)
                        Don’t go, I’m just... I didn’t... 
                        I’m an idiot, don’t go.
           Annie looks back at him. 

           He’s flustered, but sweet. And kind of cute.

                                 ANNIE
                        What’s your name?

           Steve hesitates a split-second longer than someone should at 
           that question.

                                 STEVE
                        Ron-- Ron Banks.

           Steve puts out his hand. Annie shakes it.

                                 ANNIE
                        Ron Banks. Annie Stephenson.
                             (beat)
                        So, it’s kinda late and I don’t 
                        know if you have somewhere to be, 
                        but... You wanna get a cup of 
                        coffee or something?

                                 STEVE
                        Coffee? Actually, coffee can make 
                        me a little anxious and the long-
                        term effects of caffeine are still-- 

                                 ANNIE
                        --Ok, so no coffee, forget all the 
                        coffee then.
                             (beat)
                        How ‘bout this? What’s something 
                        you’ve been craving forever? The 
                        thing you want the absolute most in 
                        the world right now?...

           This time, Steve doesn’t hesitate at all, as we--

                                                                CUT TO:

           A GIANT FUNNEL CAKE.

           Crispy, golden brown, and covered in powdered sugar.

           Steve digs into it. Melting in ecstasy with each bite.

                                 STEVE
                        Oh-my-God. This is amazing. Here, 
                        have some.

           Steve and Annie share the funnel cake in a booth at a divey 
           little DINER on Baltimore’s INNER HARBOR.
                                 ANNIE
                        So how long have you lived in 
                        Baltimore?

                                 STEVE
                        About nine, ten years now? A little 
                        while before my Dad passed.

                                 ANNIE
                        Oh, I’m so sorry. And where’re you 
                        from originally?

           Steve is too focussed on devouring this funnel cake to put 
           much thought into the necessary lies here.

                                 STEVE
                        Um, you know... Around here.

                                 ANNIE
                        So Baltimore?

                                 STEVE
                        Yeah.

                                 ANNIE
                        Which you said you just moved to 
                        nine, ten years ago?

                                 STEVE
                        No, uh, I mean-- Around Baltimore. 
                        Closer to Washington, DC actually. 
                        That area...
                             (offering the funnel cake)
                        Here, have more of this. Please, 
                        don’t let me finish it.

           Annie picks at the dessert and stares at Steve... 

           Going from amused to suspicious real fast.

                                 ANNIE
                        Ron?... Hey, Ron?...

           Steve’s too busy chewing his mouthful of fried dough, until--

                                 ANNIE
                             (grabbing her purse)
                        Ok, you know what, this was a 
                        mistake--

                                 STEVE
                        --What do you mean? Where’re you--?
                                 ANNIE
                        --When you were all fidgety and 
                        awkward back in the parking lot, it 
                        was kinda cute -- But your pathetic 
                        backstory, the alarming lack of 
                        specificity in identifying your 
                        hometown, and how you barely even 
                        respond to your own name -- You’re 
                        obviously a pathological liar.

                                 STEVE
                        No-no-no, that’s not true. I’m--

           Annie walks out of the restaurant. Steve trails after her.

                                 ANNIE
                        --Ugh, this always happens to me. 
                        My ex-husband was a liar, every guy 
                        at AA always has some weird list of 
                        perverted liar shit--

                                 STEVE
                        --AA?

                                 ANNIE
                        Yes, which I was just about to tell 
                        you about, because I’m not a 
                        goddamn liar like--

                                 STEVE
                        --Hold on, just wait-- I’m--
                             (blurts out)
                        My name is Steve Bartman.

           Annie stops and looks back at him -- He pulls out his PHONE 
           and starts typing on it with quivering hands.

                                 STEVE
                        That’s my real name, I swear, and 
                        I’m sorry I lied, but if you look 
                        me up, I think you’ll understand...

           Steve slowly hands Annie his phone-- 

           Open to a GOOGLE SEARCH of his name...

           Annie reaches for the phone with one hand and fumbles to grab 
           a TUBE OF MACE from her purse with the other.

                                 ANNIE
                        Look, if this is some kind of child 
                        sex offender registry or proof that 
                        you’re a murderer of women or 
                        something, I swear to God I will--
           She looks down at the phone...

           Seeing the countless PAGE HITS and PHOTOS from Steve’s past.

                                 ANNIE
                        What... the hell is all this?

           EXT. INNER HARBOR - NIGHT

           Steve and Annie sit on a bench at the end of the harbor, 
           framed by the water and the Baltimore aquarium as Annie keeps 
           digging through the Steve Bartman story on his phone.

                                 ANNIE
                        This is unbelievable... There’s no 
                        way this really happened to you... 
                        There’s no way this really...
                             (looks up at Steve)
                        Oh my God. This is the stupidest 
                        story I’ve ever heard in my life!

                                 STEVE
                        It’s not stupid -- It’s all true.

                                 ANNIE
                        No, no, of course it’s true -- But 
                        it’s also so... Dumb. All of this 
                        because of a foul ball??

                                 STEVE
                        It wasn’t just a foul ball. If I 
                        don’t reach for that ball and Alou 
                        makes the catch, the Cubs have a 97 
                        percent chance of making it to the 
                        World Series, finally breaking the 
                        Curse of the Billy Goat and--

                                 ANNIE
                        --Billy Goat?! There’s something 
                        called “The Curse of the Billy 
                        Goat”? Steve, please, listen to me.

           Annie takes Steve’s hand, stares into his eyes, and says:

                                 ANNIE
                        This is the single most stupid 
                        fucking thing I’ve ever heard in my 
                        life.

           Steve’s about to argue back, but then he looks down at HIS 
           HAND RESTING IN HERS.

           It feels good. For the first time in years, he feels good.
           And finally... He smiles at her.

                                 STEVE
                        You’re right. It’s so stupid.

                                 ANNIE
                        SO stupid! I mean, you went into 
                        hiding because of this. You moved to 
                        a new city. You changed your name!

                                 STEVE
                        To Ron Banks. My fake name is Ron 
                        Banks.

                                 ANNIE
                        I should have known that was a fake 
                        name as soon as you said it! You 
                        said “Ron Banks” and I immediately 
                        thought, who gets named “Ron” 
                        anymore? That’s an old ass sounding 
                        name. This guy’s name is Ron??

                                 STEVE
                        It is! It’s so old. It was my Dad’s 
                        name!

                                 ANNIE
                        Your Dad? You mean your dead Dad? 
                        Your dead Dad’s name was Ron?

                                 STEVE
                        Yeah, but it’s ok, don’t be sad, he 
                        was old.

                                 ANNIE
                        Of course he was -- His name was Ron!

           They both LAUGH at this. Loudly. 

           As Steve realizes that all the worst things that ever 
           happened to him are suddenly making him laugh right now...

           And the next thing Steve realizes is that he absolutely must-- 

           KISS THIS GIRL.

           So he does. And it feels great. For both of them.

           Finally, they pull apart, sharing some of that awkward post-
           first kiss eye contact... 

           Until Annie glances back at the list of YOUTUBE VIDEOS on her 
           phone--
                                 ANNIE
                        Hold on. What’s this? “Steve 
                        Bartman Likes Howard Stern’s--”

                                 STEVE
                        --No, no, no -- Please don’t watch 
                        that--

           Too late. Annie hits PLAY and the YOUTUBE VIDEO boots up.

           Depicting former Sportscenter anchor DAN PATRICK at his ESPN 
           NEWSDESK, announcing:

                                 DAN PATRICK (OVER YOUTUBE)
                        ...Steve Bartman, lifelong Cubs fan 
                        is joining us now via the phone on 
                        Sportscenter -- Steve, have you 
                        received death threats because of 
                        this?...

           A PHOTO of Steve pops up. And an UNFAMILIAR VOICE responds...

                                 “STEVE BARTMAN” (OVER YOUTUBE)
                        Yes, I have received at least five 
                        death threats, and I’m pretty much, 
                        you know, hiding out right now...

                                 DAN PATRICK
                        Steve, do you think you can stay in 
                        the Chicago area?

                                 “STEVE BARTMAN”
                        Um -- Do you like Howard Stern’s 
                        butt cheese?

           A very awkward beat as Dan Patrick tries not to crack up.

                                 DAN PATRICK
                        We’ve been had. That was not Steve 
                        Bartman.

           The video ends and Steve and Annie look up at each other. 

           Bursting into LAUGHTER once again.

                                 ANNIE
                        Oh-my-God, this is amazing! Are 
                        there more like that?? Show me, I 
                        wanna see everything!

           Steve and Annie move closer. Feeling like the only two people 
           in the city right now, as they keep laughing together, and we--

                                                                CUT TO:
           A CHICAGO CUBS HIGHLIGHT VIDEO

           Rapid-fire and cut to an intense ROCK ANTHEM that’s enough to 
           get any diehard fired up at the sight of:

           Double-plays -- Upper-deck home runs -- Fans going CRAZY!

           INT. ANNIE’S CLASSROOM - DAY

           Annie’s at her desk, curiously watching the CUBS HIGHLIGHTS 
           on her phone while a class of THIRD GRADERS takes a quiz.

           The video ends and Annie picks up a day-old NEWSPAPER.

           She sifts through each section, just passing the time, until 
           she’s struck by an AD in the SPORTS SECTION. It reads:

                          BALTIMORE ORIOLES VS CHICAGO CUBS     
                                   Fri, June 27 7:15PM

                                 ANNIE
                        Holy shit--

           Every pair of eight-year-old eyes darts up at her. The kids 
           all giggle and let out “Ohhhhhhhh”s at their teacher’s swear.

                                 ANNIE
                             (snapping back into 
                              teacher-mode)
                        Hey, eyes down, lips zipped. Focus 
                        on your work.

           The kids all snap back to work and Annie returns to her paper.

           Her lips curl in a secret smile, amazed at her good fortune, 
           as she looks down at the bottom of the ad...

           EXT. OFFICE COURTYARD - DAY

           Steve and Annie huddle up at a courtyard picnic table, eating 
           lunch together. Annie can barely contain her excitement.

                                 ANNIE
                        So, I did some research. And did 
                        you know that the Cubs and Orioles 
                        only play each other once every 
                        three years?

                                 STEVE
                        Yes.
                                 ANNIE
                        And they alternate which city they 
                        play in every time they match-up. 
                        That means the Cubs will only play 
                        in Baltimore once every six years. 

                                 STEVE
                        I know. It used to be ten. Or 
                        longer.

                                 ANNIE
                        That’s terrible.

                                 STEVE
                        Actually, it’s convenient. And 
                        partly why I moved to Baltimore.

                                 ANNIE
                        What do you mean?

                                 STEVE
                        American League city. Zero history 
                        with the Cubs. It’s almost like 
                        they don’t exist out here. Then 
                        when they come out once every 
                        several years, I go out of town. 
                        Nags Head or Dewey Beach. Have you 
                        ever been to Dewey Beach?

                                 ANNIE
                        No.

                                 STEVE
                        Would you like to go? Sorry, when 
                        are the Cubs coming to--

                                 ANNIE
                        --Friday, June 27th.

                                 STEVE
                        Would you like to go to Dewey Beach 
                        on Friday, June twenty--?

                                 ANNIE
                        --No, Steve, what’re you--?
                             (beat)
                        We’re going. To the Cubs game. I 
                        got us tickets! Aren’t you 
                        excited??

           Steve’s face suddenly fills with dread. 

           Like he’s just been diagnosed with a terminal illness.
                                 STEVE
                        You what?

                                 ANNIE
                             (uneasy)
                        I... got us tickets. I thought 
                        maybe we could go to the game toge--

                                 STEVE
                        --I really wish you had asked me 
                        first.

                                 ANNIE
                        Well, yeah, but-- I wanted it to be 
                        a surprise.

           Steve gets up to throw his trash away. 

           Wanting to just walk away from this conversation right now.

                                 STEVE
                        If you want to go, you should go. 
                        Take a friend. I don’t want the 
                        ticket to go to waste.

                                 ANNIE
                             (following after him)
                        No, Steve, I want to go with you. 
                        C’mon, it’ll be fun! You’ll 
                        remember how much you love the 
                        team, I’ll annoy you with 
                        ridiculous questions the whole 
                        time, we’ll--

           He turns around. Dead serious right now.

                                 STEVE
                        I can’t go.
                             (beat)
                        I’m sorry, I just... I haven’t been 
                        to a baseball game since that 
                        night. I haven’t even watched one 
                        since my Dad died.

           Annie looks back at him.

           Realizing this is about much more than baseball for him.

                                 ANNIE
                        What was it like?

                                 STEVE
                        What?
                                 ANNIE
                        Watching games with your Dad. You 
                        know, the two of you. Together.

                                 STEVE
                        It was the best three hours of my 
                        day... It was the best three hours 
                        of every day.

           Annie takes Steve’s hand. Wanting to put him at ease again.

                                 ANNIE
                        Then come to this game with me. 
                        Because I know what your days have 
                        felt like since you left home. I 
                        know what’s it’s like to be alone. 
                        And I promise, whether we win or we 
                        get our asses kicked, if we go to 
                        this game together...
                             (beat)
                        It’ll be the best three hours of 
                        your day.

           Annie smiles at him, slowly eating away at Steve’s poker-face.

           Until finally... He nods. Trusting her, as we--

                                                                CUT TO:

           ORIOLE PARK AT CAMDEN YARDS

           One of baseball’s most-loved modern ballparks.

           Thousands of fans cross the HOME RUN PLAQUES embedded in EUTAW 
           STREET. The B&O WAREHOUSE frames the view from right field.

           Steve and Annie move to the ENTRY GATES, taking it all in.

           Annie because she’s never seen anything like it before. 

           Steve because he hasn’t seen it in so long.

           STADIUM CONCESSIONS STAND

           Steve stands amongst the ocean of Orioles ORANGE and BLACK, 
           dressed in an anonymous Polo shirt and khakis. 

                                 ANNIE
                             (scanning the menu)
                        No funnel cakes, but I heard the 
                        barbecue’s good.
           Steve’s more concerned with watching all the PASSING FANS-- 

           Making sure none of them are whispering or staring at him.

                                 ANNIE
                        Steve? You hungry?

                                 STEVE
                        Oh-- Oh yeah. Sounds good.
                             (quiet)
                        Sorry, do you just... Think you 
                        could try not to use my name?

           Annie reads the rising anxiety on Steve’s face. She nods.

                                 ANNIE
                        Of course. You got it.

           NOSEBLEED SEATS

           The verrry top section in the right field stands. The players 
           all look like ants from up here.

           Annie cringes, looking back at Steve.

                                 ANNIE
                        Shit, do these seats suck? You’ve 
                        probably never sat in seats this 
                        sucky in your life. I’m sorry, I 
                        didn’t really know what I was--

           Steve freezes at the sight of a GROUP OF CUBS FANS sliding 
           along the ROW UNDERNEATH THEM.

           All decked out in their gear. Obvious diehards.

           Steve can’t breathe. Praying the Cubs fans don’t look at him.

                                 ANNIE
                        Actually -- Maybe the view would be 
                        better from a little higher up.

                                 STEVE
                        Higher?

                                 ANNIE
                        Yeah. Like, up there?

           Steve follows Annie’s eyes to the VERY TOP ROW. At a cluster 
           of EMPTY SEATS where no one will be able to notice him.

           Annie takes his hand, letting him know it’s going to be ok.
                                 ANNIE
                        C’mon. They say you haven’t really 
                        seen a baseball game ‘til you’ve 
                        watched it from 30,000 feet.

           She smiles and leads Steve up the stairs to the top row.

           MIDDLE OF THE GAME

           The inning ends with the Cubs turning a beautiful DOUBLE PLAY.

           Steve claps and grins. Letting his guard down a little and 
           just enjoying the game again for the first time in years.

                                 STEVE
                        So, that was called a 6-4-3 double-
                        play. That means the shortstop, 
                        playing the 6 position, throws to 
                        the second baseman, the 4, who then 
                        throws to first base, the 3.
                             (beat)
                        Make sense?

                                 ANNIE
                        No, not at all.

                                 STEVE
                        Ok, well understanding basic 
                        offense is a little less complex. 
                        “On-base percentage” measures how 
                        often a player safely reaches base. 
                        “Slugging percentage” measures the 
                        power of a batter -- Then “On-base 
                        plus slugging” equals--

                                 ANNIE
                        --Dude. I teach third grade, not 
                        Advanced Quantum Theory. Little to 
                        none of what you’re saying is 
                        resonating with me on any level.

           Steve realizes he’s blowing it. 

                                 STEVE
                        Sorry, I’m making this super boring 
                        aren’t I?

                                 ANNIE
                        No-no, it’s not that, just...
                             (beat)
                        Is this why people love sports? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ANNIE (CONT'D)
                        Because there’s all these 
                        statistics, and percentages, and 
                        arguments over which player is so 
                        much better than whatever other 
                        player... Is that what you and your 
                        Dad loved about baseball?

                                 STEVE
                        No. We just... Loved watching the 
                        game together.

           A long beat as Steve’s words sink in for both of them.

                                 ANNIE
                        Great. Then let’s do that. 
                             (beat)
                        Let’s just watch.

           Steve nods, as they settle in, all alone up here together...

           And slowly -- The beauty of the game begins to reveal itself:

           --The way a bare-handed scoop and throw from third gets a 
           runner out by less than half a step.

           --A suicide squeeze bunt -- The ball just tip-toeing down the 
           baseline while the runner dives across home plate.

           --And of course: A HOME RUN. Wrapping around the foul pole by 
           inches. Sending Steve and Annie leaping out of their seats.

           The games ends with the Cubs turning another picture-perfect 
           DOUBLE PLAY -- Second Base to Shortstop to First Base. 

           Annie whoops it up and turns to Steve.

                                 ANNIE
                        4-6-3?

           Steve’s eyes light up. She’s a natural.

           By the time the Cubs run off the field, the scoreboard reads:

                               CHI CUBS 9   O’s 2

           Steve lifts Annie up in the air in celebration.

           They kiss deeply while the fans down below head for the exits.
           AN HOUR AFTER THE GAME

           The Camden Yards crowds have all dispersed -- Leaving Steve 
           and Annie the only two people still in the upper-deck seats.

           Annie eats a big thing of cotton candy with her legs swung 
           over Steve’s knees. Telling him her story.

                                 ANNIE
                        And the first three years were 
                        great. Everything I always dreamed 
                        of, magical, all that... whatever.
                             (beat)
                        Then we found out I was sick. It 
                        was serious, but treatable. But I 
                        ended up needing to have a pretty 
                        nasty surgery and when it was 
                        over...

           Annie stops herself. 

           This is never going to stop being hard for her.

                                 ANNIE
                        Greg came from a big family. He 
                        wanted lots of kids. We both did. I 
                        mean, I don’t know if I wanted a 
                        whole summer camp like he did, 
                        but...
                             (beat)
                        Anyways, that wasn’t gonna happen 
                        anymore. So he put in his time 
                        fluffing pillows and feeding me 
                        soup, until... One day. When he 
                        called me from his office and told 
                        me:
                             (beat)
                        “I’m sorry. This isn’t what I 
                        signed up for.”

           Steve feels her hand trembling as she tells him this.

                                 ANNIE
                        Like almost dying and having half 
                        my insides scooped out was what I 
                        signed up for. Like I promised him 
                        some kind of life and then took it 
                        away.
                             (beat)
                        Like I was the one who lied to him.

           Steve doesn’t know what to say. So he just listens.
                                 ANNIE
                        He’s traded up to a new family now. 
                        Couple twins and a newborn. A wife 
                        who I’ll never get to judge because 
                        she preemptively blocked me on 
                        Facebook. Clever bitch.
                             (big bite of cotton candy)
                        Honestly though... I think it was 
                        my subsequent foray into internet 
                        dating that ended up really fueling 
                        my drinking problem.

           Steve laughs unexpectedly. 

           Annie always seems to have that way with him.

                                 ANNIE
                        You sound intrigued, should we deep-
                        dive into that dark history of my 
                        life now?

                                 STEVE
                             (still laughing)
                        No, actually, I think I’m ok--

                                 ANNIE
                        --You sure? It’s good stuff. Fair 
                        warning though: You will definitely 
                        need to cry alone in the shower 
                        afterwards. You will. I know this 
                        from personal experience.

           They smile at each other for a long beat.

           Steve is happy again. For the first time in so long.

           Annie then glances at the CENTER FIELD SCOREBOARD. It reads:

                                JOIN US TOMORROW FOR...

                                      O’s VS CUBS
                                         1:35 PM

           She does a double-take for a second.

                                 ANNIE
                        Wait-- Why are they asking us to 
                        come back tomorrow for the game we 
                        just saw today?

                                 STEVE
                        Because they’re playing again. Same 
                        teams.
                                 ANNIE
                        What? You mean they’re doing this 
                        whole thing again -- Tomorrow??

                                 STEVE
                        Yeah. And the day after that. It’s 
                        called a “three game series.”

           Annie’s eyes light up. 

           She swings her legs off of Steve, ready to race down to the--

           TICKET BOX OFFICE

           Where Annie skids to a stop in front of an ORIOLES TICKET 
           LADY. 

           Steve trots behind her, trying to keep up.

                                 ANNIE
                        Hello, ma’am -- I’d like your two 
                        worst seats to the next two games 
                        versus the Cubs, please.

                                 ORIOLES TICKET LADY
                        You said... Our two worst seats?

                                 ANNIE
                        Yes, ma’am. The two worst seats in 
                        the house. As far away from the 
                        action as possible.

           The Ticket Lady looks over to Steve in confusion.

                                 STEVE
                        Sorry, she’s... A new fan.

                                                                CUT TO:

           THE NEXT TWO CUBS VS ORIOLES GAMES

           Cut like a SPORTSCENTER HIGHLIGHT REEL. 

           The Cubs are on FIRE. 

           STEALING BASES -- LAUNCHING HOMERS -- TURNING DOUBLE-PLAYS

           Steve and Annie are loving every minute of it from the 
           shittiest seats in the stadium -- Their own private hideaway.

           At the end of both games, the Cubs players line up and trade 
           handshakes with each other -- Celebrating a SERIES SWEEP.
           While up in the nosebleeds, Steve and Annie KISS.

           And keep on kissing... The kind that won’t stop until the 
           stadium’s empty and the cleaning crew kicks them out.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           INT. STEVE’S CAR - NIGHT

           Steve drives home from the last game at Camden Yards with 
           Annie asleep in the passenger seat.

           He makes sure Annie’s passed out, then softly turns on...

           The AM radio. Tuned to a SPORTS TALK SHOW.

                                 SPORTS TALK HOST (OVER RADIO)
                        ...And I know we don’t see much of 
                        this team out in Baltimore, but 
                        man, the Cubs looked really good 
                        out there this weekend. Loaded with 
                        young pitching, they have speed, 
                        power in the middle of the order--

                                 SPORTS TALK CO-HOST (OVER RADIO)
                        --No doubt about it. That’s a team 
                        we could see make some real noise 
                        come September. This might be a 
                        major turning point for them...

           Steve reaches for the radio -- Turning it back off, until--

                                 ANNIE
                             (touching his hand)
                        No... Keep it.

           Annie stirs, then rests her head on Steve’s shoulder.

                                 ANNIE
                        Has it felt this long for you 
                        too?...

                                 STEVE
                        Since what?

           She doesn’t answer. She just falls back asleep beside him.

           Steve leans closer to her, then looks back at the AM radio, 
           still talking all about the Cubs... 

           He turns the radio UP just the slightest bit.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. BARTMAN HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY

           Steve’s sister, Molly, sits in the kitchen of the old family 
           house. Cup of coffee in one hand, cordless phone in the other.

                                 MOLLY
                        So, come on, tell me more -- 
                        Where’d you two meet?

                                                         INTERCUT WITH:

           INT. STEVE’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Steve sits on his couch, talking to Molly.

                                 STEVE
                        I-- Just, you know... Out.

                                 MOLLY
                        You went out? In public, for a long 
                        enough period of time to meet and 
                        engage with a real-life woman?

                                 STEVE
                        We were grocery shopping. Ok?

                                 MOLLY
                        No, totally, I’m thrilled. I’m not 
                        trying to give you a hard time, I’m 
                        happy for you. I really am.
                             (beat)
                        So, when can we meet her?

                                 STEVE
                             (knows where this is going)
                        Molls.

                                 MOLLY
                        Ok, I get it, you just started 
                        seeing each other. I’m just 
                        saying... Has she ever been to 
                        Chicago?

           Steve doesn’t answer. 

           He grips the phone a little tighter now.

                                 MOLLY
                        Steve? Hello?... This isn’t why I 
                        called you, I swear.

                                 STEVE
                        I know. It’s ok.
                                 MOLLY
                        It’s just--
                             (deep breath)
                        You realize I have a son who 
                        wouldn’t recognize his own uncle if 
                        he saw him walking down the street? 
                        You do know that, right?

                                 STEVE
                        Molly, I told you, I--

                                 MOLLY
                        --Fine, if you won’t come to us, 
                        just let us come to you. For 
                        Christ’s sake, I don’t even have 
                        your home address!

                                 STEVE
                        This place is temporary, you know 
                        that, as soon as I find a new--

                                 MOLLY
                        --Oh, bullshit. Bullshit!

           They both hold for a long beat. Catching their breath.

                                 MOLLY
                        Steve... Are we ever going to see 
                        you again? Please, just tell me--
                             (beat)
                        Am I ever going to see my baby 
                        brother again?

                                 STEVE
                        Yes. I’m going to come back, I 
                        promise I’ll--

                                 MOLLY
                        --When?

           A long beat, as Molly looks outside her kitchen window -- At 
           the OLD LITTLE LEAGUE FIELD adjacent to the house. 

           Where a ragtag TEAM OF YOUNGSTERS fields ground balls...

           Molly’s eyes narrow. She just answered her own question.

                                 MOLLY
                        Steve -- That fucking team may 
                        never win a World Series again. 
                        Ever. Is that what you think it’s 
                        gonna take for people to forgive 
                        you? For you to finally move on?
           Steve doesn’t answer. He just holds the phone in silence. 

                                 MOLLY
                        And even if they did win, it’s 
                        already too late. Dad is gone. And 
                        you’re still going to let a goddamn 
                        foul ball be the reason you weren’t 
                        here with us when he--

                                 STEVE
                        --I have to go. I love you.

           With that, Steve HANGS UP. 

           Leaving his sister to just stare out the window. And hope...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. O’SULLIVAN’S BAR AND GRILL - DAY

           Happy Hour again. 

           Annie is with Steve this time, sipping water, chatting up 
           some of his co-workers, bringing him out of his shell.

           Steve’s eyes wander up towards the ROW OF TVs above the bar.

           ESPN’s “BASEBALL TONIGHT” is on once again.

                                 KARL RAVECH (ON TV) 
                        And don’t look now, but after that 
                        weekend sweep of the O’s, the “Never 
                        say die” Cubbies are climbing back 
                        into the race for the NL Central...

           The NATIONAL LEAGUE CENTRAL STANDINGS pop up on-screen, 
           showing the Cubs 7.5 games behind the ST. LOUIS CARDINALS.

           Steve tries to look away, but he can’t. Until--

           The Bartender CHANGES THE CHANNEL to another cooking show.

                                 BARTENDER
                        Better?

                                 STEVE
                        Oh, uh... No, could you-- Could you 
                        change it back, please? And maybe 
                        turn it up a little bit? Thank you.

           The Bartender rolls his eyes and flips it back to ESPN. 

           Steve leans in, absorbing EVERY WORD of the show now.
           INT. MIDDLE SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - NIGHT

           Annie’s AA meeting.

           She stands in the circle, sharing a piece of her story with 
           the rest of the GROUP.

                                 ANNIE
                        I could find any reason to have a 
                        drink. My sister’s dog is getting 
                        put to sleep? Drink. Neighbor I 
                        don’t like is having a going away 
                        party? Drink. Kids in my class are 
                        telling racist jokes again? You get 
                        where I’m going with this...

           Steve sits beside Annie, looking up at her as she speaks.

                                 ANNIE
                        I felt so alone I wanted to die. 
                        And when I was alone, I became a 
                        different person. Until I realized 
                        that if I didn’t stop... That 
                        person would be all that’s left.

           Steve stares at Annie, getting lost in the weight of her 
           words -- Until his phone BUZZES.

           Updating with the score of the Cubs game on his ESPN app.

           He tucks his phone away and CLAPS as Annie’s testimony ends.

           INT. PUBLIC STORAGE CENTER - DAY

           Steve pulls open a door to an old STORAGE UNIT. Shafts of 
           light pour inside. Illuminating...

           ALL OF STEVE’S CUBS MEMORABILIA.

           All the posters, pennants, and autographs from his old 
           bedroom and his father’s lifelong collection.

           Steve steps inside, almost afraid of what’s in here.

           He uses his cell phone flashlight to peer into dusty boxes, 
           holding in all his emotions, until he finds...

           An old FRAMED PHOTO of Ron and Steve at Wrigley Field.

           One that once hung in Steve’s bedroom. Depicting a 10-year-
           old Steve, watching a game with his father behind home plate.

           Steve stares at the photo. Missing his Dad more than ever.
           INT. STEVE’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Annie helps Steve hang a vintage CUBS FLAG and decorate the 
           room with a few old pieces of his memorabilia collection. 

           The apartment’s formerly sterile interior is now brightened 
           with some much needed touches of BLUE AND RED. 

                                 ANNIE
                        Looks great. But maybe you can find 
                        a new place for that old ball over 
                        there? It looks like it’s been to 
                        hell and back.

           She grabs RON’S LUCKY FOUL BALL from the mantel -- Sitting 
           next to Ron and Steve’s Wrigley Field photo now.

                                 STEVE
                        No-no-no, that was my Dad’s.

           Annie looks at the ball. Realizing what she’s holding.

                                 ANNIE
                        Oh, I’m so sorry, I didn’t--

                                 STEVE
                        --No, it’s ok, I just... Keep it 
                        with me because he never got to see 
                        them win and--

           BAM-BAM-BAM. Three loud KNOCKS at the door interrupt them.

           Steve JUMPS. His paranoia kicks in -- Suddenly petrified.

                                 STEVE
                        Who’s that?

           Annie peers out the window and bounces with excitement.

                                 ANNIE
                        No-no-no, it’s nothing -- I just 
                        wanted this to be a surprise 
                        because you don’t strike me as the 
                        kind of guy who’s into big gifts. 
                        But it was on sale and you’re gonna 
                        need a way to watch the games 
                        because you don’t own a TV -- Which 
                        is honestly a little too hipster-
                        intellectual or borderline serial 
                        killer-y for my taste, so...

           She opens the door and reveals TWO BEST BUY DELIVERY MEN.

           Hauling in a brand new FLAT SCREEN TV.
                                 STEVE
                        Oh my God. You-- You didn’t have to 
                        do that. I can just check the 
                        scores on my phone or watch 
                        highlights online at work.

                                 ANNIE
                        Now why in the world would you 
                        wanna do that?
                             (beat)
                        When we can watch them together?

           She touches his arm, ready to float off the ground.

           INT. STEVE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Steve and Annie sit in front of Steve’s new TV, so happy, 
           watching a CHICAGO CUBS VS WASHINGTON NATIONALS GAME.

           Steve holds his father’s foul ball in one hand and Annie’s 
           hand in the other. Glancing up on the mantel where he sees...

           The OLD PHOTOGRAPH of Ron and Steve at Wrigley Field. 

           Steve smiles at the picture, losing himself -- Taken away by 
           the perfect image of father and son -- as the SOUNDS OF THE 
           GAME bleed over this moment... 

           Almost bringing Ron back to life for an instant, until--

                                 CUBS GAME ANNOUNCER (ON TV)
                        And that’s a foul ball heading 
                        towards the seats -- Harper gives 
                        chase, reaching into the stands and--

           The NATIONALS RIGHT FIELDER makes a SPECTACULAR CATCH-- 

           Reaching into a CLUSTER OF FANS to snag a foul ball.

                                 ANNIE
                        Oh my God! He caught that??

                                 CUBS COLOR COMMENTATOR (ON TV)
                        Wow, that was one for the highlight 
                        reel. The Nats are just lucky Steve 
                        Bartman wasn’t sitting in that seat!

           Steve and Annie both freeze. 

           Watching the Announcers yuck it up together -- While GRAINY 
           VIDEO of Steve’s infamous moment comes on-screen. 

           Still far from forgotten, all these years later.
                                 CUBS GAME ANNOUNCER (ON TV)
                        Seriously. Where’s that guy when 
                        you actually need him, right?

           Annie turns to Steve. 

           She can feel every muscle in his body tense up -- as he 
           SQUEEZES Ron’s baseball in one hand and--

                                 ANNIE
                        Ow.

           --Squeezes Annie’s hand in the other.

                                 STEVE
                        Oh, I’m sorry-- I’m so sorry, I--

                                 ANNIE
                        --No, no, that’s ok, that’s ok.

           Annie slips her hand away and rubs Steve’s back. 

           Supporting him, but unable to mask her look of concern, as we--

                                                                CUT TO:

           THE CITY OF CHICAGO

           Alive, hopeful, full of passionate love for the Cubs as we 
           FLY around the city’s most famous streets and landmarks.

                        “Abandon all hope, ye who enter 
                        here.” You know who said that?
                             (beat)
                        Someone who’s never been to 
                        Chicago.

           WRIGLEY FIELD

           Fans celebrate another CUBS VICTORY at Wrigley.

                                 SPORTS RADIO HOST (V.O.)
                        There’s not many people still 
                        walking this Earth who were alive 
                        in 1908. Who were here the last 
                        time the Cubs won it all...

           They cheer and high-five as the HAND OPERATED SCOREBOARD 
           updates the Cubs’ place in the CENTRAL DIVISION STANDINGS:

           SIX GAMES BACK OF THE ST. LOUIS CARDINALS.
           STEVE’S APARTMENT

           Steve and Annie watch another Cubs game on Steve’s new TV, a 
           feast of Chinese take-out spread out in front of them.

                                 SPORTS RADIO HOST (V.O.)
                        Over a century of losing might be 
                        enough to break some cities. But 
                        not here. Because in Chicago, Cubs 
                        fans have a saying... 
                             (beat)
                        We say “This is the year.”

           Steve inches closer to the TV -- Hanging on every pitch.

           BARTMAN HOUSE

           Molly and Jacob sit in their living room beside their 
           strapping young son, DENNIS.

           He opens up a UPS PACKAGE. It’s a wrapped BIRTHDAY PRESENT.

           The card attached reads:

                    Happy Birthday, Denny. See you at the World Series!

                                    Love, Uncle Steve

           Dennis tears open the gift, delighted at the sight of...

           A brand new CUBS JERSEY, HAT, and BASEBALL GLOVE.

                        We don’t say “This could be the 
                        year.” Or “This might be the year.”

           Molly and Jacob look up at each other. Exhaling sadly.

           AA MEETING

           Annie’s in the usual circle, sipping a coffee, while another 
           SPEAKER shares with the group.

           But this time, STRANGERS are sitting on both sides of her.

           Another win brings the Cubs within 4.5 games of first place.

           ANNIE’S BEDROOM

           Annie sleeps alone. She rolls over, reaching across the bed 
           for where Steve usually is, but he’s not here.

                                 SPORTS RADIO HOST (V.O.)
                        Because we believe. No matter how 
                        long the drought or how strong the 
                        curse. We’ve survived the billy 
                        goat in ‘45, the black cat in ‘69, 
                        Bartman in 2003...

           ANNIE’S BATHROOM

           Steve sits on the toilet at 1:30AM -- Watching the final 
           innings of the CARDINALS AT LA DODGERS GAME on his phone.

                        And after all of it, we still 
                        believe that the curse will be 
                        lifted and the suffering will end...

           He lives and dies with every pitch. Desperate to know whether 
           or not the Cubs will gain another game on their arch-rivals.

                        Think that sounds dramatic? Ok, 
                        fair enough... 
                             (beat)
                        You just don’t know how it feels to 
                        be a fan.

           INT. CUBS BROADCAST BOOTH - NIGHT

           The CUBS GAME ANNOUNCER gives an update from Wrigley Field.

                                 CUBS GAME ANNOUNCER
                        And folks, with the Cardinals 
                        falling to the San Francisco Giants 
                        earlier today -- That means our 
                        Cubs will be just two games out of 
                        first place if they can preserve 
                        this one-run lead in the ninth...

           INT. STEVE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Steve leans towards the TV, clutching his father’s foul ball, 
           watching this update during a pivotal Cubs game vs the Reds.

                                 CUBS GAME ANNOUNCER (ON TV)
                        And that’s with just one week left 
                        to go before the pivotal three-game 
                        series versus St. Louis to end the 
                        regular season...

           Annie walks through the living room, holding her purse.

                                 ANNIE
                        You sure you don’t wanna come to 
                        the meeting? You haven’t been in a 
                        while and it was really great 
                        having you--

                                 STEVE
                             (not looking up)
                        --I’ll be at the next one. Promise.

           Annie nods, trying to take it in stride.

                                 ANNIE
                        Ok, well... Good luck.

           Annie steals a kiss from him and heads out. Steve’s eyes stay 
           glued to the TV, as the CUBS PITCHER gives up a leadoff WALK.

                                 CUBS GAME ANNOUNCER (ON TV)
                        And that’s ball four -- Batter, 
                        take your base.

           Steve digs his nails into his father’s baseball. Furious.

                                 STEVE
                        Fuck.

           THREE BATTERS LATER

           Steve leans in closer -- Sweating and breathing heavily.

                                 CUBS GAME ANNOUNCER (ON TV) 
                        ...Just one more out will wrap this 
                        one up for the Cubbies, Jackson 
                        with the pitch and--

           WHACK! The REDS BATTER smashes a shot right up the middle.
                                 CUBS GAME ANNOUNCER (ON TV)
                        And that’ll bring the tying run in 
                        to score -- Fowler has to hurry to 
                        make a play at the plate -- Oh no, 
                        he bobbles the ball and...

           The Reds score the WINNING RUN. Cubs lose.

           And suddenly-- Everything goes SILENT for Steve. 

           He looks down at his father’s foul ball in his hand-- 

           Then up at the OLD PHOTOGRAPH of them on the mantel...

           A flood of emotion fills his eyes -- The pain and rage of 
           everything he’s lost BOILS up inside of him, until finally--

                                 STEVE
                        GOD FUCKING DAMMIT!!

           Steve cocks back and HURLS HIS FATHER’S BASEBALL STRAIGHT 
           INTO THE TV -- SHATTERING THE SCREEN ON IMPACT.

           It all happens so fast, Steve can barely make sense of what 
           he’s done.

           He takes short, panicky breaths -- Then gets up and 
           immediately starts hauling the ruined TV out the front door.

           INT. BEST BUY - NIGHT

           Steve stands at the CHECK-OUT REGISTER -- Ringing up another 
           BRAND NEW FLAT SCREEN. Just like the one Annie got him.

                                 BEST BUY CHECK-OUT GIRL
                        That’ll be 428.56 -- Would you like

                                 STEVE
                        --No, thank you. Actually, I’m in 
                        kind of a hurry.

           Steve hands the girl his credit card and forces a smile.

           Hating to be rude.

           EXT. BEST BUY PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           Steve opens his car door, as a BEST BUY EMPLOYEE lifts the 
           heavy TV off a cart and slides it into Steve’s backseat.
                                 STEVE
                        Thank you for your help.

           Steve reaches in his wallet and tips the guy $5.

                                 BEST BUY EMPLOYEE
                        Not a problem. And thank you, Mr--

           The Employee picks Steve’s SALES RECEIPT off the cart, 
           glancing at the NAME printed at the top. 

           He stops, checks the receipt again, then turns back to Steve.

                                 BEST BUY EMPLOYEE
                        Hey. You know you got the same name 
                        as that guy? Remember that Cubs 
                        fan? With the foul ball?

           Steve turns RED in an instant. He SNATCHES the receipt back.

                                 STEVE
                        Have a good night.

           Steve pushes past him, heading for his front door. 

           The Employee follows closely behind -- Seeing the obvious 
           panic on Steve’s face -- suddenly realizing...

                                 BEST BUY EMPLOYEE
                        Holy shit... You’re him aren’t you?

                                 STEVE
                        Excuse me, I really have to--

                                 BEST BUY EMPLOYEE
                        --Hey, look man, I don’t wanna give 
                        you a hard time, but I’ve got a 
                        buddy who works at Bleacher Report--

                                 STEVE
                        --I don’t know what you’re talking 
                        about, I have to go--

                                 BEST BUY EMPLOYEE
                        --If I could put you two in touch. 
                        He wouldn’t have to write about 
                        where you live now or anything. 
                        They’ll pay you to just--

           Steve opens the front door-- 

           The Employee corners him, just inches away now.
                                 BEST BUY EMPLOYEE
                        People wanna know what happened to 
                        you, man. What about all the Cubs 
                        fans who deserve to know what--?

           The Employee GRABS STEVE’S ARM -- Holding him back for a 
           frightening instant, until Steve turns and--

           SHOVES THE MAN AS HARD AS HE CAN.

                                 STEVE
                        Get the fuck away from me.

           The Employee stumbles backwards -- SLAMMING into a nearby 
           parked car. Other CUSTOMERS gasp and stare from afar.

           Steve looks up in horror. Right hand balled into a FIST.

           This was the biggest physical confrontation of his life.

                                 STEVE
                        I’m... I’m sorry.

           Steve dives inside his car and peels away as fast as he can.

           INT. STEVE’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Early the next morning, Steve gives Annie a kiss goodbye as 
           he grabs his stuff and heads for the door.

                                 STEVE
                        See you tonight. Love you.

                                 ANNIE
                        Love you too -- Oh, and by the 
                        way... We win last night?

           Steve flinches at the memory of last night’s game.

                                 STEVE
                        Yup. Great game.

           Annie smiles as he takes off. 

           She sips a cup of coffee and flips on the TV -- Checking last 
           night’s highlights on ESPN.

           Until she’s struck by the CRAWL on the bottom of the screen:

                                     CUBS 3  REDS 4

           Annie scrunches her face -- Didn’t Steve just say they won?
           She steps closer to the TV -- Making sure she’s not seeing 
           things -- when she suddenly notices...

           THE YELLOW ENERGY GUIDE STICKER on the bottom of the set.

           The tiny sticker that everyone forgets to peel off when 
           they’ve just bought a brand new TV.

           Annie stares at the TV -- Studying it -- Totally confused...

           EXT. STEVE’S APARTMENT BUILDING - PARKING LOT - DAY

           Annie walks softly down the stairs and through the lot, 
           making sure no one’s around to spot her.

           She strides to the DUMPSTERS -- Opens them up.

           She rifles through all the TRASH BAGS and CARDBOARD BOXES 
           inside-- Until she finds:

           THE TV SHE BOUGHT FOR STEVE.

           With a BASEBALL-SIZED HOLE smashed right in the middle of it.

           Annie’s eyes fill with panic. Like she’s found a dead body.

                                 ANNIE
                        Jesus Christ...

           INT. TEACHER’S LOUNGE - DAY

           Annie sits in the corner of the lounge, cell phone to her 
           ear, having a hushed conversation with her AA SPONSOR.

                                 ANNIE
                        Yeah, um, I’m calling about my 
                        boyfriend. I... I think he may need 
                        help and I don’t know how to--

                                 AA SPONSOR (OVER PHONE)
                        --Is he in recovery presently?

           Annie has her laptop in front of her -- Watching the YOUTUBE 
           VIDEO of the full, unbroken nightmare Steve endured at Game 6.

                                 ANNIE
                        No.

                                 AA SPONSOR (OVER PHONE)
                        And is he dealing with an alcohol 
                        dependency? Or drugs, or--
                                 ANNIE
                        --I... I don’t know. I’m sorry, I 
                        don’t really know how to classify 
                        what he’s going through, I--

                                 AA SPONSOR (OVER PHONE)
                        --It’s ok, it’s ok. Let me just ask 
                        you: Has he experienced any kind of 
                        past emotional traumas that could 
                        have been recently triggered?

           Annie watches the FOOTAGE of Steve getting a FULL BEER thrown 
           in his face.

           Her heart wrenches at the sight of her boyfriend staring 
           blankly as he wipes the beer off his face. 

           Destroyed inside.

                                 ANNIE
                        Yes.

           INT. ANNIE’S CAR - DAY

           Annie sits alone in her car in the school parking lot.

           She holds her phone up close to her face, watching an ESPN 
           VIDEO analyzing the current PENNANT RACES:

                                 KARL RAVECH (ON PHONE)
                        ...And for the Cubs, it all comes 
                        down to this final three-game 
                        series with the Cardinals. Chicago 
                        needs to sweep all three contests 
                        at Wrigley to make the playoffs -- 
                        It’s winner take all.
                             (beat)
                        And if the Cubs’ miraculous run 
                        falls short, that’ll make it a 
                        brutal 107 years without a World 
                        Series title for the North Siders...

           Annie swipes off the video, struggling to catch her breath.

           Utterly petrified about the outcome of these next three games.

           INT. CHAIN RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Date night. 

           Steve and Annie sit quietly, sharing appetizers in a corner 
           booth. 
                                 ANNIE
                        So... I was thinking maybe we could 
                        take one of those trips you were 
                        talking about sometime soon. You 
                        know, Dewey Beach?

           Steve’s adrift in his own world -- Sucked in by the TV near 
           the bar broadcasting tonight’s BASEBALL HIGHLIGHTS.

           Annie reaches for his hand. More concerned than annoyed.

                                 ANNIE
                        Steve?

                                 STEVE
                        Oh-- I’m sorry. Yeah, Dewey Beach, 
                        totally. When?

                                 ANNIE
                        How ‘bout this weekend?

                                 STEVE
                        This weekend? You mean tomorrow? I 
                        don’t think that’s gonna work.

                                 ANNIE
                        How come?

                                 STEVE
                        It’s the Cubs’ last series of the 
                        regular season. If they sweep the 
                        Cardinals, they’ll make the 
                        playoffs and--

                                 ANNIE
                        --No, I know that, but--

                                 STEVE
                        --It’s incredibly difficult to 
                        reach the postseason in baseball. 
                        Only one third of the teams--

                                 ANNIE
                        --Right, but whether or not you’re 
                        actually watching really has 
                        nothing to do with how they--

                                 STEVE
                        --And they’re one of the hottest 
                        teams in the league right now with 
                        an excellent chance to--

                                 ANNIE
                        --Steve!
           He shuts up.

           Looking over both shoulders to make sure no one heard them.

                                 STEVE
                        Could you... not say my name so 
                        loudly, please?

                                 ANNIE
                        Sorry. I just... You know I would 
                        never lie to you. So that’s why I 
                        feel like I need to tell you that 
                        what’s going on right now with 
                        you... and this team...
                             (beat)
                        It doesn’t feel right.

                                 STEVE
                        That’s just because you don’t have 
                        that connection to a team yet. You 
                        don’t know what this feels like.

                                 ANNIE
                        You mean the obsession, the 
                        isolation, the depression?...

                                 STEVE
                        Those are very strong words and I 
                        don’t think it’s fair to--

                                 ANNIE
                        --How long has it been since you’ve 
                        seen your family? 

           He freezes at that question. Caught way off guard.

                                 ANNIE
                        Or introduced yourself to someone 
                        by your real name? When was the 
                        last time you walked past a 
                        stranger on the street and didn’t 
                        wish to God that you could trade 
                        lives with them? Just for a day.

           Steve blinks down at the table. 

           His voice trembles. Barely more than a whisper now.

                                 STEVE
                        You don’t understand. My Dad... All 
                        he wanted was to see them win. It’s 
                        my fault he never--
                                 ANNIE
                        --No. Your Dad wanted to see them 
                        win with you. He loved that team 
                        because he shared them with you. 
                             (beat)
                        Jesus, Steve -- Don’t you know that 
                        your life is about so much more 
                        than a game? It’s about so much 
                        more than that night.

           She lets that hang there. For as long as she needs to.

                                 STEVE
                        If we can just finally win... Just 
                        once. I promise I can let this go.

                                 ANNIE
                        And what if they don’t win?

                                 STEVE
                        We’re eliminated from playoff 
                        contention.

                                 ANNIE
                        No. I mean what’s going to 
                        happen... If they never win.

           Steve holds for a beat. Glancing back at the TV over the bar.

                                 STEVE
                        They’re going to win. I know it.

                                                                CUT TO:

           WRIGLEY FIELD

           Where the OUTFIELD LIGHTS burst to life once again and a herd 
           of hopeful FANS files through the gates.

           The Cubs and Cardinals take the field and the game begins...

           It feels like the entire stadium is watching in silence.

           INT. ANNIE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Steve and Annie watch on TV, nerves fraying with every pitch.

           It’s a tense, low-scoring game. 

           With every play -- Good or bad -- there is no joy. 

           Only PAIN or RELIEF.
           Finally-- The Cardinals push a run across on a SACRIFICE FLY.

           Annie’s face falls. Steve sits perfectly still, as we reach--

           THE BOTTOM OF THE NINTH

           The Cubs are at the plate. Down to their last three outs.

                                 CUBS GAME ANNOUNCER (OVER TV)
                        This is it, folks. Bottom of the 
                        ninth, three outs to go and we need 
                        one run to live another inning -- 
                        Two runs to live another day...

           Steve sets down his father’s foul ball on the table in front 
           of him. He’ll squeeze it into dust if he doesn’t.

           The first pitch from the CARDINALS CLOSER comes in--

           --A CHOPPER to third -- The RUNNER beats out an INFIELD 
           SINGLE by a quarter of a step.

                                 ANNIE
                        Oh-my-God. Yes!

           Steve doesn’t crack. He knows they need more. Next play:

           --A SACRIFICE BUNT. Moving the runner into scoring position.

           ONE OUT.

           --Then, a WALK. Runners at FIRST and SECOND.

           Steve hunches over. Leaned all the way in. Next play:

           --A LONG FLY BALL... All the way back to the WARNING TRACK.

                                 ANNIE
                        GO! GO!!

           But it’s CAUGHT. 

           The runners advance to SECOND and THIRD on the SAC FLY.

           TWO OUTS.

           --The next pitch comes in and-- HITS THE BATTER IN THE BACK.

                                 CUBS GAME ANNOUNCER (ON TV)
                        And Baez took that one right 
                        between the shoulder blades and 
                        that’s gonna load the bases for the 
                        Cubs here with two outs!
           Steve still doesn’t speak. He just reaches for his Dad’s 
           lucky ball again. Holding it tight, as--

           STRIKE ONE. Swing and a miss.

                                 CUBS GAME ANNOUNCER (ON TV)
                        My goodness, Rizzo’s trying to get 
                        us all out of here on one pitch.

           Next pitch: STRIKE TWO. Looking at a curveball at the knees.

                                 CUBS GAME ANNOUNCER (ON TV)
                        And the Cubs are down to their last 
                        strike...

           Annie closes her eyes. Steve holds his breath.

           The pitch comes in-- POPPED UP FOUL down the third baseline.

           Lofting ever so close to Aisle 4 -- The section where Steve 
           sat for Game 6...

                                 STEVE
                        Get in the seats -- C’mon, get in 
                        the seats--

           The ball hits its apex -- Looking like it has a chance to 
           reach Aisle 4 and extend the game. 

           The FANS in the seats below all STAND -- REACHING UP...

           Until the ball dies in the air-- 

           Landing safely in the glove of the CARDINALS THIRD BASEMAN. 

           THREE OUTS. 

           Final score:

                             ST. LOUIS 1   CUBS 0

           It’s over. But Steve can’t take his eyes off the screen. 

           Returning to the nightmare of years past all over again.

                                 CUBS GAME ANNOUNCER (ON TV)
                        Well, that’ll do it, folks. We’ve 
                        got two more games left in the 
                        season -- But there will be no 
                        playoff magic. And once again our 
                        chance at breaking that darn 
                        curse... Just wasn’t meant to be.
           Steve shakes, barely able to keep breathing, until he finally 
           looks over at Annie...

           She has tears in her eyes.

           For the exact same reason Steve’s Dad did after Game 7 in ‘03.

                                 STEVE
                        What’re you doing?

                                 ANNIE
                             (wiping her tears)
                        Nothing, I’m fine, I just--

                                 STEVE
                        --Are you crying? Are you--?
                             (beat)
                        Why are you crying?

                                 ANNIE
                        Because... They lost. And I know 
                        how much--

                                 STEVE
                        --You can’t cry.

           She looks back at him through the tears. Suddenly hurt.

                                 ANNIE
                        What? 

                                 STEVE
                        I’ve been watching this team lose 
                        my whole FUCKING life. You’ve 
                        watched for four months.
                             (rising anger)
                        Who are you to cry?

                                 ANNIE
                        Who am I? Who are you?! Seriously, 
                        who the fuck is-- This guy. Who 
                        yells, and hurts, and... Throws 
                        fucking baseballs through 
                        television screens!

                                 STEVE
                        That’s being a fan!

                                 ANNIE
                        No! That’s being a fucking 
                        psychopath! Did your Dad ever throw 
                        that ball through a TV?! Or a 
                        window? Did he?
           Steve looks down at the ball.

           The thing his father loved more than anything in the world.

                                 STEVE
                        I’m sorry this isn’t what you 
                        signed up for.

           Those are probably the most hurtful words Steve could say to 
           Annie right now.

           Her anger is the only thing pushing back her tears.

                                 ANNIE
                        Fuck you.

                                 STEVE
                             (immediately feeling 
                              terrible)
                        Wait-- I’m sorry, I--

                                 ANNIE
                        --No. You don’t get to say 
                        something like that to me and just 
                        apologize your way out of it. Your 
                        usually other-worldly level of 
                        politeness can’t do a goddamn thing 
                        to take that back right now.

           Annie gets up and moves away from Steve.

                                 ANNIE
                        I know you hate yourself because 
                        you think you cost your father 
                        this... piece of joy that he never 
                        got to feel. And you think I don’t 
                        understand it -- And right now, I 
                        hope I never do.
                             (beat)
                        But I’ve seen what happens when you 
                        love something so much... and it 
                        won’t ever love you back.

           Steve just stares back at her. Taking in all of her pain.

                                 ANNIE
                        You love this team so much... And 
                        it doesn’t even know you exist. It 
                        has no regard for you, or your 
                        pain, or your happiness. It has and 
                        always will proceed in exactly the 
                        same way, forever, whether you are 
                        still alive to see it or not.
                                 STEVE
                        That’s not true. If I hadn’t been 
                        there to catch that ball--

                                 ANNIE
                        --It would have been someone else! 
                        It could have been anyone else! But 
                        it’s easier to blame YOU -- To 
                        blame yourself -- than to admit 
                        we’re all utterly fucking powerless 
                        to control the only things in our 
                        lives that can make us happy.

           She takes a long breath and looks Steve in the eyes.

                                 ANNIE
                        What do you think would happen if 
                        they finally won? You could go back 
                        home? Back to your old name? Go to 
                        the games, high-five strangers... 
                        And look up and see your Dad again?
                             (beat)
                        And what if you walked into that 
                        place tomorrow? Would they kill 
                        you? Burn you alive? Maybe that’s 
                        what you want. Because maybe that’s 
                        what you think will finally get 
                        them to forgive you...

           Steve is frozen. He knows every word she’s said is true.

                                 ANNIE
                        I think you should go.

                                 STEVE
                        Go where?

                                 ANNIE
                        I don’t care.
                             (beat)
                        Just go, Steve.

           Finally, Steve just nods.

           He walks out the door, RUNS down the stairs, into the--

           APARTMENT PARKING LOT

           Where Steve jumps in his car, SPEEDS AWAY, and DRIVES...
           STEVE’S CAR

           He just drives and drives and drives-- 

           Baltimore receding in the distance...

           No idea where he’s going -- He just needs to get there FAST.

           EMPTY HIGHWAYS

           Steve keeps driving. With a purpose now. 

           White-knuckling the wheel as he hits a SIGN reading:

                               PENNSYLVANIA WELCOMES YOU

           Steve keeps going -- Stopping for nothing -- A man possessed.

           It’s the middle of the night now, but Steve is still WIDE 
           AWAKE, as he blows by:

                                    WELCOME TO OHIO

           Hours and hours have passed, as Steve hits:

                            INDIANA - CROSSROADS OF AMERICA

           And suddenly, the first rays of DAYLIGHT start to creep 
           through as Steve reaches:

                      WELCOME TO ILLINOIS - THE LAND OF LINCOLN

           His eyes are barely open now, but he can’t stop. 

           He’s too close. 

           Too close to...

           WRIGLEY FIELD

           Shining like a jewel in the early morning sun once again.

           The DIGITAL CRAWL beneath the RED NEON MARQUEE reads:

                                  CUBS VS CARDINALS

                                    OCTOBER 3  3:05PM

           And in the distance, parked on a dingy side street, we find:

           STEVE’S CAR.
           Steve sits passed out in the front seat. Exhausted and out 
           cold. But not for long...

           It’s almost game time.

           EXT. WRIGLEY FIELD - ADDISON STREET ENTRANCE - DAY

           Steve stands on the sidewalk just outside the stadium, 
           haggling with a TICKET SCALPER for a last-minute seat.

           FANS file in around him from every direction. 

           Steve shields his face, hands the Scalper some cash and takes 
           his ticket.

           INT. WRIGLEY FIELD - STADIUM CONCOURSE - DAY

           Steve walks slowly through the herd of Cubs fans.

           Like an inmate being led to the electric chair.

           Every nearby FOOTSTEP -- Every HOLLER from across the 
           concourse -- Every split-second of EYE CONTACT sends shivers 
           up Steve’s spine.

           But he keeps walking. 

           Ready for whatever’s coming to him, until he reaches...

           WRIGLEY FIELD - LEFT FIELD SEATS

           Aisle 4. Row 8. Seat 113.

           There it is. The seat Steve sat in during Game 6.

           Steve stands at the top of the aisle -- Ready to move closer 
           to it -- Ready to return to the scene of the crime, until--

           He sees the seat is surrounded by SMILING FANS.

           Posing -- Laughing -- Taking selfies at this infamous piece 
           of baseball real estate.

                                 MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Hey, excuse me--

           Steve turns. Ready to be exposed.

           He stares back at a YOUNG DAD holding his 5-YEAR-OLD SON in 
           his arms.
                                 YOUNG DAD
                        Would you mind taking a picture of 
                        us? At the seat?

           This guy doesn’t recognize him. In fact, no one does.

           Nobody here could pick Steve out of a lineup right now.

                                 STEVE
                        I, uh... Sure.

           The Young Dad hands Steve his phone and hoists his adoring son 
           on his shoulder. 

           Smiling big as they pose at Steve’s seat.

                                 YOUNG DAD
                             (to his son)
                        Smile, buddy. Big smile, ok?
                             (to Steve)
                        It’s his first game.

           Steve takes the photo and walks it back to the Father and Son.

                                 STEVE
                        No kidding?

                                 YOUNG DAD
                        Yeah. Tell me if I’m doing the 
                        wrong thing. After that loss last 
                        night, you think I’m setting the 
                        little guy up for a lifetime of 
                        heartbreak?

           Steve looks at the little boy. 

           Staring out at Wrigley Field with wide eyes like it’s the 
           greatest place on Earth.

                                 STEVE
                        No. Not if he always remembers how 
                        good it feels to be here right now. 
                        With his Dad.

           The Young Dad smiles and takes his phone back.

                                 YOUNG DAD
                        You know what seat this is?

                                 STEVE
                        Yeah.
                                 YOUNG DAD
                        Poor guy. You know, sometimes I 
                        wonder whatever happened to him...
                             (beat)
                        I mean, when it happened, I was 
                        furious, I was going crazy just 
                        like everyone else, but-- He was 
                        just... A fan. You know? 

           Steve nods.

                                 YOUNG DAD
                        I’m sorry, I don’t wanna talk your 
                        ear off, you’ve probably got your 
                        own friends to meet up with--

                                 STEVE
                        --No, actually, I came by myself.

                                 YOUNG DAD
                        By yourself? Where’re you sitting? 

                                 STEVE
                        Over in right field, up by the--

                                 YOUNG DAD
                        --You can’t come to Wrigley and 
                        watch a game by yourself, man. 
                        That’s like an unwritten rule of 
                        this place. 
                             (setting his son down)
                        Listen, my wife was gonna come with 
                        us, but she’s sick today, so we’ve 
                        got an empty seat right beside us.
                             (beat)
                        You wanna sit over here with us?

           Steve looks back at the Father and Son. Feeling the love they 
           have for this field, this team, and each other.

                                 STEVE
                        That’d be great. Thank you.

                                 YOUNG DAD
                        My pleasure. I’m Chris, by the way. 
                        And the little guy’s Nicky. 
                             (extends his hand)
                        What’s your name?

           Steve shakes his hand, looks him square in the eye, and says:

                                 STEVE
                        I’m Steve.
           The Young Dad smiles and directs Steve to their seats, where 
           they settle in as...

           THE GAME BEGINS

           And for once, Steve just lets go and enjoys all the classic 
           moments of a day at the ballpark:

           --The CUBS PLAYERS racing out to take the field. Some do 
           FLIPS across the grass, waving out to the fans.

           --The CRACKS of the bats. The SNAP of a blazing fastball 
           colliding with a leather glove.

           --The Cubs score their FIRST RUN. Then another. Steve, Chris, 
           Nicky, and all the FANS sitting around them HIGH-FIVE and 
           CHEST BUMP like little kids.

           --A CARDINALS slugger hits a HOME RUN to the center field 
           bleachers. The crowd breaks into a deafening “THROW IT BACK!” 
           chant. Steve and the others GO NUTS as the fan throws the 
           Cardinals home run ball back onto the field.

           --At the SEVENTH INNING STRETCH, Steve sings “Take Me Out to 
           the Ball Game” with the rest of the Wrigley faithful. A Cubs 
           tradition that brings the entire stadium together as one.

           --And finally, THE LAST OUT. It’s a Cubs victory. Steve claps 
           and cheers his ass off. Hugging strangers. Pumping his fist.

           Overjoyed like his team just won Game 7 of the World Series.

           Steve then looks out behind HOME PLATE, at a pair of familiar 
           seats -- Where he suddenly sees...

           HIS DAD.

           The Ron Bartman from the decades-old photo at Wrigley Field. 

           And sitting right beside him is 10-YEAR-OLD STEVE. 

           Both standing, cheering, sharing this beautiful moment 
           together... 

           Father and son.

           Steve stares out at this vision -- This perfect memory -- as 
           his pain melts away and TEARS fill his eyes.

           He’s been waiting for this moment for so long.
           STADIUM CONCOURSE

           After the game, Steve moves through the DEPARTING CROWD. 

           Still undetected and closing in on the EXIT GATES up ahead.

           His mission is almost complete, until...

                                 MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        --Steve?

           Steve flinches, but doesn’t look back. Just keeps moving.

                                 MAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Steve! Hey, Steve!

           He picks up his pace now, about to move into a full jog to 
           escape the pursuing voice, until he looks back and sees:

           MARK. The old friend who attended Game 6 with him.

                                 MARK
                        Oh my God. Steve. It’s--
                             (beat)
                        It’s you, right?

           Steve looks over both shoulders, making sure no one else is 
           listening in on them.

                                 STEVE
                        Mark. Hey.

           And suddenly, Mark’s eyes fill with a hint of emotion.

           This is a moment he never thought he’d have.

                                 MARK
                        I... I can’t believe-- It’s been so 
                        long.

                                 STEVE
                        Yeah. How’ve you been?

                                 MARK
                        I’m-- I’m great. Still at Hewitt. 
                        We actually have a suite at the 
                        stadium now, that’s why I’m here. 
                        Hey, you wanna come up and check it 
                        out? Say hi to some of the old--

                                 STEVE
                        --No. No thank you. I appreciate 
                        that though.
           Mark nods. Realizing how hard this is for Steve.

                                 MARK
                        Lori’s up there too. Remember her?
                             (holds up his ring finger)
                        Married going on eight years now. 
                        Two kids. Can you believe it?

           Mark pulls out his phone and shows Steve a bunch of PHOTOS of 
           his family. 

           Lori and their TWO ADORABLE CHILDREN decked out in CUBS GEAR.

                                 MARK
                        Lori’s a diehard fan too now. She 
                        knows all the players, their stats, 
                        when their contract’s up... I 
                        swear, she must’ve learned it all 
                        from you.

                                 STEVE
                        No... I-- I don’t think so.

                                 MARK
                        And she still talks about your Dad, 
                        man. She only met him that one 
                        time, but she still says he was the 
                        best fan she’s ever met...
                             (beat)
                        I meant to call you when I heard 
                        about him. But I just-- Didn’t know 
                        how to reach you back then and...

           Mark stops himself and looks back at Steve for a long beat.

           Tinged with sadness for both of them.

                                 MARK
                        I’m so sorry, man. I am. I never 
                        should’ve left you alone that 
                        night, I--
                             (beat)
                        I should’ve been a better friend to 
                        you.

           Those words make Steve stand up just a little straighter.

                                 MARK
                        I mean, I think about it all the 
                        time. If it had been me sitting in 
                        that seat instead of you... I 
                        would’ve done the exact same thing. 
                        We all would have. Every single 
                        person in this stadium.
                                 (MORE)
                                 MARK (CONT'D)
                             (beat)
                        And I think if they could, they’d 
                        all tell you the same thing. That 
                        what happened that night -- Was 
                        wrong. You deserved better than 
                        that.

           Mark’s apology may not be coming from every fan in Wrigley 
           right now, but it may as well be.

                                 STEVE
                        Don’t worry about it, Mark. It was 
                        just a game.

           Mark nods. 

           He knows Steve’s lying, but pretends not to.

                                 MARK
                        And hey, too bad we came up short 
                        this season -- But we’ve got a nice 
                        little squad lined up now, don’t 
                        you think? We could make a run next 
                        year for sure.

                                 STEVE
                        Yeah... I’ve got a good feeling 
                        about next year.

                                 MARK
                        You always do... That’s why places 
                        like this wouldn’t exist without 
                        fans like you.

           The guys share a small smile. 

           Their mutual hope serving as an unbreakable bond.

                                 MARK
                        Anyways, it was great to run into 
                        you. I hope we see you back here 
                        again soon.

                                 STEVE
                        Thanks. Me too.

           And with that, the guys share a brief hug, a wave, and go 
           their separate ways once again.

           Steve exhales... 

           Finally feeling whole again as he exits the stadium.

           But just before he walks out, his eyes land on one last thing--
           A CONCESSIONS STAND.

           Packing up. Just about to close. 

           But still radiating with the warm aroma of...

           FUNNEL CAKES.

           Steve smiles and heads towards the stand, not ready to leave 
           Wrigley quite yet, as we...

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           THE OLD LITTLE LEAGUE FIELD

           The one adjacent to Steve’s old house in Lincolnshire -- Where 
           he used to coach his team of Little Leaguers, The Renegades.

           It’s bright and early the next morning, when we find Steve 
           exiting the house he once shared with his father -- Now home 
           to his sister Molly, Jacob, and their son, Dennis.

           Steve walks to his car and gives Molly a hug goodbye, then 
           hugs Jacob and Dennis.

                                 STEVE
                        I’ll see you guys soon. 

                                 MOLLY
                        How soon?

           Steve gets in the car and looks up at his sister. Bringing a 
           long overdue smile to her face.

                                 STEVE
                        You won’t even know I’m gone this 
                        time.

           With that, Steve waves goodbye and hits the road.

           As he goes, he looks down at the passenger seat next to him.

           TWO FUNNEL CAKES sit covered in saran wrap. Ready to make the 
           trip back home with him.

           STEVE’S CAR

           It’s HOURS LATER now and the sun is just starting to set.

           The radio’s on -- The call for the final Cubs game of the 
           season fills the air.
                                 CUBS RADIO ANNOUNCER (OVER RADIO)
                        ...So here we are, the ninth inning 
                        of game number one-sixty-two, and 
                        our Cubs need just three outs to 
                        end this season with a win...

           Steve breathes easy, steering back down some familiar streets.

                                 CUBS RADIO ANNOUNCER (OVER RADIO)
                        A cynic might call it a meaningless 
                        victory -- But I’ve never met a 
                        Cubs fan in my life foolish enough 
                        to call any victory meaningless...

           INT. ANNIE’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           Annie sits alone on her couch, watching the end of the Cubs 
           game in silence.

           The Cardinals batter swings and misses for out number one, 
           just as Annie hears a KNOCK at her door.

           She gets up and answers. 

           It’s Steve. Holding the plate of funnel cakes.

                                 STEVE
                        Hey.

                                 ANNIE
                        Hi.

           She glances down at the funnel cakes. Then back at Steve.

                                 ANNIE
                        Where’d you go the other night?

           Steve breathes in and out. Finally so happy to say:

                                 STEVE
                        I went home.

           ANNIE’S COUCH

           Steve and Annie sit side-by-side, sharing the funnel cakes, 
           watching the last few pitches of the Cubs’ season.

                                 ANNIE
                             (mouth full)
                        Not bad. Little chewy, but decent.
                                 STEVE
                        Yeah. Sugar-coated fried dough 
                        isn’t really made to hold up well 
                        the next day, but...
                             (takes another bite)
                        They’re great at the ballpark 
                        though.

                                 ANNIE
                        Yeah? Well, maybe we’ll go sometime.

           Steve smiles and nods.

                                 STEVE
                        Can’t wait.

           Annie smiles back and they turn to the TV -- Where a lazy POP 
           FLY to right field sends the Cardinals down in order.

           The Cubs high-five and line up to congratulate each other on 
           the win.

                                 CUBS GAME ANNOUNCER (ON TV)
                        And that’s gonna close the book on 
                        another season of Cubs baseball, 
                        folks. I hope you enjoyed sharing 
                        it with us as much as we enjoyed 
                        sharing it with you...

           The Wrigley crowd STANDS UP and APPLAUDS as the Cubs leave 
           the field. 

           Proud of their team. No matter what.

                                 CUBS GAME ANNOUNCER (ON TV)
                        I know this year ended a little 
                        sooner than we all hoped, just like 
                        they all have since back in good 
                        ol’ 1908. But if you’re feeling a 
                        little blue right now, guess what? 
                        I’ve got good news for you...

           Steve looks back at Annie. She holds his hand. 

           He holds hers right back. Never more hopeful than now.

                                 CUBS GAME ANNOUNCER (ON TV)
                        There’s always next year.

                                                              FADE OUT.

                                 THE END
