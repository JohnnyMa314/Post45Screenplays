           Super: SALEM 

           INT. PURITAN HOME - MORNING

           CLOSE ON the laces of a Sunday dress being yanked tight.  The 
           little girl inside squirms, uncomfortable.   

                                 ANNA’S MOTHER (O.S.)
                        Hold still, child. 

           The girl’s MOTHER, a tired woman older than her years, spins 
           her around for a final inspection.    

           Her FATHER, a rugged man in an ill-fitting suit, waits 
           impatiently by the door.  

           As the girl’s bonnet is hastily tied, we get a good look at 
           her: a quiet countenance, with doll-like features and deep 
           blue eyes.  This is ANNA (9). 

           Her mother licks her thumb, smudges dirt from Anna’s face.     

                                 ANNA’S MOTHER (CONT’D)
                        Well, it’ll have to do.  We’re late 
                        enough, aren’t we?   

           Her Father opens the door, and as the church bell rings once 
           more, Anna is pulled out into --   

           EXT. SALEM VILLAGE - MORNING - CONTINUOUS

           -- Salem Village, a scattering of rustic colonial houses 
           honeycombed by winding dirt roads.  It’s a particularly raw 
           morning, gray clouds casting a bleak shadow over the town.              

           As they walk, we hear a preacher’s sermon:

                                 REVEREND PARRIS (V.O.)
                        A reading from Psalm Fifty-Eight: 
                        The wicked go astray from the womb, 
                        and err from birth, speaking lies. 

           Our family rushes through the eerily empty TOWN SQUARE...  
                                 REVEREND PARRIS (V.O.)
                        The righteous will rejoice when 
                        they see vengeance done, and will 
                        bathe in the blood of the wicked.      

           A TALL WHITE CHURCH stands before them.  They compose 
           themselves as they approach, but surprisingly -- 

           -- they walk right past.  We see through the church windows. 
           Not a soul inside.  

           EXT. SALEM VILLAGE - GALLOWS HILL - MORNING

           On the far edge of town, we finally see our preacher. Stern-
           faced, speaking with conviction. Open bible in his hands, 
           WOODEN CROSS hanging from his neck. 

           This is REVEREND PARRIS (50s). 

                                 REVEREND PARRIS
                        And there shall be divine reward 
                        for the righteous, who carry out 
                        God’s judgment here on Earth. 

           PULL BACK TO REVEAL: he is standing on a SCAFFOLD, flanked by 
           three accused “WITCHES”. This is no sermon... it’s a hanging.   

           A venomous CROWD stands before them.  At the rear, Anna and 
           her parents are the last to join.  Anna takes in the scene.       

           Reverend Parris closes his bible. Gives a solemn nod to the 
           edge of the gallows, where a LAWMAN hatefully strings a NOOSE 
           around each woman’s neck. Parris continues:

                                 REVEREND PARRIS (CONT’D)
                        And now, the Lord’s prayer.

           Anna’s parents pull her to the front of the crowd.

           OFF HER EYES, witnessing her village’s capacity for evil -- 

                                 REVEREND PARRIS (CONT’D)
                        Our Father, who art in Heaven, 
                        hallowed be thy name... 

           The crowd RUMBLES with vitriol: “Witches!” “Heathens!” etc.

           The First Witch trembles in tears. 

                                 REVEREND PARRIS (CONT’D)
                        Thy kingdom come. Thy will be done. 
                        On Earth as it is in Heaven.
           The Third Witch spots Anna in the crowd. The two lock eyes, 
           and Anna stands frozen.     

                                 REVEREND PARRIS (CONT’D)
                        Lead us not into temptation, but 
                        deliver us from evil...   

           A burlap hood is placed over the First Witch’s head, then 
           onto the Second’s. 

                                 REVEREND PARRIS (CONT’D)
                        For the kingdom, the power and the 
                        glory are yours...

           The Lawman approaches the Third Witch, who never breaks her 
           stare from Anna. Then, with force, she is hooded as well.            

                                 REVEREND PARRIS (CONT’D)
                        ...now and forever. Amen. 

           With a final nod from Parris, the Lawman pulls a switch.         

           SNAP!  The women drop through to their fate. There’s a 
           strange silence among the onlookers.          

           CLOSE ON: Anna’s eyes.  Unblinking.  Unforgetting.                 

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:

           The same eyes, only now they’re the somber eyes of a 
           beautiful young woman (mid-20s).  This is ANNA, grown up.          

           INT. ANNA’S INN - ANNA’S ROOM - DAY

           From the upper room of her modest inn, she stares out the 
           window to the adjacent harbor, lost in thought.     

           Her rocking chair sways softly. 

           Super: Fifteen Years Later. 

                                 DR. GRIGGS (O.S.)
                        Anna?

           Across the room, rifling through his medical bag, is DR. 
           WILLIAM GRIGGS (60s), a naturally cranky man who softens up 
           in Anna’s presence.     

           He waits for an answer like he’s said her name twice already. 

                                 ANNA 
                           (snapping out of it)
                        I’m sorry. What did you say? 
                                 DR. GRIGGS
                        I asked when your husband was 
                        returning? 

           Anna turns, and we notice that she is visibly PREGNANT. 

                                 ANNA
                        Um. Four months. First week of 
                        March.

                                 DR. GRIGGS
                        The inn’s been rather empty with 
                        him away, hasn’t it?

                                 ANNA
                        Indeed. I’ve only had one visitor 
                        since Daniel’s been gone at sea. 
                        Though I’m expecting a new guest 
                        shortly. 

           As she moves from the window, she winces in pain.

                                 DR. GRIGGS
                           (steadying her)
                        Here. 

           Dr. Griggs produces a SMALL BOTTLE OF ELIXIR.   

                                 DR. GRIGGS (CONT’D)
                           (with a warm tone)
                        The discomfort is entirely normal. 
                        Drink this if you become unsettled.

                                 ANNA
                        Thank you, Dr. Griggs.

                                 DR. GRIGGS
                           (then, approaching a 
                           delicate subject)
                        As for the dreams... What exactly 
                        do you see?

           A beat as Anna searches for the best way to describe them.

                                 ANNA
                        It’s the same every time. A 
                        stranger stands in the shadows of 
                        my bedroom, watching me as I sleep. 
                        I think it’s Daniel, but when I say 
                        his name, he doesn’t respond. 

                                 DR. GRIGGS
                        And then what?
           Anna looks down, a shameful look on her face. There’s more to 
           say, but...

                                 ANNA
                        Nothing. I just... wake up. 

                                 DR. GRIGGS
                           (assuring)
                        Probably just a matter of nerves. 

           Dr. Griggs buckles his bag and grabs his coat to leave.

                                 ANNA
                        May I follow you out? I was 
                        actually going to walk to the 
                        market if you think I’m still able. 

                                 DR. GRIGGS
                        I think a walk and some fresh air 
                        would do you good. 

           Off her polite smile -- 

                                                           CUT TO:

           EXT. SALEM VILLAGE - DAY

           Outside, Dr. Griggs exits Anna’s Inn and heads off into the 
           unseasonably warm winter day. Anna takes in a breath, 
           tightens her cloak, and goes the opposite direction.   

           As she walks through town, we notice a different Salem than 
           the one we first saw. The winter sun bathes the square in 
           warm light. New houses line clean roads as VILLAGERS bustle 
           about. Sailors work the docks in high spirits. It looks more 
           like the promising port city it once intended to be.  

           Anna stops a moment to take it all in, her gaze drifting 
           toward the sea, almost longingly, before she continues on. 

                                                           CUT TO:

           EXT. SALEM VILLAGE - HUBBARD HOUSE - SAME TIME

           Amid the seeming cheeriness of the town, we see Dr. Griggs 
           walk down an isolated road to a lone house, sitting somewhat 
           grimly on its property.  

           Dr. Griggs approaches, noticing a pair of WOODEN CROSSES and 
           FLOWERS placed against the front door. Like a gravestone. 

                                                          BACK TO:
           EXT. SALEM VILLAGE - TOWN SQUARE - SAME TIME

           Anna walks through the town square, past children playing, a 
           blacksmith working his fire, people milling cheerfully. 

           She stops outside the BAKERY, nodding a familiar hello to the 
           BAKER. 

                                 BAKER
                        Good morning, Goody Downing.  
                           (re: her belly)
                        How much longer?

                                 ANNA
                        Any week now, I’m told.   

                                 BAKER
                        Ah, Praise the Lord. 

                                 ANNA
                        Yes. Praise the Lord. 

           There’s a slight unease in her smile. Perhaps the absence of 
           her husband. Perhaps just good old Puritan caution.  

                                 BAKER
                        Here you are... 

           As the Baker turns to ready her basket for her, Anna notices 
           a MOTHER with a BABY and two children. 

           The BABY cries loudly as the mother shushes and rocks her 
           gently. Anna looks on like any expecting mother, half 
           adoring, half preparing.  

           CLOSE ON the baby, crying louder and squirming until the 
           sounds of her cries are replaced by --  

           INT. HUBBARD HOUSE - BEDROOM - DAY

           -- the JARRING SCREAM of a YOUNG WOMAN writhing violently 
           atop a bed in a curtain-darkened room.     

           (We’ll meet her properly soon enough.) 

           Her face is almost entirely hidden by a mess of hair, but as 
           she winces in pain, we see her teeth, stained with blood. 

           She BABBLES an indiscernible language. It’s frightening. 

                                 DR. GRIGGS 
                        Hold her down! 
           REVEAL Dr. Griggs by her side, accompanied by a frightened 
           CHAMBERMAID (50s) and a SLAVE WOMAN (30s) with cloth wrapped 
           tightly around her face, save for her eyes. 

           The Young Woman is already restrained at the arms and legs by 
           THICK ROPES, but her violent twisting tests them.   

           She MOANS once more, arching her back, as if burning.       
           Dr. Griggs readies a DRINK OF MEDICINE for her. 

                                 DR. GRIGGS (CONT’D)
                        Steady... 

           As the others hold her, he manages to pour the elixir into 
           her mouth, but she SPITS it back, returning to her chilling 
           foreign tongue. 

           We see her pale face, and her eyes rolling back in her head.

           Off this chaos, we move into --

           INT. HUBBARD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME

           -- the main room of the cabin, where the screams are barely 
           muffled. Shades drawn just as tightly. 

           THREE MEN stand by the fireplace, arguing intently about the 
           situation in the next room.

           JUDGE MORROW (60s), a wise man, aged with worry, paces. 

                                 JUDGE MORROW
                        God help her. She’s getting worse. 

           Across from him stands CONSTABLE WALKER (40s), a stout and 
           naturally disagreeable man.           

                                 CONSTABLE WALKER
                        Dr. Griggs has done everything 
                        humanly possible.

                                 JUDGE MORROW
                        It’s not enough. I’ve found someone 
                        who can help. A specialist. 

                                 CONSTABLE WALKER
                        A specialist? In curses? 
                        Possessions?

                                 JUDGE MORROW
                        And other things. Yes. 
                                  Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

           Finally speaking up is REVEREND PARRIS (now 60s). We 
           recognize him as the preacher from our opening scene. He’s 
           only grown more dour with time.

                                 REVEREND PARRIS
                        What if this truly is the Devil’s 
                        work? A specialist won’t save us 
                        then. 

           Morrow looks to the next room. The screaming has subsided now 
           as Dr. Griggs and the Chambermaid hush the Young Woman.   

                                 JUDGE MORROW
                        It’s too late. I summoned him two 
                        days ago, he’s already on his way. 

           This is news to the others. They share a look, frustrated 
           that he’s not consulted them in his decision.

                                                           CUT TO:

           The WOODEN SPOKES of a carriage wheel, spinning hastily. 

           EXT. WOODED ROAD / INT. CARRIAGE - DAY

           We’re traveling with a one-horse carriage, plush and ornate, 
           as it rolls through an isolated wooded road, heading for a 
           town in the distance. 

           INT. ANNA’S INN - GUEST ROOM - LATER

           Anna fluffs the pillows on a bed when she hears a commotion 
           outside. Looking out her window, she notices a small CROWD 
           has gathered, and heads downstairs.     

           The carriage has arrived.  

           EXT. ANNA’S INN - DAY

           The door opens and out steps a man with well-tailored clothes 
           and a crisp three-point hat. He’s handsome, with sharp 
           features and kind eyes that seem to take in everything.   

           This is DR. ROBERT CURTIN (30s). 

           Anna, as owner of the inn, goes to introduce herself. 

                                 ANNA
                        Good day, sir. I’m Anna Downing. 
                        You must be my new guest.  
           Curtin removes his hat, charmed. 

                                 CURTIN
                        Ah, so I’m in the right place. Dr. 
                        Robert Curtin. Pleased to meet  
                        you. I was told to find the inn by 
                        the harbor and await instructions 
                        from Judge Morrow.    

                                 ANNA
                        Well, here, let me help you with 
                        your bag.

                                 CURTIN
                           (having noticed her 
                           pregnant belly)
                        Oh, please, no, I insist.

           From the gathering crowd of curious onlookers, a young boy, 
           THOMAS (9), approaches. 

           Seeing Curtin up close, wide-eyed, he turns to his FATHER. 

                                 THOMAS
                        What’s on his hand, Poppa?

                                 THOMAS’S FATHER
                           (firm, embarrassed)
                        Hush, boy.

           But Curtin looks to the father, amused. 

                                 CURTIN
                        No, it’s quite all right. 

           He kneels down to Thomas’s level, extends his hand. We notice 
           a DISTINCTIVE MARKING on the back of it: 

           A CIRCULAR TATTOO, resembling a three-pronged coil. 

                                 CURTIN (CONT’D)
                           (to Thomas)
                        It’s from my time spent in 
                        Barbados. Do you know of Barbados?

           Thomas shakes his head. 

                                 CURTIN (CONT’D)
                        It’s an island, far away from here. 
                        To the natives, this mark is a sign 
                        of honor.    

                                 THOMAS
                        Are you an explorer?  
           Curtin smiles at the boy’s fascination.  

                                 CURTIN
                        I’m not sure I’d call myself that. 
                        But I’ve been to a lot of places.  
                           (then)
                        Tell you what... 

           Curtin opens his UTILITY BAG, produces a small NAUTICAL 
           SPYGLASS.  

                                 CURTIN (CONT’D)
                        Here. So you may explore as well.   

           He hands the spyglass to Thomas, who runs off, excited.  

           The Father gives a stern look to Curtin before following. 

           Before we can dwell on it:  

                                 JUDGE MORROW (O.S.)
                        Doctor Curtin. 

           Anna turns to see Judge Morrow approaching. Constable Walker 
           and a hesitant Reverend Parris follow behind.

                                 JUDGE MORROW (CONT’D)
                        Judge William Morrow. So glad you 
                        could make it. We can’t thank you 
                        enough.  

                                 CURTIN
                           (shaking hands)
                        Happy to be of service. 

           Judge Morrow looks at the gathering crowd, wishing this were 
           more discreet. 

                                 JUDGE MORROW
                        I trust you had a pleasant journey. 

                                 CURTIN
                        Indeed. It’s beautiful up here. 
                        Some of the trees still have their 
                        autumn leaves.

                                 JUDGE MORROW
                        Allow me to introduce Constable 
                        Walker, and Reverend Parris. 

           Nods from the two. Pleasant enough, but skeptical. 
                                 JUDGE MORROW (CONT’D)
                        And I see you’ve already met our 
                        wonderful Anna.     

                                 CURTIN
                        Yes, she was just welcoming me. 

                                 JUDGE MORROW
                           (warmly)
                        Very good. 
                           (loud enough for the CROWD 
                           to hear)
                        Dr. Curtin is touring the colonies 
                        to share medical knowledge from 
                        London. 

           He looks around, not used to fabricating cover stories. 

                                 JUDGE MORROW (CONT’D)
                           (then, quietly, to Curtin)
                        Well, then. If you aren’t too 
                        tired, perhaps I could fill you in 
                        before you get settled.  

                                 ANNA
                           (excusing herself)
                        Your room will be ready by the time 
                        you return, Doctor. 

           As Judge Morrow leads Curtin away, Curtin smiles back to 
           Anna. The crowd watches them go, intrigued. 

                                                           CUT TO:

           EXT. SALEM VILLAGE - MOMENTS LATER - CONTINUOUS

           Alone now, Curtin and Judge Morrow walk along a quiet stretch 
           of town. Losing the pleasant formalities, Judge Morrow shifts 
           to a more serious tone. 

                                 JUDGE MORROW
                        You come highly recommended by my 
                        associates in Boston. School of 
                        Oxford. Royal Society of London. 
                        And I understand you quelled the 
                        Witch Hunt in King’s Lynn?        

                                 CURTIN
                        I offered scientific and medical 
                        assistance to the law, yes. There 
                        were certain ‘phenomena’ occurring.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 CURTIN (CONT'D)
                        Men and women were blamed for 
                        witchcraft. I simply provided an 
                        alternative explanation.           

                                 JUDGE MORROW
                        Yes. Well. That’s precisely why I 
                        requested your visit. And you 
                        couldn’t have come soon enough. I 
                        fear her condition is 
                        deteriorating.  

                                 CURTIN
                        The young woman... 

                                 JUDGE MORROW
                        Betty Hubbard. She’s under Dr. 
                        Griggs’ care. Our town physician.      
                           (then)
                        We’ve had our share of sicknesses, 
                        Doctor, and fevers. But nothing 
                        like the one that afflicts poor 
                        Betty, bless her soul. 
                           (thinking how to phrase)
                        As I’m sure you are aware, we have 
                        a rather delicate history in Salem. 

                                 CURTIN
                           (understanding)
                        The Trials... 

                                 JUDGE MORROW
                        Those days are behind us now. Look 
                        around: Salem is strong. Our church 
                        is strong. 
                           (then)
                        But I fear if our people find out 
                        about Miss Hubbard, they might 
                        start blaming something sinister... 
                        Or worse, each other. 

                                 CURTIN
                        I understand. 

                                 JUDGE MORROW
                        Dr. Griggs may object, but he’s 
                        been asked to assist you in any 
                        way. God help you find a cure for 
                        her. At the very least, a rational 
                        explanation.

           Curtin nods. There’s a sad desperation in Morrow’s eyes. 
                                 JUDGE MORROW (CONT’D)
                        But for now, you’d like get to 
                        settled, I’m sure...

                                 CURTIN
                        Actually, if it’s all right, may I 
                        see Miss Hubbard now? 

           Curtin is here for a reason.  Straight to work.  

                                                           CUT TO:

           EXT. HUBBARD HOUSE - AFTERNOON

           As daylight disappears, Curtin follows Morrow up the walkway 
           of a small grim-looking home, preparing himself for what he’s 
           about to see. Thick drapes block the windows.   

           But as they make their way closer -- they’re startled by LOUD 
           BARKING! A PAIR OF HUNTING DOGS, roped at the neck, lunge 
           viciously at them from the next yard.

           SNAP! They’re reined back by their leashes, and simmer to a 
           low growl. Curtin, unfazed, follows Morrow to the door. After 
           a moment, it opens, and they are greeted by Dr. Griggs.  

                                 DR. GRIGGS
                           (to Judge Morrow, softly)
                        Come.  She’s resting now. 

           Griggs guardedly eyes Curtin as they are let in to --

           INT. HUBBARD HOUSE - MAIN ROOM - AFTERNOON

           -- the main room, a dim, small space with a dying fire.      

           The two people we saw earlier stand to greet them. The 
           CHAMBERMAID, wearing a worried expression. The SLAVE WOMAN, 
           face wrapped in cloth.              

           But this time, they are joined by MERCER (30), a hulking 
           tower of a man, strong-jawed with a fierce brow. The 
           archetype of a pious Puritan farmer.                

                                 JUDGE MORROW
                        Dr. Curtin, this is John Mercer, 
                        betrothed to Miss Hubbard.           

                                 CURTIN
                           (offering a hand)
                        Mr. Mercer. Sorry to meet under 
                        such circumstance.    
           Mercer reluctantly shakes Curtin’s hand, but says nothing.            

                                 JUDGE MORROW
                           (off the awkward silence)
                        And this is Doctor Griggs.

           Griggs isn’t thrilled either, but puts on a nicer face. 

                                 DR. GRIGGS
                        Pleasure.

                                 CURTIN
                        Likewise. I understand Miss Hubbard 
                        has been in your care. What seem to 
                        be her symptoms? 

                                 MERCER
                           (jumping in, impatient)
                        She doesn’t need this blasphemy. 
                        She needs prayer! This is a 
                        possession.  

                                 DR. GRIGGS
                           (to Curtin)
                        This affliction, Doctor, is quite 
                        profound. Beyond anything I’ve 
                        witnessed before. Tremors. Fevers. 
                        Bleeding from the eyes and ears. 
                        Speaking in tongues...                                

                                 JUDGE MORROW
                        You can see why this is such a... 
                        delicate matter for us--   

                                 DR. GRIGGS
                        And violent spells. Frightful fits 
                        of aggression. We’ve managed to 
                        restrain her, but before you enter, 
                        I should warn you. She did this to 
                        poor Ebetha.     

           Griggs gestures the Slave Woman over to them and slowly 
           unwraps the cloth around her face. 

           As the final layer is pulled away, we’re startled by the 
           sight of a hideously mangled face beneath. Clawed flesh, 
           poorly healed. Curtin, however, keeps his composure.    

                                 CURTIN
                        I heed your warning. Respectfully. 
                           (then, ultimately)
                        Shall we?
           INT. HUBBARD HOUSE - BEDROOM - AFTERNOON

           A door slowly creaks open in a colorless bedroom, brightened 
           by the final throes of sunlight outside.    

           As Griggs leads Curtin and the group inside, we hear the 
           sound of STEADY BREATHING. Slightly labored.   

           Reveal: BETTY HUBBARD (mid-20s), the young woman from 
           earlier, lying flat in bed, eyes closed, face pale. 
           Restrained by THICK ROPES.  

           Curtin approaches calmly. When he turns back, he realizes 
           none of the others will come as close.  

           Still unfazed, he leans over to inspect her. Her shallow 
           breathing, the only thing breaking the silence. 

                                 CURTIN
                        How long has she been sleeping? 

                                 CHAMBERMAID
                        It’s not so much sleep, sir... 

                                 DR. GRIGGS
                        She lies still. As if under a 
                        spell. Can’t seem to hear us, 
                        either. 

           Curtin puts a palm to her forehead, checking for a fever.  

           He produces a small MAGNIFYING GLASS chained to his coat. The 
           others look at the foreign object suspiciously. 

           Then, he pulls her eyelids up one at a time to reveal 
           bloodshot eyes underneath. The others watch with trepidation.       

                                 CHAMBERMAID
                        Doctor, I wouldn’t... 

           No use. Curtin leans mere inches away from Betty. He gently 
           tilts her head from side to side, examining further.

           The others are forgetting to breathe. 

           Then, Curtin leans in even closer, slowly peeling her lips 
           and exposing her teeth to find raw, bloody gums. We hold for 
           a tense, dreadful beat, ready for anything... Until finally -- 

           He pockets his magnifying glass, turns to the others. 

                                 CURTIN
                        Those hounds outside. Did she come 
                        into contact with them? 
                                 DR. GRIGGS
                        Couldn’t say. Why? 

                                 CURTIN
                        Is she taking down water? 

                                 CHAMBERMAID
                        Not easily, no. 

                                 CURTIN
                        Hm. It’s possible she could be 
                        rabid. Or showing early signs of 
                        Yellow Fever. 

           The others trade looks.

                                 DR. GRIGGS
                        Rabid? 

                                 MERCER
                           (offended)
                        Sick like some dog? 

                                 DR. GRIGGS
                        I hope you don’t think us fools, 
                        Dr. Curtin. I’ve treated rabies. 
                        That is not what this poor girl is 
                        suffering from. 

                                 CHAMBERMAID (O.S.)
                        Come when she’s awake. 

           Dr. Griggs turns. Everyone goes quiet.  

                                 CHAMBERMAID (CONT’D)
                           (intently)
                        You’ll see for yourself. Come when 
                        she’s awake. 

           Curtin studies the serious faces in the room.

           EXT. HUBBARD HOUSE - EVENING - LATE

           Curtin walks quietly with Judge Morrow, leaving the tension 
           in the Hubbard house behind him.   

                                 CURTIN
                        You say she works on a farm? 

                                 JUDGE MORROW
                        Mr. Cooke’s farm. On the far end of 
                        town.   
                                  Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 CURTIN
                        I’d like to go there in the morning 
                        if I could. Maybe we could find the 
                        source of her illness.    

                                 JUDGE MORROW
                        Of course.
                           (then, after a beat)
                        Thank you, Doctor. 

           Curtin nods, seeing a sliver of hope in Morrow’s eyes. 

                                                           CUT TO:

           EXT. ANNA’S INN - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

           A room glows with firelight on the second floor of the inn. 

                                 ANNA (O.S., PRE-LAP) 
                        I gave you the room at the end. 

           INT. ANNA’S INN - HALLWAY / CURTIN’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Anna walks Curtin through the dim halls of the inn, opening a 
           door to reveal a cozy room with a fire already burning. 

                                 ANNA
                        It has the nicest fireplace, and 
                        it’s quiet, with room to work. Hope 
                        it suits you fine.    

                                 CURTIN
                        More than fine. Thank you. It’s 
                        truly a lovely inn you have. 

                                 ANNA
                        I try to keep it in order while my 
                        husband is away at sea. 

           She goes to stoke the fire, straining a bit to bend. 

                                 CURTIN
                        Allow me.  

           He takes the fire poker. 

                                 CURTIN (CONT’D)
                        You shouldn’t strain yourself.
                           (beat)
                        How long has he been gone?
                                 ANNA
                        Too long. Long enough not to know 
                        that his little one’s on the way.

                                 CURTIN
                        Well, he’ll have quite the 
                        wonderful surprise to come home to. 

           They share a pleasant silence. Then -- 

                                 ANNA
                        Judge Morrow says you traveled here 
                        from London?

                                 CURTIN
                        Well, my practice is in London, but 
                        I was working just over in Boston 
                        when he summoned me. Have you been? 
                        To London, I mean?        

                                 ANNA
                        Oh. Sadly, it’s my husband who gets 
                        the adventure of travel. If it 
                        weren’t for his stories, I’m afraid 
                        my world would stop at this inn. 
                        Perhaps one day... 

           He smiles politely.  There’s something refreshing about her 
           innocence. 

                                 CURTIN
                        Well, if it makes you feel better, 
                        know that every traveler dreams of 
                        nothing but home.  

           Anna studies him for a beat.  His clothes.  His features.   
           The mark on his hand. Everything about him, so... intriguing.     

                                 ANNA
                        Right. Well. Goodnight, Doctor. 

                                 CURTIN
                        Good night, Miss Downing. 

           INT. ANNA’S INN - UPSTAIRS - NIGHT

           Anna closes his door and heads down the hall to her bedroom. 
           Before entering, we hold as she looks back toward Curtin’s 
           room. Enchanted. 

                                                           CUT TO:
           EXT. SALEM VILLAGE - ESTABLISHING - EARLY MORNING

           A cloudy winter morning. Bells ring from the harbor.    

           INT. ANNA’S INN - CURTIN’S ROOM - SAME TIME

           At the light of first dawn, Curtin finishes his notes, closes 
           his ledger. Clearly been working all night. 

           He rises to leave, grabbing his UTILITY BAG on a chair. We 
           notice an “Oxford” insignia on its side. 

           EXT. SALEM VILLAGE - MOMENTS LATER

           No sooner does Curtin exit the inn than --

                                 EDWARD (O.S.)
                        Doctor Curtin? 

           He turns to find an energetic young man, no older than 
           sixteen, rushing to his side.  This is EDWARD.

                                 EDWARD (CONT’D)
                        Doctor Curtin, my name is Edward.  
                        I’ve been sent by Judge Morrow to 
                        assist you. 

                                 CURTIN
                           (not what he expected)
                        Is that right?    

                                 EDWARD
                           (cheerily confessing)
                        I volunteered actually. You’re 
                        headed to Mr. Cooke’s farm, right? 
                        He said you’d need a guide.           

           He takes off walking. Curtin follows curiously.  

                                 CURTIN
                        Right. Of course. Sorry, I just 
                        didn’t expect you to be so-- 

                                 EDWARD
                        Young? I’m almost sixteen, sir.  
                        And I’ve got schooling, too.    

                                 CURTIN
                        I was going to say ‘excited.’ 
                                 EDWARD
                        But it is exciting, sir. A man of 
                        proper science coming to our town. 
                           (with a juvenile grin)
                        Trying to make sense of the great 
                        big curse. 

                                 CURTIN
                        Curse?  

                                 EDWARD
                        You’re caring for Betty Hubbard, 
                        right? They say she’s sick. But 
                        some people have heard things from 
                        what I gather. In the night. 
                        Screaming and the like. Say there’s 
                        a curse coming back on Salem.    
                           (but then)
                        Rubbish, though, if you asked me. 

                                 CURTIN
                        Why? Don’t you believe in curses?

                                 EDWARD
                        My father would strike me for 
                        saying so, but I’m not exactly like 
                        everyone else around here. I want 
                        to be a man of science. Travel the 
                        world. Like you.

           As brash as Edward is, Curtin can’t help but like him.  

           They stop a moment, reaching the TOWN SQUARE. 

                                 CURTIN
                        Well then, I’d say I couldn’t find 
                        a more suitable assistant.       

                                 EDWARD
                           (beaming)
                        Right, sir.  
                           (then)
                        Anyway, Mr. Cooke’s farm is less 
                        than a mile from--

           He notices Curtin is distracted, staring off.

                                 EDWARD (CONT’D)
                        Sir? 

                                 CURTIN
                        Who is that? 
                                 EDWARD
                           (looking around)
                        Who, sir? 

                                 CURTIN
                        That woman over there. She hasn’t 
                        stopped staring at me since we 
                        reached the square.  

           Curtin’s POV: a stoic young woman with a fierce gaze stares 
           back at him from across the square as people mill about.  

           This is ABIGAIL WILLIAMS (late 20s).         

                                 EDWARD
                           (dismissive)
                        Oh, don’t mind her, sir. That’s 
                        just Miss Abigail. ‘The Mad Widow.’ 
                        She lives alone up on the hill.          

           Abigail’s stare never breaks. It’s more than unsettling.  

                                 EDWARD (CONT’D)
                           (snapping him out of it)
                        Come. She’ll do you no harm. 

           As Curtin is led away, he glances back once more... 

           She’s still watching him.

                                                           CUT TO:

           EXT. COOKE’S FARM - ESTABLISHING - DAY

           A sprawling farm on which AILING LIVESTOCK bleat and moan. 

           Edward leads Curtin across the farm toward the BARN, where a 
           man leans over a WHIMPERING SHEEP DOG.   

                                 EDWARD
                        Mr. Cooke.  

           MR. COOKE (50s) stands and takes off his hat. He is a simple 
           and tired farmer with a defeated air.      

                                 MR. COOKE
                        They’re dying.  
                           (looking to the field)
                        More and more by the day.
                           (then, to Curtin)
                        They say you’re a specialist.  
                                 CURTIN
                        I believe I can be of service. 

           Mr. Cooke, like almost everyone else in Salem, sizes Curtin 
           up with that trademark incredulity.  

                                 MR. COOKE
                        Aye. Come, then. There’s something 
                        I should show you.   

           He leads them around the barn, where they run into a shy 
           young woman, equally simple but youthful with a rough beauty.   

           This is SUSANNAH SHELDON (mid-20s). 

                                 MR. COOKE (CONT’D)
                           (to Curtin)
                        Ah, this is my house girl, 
                        Susannah.
                           (To Susannah)
                        Susannah, Doctor... 

                                 CURTIN
                        Curtin.
                           (extending a hand)
                        Pleased. 

           Susannah doesn’t meet many new people. She’s bashfully quiet. 

                                 MR. COOKE
                        Join us, I was just about to show 
                        Dr. Curtin the barn.

           He nods for the others to follow him, pulling the barn door 
           wide.  But Susannah stands still, scared to enter. 

                                 MR. COOKE (CONT’D)
                           (forcefully)
                        Come now... 

           Taking a breath, she slowly follows them in.  

           INT. BARN - DAY

           Mr. Cooke leads them past several WORK TABLES and PILES OF 
           GRAIN to the corner of the barn.

                                 MR. COOKE
                        They come every year around this 
                        time. With the harvest. But this 
                        year, there are hundreds of them.         
                                 CURTIN
                        Hundreds of what? 

           They reach the corner, where Mr. Cooke pulls back a heavy 
           burlap blanket to reveal FOUR LARGE IRON CAGES...

           ...TEEMING WITH RATS. 

           They squeal and claw, climbing atop one another. The ones at 
           the bottom, clearly dead.             

                                 MR. COOKE
                        I burn them every week, but more 
                        keep coming. Like locusts. 

           Susannah takes a large step back. 

                                 SUSANNAH
                           (to Curtin and Edward)
                        Sorry. I’m just deathly afraid of 
                        those... things.        

                                 EDWARD
                           (just as shaken)
                        Not too fond of them myself. 

           Curtin looks to Cooke for an explanation. 

                                 MR. COOKE
                        Betty’s fallen ill. Now the animals 
                        are getting sick... 
                           (then)
                        They say the plague in Europe was 
                        caused by rats. Did you see much of 
                        the Black Death in London, Curtin?         

                                 CURTIN
                           (staring at the cages)
                        More than I’d have liked to. 

                                 MR. COOKE
                        Might this be what’s causing this 
                        affliction, sir? 

           Curtin thinks for a beat. Then, standing: 

                                 CURTIN
                        There’s only one way to tell.   
                           (then, to Cooke)
                        I’ll need to inspect the dead ones. 

           Off Cooke’s look -- 

                                                         TIME CUT:
           CLOSE ON a hand, grabbing a DEAD RAT from a PILE of several 
           others. As we pull back, we find Curtin sitting at a table, 
           his utility bag open, SURGICAL TOOLS laid out.  

           Curtin slices the rat down the center, quickly inspects it, 
           then tosses it like a peeled potato into a bucket on the 
           floor before grabbing another. 

           The others look on, stunned.  

                                 MR. COOKE
                        What is that you’re doing, Doctor?

                                 CURTIN
                           (never breaking rhythm)
                        There’s a school of anatomists, 
                        inspired by Da Vinci, who believe 
                        it important to inspect the inside 
                        of the body as well as the outside.             

           Susannah, pale as a ghost, puts a hand over her mouth.   

                                 CURTIN (CONT’D)
                           (readying another rat)
                        Sometimes the dead are able to 
                        provide answers for the living. 

           Curtin pokes the insides of a rat, lifting organs and pushing 
           away flayed skin. 

                                 CURTIN (CONT’D)
                           (slightly disappointed)
                        Strange. 

                                 MR. COOKE
                        What’s strange? 

                                 CURTIN
                           (puzzled)
                        These rats aren’t sick.  
                           (then, showing)
                        Look here. The lungs. If they’d 
                        been infected, they would be yellow 
                        and swollen.  

           Mr. Cooke leans closer.  

           CLOSE-UP: Curtin’s hand reaches into the mound of rats when --

           SCREEEECH!! A LARGE RAT suddenly jumps from the presumably 
           dead pile! It startles everyone, including Curtin, charging 
           across the table until --    

           SLAM! Mr. Cooke stabs it to the table with a LARGE KNIFE.
           And with that, Susannah is finished. 

                                 SUSANNAH
                        Excuse me. 

           She rushes off, nearly vomiting. Curtin recovers from the 
           scare quickly. Edward doesn’t, looking even more queasy. 

                                 CURTIN
                           (rising)
                        But there must be an explanation. 

           He paces over to the CAGES, staring at them for a long beat,   
           when something else catches his eye... 

                                 CURTIN (CONT’D)
                        That barley over there. 

           Cooke turns to the LARGE PILE OF GRAIN along the wall. 

                                 CURTIN (CONT’D)
                        Is that what you’ve been feeding 
                        the animals?  

                                 MR. COOKE
                        Aye, sir. And we sell to the baker 
                        as well. 

           Curtin kneels to see that MOLD has formed on the damp pile. 

                                 CURTIN
                        Well, this might be your first 
                        problem, Mr. Cooke. Rancid grain 
                        can cause many illnesses, including 
                        dementia. Illnesses that can 
                        spread. I’ll have to consult my 
                        research, but this could be a 
                        factor in Miss Hubbard’s sickness.     
                           (then, standing)
                        Tell me, do you wash your hands 
                        before eating meals? 

           Cooke just stares at him, confused. 

                                 CURTIN (CONT’D)
                        You know, in Europe, the Hebrews 
                        have been accused of starting the 
                        Black Death, because while everyone 
                        around them fell ill and spread 
                        their disease, the Hebrews stayed 
                        healthy. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 CURTIN (CONT’D)
                        Turns out, it wasn’t any curse or 
                        black magic, but simply the fact 
                        that their tradition made them 
                        cleanse their hands before every 
                        meal. See, the cleanliness and 
                        resistance go hand in hand.    

                                 MR. COOKE
                        Still sounds like a curse to me. 

                                 CURTIN
                        Just science.  
                           (adding)
                        Try it for yourself. I suspect 
                        you’ll see a difference. If I’m 
                        wrong, you’ve lost only the dirt on 
                        your hands.  

           Curtin smiles, grabs his bag, and exits. Edward follows, more 
           than impressed. 

           Off Cooke, confused and suspicious -- 

           EXT. COOKE’S FARM - MOMENTS LATER

           At far end of the farm, Curtin and Edward pass Susannah 
           again, hanging laundry. Curtin tips his hat.    

           As they reach the main road, they turn to see THICK BLACK 
           SMOKE rising beyond the barn.   

           POV: In the distance, Mr. Cooke empties a CAGE OF RATS onto a 
           SMOLDERING FIRE. He looks back for a moment, then slowly 
           drags the cage inside.  

                                                           CUT TO:

           CLOSE UP: Pages of an old ANATOMY BOOK are thumbed through. 
           GRISLY ILLUSTRATIONS of people with various diseases. 

           INT. ANNA’S INN - PARLOR - DAY

           At the parlor of the inn, Curtin sits at a table, several 
           books splayed out before him. He looks intently for something 
           specific.

           Edward reads a similar book nearby, fascinated by the 
           dreadful images. A beat, then:

                                 CURTIN
                        Discourse on Disease. 
                                 EDWARD
                        Sir? 

                                 CURTIN
                           (tapping his book)
                        Has a spine like this. Top shelf.

                                 EDWARD
                           (getting it)
                        Yes, sir.

           Edward scoots from his chair, heads upstairs as Anna enters 
           the parlor, placing FOOD on the table.

                                 ANNA
                        Can I get you anything else?

                                 CURTIN
                        I don’t have much of an appetite 
                        when I’m doing my work.

           She spots a hideous image of a malnourished woman on the 
           page. 

                                 ANNA
                        Nor would I, I suppose. 

           Curtin flips the page from her view, apologetically. Goes 
           back to reading...  

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        It’s about Betty, isn’t it? 

                                 CURTIN
                           (coming upon something)
                        Just a moment. 

           Anna goes silent as Curtin stops on an image of HUMAN 
           INTESTINES. He studies it a moment, before closing the book.

                                 CURTIN (CONT’D)
                        I’m afraid we must be on our way, 
                        Miss Downing. I do apologize. 
                           (then, calling out)
                        Edward? 

           EXT. ANNA’S INN - CURTIN’S ROOM - SAME TIME

           We find Edward in Curtin’s Room. He pulls open drawers, 
           checks shelves, searching for something -- even with Curtin’s 
           book already under his arm. Odd...
           Finally, he moves to leave, but something catches his eye on 
           the way out -- Curtin’s UTILITY BAG. He starts to rifle 
           through it, sifting through objects we can’t see, when -- 

                                 CURTIN (O.S.)
                        Looking for something else?

           Startled, Edward spins to find Curtin in the doorway. 

                                 EDWARD
                        Dr. Curtin. I was just--

                                 CURTIN
                           (with a smile)
                        It’s quite all right, Edward. 
                        Curiosity is what sets apart the 
                        brighter minds from the rest, no?

           Edward’s nerves are immediately put at ease. 

                                 EDWARD
                        Yes, sir. I’m-- I’m sorry, sir. 

                                 CURTIN
                        Don’t be. Here. 

           Curtin steps past Edward, opening the bag wider to reveal 
           dozens of instruments of science. Lenses, scalpels, etc.  

                                 CURTIN (CONT’D)
                        Simply tools of the trade. 

                                 EDWARD
                        It’s all just so fascinating. 

                                 CURTIN
                        I’m glad you share my enthusiasm. 
                        Come. Let’s put it to work.  

           Off Curtin, tapping what he found in his book --

           EXT. HUBBARD HOUSE - DAY - ESTABLISHING

                                 CURTIN (O.S., PRE-LAP)
                        Malnutrition. Fevers. 

           INT. HUBBARD HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Book in hand, Curtin addresses Judge Morrow and Dr. Griggs, 
           reading from a particular page. 
                                 CURTIN
                        Bleeding from the eyes and gums. 
                           (handing them the book)
                        All signs point to grain fever, an 
                        infection of the stomach, most 
                        likely caused by rotted grain. 
                        Rancid food can be worse than 
                        poison, especially if it goes 
                        untreated.  

                                 DR. GRIGGS
                        But if the grain is diseased, why 
                        is no one else getting sick? 

                                 CURTIN
                        Perhaps it’s not the grain alone. 

           As Griggs is about to object further, Judge Morrow holds up 
           his hand, tempering him.

                                 JUDGE MORROW
                        What should we do, doctor? 

                                 CURTIN
                        Keep her cool. Regulate her diet. 
                        No grain, nothing from the farm, 
                        and plenty of water. It will help 
                        dilute the sickness.

                                 JUDGE MORROW
                        Yes, doctor. 
                           (then)
                        And she will recover? 

           In the bedroom nearby, we glimpse Mercer through the doorway, 
           sitting at Betty’s side while she sleeps. 

                                 CURTIN
                        Time will tell. 

           Off Mercer, looking at his fiancée, hoping Curtin’s right --

           EXT. SALEM VILLAGE - DAY

           Thomas, the boy we met at the town square, playfully runs 
           down a SMALL ROAD with his new SPYGLASS. We follow him as he 
           skips toward a particular house --

           INT. MARY’S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME

           -- and into a modest living room, where he’s cut off by his 
           mother, MARY WALCOTT (30s). She charges in from the kitchen.
                                 MARY
                           (angrily)
                        Thomas! 

           Stern and traditional, hair pulled back tight, Mary need not 
           say a word to frighten Thomas. But does anyway.   

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        Where have you been? I’ve told you 
                        not to play where I can’t see you!
                           (spotting the spyglass)
                        What is that in your hand? 

                                 THOMAS
                        Nothing...

                                 MARY
                        Thomas. Give it to me. 

           Thomas sheepishly offers the SPYGLASS. She instantly snatches 
           it and snaps it shut. 

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        No son of mine will toy with one of 
                        the Devil’s instruments. The Lord 
                        sees you, you know.
                           (then, watchfully)
                        Run along, now. And stay in the 
                        yard, do you understand?

           Thomas puts his head down, shuffles back outside. 

           Clearly, superstition runs deep in Salem. 

           INT. ANNA’S INN - CURTIN’S ROOM - EVENING 

           Anna enters Curtin’s room carrying a tray of tea. He turns 
           from his studies.   

                                 ANNA
                        Sorry to disturb you. It’s cold 
                        this evening. Thought you’d like a 
                        cup of warm tea. 

                                 CURTIN
                        No, you’re not disturbing me at 
                        all. Thank you. 

           She sets down the tray, pours the kettle with care.
                                 ANNA
                        Please forgive me if I’m out of 
                        turn, Doctor, but, may I ask you a 
                        question? 

                                 CURTIN
                        Of course. 

                                 ANNA
                        People are starting to talk about 
                        Betty Hubbard. That’s why you’re 
                        here, isn’t it? Has something 
                        happened to her?   
                           (off his look)
                        Something more than a sickness, I 
                        mean...

                                 CURTIN
                        Did someone tell you that? 

                                 ANNA
                        Well, it is why you’re here, isn’t 
                        it? To find what’s wrong with her.  

                                 CURTIN
                        That much is true. And I plan to do 
                        so. But rumors of anything else are 
                        -- well, they’re just that. Rumors.  

                                 ANNA
                        Right. Well, I think it’s very kind 
                        of you to come here. Helping a poor 
                        girl in a small port town like--  

           She WINCES, feeling a jab of pain from her stomach.  

                                 CURTIN
                           (assisting her)
                        Are you all right? 

                                 ANNA
                        Sorry, yes, I’m fine. It’s just... 
                        I’ve been feeling these aches the 
                        past few weeks... 

                                 CURTIN
                        May I? 

           He gestures to her belly. Off her approval, his hand touches 
           her stomach and he examines her. The feel of a man’s touch 
           sends a charge through Anna. 

           Curtin places his other hand on the small of her back. 
                                  Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 CURTIN (CONT’D)
                        Is this okay? 

           She straightens her back, looking straight ahead.

                                 ANNA
                        Yes. 

           Curtin then stands in front of her, and softly places both 
           hands beneath her chin. Nothing more than a lymph-node 
           inspection, but to a Puritan woman...

                                 CURTIN
                        And this?

           She finally looks him in the eye. Nods.  

                                 CURTIN (CONT’D)
                        Your heart’s beating fast. 

           She looks down, sheepishly. Curtin finally drops his hands. 

                                 CURTIN (CONT’D)
                        Perhaps discomfort from carrying 
                        child. 

                                 ANNA
                        Dr. Griggs gave me this for the 
                        pain. 

           From her waist-pocket, she pulls out the bottle of elixir. 
           Curtin studies it, giving it a quick sniff--  

                                 CURTIN
                           (reeling from the scent)
                        Well, I’d hate to disagree with the 
                        good Doctor, but this won’t do you 
                        any good at all. Here... 

           He rifles through his luggage, producing a cylindrical GLASS 
           JAR filled with DRIED HERBS.

                                 CURTIN (CONT’D)
                        An herb, from South America. Too 
                        much of it is known to be toxic, 
                        but a little bit in your tea, and 
                        it relieves about any pain        
                        you could have.

           He carefully crushes a leaf between his fingers and dusts it 
           over the cup of tea. 

           She hesitantly sips... it’s not that bad.   
                                 CURTIN (CONT’D)
                        Here. Take it each night, just a 
                        bit, like that, and you’ll feel 
                        better in no time.   

           He hands her the jar. 

                                 ANNA
                        Thank you, Doctor. I’m grateful 
                        you’re here.  

           Curtin nods appreciatively as she exits. 

                                                           CUT TO:

           EXT. HUBBARD HOUSE - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

           Later. It’s a cold evening. Betty Hubbard’s house, adorned 
           with crosses, looks even more haunting in the dark.   

           Through one of the bedroom windows, a candle glows. 

           INT. HUBBARD HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           The Chambermaid and Slave Woman, Ebetha, enter the candlelit 
           bedroom to the steady sound of LABORED BREATHING.   

           They approach the bed to find Betty in a catatonic state, 
           thick ropes hugging her down to the mattress. 

           Eyes closed, Betty winces and a tear rolls down her cheek. Up 
           close, we realize it’s a drop of blood.  

                                 CHAMBERMAID
                        Poor angel. 

           As the Chambermaid prepares a cloth, Ebetha grabs a water 
           dish... but quickly notices: 

           The sound of the breathing has stopped.

           The Chambermaid notices as well. They look to each other. 
           Ebetha is still too afraid to go near. 

                                 CHAMBERMAID (CONT’D)
                           (leaning over her)
                        Betty? 

           She nudges Betty gently, growing concerned.  

                                 CHAMBERMAID (CONT’D)
                        Betty, darling?
           She leans down, dangerously close, listening for breathing. 
           Betty lies still, growing noticeably pale.     

                                 CHAMBERMAID (CONT’D)
                           (rising, to Ebetha)
                        Get Mr. Mercer. She’s not-- 

           Suddenly, Betty SNAPS up in her bed before she’s yanked back 
           like a pitbull feeling the grip of its chain. 

           Ebetha drops the water dish. The Chambermaid SCREAMS --   

           But with one more thrust, Betty RIPS the ropes from the 
           bedposts and lunges at the Chambermaid.    

           SMASH! She slams her into the mirror, then to the ground.  

                                 CHAMBERMAID (CONT’D)
                        Help! Help me! 

           Pinning the Chambermaid down, Betty leans in and whispers, in 
           a chilling voice: 

                                 BETTY
                        It’s already begun!

           BOOM! Mercer bursts in and pulls Betty off. She violently 
           COUGHS UP BLOOD and slumps to her side.   

           Mercer pulls her in close, desperate to bring her back.  

                                 MERCER
                        Betty? 
                           (panicking)
                        Betty!   

           But it’s too late. Her bleeding eyes roll back in her head. 

           She’s gone.  

           The Slave Woman and Chambermaid look on, shocked, as Mercer 
           cradles Betty in his arms, weeping in disbelief.

                                                    FADE TO BLACK.

                                                       OVER BLACK:

           The sound of CHURCH BELLS. 

           EXT. CEMETERY - MORNING

           It’s a cold, stark morning. Dozens of MOURNERS dressed in 
           black surround the humble coffin of Betty Hubbard. 
           Among them, several familiar faces: Anna, Griggs, Abigail the 
           Widow, and of course... 

           Mercer, red-eyed and angry, staring daggers at Curtin, who 
           bows his head in respect while Reverend Parris prays: 

                                 REVEREND PARRIS
                        Where means of grace cease, where 
                        nothing defiles. Where there is no 
                        grief, nor sin, pining sickness or 
                        consuming fears. Where I need no 
                        more to fast or pray or weep or be 
                        tempted. Oh Lord, may I arrive.    

           Then, off his nod, the crowd disperses. Somber and silent.     

           Curtin remains behind, staring at the grave of the woman he 
           couldn’t save in time. 

                                 REVEREND PARRIS (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Tragic, isn’t it?

           He looks to find Reverend Parris.

                                 CURTIN
                        I had just visited her. She was 
                        ill, but never would I have 
                        thought...     
                           (then)
                        If only I’d had more time with her.

           Parris regards him, coldly.  

                                 REVEREND PARRIS
                        Well. You did what you could. 

           Silence as Curtin looks off to the MOURNERS, gathering 
           outside the church. Curtin watches them for a beat... 

                                 CURTIN
                        I still have yet to see the inside 
                        of your church. Was I mistaken to 
                        believe Miss Hubbard’s funeral 
                        would be held within?  

                                 REVEREND PARRIS
                        Empty pageantry. A sinful tradition 
                        of Catholicism. We Puritans live 
                        and die with simplicity and 
                        dignity. We are buried the same 
                        way. 
                           (then)
                        Dignity is something we need to 
                        hold onto in these times. 
                                  Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

           Parris starts to walk toward the church. Curtin follows. 

                                 CURTIN
                           (re: church)
                        May I come visit on a less mournful 
                        day?

                                 REVEREND PARRIS
                        You’re as welcome as any in the 
                        church, Doctor, but I should let 
                        you know now: I was not in 
                        agreement with those who summoned 
                        you. In fact, I advised against it.      
                           (with a hint of animosity)
                        Good intentions aside, I believe 
                        you foolish to tamper with forces 
                        you don’t understand.  

                                 CURTIN
                        You believe Miss Hubbard’s death 
                        unearthly?

                                 REVEREND PARRIS
                        Well, like most concerns these 
                        days, my opinion hardly seems to 
                        matter much. Salem may be changing, 
                        but my conviction remains. This 
                        town has had a curse upon it since 
                        the day we settled. And only God 
                        himself has the power to lift it.    

           They stop at the church grounds. Curtin studies him. The 
           embodiment of Old Salem. A man as faithful as he is resolute. 

                                 REVEREND PARRIS (CONT’D)
                        Do you believe yourself more 
                        powerful than the Lord, Doctor?

                                 CURTIN
                        I should hardly think so. 

                                 REVEREND PARRIS
                        Then you’re as helpless as the rest 
                        of us.  

           Before Curtin can say any more -- 

                                 MERCER (O.S.)
                        What did you do to her?

           Curtin turns to see MERCER emerging from the crowd, walking 
           toward him with intensity. 
                                 CURTIN
                           (respectfully)
                        I tried to help her. She was very 
                        ill. 

                                 MERCER
                        All I know is that you saw her, and 
                        now she’s dead. Simple as that. 

                                 CURTIN
                        I understand you’re upset.    

                                 MERCER
                        You’re not needed here in Salem, 
                        Doctor. With your blasphemous talk. 
                        And your cursed trinkets. You’re 
                        not needed, and not welcome.  

           With this, he leans close, YANKS Curtin’s magnifying glass 
           from his chain -- and CRUSHES it under his boot.  

           In the face of Mercer’s pure ignorant hatred, all Curtin can 
           say is:

                                 CURTIN
                        I’m sorry for your loss. 

           And with that, he walks away. Mercer remains, dominant and 
           proud. The crowd takes it all in. As does Anna.   

           EXT. TOWN SQUARE - MOMENTS LATER

           Down the road, Anna catches up to him.     

                                 ANNA
                        Dr. Curtin.  

           Curtin looks up, surprised to see her. Before he can speak--

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        Back there. That -- that was grief 
                        talking. You mustn’t listen. 

                                 CURTIN
                        No... he’s right. 

           With nothing more to say, Curtin heads back. Anna watches him 
           go.  

                                                           CUT TO:
           INT. MARY’S HOUSE - DAY

           Mary returns from the funeral to find young Thomas sitting by 
           himself, spared from the day’s grief. 

           But he sees it in his mother.  

                                 THOMAS
                        Are you all right, Mum?         

           And suddenly, the stern woman we met earlier is gone.  She 
           looks at her son, softened by his innocence.

                                 MARY
                           (kneeling down)
                        You know all I want is to protect 
                        you, right? Protect you from the 
                        world. From change.  

           Thomas stares back, curious, not understanding. 

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        But maybe change is good sometimes. 
                        After all, it can be quite 
                        troublesome going back to old ways.   
                           (then)
                        Here. 

           She walks to the mantle to produce the SPYGLASS she 
           confiscated earlier and gives it back to him.      

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                           (with a warm smile)
                        Go out and find something beautiful 
                        in this world. 

           Thomas lights up and happily runs off.   

           CLOSE ON Mary, a good mother and a worried soul. She kneels 
           down and begins to load firewood into the hearth. 

           INT. ANNA’S INN - CURTIN’S ROOM - EVENING

           At the inn, Curtin packs his belongings by candlelight as 
           dusk sets in outside. A knock at the door interrupts him, and 
           he looks to find Judge Morrow at the threshold. 

                                 JUDGE MORROW 
                        May I? 
                           (off Curtin’s welcome)
                        I wanted to talk to you before you 
                        left in the morning. 
                                 CURTIN
                        Of course. Please. 

                                 JUDGE MORROW
                        I wish you’d had more time with 
                        poor Betty. But as I said before, 
                        we need to know what is happening. 
                        And how it’s happening. And how to 
                        stop it if it comes again. Things 
                        are getting worse. Not just Betty. 
                        The livestock, the dogs. Grain 
                        growing rancid. I’m afraid that if 
                        you leave, our hopes of finding an 
                        answer leave with you. 
                           (beat)
                        Can I persuade to stay? 

           Off Curtin, moved by the Judge’s plea -- 

                                                           CUT TO:

           INT. MARY’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           The dwindling fire from Mary’s hearth, slowly dying down.  

           It’s night, and Mary is bundled in a HEAVY CLOAK, placing 
           bread and fruit into A PICNIC BASKET resting on the table. 

           Her HUSBAND (Thomas’s Father) enters. 

                                 MARY’S HUSBAND
                        Mary? What are you doing?  

                                 MARY
                           (tying her hood)
                        I thought I’d be the one to go 
                        tonight.  

                                 MARY’S HUSBAND
                        But, Mary, I’d--

                                 MARY
                        Your back’s not getting any better, 
                        and you need it for work.  You 
                        needn’t be trotting through the 
                        woods on a horse all night.     

                                 MARY’S HUSBAND
                        But the cold outside. It’s 
                        unforgiving tonight.

           She smiles and gives him a reassuring kiss on the cheek. 
                                  Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 MARY
                        Please, get your rest. 

           Before he can argue further, she grabs the BASKET and heads --

           EXT. MARY’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           -- outside, where her HORSE is tied to the post.  The frigid 
           air instantly hits her, and she pulls her cloak tighter.  

           Looking at the full moon, she pets her horse gently. 

                                 MARY
                           (to the horse)
                        Good girl. 

           With a foot in the stirrup, she pulls herself up and we --

           INT. CHURCH - EVENING

           Inside the church, Reverend Parris lights a few modest 
           candles as he talks patiently to someone off-screen. 

                                 REVEREND PARRIS
                        Remember, no one else knows what 
                        you’ve been tasked with. So, tell 
                        me... What have you found?

           Reveal EDWARD, sitting in the first pew, hat in hand. 

                                 EDWARD
                        There’s nothing, Reverend. Honest.

                                 CONSTABLE WALKER (O.S.)
                        There’s always something. 

           We realize Walker is standing nearby. Edward looks uneasy. 

                                 EDWARD
                        I swear, nothing is out of sort, 
                        sir. He even let me look through 
                        his studies. 

                                 CONSTABLE WALKER
                        Everyone has secrets, boy. You’re 
                        not looking thoroughly enough.

                                 EDWARD
                           (to Parris)

                        A smart man.           

           Parris looks to the intimidated boy, then to Walker. 

                                 REVEREND PARRIS
                        Well. Be careful. The tree of 
                        knowledge serves a bitter fruit. 

                                                           CUT TO:

           EXT. WOODS - NIGHT

           The sound of hooves CLOPPING. On horseback, Mary makes her 
           way deeper and deeper down a wooded path, so far that we 
           can’t see the beginning or end of it. 

           It’s foggy. Cold. Haunting. As she rides, lantern dangling by 
           her side, she hears a FAINT SOUND: a branch, snapping?

           She stops the horse.  Listens. 

                                 MARY
                           (calling out)
                        Hello?

           Nothing. She stares into the thick fog, seeing the tiniest 
           swirls of motion in the distance. Probably imagined. 

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                           (voice trembling)
                        Is someone out there? 

           After a silent standoff, the horse starts up again, slowly 
           wading through the cold fog. A moment, then -- 

           CRACK! CRACK-CRACK! From behind her.   

           The horse whinnies to a halt as she spins it around and 
           raises her LANTERN. 

           CLOSE IN ON Mary’s face as she stares out, frozen in fear by 
           whatever she sees.

           INT. ANNA’S INN - ANNA’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Anna stirs in bed, asleep, when suddenly, a slight CREAKING 
           wakes her.     
           She opens her eyes to find the SILHOUETTE OF A MAN, watching 
           her from the doorway. But it doesn’t frighten her in the 
           least. 

           Instead, she sits up, almost under a spell. 

           The Man steps closer, still in the shadows, standing at the 
           foot of the bed. 

           Using the crook of his finger, he pulls the covers toward 
           him, revealing Anna in her nightgown: not pregnant. 

           We realize we’re in Anna’s recurring dream. 

           Wordlessly, the Silhouette climbs onto the bed as Anna pulls 
           open her nightgown, revealing herself to him. Her breath 
           trembles. Her chest rises and falls as she feels his touch. 

           The faceless man kisses her exposed stomach, then chest, then 
           grips her with force as she passionately rises and --

           INT. ANNA’S INN - ANNA’S BEDROOM - MORNING

           GASP! She wakes up, breathing heavily. We don’t know if it’s 
           a fantasy or the memory of an affair, but it’s clear: she 
           feels ashamed of the thoughts.

           EXT. SALEM VILLAGE - MORNING

           A new day in Salem. Various people tend to their duties.  

           Young Thomas plays around the edge of the woods with his 
           spyglass, carefree. 

           SPYGLASS POV: We see various sights.  A crow in the trees, 
           the town in the distance. And then, through the treeline... 

           A pale dress, flapping on the ground in the cold breeze.

           Thomas adjusts the sight to a CLOSER POV: We see a woman, 
           lying face down in the dirt. Thomas lowers the Spyglass, a 
           horrified look on his face. 

                                                           CUT TO:

           EXT. WOODS - DAY

           Several TOWNSPEOPLE have gathered in the woods. At their 
           center, Curtin leans over MARY’S BODY, inspecting. Edward 
           stands at his side. Mary’s Husband is being consoled nearby.
           Constable Walker stands with his men, watching with scrutiny. 
           His long black coat flaps loudly in the wind. 

                                 CONSTABLE WALKER
                        So you’re a detective now, too, 
                        Curtin?

                                 EDWARD
                           (since Curtin isn’t 
                           answering...)
                        We have orders from Judge Morrow, 
                        Constable, granting us-- 

                                 CONSTABLE WALKER
                        I know my business, boy. 

           He stares the sheepish Edward back into silence. 

           With a gentle touch, Curtin presses various parts of Mary’s 
           body, indecently in the eyes of those watching. 

           He slowly lifts the leg of her skirt to the audible gasp of 
           the crowd. This is now bordering sacrilege. He drops it back.

                                 CURTIN
                        What was she doing alone in the 
                        woods at night?

           He bends his head to stare into her open eyes.             

                                 CONSTABLE WALKER
                           (after an annoyed moment)
                        Her sister Rebecca lives in a cabin 
                        across the hollow. Isolated. 
                           (explaining)
                        Consumption of the lungs. Dreadful 
                        thing.  Mary and her husband have 
                        been sliding her meals under the 
                        door each night.  

           As Curtin listens, he inspects Mary’s bleeding fingernails, 
           and the clawed earth around her body.   

           Then, a WHINNY as Mary’s HORSE is dragged into frame by a 
           YOUNG LAWMAN. It struggles, shivering and frightened.  

                                 YOUNG LAWMAN
                        Constable Walker. I found her up 
                        the road. She’s in shock, sir. May 
                        have to put her down if she doesn’t 
                        calm.     

           Constable Walker approaches the horse. When he tries to hold 
           its reins, it BUCKS and KICKS violently.     
                                 CONSTABLE WALKER
                        Indeed. Poor girl saw something she 
                        didn’t like.

           He turns to find Curtin still transfixed by Mary’s body.

                                 CONSTABLE WALKER (CONT’D)
                           (now impatient)
                        Well, Curtin? You’re here for your 
                        opinion, so before this turns into 
                        a bigger spectacle than it is, I 
                        suggest you give us one-- 

                                 CURTIN
                        Her legs are broken. 

                                 CONSTABLE WALKER
                        Well, she did fall from a horse... 

                                 CURTIN
                        No... This was no fall. Look. 
                        Here.    

           Curtin exposes Mary’s leg to the thigh, to the murmur of the 
           crowd. He touches her ankle... 

                                 CURTIN (CONT’D)
                        And here... And here--

           ...her shin, her knee, her...   

                                 CONSTABLE WALKER
                        That’s enough. 

                                 CURTIN
                           (rising)
                        Both her legs, broken again and 
                        again, all the way up. Almost 
                        through the skin. No fall would be 
                        so exacting in its injury.  

                                 CONSTABLE WALKER
                        So what are you saying? Someone 
                        bludgeoned the poor girl’s legs and 
                        left her here to freeze to death?  

           Curtin wishes he had a reasonable explanation, but doesn’t.  

           He looks at Mary’s body one more time. Then, to the toppled 
           PICNIC BASKET on the ground.    
                                 CURTIN
                        We should bring the food to her 
                        sister. She deserves to know what 
                        happened.  

           Off Constable Walker, not exactly enthused...  

                                                           CUT TO:

           CLOSE-UP: A hand KNOCKS loudly against a door. 

           EXT. REBECCA’S CABIN - DAY

           A decaying cabin, practically hidden by trees in the deep 
           woods of Old Salem. Constable Walker knocks once more, as 
           Curtin, Edward, and the Young Lawman watch from nearby. 

                                 CONSTABLE WALKER
                        Goody Truman? 
                           (off the silence)
                        Rebecca, it’s Constable Walker. I 
                        come with news.    

           Still nothing. He now POUNDS on the door, to no avail. 

           Curtin tries to peer into the side window. It is blocked by 
           thick cloth from inside.     

                                 CURTIN
                        Could be she’s unable to speak.

                                 CONSTABLE WALKER
                        Could be a lot of things, Doctor.  
                        But you of all people should know 
                        what consumption can do to a man.  
                        We don’t go in, and she doesn’t 
                        come out. It’s the only way.

           Constable Walker starts to walk away when Curtin steps past. 

                                 CONSTABLE WALKER (CONT’D)
                        Dr. Curtin--

           Curtin tries the door himself. It budges, but...      

                                 CURTIN
                        It’s stuck. 

                                 CONSTABLE WALKER
                        Count it a blessing. Let us go, 
                        before--   

           Impatient, Curtin puts a handkerchief to his face and -- 
           INT. REBECCA’S CABIN - MAIN ROOM - DAY

           -- WHAM! From the force of Curtin’s shoulder, the door swings 
           wide, flooding the cramped, dim space with much-needed 
           sunlight. Dust hangs, shimmering in the stale air.

           Curtin slowly enters, floorboards creaking under his feet. 

           EXT. REBECCA’S CABIN - SAME TIME

           Constable Walker and the Lawman back away to safety. But 
           Edward looks like a puppy compelled to follow its master. 

                                 CONSTABLE WALKER
                        Don’t do it, son. 

           But Edward steels himself, grabs a handkerchief, and enters.

           Constable Walker, not about to be made a coward by some 
           school boy, begrudgingly follows Edward inside.     

           INT. REBECCA’S CABIN - MAIN ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Inside, Edward joins Curtin, who surveys his surroundings.  

           Walker slowly lags behind, an abhorrent look on his face. 

                                 CURTIN
                        Rebecca? 

           Silence. Eerie silence.  

           They walk through the main room, staring at a life suspended 
           in time: an unused stove, dust-covered furniture. At the back 
           of the cabin, Curtin pushes open a door to reveal -- 

           INT. REBECCA’S CABIN - BEDROOM - DAY

           -- the bedroom. With several ragged cloths on the windows, it 
           is almost completely lightless.    

           Not two steps in, though, Curtin stops. There’s a noise. 

           A slow but steady pat-pat-pat... something dripping.          

                                 CURTIN
                           (softer now)
                        Rebecca? 

           After a tense beat, he walks to the window, and RIPS the 
           cloth away. As light filters in, Edward leaps back, startled. 
                                 EDWARD
                        Oh, dear mercy...

           We follow his gaze upward, where we find: 

           REBECCA, crudely pinned to the ceiling by a PITCHFORK. Blood 
           runs down the handle and drips to the floor below.        

           Instantly pale, Edward backs to the doorway, nearly bumping 
           into Walker as he approaches.  

                                 CONSTABLE WALKER
                           (looking up, sickened)
                        God in Heaven. 

           Curtin, gathering himself, steps slowly toward her, 
           handkerchief pressed tightly. So close, his feet nearly touch 
           the POOL OF BLOOD on the floorboards. 

           He looks up, his fingertips reaching for the body when --  

           SLAM! Her body comes crashing toward us!  

           Curtin jumps backward. Edward tries to gather himself. And 
           for once, Walker finally looks shaken as well. 

                                                           CUT TO:

           INT. TOWN HALL - DAY

           The rumblings of a PACKED TOWN HALL die down as Judge Morrow 
           SLAMS his gavel.                 

                                 JUDGE MORROW
                        Silence! Order here! 

           At the front of the hall, Curtin sits among the ELDERS at a 
           long table, seeing the panic on the townspeople’s faces. 

                                 JUDGE MORROW (CONT’D)
                        We are all shocked by the tragedies 
                        that befell our friends and 
                        neighbors. But we must not fall 
                        into hysteria.
                           (then)
                        I’ve asked Dr. Curtin here for his 
                        insight. I think it fair to hear 
                        what he has to say.        
                           (gesturing)
                        Dr. Curtin...

           Curtin rises to address the crowd. Among them we see all the 
           familiar faces, including Susannah and Abigail. 
                                 CURTIN
                        I understand you are all 
                        frightened. And you’ve every reason 
                        to be. But we mustn’t allow the 
                        deaths of these women to seize our 
                        imaginations. 

           The crowd ERUPTS in confusion and protest. 

                                 CURTIN (CONT’D)
                           (yelling over them)
                        Strange as these happenings are, 
                        there is a logical explanation for 
                        them. And I will bring it to light, 
                        I assure you. 

                                 VILLAGER #1
                        Logic? You think there’s logic to 
                        whatever’s doing this? 

                                 CURTIN
                        Or whoever is doing this. Yes. 

                                 VILLAGER #2
                           (almost laughing)
                        Whoever? And what of Betty Hubbard? 
                        Surely no man did that to her! 

           We catch Mercer, staring down in anger...  

                                 CURTIN
                        Miss Hubbard showed symptoms of 
                        several illnesses-- 

                                 VILLAGER #3
                        And Rebecca, in her cabin! ‘Would 
                        take ten men to have such strength-- 

           The others rumble LOUDLY in approval, overwhelming Curtin. 
           Judge Morrow POUNDS his gavel to no effect until -- 

                                 ANNA (O.S.)
                           (shouting)
                        Enough! 

           A sudden silence as all heads turn to find Anna in the back. 

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        Let him finish. He’s trying to help 
                        us.

           Curtin gives her an appreciative look.  Anna nods.  The 
           others turn back to the front. 
                                 CURTIN
                        All I’m saying is that we’ll get 
                        nowhere blaming curses, or putting 
                        our faith in superstitions.                  

           We see Reverend Parris, looking on with disapproval from the 
           Elders table.  

                                 CURTIN (CONT’D)
                        First, we need to find a 
                        connection. These three women. Is 
                        there something they had in common?     

           Everyone in the hall exchanges grim, knowing looks. 

           Off Curtin, wondering what he’s missing -- 

                                                           CUT TO:

           A hand retrieves a LARGE, DUSTY BOOK from a high shelf, and 
           we find ourselves -- 

           INT. JUDGE MORROW’S CHAMBERS - DAY

           -- in the modest chambers of Judge Morrow. Curtin stands 
           across from him as he places the book on his desk with a 
           strange reverence. 

           From nearby, Reverend Parris observes in silence.   

                                 JUDGE MORROW
                        These are the documents, in full.  
                        Everything related to the trials 
                        fifteen years ago. Nineteen men and 
                        women were executed, found guilty 
                        of witchcraft. More imprisoned. 
                        Originally, there were ten 
                        accusers. All of them young girls. 
                        Mary Walcott, her sister Rebecca, 
                        and Miss Betty Hubbard were among 
                        them.   

           Curtin starts to see where this is going...   

                                 JUDGE MORROW (CONT’D)
                        Fate has not been kind to these 
                        girls. Two of the other accusers 
                        have already died of accident, 
                        years ago. Another, Mercy Lewis, 
                        moved to Charlestown and was killed 
                        during a tribal attack on the 
                        village. Another two fell to 
                        illness.                   
           Curtin looks to Reverend Parris, who gazes back stoically. 

                                 JUDGE MORROW (CONT’D)
                        And now, three more.

           Parris finally speaks, spelling it out coldly: 

                                 REVEREND PARRIS
                        The girls of the Witch Trials are 
                        dying, one by one.  

                                 JUDGE MORROW
                        There are only two left. 

                                 REVEREND PARRIS
                        Do you believe in curses now, Dr. 
                        Curtin? 

           Curtin takes this all in.  

                                 JUDGE MORROW
                           (staying on course)
                        I believe you’ve met one of the 
                        girls already. Susannah Sheldon. 

                                 CURTIN
                        The girl from Mr. Cooke’s farm.  

           Morrow nods. 

                                 JUDGE MORROW
                        The other, I’m sure you haven’t 
                        met. Abigail Williams. Or, as some 
                        have taken to calling her, “The Mad 
                        Widow.”            

           The woman from the square.  Curtin remembers... 

                                 CURTIN
                        Yes, I’ve seen her before.  

           Curtin soaks in this new information. Then -- 

                                 CURTIN (CONT’D)
                        Well, we should begin with the 
                        logical question: who would 
                        benefit? 

                                 CONSTABLE WALKER
                           (defensively)
                        What are you suggesting? 
                                 CURTIN
                        Constable, surely you have your 
                        suspicions. Who stands to gain from 
                        the deaths of these women? 

           He looks directly at Parris, who bristles under his stare.

                                 CURTIN (CONT’D)
                        Well, for one thing, Salem follows 
                        old clergy property law, correct? 
                        Wouldn’t that mean the dowry of 
                        Betty Hubbard and the land from 
                        Rebecca Truman both go to the 
                        church?

                                 REVEREND PARRIS
                        Be careful, Doctor. These are deep 
                        waters you’re starting to swim in. 

           Curtin is exasperated. They’re almost suspiciously unhelpful.

                                 CURTIN
                        Well, the very least we can do is 
                        give these two women protection. 
                           (to Judge Morrow)
                        Can Constable Walker and his men 
                        keep vigil over their homes?  

                                 REVEREND PARRIS
                        These girls are beyond protection.  
                           (pointedly, to Curtin)
                        As I said, Doctor. Forces you don’t 
                        understand.  

           Curtin chooses not to argue. Not when lives are at stake. 

                                 CURTIN
                           (to Judge Morrow)
                        May I borrow these documents?

           After a moment, Judge Morrow slides the book toward him.  

                                 JUDGE MORROW
                        Aye. But do treat it with caution. 
                        This here is Salem’s darkest 
                        chapter. Every horrid word of it.   

           CLOSE ON the BOOK...    

                                                         SMASH TO:

           An IRON LOCK being fastened onto a wooden door. As we pull 
           back, we find ourselves --  
           EXT. SUSANNAH’S COTTAGE - DAY

           -- outside Susannah’s Cottage, built on the outskirts of Mr. 
           Cooke’s Farm. 

           Curtin stands with Susannah and Mr. Cooke as a WORKMAN 
           reinforces her door-frame with a SOLID OAK DOOR and several 
           LOCKS. Another begins hammering PLANKS OF WOOD to her 
           windows. 

                                 SUSANNAH
                        Is all of this necessary? 

           Constable Walker stands nearby, apparently sharing her 
           skepticism. Beside him stands a BURLY GUARD.    

                                 CURTIN
                        I apologize if it seems excessive 
                        Miss Sheldon, but you must be 
                        protected. 

                                 SUSANNAH
                        Against what? What will locks do?  
                        You think a person is responsible 
                        for these deaths?

                                 CURTIN
                        We don’t know what’s responsible. 
                        But until we find out, our concern 
                        is keeping you as safe as we can. 

                                 SUSANNAH
                        What if I need to leave?

                                 MR. COOKE
                        Everything you need will be brought 
                        to you. It’s only temporary, I 
                        promise.  

           Curtin gestures to the BURLY GUARD. Walker speaks up:   

                                 CONSTABLE WALKER
                           (annoyed with Curtin)
                        Susannah, this is Captain Fulroy. 
                        He’s been assigned to stand guard 
                        through the night.   

           Susannah turns back, nervous, watching her cottage being 
           turned into a prison. As the worker hammers at the planks, 

                                                     MATCH CUT TO:

           Curtin’s hand, gently KNOCKING on a door. 
                                  Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

           EXT. ABIGAIL’S HOUSE - DAY

           Curtin stands before a decaying, WEATHER-WORN HOUSE on a 
           gloomy property. It’s neighborless save for an OLD STONE WELL 
           near the road. Walker and a GUARD wait behind Curtin.   

           We hear shuffling on the other side... but no answer. 

                                 CURTIN
                           (loudly, through the door)
                        Miss Williams? Abigail? It’s Dr. 
                        Curtin. We’ve seen each other in 
                        town... I need to speak with you. 

           No answer for a beat, then, the door cracks open, just enough  *
           to reveal Abigail’s face. She peers out with an untrusting 
           look in her eyes. 

                                 ABIGAIL
                        I know what you’re here to discuss. 
                        But I assure you, there’s no use 
                        for it. 

                                 CURTIN
                           (gently)
                        Miss Williams, a word is all I ask.  
                        We only wish to protect you.

           Her fierce eyes look right through Curtin. 

                                 ABIGAIL
                        God will protect me. 

           With that, she SLAMS the door. 

                                 CURTIN
                           (to Walker, re: Guard)
                        Have him stand watch all night.   

           Walker bristles at the command, but ultimately nods to the 
           Guard.  

                                                           CUT TO:

           INT. ANNA’S INN - CURTIN’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Curtin reads over the SALEM DOCUMENTS at his desk when Anna 
           KNOCKS at the doorway. 

                                 CURTIN
                           (turning)
                        Anna.
                                 ANNA
                        May I come in? 

                                 CURTIN
                           (gesturing)
                        Please.

           He closes the infamous book and slides it away. From the look 
           on his face, Anna is a welcome sight at this point.

                                 CURTIN (CONT’D)
                        I’ve been meaning to ask if the 
                        herbs have been helping?

                                 ANNA
                           (holding her stomach)
                        Yes. Remarkably, actually. I feel 
                        much better.

           But Curtin senses her unease... 

                                 CURTIN
                        And how is everything else? 

                                 ANNA
                           (trying to process)
                        So many strange things happening.
                           (not wanting to say it)
                        It’s as if there truly is a curse 
                        upon us. And I believe it’s taken 
                        hold of me as well. 

                                 CURTIN
                        What’s troubling you?
                           (off her reticence)
                        Whatever it is, you can tell me.  

           Anna looks into Curtin’s kind eyes, apprehensively. 

           Then, finally mustering the courage -- 

                                 ANNA
                        My child... It does not belong to 
                        my husband Daniel. He never showed 
                        affection to me in that way. The 
                        truth is, I’ve never laid down with 
                        him, or any man, in my life. 

                                 CURTIN
                        I don’t understand. 

                                 ANNA
                        It’s true, Doctor. As hard as it is 
                        to believe. It’s the truth. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ANNA (CONT'D)
                           (then, desperate)
                        In a few months, Daniel will 
                        return, and I’ll be shunned. A 
                        pariah.

           Curtin places a comforting hand on her shoulder, but she 
           shudders at his touch, still far from feeling reassured. 

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                           (tearfully)
                        What will happen to my child?

           Curtin studies her a beat, seeing the shame and fear in her 
           eyes. 

                                 CURTIN
                        No harm will come to your child. 
                           (then)
                        I promise. 

           Off Curtin -- 

                                                           CUT TO:

           It’s quiet outside of Mr. Cooke’s farm. We can barely make 
           out our surroundings under the moonlight --

           -- until the glow of a LANTERN illuminates the outside of 
           Susannah’s Cottage. 

           Through the wet grass, whoever is carrying the lantern is 
           stepping closer... 

           INT. SUSANNAH’S COTTAGE - NIGHT

           Susannah slips into her nightgown and, sparking a crude flint 
           match, lights a SMALL CANDLE by her bed. As she draws back 
           the bedsheets -- 

           There’s a NOISE from outside. She freezes, startled. 

                                 SUSANNAH
                           (nervous)
                        Hello?

           No answer. She steps closer to the door. 

                                 SUSANNAH (CONT’D)
                        Is someone there...? 
           Still nothing. Then -- 

           KNOCK-KNOCK-KNOCK! A hand raps on the door. She jumps. 

           Then, a muffled VOICE from the other side: 

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Susannah. It’s me. 

           We hear heavy BOLTS unlocking, and she opens the door to 
           reveal Mr. Cooke, holding his lantern. The Burly Guard stands 
           beside him. 

                                 SUSANNAH
                        You frightened me. 

                                 MR. COOKE
                        I didn’t mean to, child.
                           (then)
                        Here. I brought you dinner.  

           Mr. Cooke hands her a BASKET OF FOOD. 

                                 SUSANNAH
                           (warmly)
                        Thank you.  

           The Guard politely tips his hat and makes his way back out to 
           the property. 

                                 MR. COOKE
                        You’ll be all right, then? I 
                        promise to come check on you at 
                        first light. 

           There’s a sweetness in the old man we haven’t seen before. 

                                 SUSANNAH
                        I’ll be fine. 

                                 MR. COOKE
                        Goodnight, then.

           Susannah closes the door, bolts the locks, and climbs into 
           bed. Beside her, the small candle continues to burn. 

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. SUSANNAH’S COTTAGE - LATE NIGHT - ESTABLISHING

           The Guard sits quietly outside the cottage. Rising, he begins 
           to pace the property, half patrolling, half warming himself.  
           INT. SUSANNAH’S COTTAGE - SAME TIME

           Susannah’s candle has melted down further. She lies in bed, 
           fast asleep. The candle flickers once more before dying out. 
           Then, we start to hear something: 

           Like the rapid patter of nails tapping a desk. Then something 
           else: is that... SQUEAKING?

           Through the thinnest bars of moonlight, we’re able to make 
           out a shape moving just above Susannah. As it gets closer, we 
           realize what it is:

           A RAT, frighteningly large, teetering on the bedpost above 
           her. We can only hope it doesn’t crawl down on her...         

           But it does, landing in her hair. She turns in her sleep. 

           It puts a foot in her mouth. Finally -- she wakes.  

           Gathering herself, she sits up in bed, only to realize -- 

           There are RATS everywhere.

           They move beneath her blanket. Tangled on the floor. Falling 
           from the rafters... 

           EXT. SUSANNAH’S COTTAGE - SAME TIME

           The Guard, patrolling the grounds, hears Susannah SCREAM from 
           the cabin. He rushes toward the front door. 

           INT. SUSANNAH’S COTTAGE - NIGHT

           Susannah throws the covers and stumbles out of bed, 
           scrambling for the door. The rats nip at her heels. 

                                 BURLY GUARD (O.S.)
                           (through the door)
                        Miss Sheldon, what’s wrong? 

           She yanks at the door -- but the new LOCKS rattle in place. 
           She fumbles with them, desperate to open the door.

                                 SUSANNAH
                        Help! Help me!

           EXT. SUSANNAH’S COTTAGE - SAME TIME

           On the other side, the guard pounds and shoulders the door. 
           But it’s locked. Strongly reinforced.  
                                 BURLY GUARD
                        Susannah! Unlock the door!

           INT. SUSANNAH’S COTTAGE - SAME TIME

           But she can’t. The rats are biting at her hands, falling from 
           above, climbing from below. She shakes them off, hysterical.  

           THUMP, THUMP, THUMP... the guard shoulders the door, 
           splitting it but not breaking it. 

           Desperate, she looks to the CLOSET and races toward it, 
           grabbing her MATCHES, on the way. Stepping over more rats, 
           she yanks the door open and SLAMS herself inside. 

           INSIDE THE CLOSET:

           Susannah sits in complete darkness. Every sound muffled 
           almost to silence, save for her steady panicked breathing.  

           Then, another sound. The patter of footsteps and a growing 
           hum of tiny squeaks. 

           STRIKE! The glow of a match illuminates the tiny space...

           Where a HUNDRED EYES glow green in the match’s light.

           They tumble from shelves and skitter along the floor, 
           swarming her all at once. 

           Her SCREAM puts out the flame...

           And we hear her get eaten alive.  

           EXT. SUSANNAH’S COTTAGE - SAME TIME

           The Guard pulls at the boarded window planks in vain.

                                 BURLY GUARD
                        Susannah! 

           FADE OUT on the guard struggling desperately to get in.  

                                                           CUT TO:

           EXT. SALEM VILLAGE - MORNING

           From our view of the harbor, another quiet and peaceful New 
           England morning. But on the streets, Curtin walks briskly, 
           tightening his coat against the cold, Edward by his side.   
                                 EDWARD
                        The others have already been 
                        summoned, sir. Mr. Cooke found her 
                        this morning...  

           EXT. SUSANNAH’S COTTAGE - MORNING

           They approach Susannah’s Cottage on Cooke’s farm while 
           various men move about the scene. TWO DEPUTIES empty a LARGE 
           CAGE OF RATS onto a smoking FIRE. 

           Nearby, Mr. Cooke weeps inconsolably. 

           Suddenly, Constable Walker cuts Curtin off in his path. 

                                 CONSTABLE WALKER
                        Spare us your theories for the 
                        moment, Dr. Curtin. 
                           (re: Mr. Cooke)
                        Now’s not the time.

           But Curtin is livid. 

                                 CURTIN
                        What happened? 

                                 CONSTABLE WALKER
                        Well, we’re trying to figure that 
                        out, aren’t we? 

           Curtin looks to Susannah’s Guard, standing nearby. His face, 
           pale with shock. 

                                 CURTIN
                           (approaching Guard)
                        She was supposed to be guarded 
                        every minute. Why wasn’t she-- 

                                 CONSTABLE WALKER
                           (getting in Curtin’s way)
                        I will not have one of my men’s 
                        actions called into question, 
                        Curtin. It was your frenzied 
                        security that kept him from saving 
                        her life. Sealed her in like a 
                        tomb. It’s why she couldn’t get 
                        away from them.   

                                 CURTIN
                        From who? 
                                 BURLY GUARD
                           (not looking up)
                        The rats. 

                                 CURTIN
                           (looking to Walker)
                        What? What happened to her?  

                                 CONSTABLE WALKER
                        As I said, Doctor. We’re looking 
                        into it. 

           There’s a quiet standoff between the two. Finally -- 

                                 CONSTABLE WALKER (CONT’D)
                        Come. See for yourself. 

           With a self-righteous air, Walker leads Curtin to the 
           COTTAGE, where the door has been axed away. 

           INT. SUSANNAH’S COTTAGE - MORNING

           Inside, it’s still shadowy from the boarded windows. Walker 
           pulls open the closet door, Curtin and Edward look inside. 
           Curtin’s POV: a bloody SKELETAL FIGURE curled on the closet 
           floor. A RAT scurries across. 

           Constable Walker leans in as they examine the horrific sight. 

                                 CONSTABLE WALKER
                        She was eaten by them. Alive, from 
                        the looks of it. Poor thing. 
                           (adding)
                        What an awful way to meet your end.  

           But Curtin doesn’t look up. CLOSE ON the rat, still scurrying 
           below. Then, off Curtin, suddenly realizing --

                                                         SMASH TO:

           INT. JUDGE MORROW’S CHAMBERS - DAY

           THUD! Curtin slams the BOOK of Witch Trial documents onto 
           Judge Morrow’s desk. 

           Surrounding him: Judge Morrow, Reverend Parris, the rest of 
           the Elders, and Constable Walker.     

                                 CURTIN
                        It’s all in here. The deaths, the 
                        three girls, all accusers. But it  
                        never made sense. The affliction.

                        The struggle in the woods. The 
                        pitchfork. So atrocious, yet 
                        strangely specific.  
                           (opening the book)
                        But then, the rats. 

           He finds a particular passage... 

                                 CURTIN (CONT’D)
                        February 2nd, 1692. Susannah 
                        Sheldon accuses Bridget Bishop of 
                        conjuring wild animals to do harm.  
                        Birds, snakes... rats. 
                           (flipping to another page)
                        March 13th. Mary Walcott claims 
                        that the widowed beggar Margaret 
                        Scott confessed to cursing the 
                        infirm in the village... By 
                        striking them lame. 
                           (flipping to another page)
                        April 6th. Her sister Rebecca 
                        accuses Giles Corey of commanding 
                        her to sign her soul to the Devil. 
                        In her testimony to the court, she 
                        says, and I quote: “I would sooner 
                        fall on a pitchfork than sign the 
                        Devil’s Book.”       

           He looks to the Elders, but their reactions are hard to read  
           -- perhaps reluctant to give him the satisfaction of 
           admitting how much sense this makes.

                        Don’t you see? These girls are 
                        being punished, severely, 
                        meticulously. Each in the same 
                        manner as they accused others. At 
                        the very least, it proves--

                        It proves nothing. 

           All eyes turn to Parris, whose gaze burns into Curtin.

                        Since the day you’ve arrived,

                        knowledge and derided our faith. 
                        But what have you really proven? 
                        Only a truth we’ve all known for 
                        fifteen years. That there is a 
                        curse upon this town, and it’s come 
                        back again to lay its claim.       
           His conviction is palpable. The others dare not speak.

                        You can’t be serious. Someone is 
                        deliberately doing this. 

           He looks around the room, realizes he's not getting through 
           to them. Then, in a more measured tone --

                        Well, surely the pews of your 
                        church will be filled when this 
                        town is stirred up to a proper 
                        frenzy. 

           A long, tense beat as Parris seethes. Then -- 

                                 JUDGE MORROW
                           (to Constable Walker)
                        Constable. Make sure you and your 
                        men guard Abigail Williams day and 
                        night, in shifts. No harm shall 
                        come to her while this 
                        investigation continues.  

           EXT. WOODS - DAY

           Curtin walks through the woods with Abigail, the Mad Widow.  
           She looks tired and noticeably frail.   
                                 CURTIN
                        I want to thank you for finally 
                        agreeing to speak with me.

                                 ABIGAIL
                        I suppose it’s no harm at this 
                        point. 

                                 CURTIN
                        The Elders have arranged for 
                        Constable Walker and his men to 
                        protect you. 

           Abigail stops, guiding his eyes to the ground before them. 

                                 ABIGAIL
                        Look. 

           They’ve reached a SMALL GRAVEYARD, overgrown and forgotten.     

                                 ABIGAIL (CONT’D)
                        This is where they are buried. 

           Curtin stares at the crude UNMARKED GRAVESTONES. 

                                 ABIGAIL (CONT’D)
                        The nineteen accused. They were not 
                        allowed to lay with the rest of the 
                        townspeople.     

           He listens intently to her rare moment of openness. 

                                 ABIGAIL (CONT’D)
                           (sober, remembering)
                        Sarah Wildes. She was hanged, then 
                        buried here, alone. Because of me. 

           Curtin stares back at her, concerned.  

                                 ABIGAIL (CONT’D)
                        Do you know what it means to be 
                        marked for your sins? I appreciate 
                        your efforts, Doctor, but Salem 
                        would be happy to see me go. The 
                        Lord as well, I suppose.     

                                 CURTIN
                        You don’t look well. Are you ill? 

                                 ABIGAIL
                        I haven’t eaten since Betty Hubbard 
                        died.
                           (off his look)
                        Fasting. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ABIGAIL (CONT'D)
                        Like Saul in the Good Book.
                           (adding)
                        You have your methods. I have mine. 
                        I believe that repentance is the 
                        only way to salvation.    

           Far too weary to fight such superstition, Curtin realizes 
           he’s not going to reach her.

           He looks away, gazing once more at the cross-less graves. 

                                 CURTIN
                        I find it intriguing that this town 
                        is named Salem.

           She looks to him, curious. 

                                 CURTIN (CONT’D)
                        The word itself is Greek. The 
                        Hebrews call it Shalom. The Arabs, 
                        Salaam. But in any language, it’s 
                        the same...

           He turns, ready to leave.   

                                 CURTIN (CONT’D)
                        It means peace. 

           Off Abigail, staring at the graves...    

                                                    FADE TO BLACK.

           EXT. SALEM VILLAGE - ESTABLISHING - DAY

           A light snow settles on the village. At the CHURCH, we watch 
           a large flock of PARISHIONERS as they funnel inside.  

           INT. CHURCH - DAY

           Every pew is full beyond capacity. Some even stand in back. 
           Among them, entering quietly, is Curtin.    

           At the altar, Reverend Parris delivers an impassioned sermon.      

                                 REVEREND PARRIS
                        O, Lord, give to us in our time of 
                        dread a deeper repentance. The 
                        refuge of your wisdom, the comfort 
                        of your protection. 

           As he continues, we see a SERIES OF SHOTS:  
           EXT. ABIGAIL’S HOUSE - DAY

           A hammer pounds a nail into a wooden structure. Pull back to 
           reveal a large CYLINDRICAL BARREL on stilts, eight feet off 
           the ground, with a hatch door in its side. 

           It’s a crude puritan WATER TOWER. And it’s one of four. Each 
           with a gutter-like chute aimed at Abigail’s house.         

                                 REVEREND PARRIS (V.O.)
                        As tragedy befalls us, let us 
                        remember our past. Let us not greet 
                        each other with suspicion, or 
                        divide ourselves with accusations. 

           ONLOOKERS stand on the edge of the property, viewing the 
           construction with mistrust.  

                                 REVEREND PARRIS (V.O.)
                        Instead, let us find strength in 
                        each other’s protection... 

           We see Abigail’s yard filled with LAWMEN, bringing water from 
           her well and filling the towers. 

                                 REVEREND PARRIS (V.O.)
                        Let us face the shadow that walks 
                        in darkness, and together, bring 
                        light upon it... 

           INT. ABIGAIL’S HOUSE - DAY

           Abigail kneels in prayer, when Walker and his Lawmen storm 
           in. 

                                 ABIGAIL
                        Excuse me--! 

                                 CONSTABLE WALKER
                        We’ll need all your candles and 
                        flint, Miss Williams. Ordered by 
                        the Judge, for your protection.     

           QUICK SHOTS of the Lawmen pilfering her drawers, fireplace, 
           stove, grabbing CANDLES, WOOD, and FLINT MATCHES.  

                                 ABIGAIL
                           (protesting in vain)
                        But...

                                 REVEREND PARRIS (V.O.)
                        The light of solidarity. The light 
                        of compassion... 
           EXT. ABIGAIL’S HOUSE - DAY

           Outside, with the towers full, a Lawman pulls the hatch to 
           test the water chute. All works properly. He nods. 

           A final shot of the yard, the four towers, the guards 
           standing by... 

           Curtin stands by Constable Walker, who oversees it all. 

           INT. CHURCH - PRESENT

                                 REVEREND PARRIS
                        The flame lit by the faith in 
                        Almighty God, Who guides us when we 
                        fail to see the path. Amen. 

           END SERIES OF SHOTS.

           The congregation echoes the Amen and quietly shuffles out. 
           After a moment, Curtin is the only one who remains.

           He approaches Reverend Parris near the altar. 

                                 CURTIN
                        I finally got to visit your church. 
                        That was a lovely sermon.    

           Parris eyes Curtin for a moment, choosing his words. 

                                 REVEREND PARRIS
                        You think I hold contempt for you. 
                        But I don’t. I hold pity. 

                                 CURTIN
                        How so? 

                                 REVEREND PARRIS
                        Because you don’t believe in 
                        anything larger than yourself. How 
                        can a man overcome something he 
                        doesn’t even believe in?

           Curtin looks at him, feeling pity in return. Another pious 
           man, frightened by what he doesn’t know. 

                                 CURTIN
                        Help me understand. If this were 
                        the Devil... why choose Salem? 

                                 REVEREND PARRIS
                        He’s cast his eye on us since the 
                        day we settled. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 REVEREND PARRIS (CONT'D)
                        Salem is a beacon of devotion. A 
                        settlement strengthened by God, 
                        like Damascus and Jerusalem before 
                        us.

                                 CURTIN
                        Well surely, then, in all his 
                        power, there’s a more resounding 
                        way to make his point.

           Parris puts on the patient grin that the wise reserve for the 
           young.  

                                 REVEREND PARRIS
                        People always say they can never 
                        know God’s plan, yet they’re always 
                        so bold as to think they understand 
                        the intentions of the Devil.  
                           (then)
                        But you’d be a fool not to think 
                        that the Devil, just like the Lord, 
                        works in mysterious ways. 

           Off Curtin, considering this -- 

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. ANNA’S INN - ESTABLISHING - DAY

           Several days have passed. A blanket of snow covers the inn.      

           INT. ANNA’S INN - ANNA’S BEDROOM - DAY

           Anna lies on her bed as Dr. Griggs examines her once again.  

                                 DR. GRIGGS 
                           (pressing her stomach)
                        Everything seems healthy. Should be 
                        any day now. 

           Anna puts on her best smile... but it’s not good enough to 
           convince Dr. Griggs. 

                                 DR. GRIGGS (CONT’D)
                        Anna, I’ve known you since you were 
                        a child. I can tell when 
                        something’s wrong. What’s troubling 
                        you?   

                                 ANNA
                        Nothing. It’s just-- 
                                  Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

           The truth is on the tip of her tongue. But...

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        With Daniel gone so long, the 
                        burden of carrying this child has 
                        been mine alone. I feel like the 
                        others look down on me.

                                 DR. GRIGGS
                        Nonsense, dear girl. Don’t confuse 
                        concern with pity. And besides, in 
                        a few months, your husband will be 
                        home, and all these small worries 
                        will be far behind you.   

           He smiles, warmly. Off Anna, far from reassured --  

           INT. ANNA’S INN - CURTIN’S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Curtin works at his desk when he hears Dr. Griggs’ knocking. 

                                 DR. GRIGGS
                        A moment, Doctor? 

                                 CURTIN
                           (rising)
                        Dr. Griggs, yes, of course.

                                 DR. GRIGGS
                        I was checking on Anna only to 
                        discover that she’d stopped taking 
                        my medication at your behest.  

                                 CURTIN
                        Well, Doctor, you’d given her --

                                 DR. GRIGGS
                        I’d given her what was necessary to 
                        help her. And you’ve given her 
                        poison instead! 

                                 CURTIN
                        I’m afraid that’s where we 
                        disagree. My studies have found--

                                 DR. GRIGGS
                           (growing angry)
                        Your studies don’t much matter 
                        here, is that clear? This is not 
                        some experiment, this is my 
                        patient. Someone I care about, whom 
                        I’ve treated since she was born.

                                 DR. GRIGGS (CONT'D)
                        So forgive me if I don’t want my 
                        medical decisions usurped by some 
                        charlatan when two lives are on the 
                        line.    

           Curtin thinks it futile to defend his position further.

                                 DR. GRIGGS (CONT’D)
                        That woman’s health is what I care 
                        about, Doctor. Don’t you have 
                        enough projects of your own? 

           Griggs walks out, angry. His medical knowledge may be 
           lacking, but not his dedication. 

                                                           CUT TO:

           INT. ANNA’S INN - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Later that night, Anna is finishing the last of her chores in 
           the kitchen. She starts to fold the tablecloth when --  

           Curtin rounds the corner, heading for the door.  

                                 ANNA
                        Dr. Curtin. You’re heading out 
                        late.     

                                 CURTIN
                        I’m going for a walk. It helps me 
                        when I can’t sleep.  
                           (then)
                        You know, if you walk past your 
                        neighbor’s farm, there’s quite a 
                        lovely view of the harbor.  

                                 ANNA
                        I know it well. 
                           (then, boldly)
                        Do you mind if I join you? 

           He senses that she feels trapped inside this house.  

                                 CURTIN
                        Of course not. 

                                                           CUT TO:
           EXT. ANNA’S INN/SALEM VILLAGE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           Outside the inn, Anna carefully closes the door, wraps 
           herself in a heavy cloak, and joins Curtin along a nearby 
           path. Snow falls lightly, smoke rises from chimneys.         

           After a quiet moment -- 

                                 ANNA
                        May I ask you something personal, 
                        doctor?

                                 CURTIN
                        Of course. 

                                 ANNA
                        You don’t believe in God, do you? 

           He thinks carefully how to answer. 

                                 CURTIN
                        I believe in what I see. I believe 
                        in science, in reason.  
                           (then)
                        And I believe that’s enough.

                                 ANNA
                        But what about the things reason 
                        cannot answer? 

                                 CURTIN
                        I’ve yet to come across one. 

                                 ANNA
                        Even in Salem? 

           That last comments sits with him. 

           By now, they’ve reached the end of the path, where a stunning 
           view of the harbor has seemingly crept upon them.    

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        I imagine it’s easy for a man of 
                        your background to dismiss all of 
                        it. Curses. Witches. The Devil. You 
                        didn’t have to live through the 
                        trials. To experience what we did. 

                                 CURTIN
                        And what was that? 

                                 ANNA
                        Isn’t it in those books you read?
                                 CURTIN
                        What the Elders want me to know, 
                        sure. But you lived it, correct? 
                           (truly curious)
                        What do you remember? 

           A beat as Anna looks to the harbor, lost in thought. 

                                 ANNA
                        I was only a child when it 
                        happened. The rumors spread through 
                        the town like a wildfire...

           EXT. SALEM FOREST - FLASHBACK - NIGHT

           A densely wooded area. We move through the trees until we see 
           a LANTERN’S GLOW in a small clearing ahead. 

           A DISHEVELED WOMAN walks through with her lantern...

           And approaches a SHADOWY FIGURE, dressed entirely in black. 

                                 ANNA (V.O.)
                        The witches, they were accused of 
                        meeting the Devil in secret, and 
                        making a pact for powers God never 
                        gave them...

           INT. SHACK - FLASHBACK - DAY

           A BOILING POT bubbles as a WEST-INDIAN WOMAN stands over it, 
           sprinkling sage into a steaming concoction. 

                                 ANNA (V.O.)
                        Of using unnatural medicines...

           INT. PURITAN HOME - FLASHBACK - NIGHT

           An OLD WIDOW cradles a BLACK CAT close to her chest as she 
           walks through her house. When she reaches her LIVING ROOM --  

                                 ANNA (V.O.)
                        Of manipulating nature...

           -- we discover it is filled with DOZENS OF BLACK CATS, 
           slinking across the furniture and along the floor. 
           INT. PURITAN BEDROOM - FLASHBACK - NIGHT

           A YOUNG WOMAN plants an OLDER MAN onto his bed. There’s a 
           conflicted look in his eyes... 

                                 ANNA (V.O.)
                        Of tempting men from their 
                        marriages.

           But he doesn’t object when the Young Woman unbuttons her 
           dress and lets it fall to the floor. 

           INT. CHURCH - FLASHBACK - DAY

           REVEREND PARRIS, in his 50s when we first met him, gives a 
           solemn nod to a younger CONSTABLE WALKER and his men. 

                                 ANNA (V.O.)
                        So the Elders rounded up these 
                        women, then more, and more, as 
                        hysteria took over.

           EXT. SALEM VILLAGE - FLASHBACK - DAY

           In a series of shots: SEVERAL WOMEN, including those we’ve 
           just seen, are pulled from their homes by Walker’s men. 

                                 ANNA (V.O.)
                        The widows. The unwed. The outcasts 
                        who didn’t attend church. The 
                        Elders believed Salem would be 
                        cleansed if these women were gone. 

           INT. SALEM PRISON - FLASHBACK - DAY

           The women are herded together and locked away in JAIL CELLS.  

           As Constable Walker turns the key and walks away, we CLOSE ON 
           one very distinct-looking woman as she clutches the bars.

           She angrily peers out with TWO DIFFERENT-COLORED EYES. One 
           blue, one brown. It’s a face we’re not likely to forget.

                                 ANNA (V.O.)
                        And then came the trials. 

           INT. SALEM COURTHOUSE - FLASHBACK - DAY

           The accusers, as LITTLE GIRLS, point and faint in the 
           courtroom.
                                 ANNA (V.O.)
                        We were told that if we helped 
                        convict them, we would be saved.

           EXT. SALEM VILLAGE - GALLOWS HILL - FLASHBACK - DAY

           In a series of shots: SNAP! SNAP! SNAP! Several of the women 
           we’ve just seen are dropped from the gallows. An ANGRY MOB 
           looks on, cheering louder and louder. 

                                 ANNA (V.O.)
                        And Salem would be rid of evil 
                        forever.

           End Flashbacks. 

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. SALEM VILLAGE - HARBOR - NIGHT

           Anna continues staring off at the harbor, lost in her memory. 

                                 ANNA
                        But we’ll never be rid of evil. I 
                        know that now.

           She places a hand over her stomach. 

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        And my child will be born soon. 

           Curtin struggles to make sense of what Anna’s confiding in 
           him. 

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        You still don’t believe me, do you?  
                        That I haven’t laid down with a 
                        man. You think anything otherwise 
                        would be impossible.

                                 CURTIN
                           (trying)
                        Not impossible. Just... a miracle.  

           Anna smirks. 

                                 ANNA
                        Right. A miracle.

           She looks off into the harbor again. He looks out with her. 
                                 CURTIN
                        I don’t judge you, Anna. In fact, I 
                        don’t see anyone here who has the 
                        right to judge you. 
                           (then)
                        Come, now. It’s cold. 

           He turns to lead her back to the inn when --  

                                 ANNA (O.S.)
                        There weren’t only ten.

                                 CURTIN
                           (turning back)
                        I’m sorry? 

                                 ANNA
                           (still looking off)
                        The girls. The original accusers. 
                        There weren’t only ten of them.   
                           (then, turning to him)
                        There were eleven. 

           Curtin suddenly realizes what she’s saying...

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        I was nine years old. I gave a 
                        private testimony to the judges 
                        that my father later paid heavily 
                        to have discarded. 
                           (then)
                        You won’t find it in your 
                        documents.      

                                 CURTIN
                           (still stunned)
                        And whom did you accuse? 

                                 ANNA
                        A poor maid who lived alone on the 
                        edge of town. She used to frighten 
                        us as children.
                           (then)
                        I accused her of carrying the 
                        Devil’s child.

           IN A BRIEF CUT: We flash back to our opening scene. At the 
           front of the crowd, YOUNG ANNA stares up at the ACCUSED WITCH 
           at the gallows...

           Whom we now reveal is visibly pregnant.
           As the two lock eyes, the Lawman forcibly places a hood on 
           the pregnant woman’s head, before she plunges through the 
           gallows with a sickening SNAP. 

           BACK TO THE PRESENT:

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                           (wiping tears)
                        See, I do believe in God. And I 
                        believe in the Devil. And I believe 
                        in getting one’s just deserves.

           Curtin sees her pain, but can’t help to ask:  

                                 CURTIN
                        But why now? 

                                 ANNA
                        Why ever? Perhaps the Devil was 
                        waiting until we thought we were 
                        finally safe. 
                           (then, looking down)
                        I want to confess, to everyone, but 
                        I’m far too afraid. And that makes 
                        the shame even worse. 

           Overwhelmed, Anna’s eyes well with tears. 

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        I’m a sinner, Dr. Curtin. 

           Curtin takes her by the hand and turns her toward him. 

                                 CURTIN
                        We all are. 

           He wipes a tear from her cheek, leaving his hand there. 

           They lock eyes for a moment, as if about to fall into a 
           kiss... but Curtin pulls away.

                                 CURTIN (CONT’D)
                        We should be getting back. 

           EXT. ABIGAIL’S HOUSE - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

           At the top of the hill, TWO GUARDS stand watch over Abigail’s 
           home. Through a window, pale MOONLIGHT shines in to reveal --
           INT. ABIGAIL’S HOUSE - SAME TIME

           -- Abigail, as she enters her bedroom wearing only a ROBE. 
           She approaches a WOODEN CROSS on the wall -- 

           And drops her robe to the floor, revealing her naked body.  

           But what should be a beautiful figure is instead a scarred 
           and ghastly sight: Badly healed wounds on her back and arms. 
           Ribs, exposed through her starved frame. It’s clear she 
           hasn’t eaten in weeks.  

           Somewhat ceremoniously, she kneels before the cross and 
           produces a crude LEATHER SWITCH.   

           Closing her eyes, she starts reciting The Lord’s Prayer...  

           ... punctuated by HARSH LASHES to her own back.  

                                 ABIGAIL
                        Our Father, who art in Heaven--
                           (CRACK!)
                        Hallowed be thy name...
                           (wincing)
                        Thy Kingdom come... 
                           (CRACK!)
                        Thy will be done...   

           As we pull back from this gruesome display, we see an OPEN 
           BIBLE on a table behind her. Its pages softly flutter. 

                                 ABIGAIL (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                           (voice trembling)
                        ...on Earth as it is in Heaven. 

                                                           CUT TO:

           INT. ANNA’S INN - LATE NIGHT

           It’s the dead of night. As quiet as it is outside, every room 
           is hauntingly still... 

           INT. ANNA’S INN - ANNA’S BEDROOM - SAME TIME

           ...except Anna’s. She tosses in her bed, restless. A long 
           beat, then -- she’s wracked with a horrible pain.

           She lurches up in bed, wide awake, clutching her stomach. The 
           pain must be excruciating -- she can barely get out a breath. 

                                 ANNA
                        Help... Help me... 
           She kicks the sheets away, desperate to get to her feet -- 
           when the pain hits again, and she collapses to the floor. 

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        Oh, God... 
                           (then, calling out)
                        Doctor-- Doctor Curtin!

           We hear his footsteps pounding down the hall.

                                 CURTIN (O.S.)
                        Anna? 

           Dr. Curtin rushes into the room, kneels beside Anna.  

                                 ANNA
                        Help me, please...

                                 CURTIN
                           (feeling her stomach)
                        Breathe, Anna. Just breathe. 
                           (a beat, then)
                        This child is coming. Right now. 

                                 ANNA
                        But, that can’t be--

                                 CURTIN
                        It is, Anna. Now, I need you to be 
                        strong for me. Are you ready? 

           She nods, reluctantly. Curtin positions himself before her.  

                                 CURTIN (CONT’D)
                        Good. Now... push!

           Anna pushes, moaning with unbearable pain. She glances down 
           to notice BLOOD seeping through her dress. She hikes it up. 

                                 ANNA
                        Oh God! -- 

                                 CURTIN
                           (keeping calm)
                        It’s okay, Anna. You’re okay. 
                        One more time, push!

           But as Anna pushes again, we glimpse the skin of her bare 
           stomach: a bony, vertebrate shape stretches and snakes down 
           the center.   

           Curtin’s mouth drops in shock, but Anna is too preoccupied 
           with the pain, blood-stained hand squeezing the bedpost. 
           A wincing, gut-wrenching SCREAM from Anna until -- She 
           collapses in relief, and we hear the baby’s CRIES. It’s over.

           But as she leans forward to look at her child, Curtin stares 
           back in disbelief. Something has gone terribly wrong.  

                                 ANNA
                        What? What is it? 

           And as Curtin lifts the baby to show her, Anna’s eyes go wide 
           in horror. 

           CLOSE IN ON her piercing SCREAM until --  

           INT. ANNA’S INN - ANNA’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           GASP! She jolts awake in her bed. Only a dream...  

           Collecting herself, she quietly rises to notice a dim light 
           flickering from outside. She moves to her window, where she 
           spots a MAN slowly walking toward the inn. 

           Wrapping herself in a shawl, she enters the --

           INT. ANNA’S INN - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           -- hallway. She starts to make her way down the stairs... 
           when we hear the FRONT DOOR to the inn open. 

           Someone is inside. 

           Growing nervous, she looks back toward Curtin’s room, hoping 
           he’s still awake -- but his room is dark.

                                 ANNA
                           (hushed)
                        Dr. Curtin? 

           No response. She steels herself, inches closer to the stairs. 

           A beat, then -- we hear HEAVY FOOTSTEPS creaking on the 
           floorboards below. Anna reels back, cupping her mouth. 

           Then... she hears them walking up the stairs. 

           She quickly turns -- 

           INT. ANNA’S INN - ANNA’S BEDROOM - SAME TIME

           -- and slips back into her bedroom, softly closing the door 
           behind her before she hides on the other side of the bed.  
           In the darkness, she listens: the footsteps THUD-THUD-THUD 
           down the hall -- finally stopping at her door.

           The handle turns. Anna braces herself as the door creaks 
           open, and the soft glow of lantern light invades the 
           darkness. A long, tense beat, then -- 

                                 DANIEL (O.S.)
                        Anna? 

           The fear immediately drops from Anna’s face. 

                                 ANNA
                        Daniel? 

           She rises from behind the bed to see her husband, DANIEL 
           (30s), standing in the doorway. He studies her with tired 
           eyes for a moment... though he’s in no hurry to embrace her. 

                                 DANIEL
                        It’s been a long time. 

           She puts a hand over her stomach, almost ashamed.

                                 ANNA
                        I thought you weren’t arriving for 
                        months. 

                                 DANIEL
                        Our ship came south from Montauk to 
                        avoid a storm. We head out again 
                        day after tomorrow. But I heard 
                        quite intriguing news from home. 
                        And I’m here to see if it’s true... 

                                 ANNA
                        Daniel, let me explain --

                                 DANIEL
                           (growing stern)
                        Now I realize I haven’t been the 
                        husband you wanted, Anna, but this 
                        is how you shame me? 

                                 ANNA
                        Daniel, please -- 

           He inches closer, menacingly. 

                                 DANIEL
                        A child with another man?
                           (off her silence)
                        Whose is it? 
                                 ANNA
                           (shakily)
                        You don’t understand. It’s -- 
                        Things are happening in Salem. 

                                 DANIEL
                        That much I’ve gathered... 

                                 ANNA
                           (crying now)
                        Daniel--

                                 DANIEL
                        Whose?! 

                                 ANNA
                        No one’s.

           He lunges forward, pinning her against the wall. 

                                 DANIEL
                        No one’s? So you’re a whore and a 
                        liar?

                                 ANNA
                           (finally asserting 
                           herself)
                        What do you know about me? You 
                        leave me here all alone like some 
                        widow. And you’d rather abandon me 
                        than so much as touch me.

                                 DANIEL
                        You want to be touched, do you? 

           He raises a hand to STRIKE HER, when -- 

                                 CURTIN (O.S.)
                        Enough!

           -- he spins to find Curtin standing in the doorway. 

                                 DANIEL
                           (fuming, staring daggers)
                        And who might you be?

                                 CURTIN
                        What kind of man strikes a woman 
                        who’s with child? 

           Daniel laughs proudly, turning to face Curtin properly.  
                                 DANIEL
                        And what happens if I strike you 
                        instead?

                                 CURTIN
                        I’d be happy to show you. 

           Curtin isn’t the least bit afraid. He steps between Daniel 
           and Anna, never unlocking eyes with his threat. 

                                 DANIEL
                           (re: Anna’s stomach)
                        Protecting your property, are you?

                                 ANNA
                        Please... He’s only a guest... 

                                 DANIEL
                        Of course. 

           The standoff between the two men is intense. But finally -- 

                                 DANIEL (CONT’D)
                           (to Anna)
                        You’ve shamed us both. 

           Daniel slowly walks to the doorway, looking back once more.  

                                 DANIEL (CONT’D)
                        I head back out to sea the day 
                        after tomorrow. When I return, I 
                        want you and your filthy sin to be 
                        gone forever. 

           For the slightest moment, we might feel bad for how much pain 
           and embarrassment he’s feeling.  

                                 DANIEL (CONT’D)
                        I don’t care where. 

           With that, Daniel exits, leaving Curtin and an overwhelmed 
           Anna standing silent in the glow of the lantern.

           He stays by her side as she begins to weep inconsolably. 

                                                         TIME CUT:

           Anna now lies asleep in her bed. Curtin sits nearby, watching 
           her like a protective parent.

                                                           CUT TO:
           INT. ABIGAIL’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Various shots of Abigail’s house. Most notably, the empty 
           hearth, leaving everything cold and dark.   

           Abigail sleeps in her moonlit bedroom when a soft COMMOTION 
           stirs her. Two men arguing outside, in the distance.

           She sits up. Listens. Two men sound like three now... 

           EXT. ABIGAIL’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           The front door creaks open as Abigail steps out to see a 
           faint lantern light at the WELL on the edge of her yard. 

           It’s hard to see, but Constable Walker and two of his GUARDS 
           are clearly distracted by something. Wrapped only in a slim 
           coat, Abigail steps onto the snow, curious, when --  

                                 CONSTABLE WALKER (O.S.)
                        Stay back, Miss Williams! Don’t 
                        come any closer.    

           Even more intrigued now, Abigail can’t help but approach. 

                                 CONSTABLE WALKER (CONT’D)
                        I said back inside with you!

           As she walks toward them, she passes two of the WOODEN WATER 
           TOWERS, creaking from the strain they bear. She continues.  

           AT THE WELL: 

           Walker and his men stand still at the mouth of the stone 
           well, staring at something they don’t understand. 

           STEAM is rising out, clouding the winter air. Then, the 
           echoing sound of water. Boiling. 

           Walker breaks his concentration to handle Abigail’s arrival. 
           But before he can speak, he sees she is mesmerized as well.

                                 ABIGAIL
                        What is it? 

                                 CONSTABLE WALKER
                           (grabbing her arm)
                        Miss Williams, I said it’s not safe 
                        for you out here-- 

                                 ABIGAIL
                        Unhand me! This is my property, you 
                        can’t keep me prisoner. 
                                 CONSTABLE WALKER
                        That’s precisely what I can do--

                                 GUARD #1 
                        Constable! 

           His worried tone is enough to stop their quarrel. Walker 
           looks to the young Guard, who simply points to the TOWERS: 

           Where PLUMES OF STEAM rise, as well. 

                                 CONSTABLE WALKER
                           (to both Guards)
                        Ring the bells, and get the others. 
                        Now. 

           The two run dutifully into the darkness, clanging large ALARM 
           BELLS as they head for the main road. 

           EXT. ROAD - NIGHT

           A chain reaction of lookouts begins. A Lawman in the road 
           hears the bells from Abigail’s and starts ringing his own... 

           EXT. TOWN SQUARE - NIGHT

           ...which we hear in the Town Square, where another Lawman 
           clangs his bell. Villagers pour from houses, Edward included.    

           INT. ANNA’S INN - ANNA’S BEDROOM - NIGHT

           From inside Anna’s bedroom, Curtin hears the muffled ALARM 
           BELL. Realizing instantly, he rises from his chair...      

                                                          BACK TO:

           EXT. ABIGAIL’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Constable Walker walks with Abigail to safety, quickly but 
           cautiously, across the snowy yard.    

           But they stop as they reach TOWERS, rumbling, wood sweating. 
           Walker lifts his lantern for a better look when --   

           WHOOSH! Glass blows out as the lantern BURSTS INTO FLAMES!  

           The sleeve of his cloak ignited, Walker drops to the snow.

                                 CONSTABLE WALKER
                        Miss Walker, run! 
           Abigail takes off in a panic, but stops to see if Walker’s 
           all right. When she sees: 

           The FLAME from the lantern, snaking atop the snow, moving 
           with a will of its own. A TRAIL OF FIRE in its wake.

                                 ABIGAIL
                        Dear God... 

           It begins to crawl toward her. Her eyes go wide. 

                                 CONSTABLE WALKER
                           (extinguishing his sleeve)
                        Run!  

           This time, she heeds his advice.

           AT THE EDGE OF THE PROPERTY: 

           A group of VILLAGERS races toward the yard, when from their 
           ranks, hooves clop, and Curtin BURSTS through on horseback.  

           He races up the hill, his horse leaping the fire.  

           He passes Walker, glancing to make sure he’s okay. When he 
           looks back, Abigail has reached the house. 

           The trail of fire follows... 

           INT. ABIGAIL’S HOUSE - SAME TIME

           SLAM! Abigail shoves the door shut, panting for breath in the 
           sudden quiet. Then, almost immediately:

                                 ABIGAIL
                           (frantic)
                        Our Father, who art in heaven, 
                        hallowed be thy name --

           Then, as SMOKE begins to curl beneath the doorway, she hears 
           Curtin’s voice on the other side: 

                                 CURTIN (O.S.)
                        Abigail! Abigail, can you hear me?!

           Backing away slowly, she sees a HOT ORANGE GLOW lining the 
           frame of her door. It’s coming inside... 
           EXT. ABIGAIL’S HOUSE - SAME TIME

           Curtin shoulders the locked door to no avail as flames climb 
           the house. Behind him, Edward and the Villagers arrive to 
           assist.

                                 CURTIN
                        It won’t budge!   

           The Villagers rush the door as well. 

           AT THE TOWERS:

           A Villager pulls a ROPE to release a flood of water from the 
           Tower’s chute door -- but all that comes out is a curl of 
           steam, searing the frigid air. The water has boiled away. 

           He stares up in disbelief -- 

           INT. ABIGAIL’S HOUSE - SAME TIME

           Inside, Abigail turns to face a LARGE CROSS on the opposite 
           wall. Resigned now, she calmly kneels, bows her head... 

                                 ABIGAIL
                           (finishing)
                        Thy kingdom come, thy will be done. 
                        On earth...

           EXT. ABIGAIL’S HOUSE - SAME TIME

           Curtin braces himself for one final push when he looks back: 

           The end of the fire trail, coming back to life, races 
           straight for the house!

                                 CURTIN
                           (to Villagers)
                        Look out!

           INT. ABIGAIL’S HOUSE - SAME TIME

                                 ABIGAIL
                           (finishing)
                        ...as it is in heaven. 

           EXT. ABIGAIL’S HOUSE - SAME TIME

           Curtin shoves the other Villagers out of the way of the fire 
           when -- WHOOOSH!! 
           He and the others are thrown to the ground as Abigail’s house 
           is suddenly ENGULFED in flames!  

           The Villagers shield their faces, but Curtin lies prone on 
           the ground, eyes locked on the roaring flames as they lick 
           the night sky. 

           A disorienting moment, then... 

                                 EDWARD (O.S.)
                        Dr. Curtin? Dr. Curtin?!    

           He looks up to see Edward kneeling over him. 

                                 EDWARD (CONT’D)
                        Are you all right, sir?  

           But Curtin can’t respond. His stare, fixed on the crumbling 
           house. CLOSE ON the reflection of the flames in his eyes.      

                                                           CUT TO:

           EXT. CEMETERY - DAY

           The next day. We look on as Villagers huddle for Abigail’s 
           modest funeral. As Reverend Parris says a prayer, a stupefied 
           Curtin catches several looks that say only one thing: 

           We tried to warn you.

                                 CURTIN (V.O.)
                        Judge Morrow, despite my greatest 
                        effort and most earnest devotion, 
                        the events I’ve witnessed in the 
                        village of Salem have left me 
                        unable to provide a rational 
                        explanation for their cause...

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. ABIGAIL’S HOUSE - DAY

           Several Workers shovel and wheelbarrow, clearing the charred 
           remains of Abigail’s house. 

                                 CURTIN (V.O.)
                        It is with deep regret that I must 
                        resign my position forthwith.

           One young man overturns a pile of wreckage to find -- 
                                  Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

           A BIBLE. Covered in soot, but intact. Stopping for a moment, 
           he kneels to pick it up. We CLOSE ON the bible... 

                                                     MATCH CUT TO:

           INT. ANNA’S INN - CURTIN’S ROOM - DAY

           The WITCH TRIAL BOOK rests on Curtin’s desk. Beside it, 
           Curtin dips a PEN into an inkwell and finishes his letter. 

                                 CURTIN (V.O.)
                        Sincerely. Doctor Robert Curtin.

           He lights a wax seal and stamps it onto the letter’s fold. 

           Then, sitting at his desk, reflecting on all that’s happened, 
           he hears CRYING, down the hall. 

           He rises, glancing at his packed bags. 

           INT. ANNA’S INN - ANNA’S ROOM - DAY

           Anna faces the window, like we first saw her, lost in 
           thought, when Curtin enters.  

                                 CURTIN
                        Anna...

           She releases the tears she was holding back. He rushes to 
           console her.   

                                 CURTIN (CONT’D)
                        I know how hard this must be, but 
                        give Daniel time--

                                 ANNA
                           (almost snapping)
                        It’s not just Daniel. Don’t you 
                        see?
                           (through tears)
                        I’m so frightened. Abigail is 
                        dead... And now... 

           She can hardly form her words. 

                                 CURTIN
                        Anna, it’s over.

                                 ANNA
                        How can you say that? Look at me. 
                        You saw it with your own eyes. It’s 
                        happening. And I’m next. 
                                 CURTIN
                        Please. I’m leaving soon. And I 
                        wish you’d come with me. To deliver 
                        your child safely. I can protect 
                        you. 

                                 ANNA
                        You haven’t protected anyone yet. 
                        What makes me any different? 

           Off Curtin, realizing just how painfully true that is -- 

           FOOTSTEPS. They turn to see Edward rushing to the doorway. 

                                 EDWARD
                           (worried)
                        Dr. Curtin... You’ve been summoned 
                        to the square.

                                                           CUT TO:

           EXT. TOWN SQUARE - DAY

           Curtin and Anna approach the town square to find a NOISY 
           CROWD growing LOUDER at their arrival. Standing high above 
           them, acting as ringleader: a SCARRED and embittered 
           Constable Walker. 

           Dr. Griggs stands in the back, quickly turning to Curtin:  

                                 DR. GRIGGS
                        They won’t listen to me. They’re 
                        becoming a mob.   

                                 CONSTABLE WALKER
                           (spotting Curtin)
                        Ah, the good doctor arrives! Tell 
                        us, Doctor, what say you?

           Curtin scans the angry faces, confused. 

                                 CURTIN
                        I don’t... 

                                 CONSTABLE WALKER
                           (accusingly)
                        Why is our livestock still sick?  

           Curtin suddenly realizes where this is going. 

                                 VILLAGER #1
                        My dogs are frenzied as well!     
                                  Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

           Before Curtin can respond, MR. COOKE pushes his way through. 

                                 MR. COOKE
                        And my grain. Fallen again to rot!     

           Curtin sees the fear in their eyes masked as anger. Paranoia 
           reaching a boiling point. 

           Careful not to react, he glances in the direction of the 
           CHURCH, where REVEREND PARRIS stands, looking on.   

                                 CURTIN
                        Please. If you’ll hear me out, I’m 
                        sure we can-- 

                                 CONSTABLE WALKER
                        It’ll do you no good to deny the 
                        curse on this town now, Doctor. I 
                        stood in its way and nearly met my 
                        death. 
                           (then)
                        But it got what it came for. The 
                        Widow Abigail was the last accuser. 
                        If she’s been taken, why are we 
                        still afflicted so?    

           The crowd SHOUTS and MURMURS in support. Anna looks to 
           Curtin, suffocated by guilt. 

                                 CURTIN
                        I’m sorry if I’ve failed you. But --

                                 JUDGE MORROW (O.S.)
                           (calling out)
                        She was not the last. 

           Everyone turns to find JUDGE MORROW approaching the scene.

                                 JUDGE MORROW (CONT’D)
                           (then, pointedly)
                        She was not the last. 

           Judge Morrow’s friendly countenance has disappeared, and he 
           stares at Anna and Curtin with a newfound disdain.   

           Whispers run through the crowd. 

                                 JUDGE MORROW (CONT’D)
                        April the 3rd, 1692. 

           He produces a LARGE HANDWRITTEN DOCUMENT; displays it.
                                 JUDGE MORROW (CONT’D)
                        The sworn testimony of the child 
                        Anna Burgess given to the late 
                        Judge Hathorne of Salem Village.           

           Anna cups a hand to her mouth, horrified. 

                                 JUDGE MORROW (CONT’D)
                        Expunged from public record, but 
                        recently brought to light. In it, 
                        she accuses the condemned Constance 
                        White of carrying the Devil’s 
                        child.  
                           (directs his gaze to Anna)
                        And here today she stands before 
                        us, silent as we suffer. 
                           (then, with potency)
                        Carrying child. A child not 
                        conceived by any man. 

           All turn to Anna -- venom in their eyes. 

           Protectively, Edward shouts out:

                                 EDWARD
                        This can’t be true! There must be a 
                        mistake.   

                                 JUDGE MORROW
                        It’s true. 
                           (coldly)
                        ‘Twas brought to light by someone 
                        who knows.   

           We find DANIEL in the back of the crowd, narrowing his eyes, 
           silently satisfied watching Anna’s torment.

                                 JUDGE MORROW (CONT’D)
                        Well, Miss Downing?

           Anna closes her eyes, breathes deeply, and does what she’s 
           waited an entire lifetime to do:     

                                 ANNA
                           (calling out)
                        It’s true.

           The crowd starts to quiet. 

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        All of it. I confess.
                           (then)
                        And even if I beg your mercy... I 
                        am still damned.                   
           As she looks out, awaiting her judgment, we see that she is 
           now free.  Alleviated from the burden she’s carried so long.   

           But then, a FEMALE VILLAGER screams out with vitriol:    

                                 FEMALE VILLAGER
                        She’s carrying the Devil’s child! 
                        Hang her!    

           The crowd ignites.

                                 VILLAGER #1
                        Take the child! 

           Curtin moves to protect Anna. She guards her stomach, growing 
           overwhelmed and faint.    

           The mob, possessed with hatred, closes in until --    

                                 DR. GRIGGS
                        Keep back from her! 

           -- Griggs thrusts himself between Anna and the crowd, but 
           they push forward.   

                                 DR. GRIGGS (CONT’D)
                           (then, forcefully)
                        God is watching! 

           This somehow keeps them at bay for a moment... 

                                 DR. GRIGGS (CONT’D)
                        And casting out evil does not make 
                        your actions just. We learned our 
                        lesson last time, did we not? This 
                        woman will live. And I shall 
                        personally see her child to term. 
                        We let God judge us now. 
                           (adding)
                        God alone. 

           The crowd remains quiet, staring daggers at Griggs, Curtin, 
           and Anna... But lets them go. 

           As Griggs carries off Anna with care, Curtin looks back to 
           the church one last time. 

           Reverend Parris meets his gaze. Then, with indifference, 
           simply turns and goes back inside.    

                                 CURTIN
                           (stoically, to the crowd)
                        I’ll be gone in the morning. 
           And with that, he heads to catch up with Griggs and Anna. 

                                                           CUT TO:

           INT. ANNA’S INN - CURTIN’S ROOM - DUSK

           Later. Curtin prepares to leave, placing several items in his 
           bags. Everything he’s worked for, defeated. 

           INT. ANNA’S INN - ANNA’S ROOM - SAME TIME

           In her own room, Anna lies in bed, placing a hand on her 
           stomach with a faraway stare... But she forces back tears, 
           this time.  

           Instead, her eyes drift to the JAR OF HERBS Curtin had left 
           for her. She studies the leaves inside, potent, toxic. 

           She pulls one out... 

           Then all the rest...

                                                          FADE TO:

           EXT. SALEM VILLAGE - ESTABLISHING - MORNING

           The next day. The morning sun struggles to pierce through 
           gray clouds. In the distance, a BELL from the docks calls 
           sailors to board. 

           EXT. DOCKS - MORNING

           At the docks, several CREWMEN and DOCKWORKERS load a large 
           ship as Daniel approaches with his bags.  

                                 CREWMAN 
                           (loading gear)
                        Underway boys! 

           Daniel looks back toward the inn one last time. Then boards. 

           EXT. CEMETERY - MORNING

           In the cemetery, blanketed with snow, Curtin stares pensively 
           at the four humble graves of the women who have died. 

                                                           CUT TO:
           EXT. SALEM VILLAGE - MORNING

           Later. Curtin walks to the inn to collect his things when --      

                                 EDWARD (O.S.)
                           (softly)
                        Dr. Curtin. 

           He looks up to see Edward, removing his hat, a look of grief 
           bringing him nearly to tears. 

                                 EDWARD (CONT’D)
                        It’s Anna... 

           When he steps aside, Curtin sees that a SMALL CROWD has 
           gathered at the entrance of the inn... 

           Dr. Griggs is somberly loading a CARRIAGE.   

           Curtin hurries his pace. 

           EXT. ANNA’S INN - MORNING

           Griggs spots Curtin approaching, tries his best to keep him 
           from getting any closer. 

                                 DR. GRIGGS
                        Dr. Curtin, there’s nothing we can 
                        do now--

                                 CURTIN
                        What happened?

                                 DR. GRIGGS
                           (trying to prepare him)
                        Dr. Curtin, please-- 

           But Curtin pushes past Dr. Griggs, pulling back the 
           carriage’s drape to reveal: 

           Anna. Lying on her back, dead.

                                 DR. GRIGGS (CONT’D)
                        She passed sometime in the night.

           Curtin, for the first time, is truly overwhelmed. 

                                 DR. GRIGGS (CONT’D)
                        This was by her bedside. She took 
                        the entire jar.

           Griggs produces the EMPTY HERB JAR. 
                                 CURTIN
                        No...

           The crowd looks on with indifference -- MERCER among them.

                                 DR. GRIGGS
                        The child had no chance. 
                           (then, for all to hear)
                        Neither of them had a chance!

           He shuts the carriage door.

                                 DR. GRIGGS (CONT’D)
                           (to Curtin)
                        I’m sorry, Doctor.

           But Curtin is speechless. Dumbfounded. 

           Griggs mounts the horse at the front of the carriage. Looks 
           to the crowd one final time:  

                                 DR. GRIGGS (CONT’D)
                        She doesn’t deserve to be buried 
                        among the likes of you. I’m taking 
                        her to be properly put to rest. 
                           (then, gravely)
                        Shame on all of you.  

           He snaps the reins and rides away.  

           Curtin watches Anna go... then turns back to the crowd.

           A long, tense beat as he tempers his rage, staring at their 
           callous faces. Then --    

                                 CURTIN
                        You... All of you did this. 

           He raises his voice for any passerby to hear. 

                                 CURTIN (CONT’D)
                        Not a curse. Not the Devil. You. 
                           (then)
                        I came here to help you. To prevent 
                        a town from once again becoming 
                        gripped by its own unreason.
                           (scanning the crowd)
                        All of you let this happen. And 
                        you’ve learned nothing. Sacrificing 
                        your own in the name of judgment. 
                        Turning on each other like dogs. 
                        Casting blame for your own sins. 
                        Your misfortunes. Your sickness--       
           And with that, Mercer LUNGES at Curtin through the crowd, 
           GRIPS him by the throat and SLAMS him to the ground.

                                 EDWARD
                        No! 

           Edward charges to defend him, but a Villager restrains him.  

                                 EDWARD (CONT’D)
                           (struggling)
                        Let me go! 
                           (to Mercer)
                        Unhand him!  

           But Mercer only squeezes tighter, pinning Curtin with all his 
           force. 

                                 MERCER
                        I think you have it wrong, Doctor. 
                        We don’t blame each other. 

                                 EDWARD
                        Stop! He can’t breathe! 

                                 MERCER
                           (to Curtin)
                        How many women have died since your 
                        arrival? 

           Curtin turns red, struggling to breathe.  Mercer stares into 
           his eyes, relishing, happy to kill him right here.     

                                 MERCER (CONT’D)
                        How many? 

           Curtin’s eyes pop. His mouth gulps in vain. Then -- 

                                 CONSTABLE WALKER (O.S.)
                        Mr. Mercer.  

           Mercer looks up to see Constable Walker arriving with JUDGE 
           MORROW. But he doesn’t loosen his grip on Curtin. 

                                 CONSTABLE WALKER (CONT’D)
                        Let him go. 

           Judge Morrow gives an assertive nod, and after a long beat, 
           Mercer finally releases him.  

           Curtin COUGHS and rolls on his side, gasping for air. 
                                 CONSTABLE WALKER (CONT’D)
                           (to Mercer)
                        Dr. Curtin here already thinks us 
                        an angry mob.

           Curtin, grateful for the mercy, still can’t speak... 

                                 CONSTABLE WALKER (CONT’D)
                        He came with the expectation of 
                        order. And justice. So that is what 
                        we shall serve him.     
                           (to Curtin)
                        Dr. Robert Curtin, the court of 
                        Salem Village and the Commonwealth 
                        of the Massachusetts Bay colony 
                        hereby charges you with the high 
                        crimes of blasphemy, conjuring, and 
                        murder.

           Curtin rises to his knees, depleted. He looks to Judge 
           Morrow, who cowardly lowers his head. 

           Clearly, they’ve swept him in their fervor. 

                                 CURTIN
                        This is madness. What murder? 

                                 CONSTABLE WALKER
                        The murder of Abigail Williams, -- 

                                 CURTIN
                        Impossible! You were there. You 
                        were all there!

                                 CONSTABLE WALKER
                           (continuing)
                        The murder of Susannah Sheldon... 

                                 EDWARD
                        No--!

                                 CONSTABLE WALKER
                        The murder of Rebecca Truman. The 
                        murder of Mary Walcott...  

           Curtin realizes how powerless he is against their ignorance.  

           Too weak to fight, he lets Walker finish... 

                                 CONSTABLE WALKER (CONT’D)
                        And the murder of Betty Hubbard. 

           Mercer takes a special satisfaction in this one. 
           Constable Walker gestures for two Lawmen to hoist Curtin to 
           his feet. 

           He then approaches him, locking eyes, uncomfortably close. 

                                 CURTIN
                           (weakly)
                        Please. Think of what you’re doing.

                                 CONSTABLE WALKER
                        We’ll try you properly. As you 
                        wish. And you’ll be hanged.    

           He nods to the Lawmen, who drag Curtin away... 

                                 EDWARD
                           (struggling)
                        No, you can’t do this! 
                           (calling out)
                        Sir! Sir! 

           EXT. TOWN CENTER - MOMENTS LATER

           As Curtin is marched through the village, doors open and 
           faces emerge in windows, all with malice in their eyes.       

           Salem has devolved into what it once was.  

                                                           CUT TO:

           INT. JAIL - DAY

           In a dark stone hallway, Curtin is thrown into a cold iron 
           CELL. He falls to the ground, doesn’t even try to stand. 

           Constable Walker SLAMS the gate and turns the lock.   

                                 CONSTABLE WALKER
                           (walking off)
                        Sleep well, Doctor. 

           CLOSE ON Curtin, left alone to his fate.

                                                      DISSOLVE TO:

           EXT. SALEM VILLAGE - ESTABLISHING - NIGHT

           We canvass Salem in the dead of night: the empty TOWN SQUARE. 
           Icicles hanging from the cross on the CHURCH. ANNA’S INN, now 
           abandoned. And a view of the MOON through dead tree branches.         
           The SOUND OF KEYS TURNING A LOCK brings us to -- 

           INT. JAIL - NIGHT

           -- Curtin’s cell. As the jailhouse door opens, a bar of 
           moonlight illuminates the corridor and a SHADOW approaches.   

           Curtin slowly rises to find REVEREND PARRIS. 

           Parris approaches the bars of the cell. Curtin is more than 
           surprised to see him, especially at this hour.  

                                 CURTIN
                        Reverend Parris...

                                 REVEREND PARRIS
                        You and I have never seen eye to 
                        eye, Doctor. And now, the entire 
                        town has been persuaded by my 
                        conviction. The only person still 
                        defending you is that foolish boy 
                        Edward, who’s always been too 
                        loyal, despite my warnings. 
                           (beat)
                        But he’s right. 
                           (off Curtin’s surprise)
                        For years, I’ve tried my best to 
                        guide this village down the moral 
                        path. Along the way, I’ve done 
                        things I’m not proud of. 

           As we feel the burden of his regrets, he lifts his keys and 
           UNLOCKS Curtin’s cell.  

                                 REVEREND PARRIS (CONT’D)
                        You’ve committed no crime. And I 
                        ask your forgiveness for what this 
                        town has done to you.

                                 CURTIN
                        But Reverend... my trial... Surely 
                        they’ll want someone to blame.

                                 REVEREND PARRIS
                        Then we should blame ourselves. I 
                        will not allow us to hang an 
                        innocent man. Salem has enough 
                        blood on its hands.
                           (beat, off Curtin’s look)
                        Edward has prepared a carriage. 
                        Boston is no further than a night’s 
                        ride.    
                                  Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

           There’s a kind, unspoken regard between them. Finally: 

                                 CURTIN
                        Thank you for your faith in me.  

           Reverend Parris gives a respectful nod as Curtin exits.

           EXT. JAIL - NIGHT

           Outside the jailhouse, Curtin’s carriage awaits. Edward 
           stands, holding the horse’s reins, and tips his hat.    

                                 CURTIN
                        It’s good to see you, Edward. 

                                 EDWARD
                           (with a reverent nod)
                        And you, sir. 
                           (then)
                        Your bags are all stowed.

                                 CURTIN
                        Actually... 

           He reaches for his UTILITY BAG, hands it to Edward.

                                 CURTIN (CONT’D)
                        I should hope you can take care of 
                        my things from now on. Being my 
                        assistant and all.

                                 EDWARD
                        But sir, -- 

                                 CURTIN
                        No. Please... I’m not sure they’re 
                        much use to me anymore.  

           Edward studies the bag, then looks to Curtin, confused.      

                                 CURTIN (CONT’D)
                           (forcing a smile)
                        Goodbye, Edward. 

           Curtin climbs the carriage, snaps the horse’s reins. 

           Reverend Parris joins Edward’s side. Together, they watch as 
           Curtin’s carriage disappears into the woods.

                                                    FADE TO BLACK.

                                                       OVER BLACK:
           The RINGING BELLS of a DOCKYARD bring us to -- 

           EXT. BOSTON - ESTABLISHING - MORNING

           -- the bustling city of BOSTON. Vibrant sounds and colors, 
           cobblestone streets, children laughing and playing.  

           A far cry from Salem. 

           We hear the CLATTER of Curtin’s carriage as he guides it 
           through the streets. Eventually, he arrives -- 

           EXT. BOSTON STREET - MORNING

           -- at a LARGE WHITE HOUSE. He dismounts his carriage and 
           walks to the door, where he is greeted by a familiar face:   

           DR. GRIGGS. As Curtin approaches, Griggs cracks a warm smile. 

                                 DR. GRIGGS
                        Quite the dangerous plan, Dr. 
                        Curtin. For a moment, I thought you 
                        decided to stay in Salem. 

                                 CURTIN
                        I suppose I owe a debt to the good 
                        Reverend Parris. 
                           (then)
                        How is she? 

           Griggs opens the door wider. 

                                 DR. GRIGGS
                        Come see for yourself. 

           INT. LARGE HOUSE - MORNING

           He leads Curtin through the winding hallways to find --

           INT. LARGE HOUSE - BEDROOM - MORNING

           Anna. Alive and well, lying on a bed...  

           Cradling her NEWBORN BABY. It softly coos in her arms as Anna 
           looks up to Curtin with a smile.

                                 ANNA
                        Look. A miracle.   

           Curtin gives a warm smile back.  
                                 CURTIN
                        That’s right. A miracle.  
                           (then)
                        I trust Dr. Griggs has been taking 
                        good care of you both. 

                                 ANNA
                        He has. 
                           (then, shifting)
                        But what about the others? Do they 
                        suspect anything?

                                 CURTIN
                        It’s nothing to be concerned about. 
                        You’re safe now, that’s all that 
                        matters. They won’t find you here.

           EXT. SALEM VILLAGE - MORNING

           Harsh and violent YELLS ring out over a CLOSE-UP of two boot-
           heels being dragged through the dirt.

           Pull back to reveal a MOB OF VILLAGERS (nearly everyone in 
           Salem), rabid, irate, pulling Reverend Parris through town.

           Constable Walker leads their vengeful march.  

                                 CONSTABLE WALKER
                           (as he marches, to Parris)
                        You knew better than to set him 
                        free, Reverend. 
                           (yelling, to the others)
                        Find Morrow! And the boy, too.   

           INT. MORROW’S HOME - MOMENTS LATER

           Inside his quiet cabin, Judge Morrow looks out his window in 
           fear. We hear the groan of the mob getting closer. 

           CRASH! A brick is hurled through the second window. As he 
           looks to it, the door is kicked open and a wave of villagers 
           shuffles through.

                                 JUDGE MORROW
                        No! Please, wait-- 

           But like a pack of wolves, they surround and seize him. The 
           sound of the chaos swells until --
           EXT. ANNA’S INN - SAME TIME

           It’s quiet. Outside Anna’s inn, the town appears empty. The 
           roar of the mob but a faint sound in the distance.

           INT. ANNA’S ROOM - MORNING

           Inside, we find Edward peeking out from Curtin’s upstairs 
           window, clearly hiding from the maelstrom outside. 

           He turns, back to the wall, sliding down, safe for now. 

           Then, after a beat, he hears something outside. Hooves 
           CLOPPING. A carriage arriving.  

           As he cautiously peeks back out the window, we are taken -- 

           EXT. ANNA’S INN - MORNING

           -- back outside, where a CARRIAGE pulls up to the inn’s 
           entrance, and a MAN and his DRIVER step down.  

           INT. ANNA’S ROOM - SAME TIME

           Edward clearly doesn’t recognize the man, and while he isn’t 
           afraid of him, he is afraid of the attention he might draw.    

           Boom-Boom-Boom. The door, downstairs. Edward stays hidden.   

                                 MAN (O.S.)
                           (muffled, from outside)
                        Hello? Is anyone around? 

           EXT. ANNA’S INN - MORNING

           Finally, the door opens, and Edward studies the strange 
           visitor: well-dressed, early 50s, a confident air about him. 

                                 MAN
                        Ah. Young man. I was looking for 
                        the owner of the inn. A Miss Anna 
                        Downing? 

                                 EDWARD
                        She’s, um. She’s gone, sir. 

           Edward shifts his gaze around, making sure no one’s outside. 
                                  Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

                                 MAN
                        Very well. Perhaps you could direct 
                        me to Judge William Morrow, then. 
                        He might not be expecting me today, 
                        but he’ll know my purpose. My name 
                        is Doctor Robert Curtin. 

           Edward looks up at the man, confused. Did he just hear that?

                                 EDWARD
                        Say again? 

                                 MAN
                        Dr. Robert Curtin, from London. I 
                        was due here weeks ago, but there 
                        were complications in my travel. If 
                        I could-- 

                                 EDWARD
                        I’m sorry, sir, there must be some 
                        mistake. You say your name is 
                        Curtin? Summoned by Judge Morrow? 
                        To look after Betty Hubbard?

                                 MAN
                           (curious)
                        How do you know that? 

           Edward starts to go dizzy with a sinking feeling in his gut. 

                                 EDWARD
                           (faintly)
                        That’s... That’s not possible. 

                                 MAN
                        Sorry? 
                           (off Edward’s silence)
                        My boy, are you all right?

           Edward finally looks back at Curtin -- the real Dr. Curtin -- 
           with a sudden horror in his eyes. 

                                 EDWARD
                        Excuse me, I must--

                                 ANGRY VILLAGER (O.S.)
                        There he is!  

           Edward looks up to see an ANGRY VILLAGER near the inn, joined 
           quickly by four others, staring daggers. 

                                                           CUT TO:
                                  Blue (mm/dd/yyyy)

           INT. LARGE HOUSE - BEDROOM - MORNING

           The room in Boston. Anna holds the baby, looks up to Curtin, 
           comfortable, safe. Only now, we know she is anything but. 

           Everything we knew about Curtin has just changed.

                                 CURTIN
                        Dr. Griggs? Would you mind giving 
                        us a moment? 

           Griggs complies. Closes the door behind him. 

           Curtin gently touches the baby’s head. It squirms peacefully.  

                                 ANNA
                        He likes you. 

           Curtin smiles. 

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        So what’s next? Back to London?    

                                 CURTIN
                        To wherever I’m needed next.

                                 ANNA
                        Right. Well. Thank you. 
                           (before he can respond)
                        For everything. Thank you. 

           Curtin looks down at the coddled baby. Then to Anna. 

                                 CURTIN
                        Of course.  
                           (then)
                        I’m just happy to have taught you 
                        your lesson. 

           She dotes on the baby, absently smiling. 

                                 ANNA
                        What lesson is that? 

           The subtlest sinister grin creeps on Curtin’s face as he 
           approaches the foot of the bed. 

                                 CURTIN
                        You’ve done well, Anna.

           Using the crook of his finger, Curtin reaches out and PULLS 
           ANNA’S BLANKET down toward him.   

           There’s something unsettlingly familiar about this...
           Suddenly, Anna goes pale, realizing the unthinkable:

           In brief cuts, we see flashes of Anna’s dream: In her Salem 
           bedroom, the silhouette of the man, pulling the covers in the 
           exact same manner...  

           ...the passionate lovemaking, but this time, the man lifts 
           his face into the candlelight to reveal CURTIN. 

                                 ANNA
                        No... It can’t be...

           Just then, the door slowly CREAKS open.

           Anna turns to see an OLD WOMAN, CLOAKED IN BLACK, with 
           stringy white hair and pale skin, trailed by TWO OTHERS. 
           Their cloaks drag on the floor. 

           Curtin seems to be expecting them. He hands the blanket to 
           one of the women. Anna looks confused.

           The Women move through the room with purpose... 

                                 CURTIN
                        Now it’s time to say goodbye. 

           Without a word, the two women pin Anna down as the Old Woman 
           pulls the baby from her arms.

                                 ANNA
                        What are you doing!? STOP! Let go! 

           The baby starts to WAIL as the Old Woman wraps him in the 
           blanket and cradles him. 

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                        Don’t touch him! Don’t touch him!  

                                 CURTIN
                        Goodbye, Anna. 

           The Women release Anna, but when she tries to move from her 
           bed, she’s wracked with pain. 

                                 ANNA
                           (to Curtin)
                        Why?! Dr. Curtin! 

           But Curtin turns his back on her, and follows the Women out 
           of the room.

                                 ANNA (CONT’D)
                           (shouting)
                        Help! Someone, please! 
           As they leave, the Old Woman turns back to Anna and we 
           finally get a good look at her face: 

           Pale skin, with stringy black hair, she stares back at Anna 
           with TWO DIFFERENT-COLORED EYES. One blue. One brown. 

           It’s a face we’ve seen before. The Witch from our flashback.

                                 OLD WOMAN
                        Thank you, Goody Downing. 

           And with that, Curtin and the Women leave with Anna’s child. 

           Anna stumbles from her bed, collapsing in pain. She drags 
           herself toward the doorway. 

                                 ANNA
                        No. Oh, God, please...  

           As Anna SCREAMS, desperate for help, we move out through the 
           house, following the BABY’S WAIL --

           INT. LARGE HOUSE - ENTRYWAY - MORNING

           -- to the entryway, where DR. GRIGGS lies dead on the ground, 
           eyes open, his neck twisted to a grotesque angle.

           EXT. LARGE HOUSE/INT. CARRIAGE - MORNING

           Curtin and the Women exit with an eerie calmness, entering a 
           small CARRIAGE that awaits them.  

           The muffled SCREAMS from inside the house bleed into the 
           noise of the bustling city.  

           And as we watch the carriage disappear down the road, we HEAR 
           Reverend Parris’ warning once more. 

                                 REVEREND PARRIS (V.O.)
                        People always say they can never 
                        know God’s plan...

           Then, in a final SERIES OF SHOTS: 

           EXT. SALEM VILLAGE - TOWN SQUARE - MORNING

           The Four Angry Villagers drag a struggling Edward through the 
           town square as the MOB curses and spits as he passes by. 
                                 EDWARD
                           (yelling in vain)
                        Please! Stop! This is exactly what 
                        he wants! 

                                 REVEREND PARRIS (V.O.)
                        ...but they’re always so bold as to 
                        think they understand the 
                        intentions of the Devil...

           EXT. WOODS - MORNING

           At the outskirts of town, we pan across the overgrown 
           GRAVEYARD housing the dead Witches from the trials.   

                                 REVEREND PARRIS (V.O.)
                        But you’d be a fool not to think 
                        that the Devil, just like the 
                        Lord...

           INT. CARRIAGE - MORNING

           As the carriage rattles down a small path, we see the Old 
           Woman cradling ANNA’S BABY. She pulls back its blanket...

           CLOSE ON the baby’s tiny foot... And we see it: 

           The SAME MARK from Curtin’s hand. The Mark of the Devil.  

                                 REVEREND PARRIS (V.O.)
                        ...works in mysterious ways.

           The sound of CHURCH BELLS swells all around, bringing us --

           EXT. SALEM VILLAGE - GALLOWS HILL - DAY

           -- right back to Gallows Hill in Salem, where the entire 
           village stands before a WOODEN SCAFFOLD, identical to our 
           opening scene.

           Lined on the scaffold stand JUDGE MORROW, REVEREND PARRIS, 
           and EDWARD -- each with nooses strung around their necks.

           The floorboards creak under Constable Walker’s boots as he 
           approaches them.  

                                 CONSTABLE WALKER
                        Any last words, then?

           Parris says nothing. Morrow closes his eyes in defeat. 
           Edward’s eyes dart with desperation.    
                                 CONSTABLE WALKER (CONT’D)
                        Very well. 

           Constable Walker looks to the hungry crowd, then personally 
           walks over to the lever, ready to pull.  

           CLOSE ON young THOMAS, the boy from earlier, watching just as 
           Anna did fifteen years ago, through a child’s eyes. 

           SNAP! The three drop through gallows.

           As the crowd looks on, satisfied, we realize...

           The Devil has finally finished what he started. 

           Church bells RING a final time and we -- 

                                                    SMASH TO BLACK.

                                   END OF FILM.
