           INT. NEWS STUDIO - EVENING

           CLOSE UP on COLIN WESTON, 43, as preened and manicured as can 
           be. Meticulous hair, suit, and gaze. Too handsome for high 
           Cronkite drama. Too much charm for national seriousness. He’s 
           local all the way.

                                 WESTON
                        What are we talking about? We’re 
                        talking about people that declare 
                        themselves leaders. They’re asking 
                        something of us... they ask us to 
                        believe. Maybe the hardest thing 
                        possible. Do you believe in me? Do 
                        you want me?  
                             (beat)
                        You’re asking for a character 
                        judgement. You’re asking for 
                        something both intimate and 
                        personal. 

           The voice from above. It almost comes from nowhere:

                                 VOICE (O.C.)
                        That’s great, Wes. Nice close. Take 
                        us home.

           Weston pauses hard. The camera doesn’t break. It yearns for 
           his gleaming teeth to flash. Weston breaks right.

                                 WESTON 
                        Councilman Wyatt...

           A 45-year-old basks in the local spotlight, however faux-
           humbly. A head tilt, a slight blush.

                                 WESTON (CONT’D)
                        ...in a political landscape riddled 
                        with paranoia, with injustice, with 
                        ennui... how do you pretend to 
                        represent the will of the people?

           Councilman Wyatt doesn’t hesitate a beat.

                                 COUNCILMAN WYATT
                        Well, that’s easy Colin. I don’t 
                        pretend. I listen, and then I act.

                                 WESTON
                        Do you have your sights on the 
                        governor’s mansion?
                                 COUNCILMAN WYATT
                        I opened an exploratory committee.

           He smiles contentedly. Weston turns back to the camera.

                                 WESTON
                        Councilman Gregory Wyatt, man of 
                        the people. I’m Colin Weston, and 
                        this has been a Local Profile. For 
                        Susan Sanchez and all of us here at 
                        KPTV, good night.

           Theme music starts to play. Pleasant and familiar. The camera 
           pulls out revealing co-anchor SUSAN SANCHEZ, 36, to Weston’s 
           right. They all grin and shuffle papers as the lights change 
           and the camera swoops out. Councilman Wyatt smiles in the 
           fading TV glow.

                                 VOICE (O.C.)
                        Pulling out. You nailed it again, 
                        Wes. We’re good in five, four...

           Camera is back and we see the full newsroom studio for KPTV 
           Phoenix, Channel 4. They wait for the all clear.

                                 SUSAN SANCHEZ
                        Ennui?

                                 WESTON
                        Means boredom.

                                 SUSAN SANCHEZ
                        I don’t think it does.

                                 VOICE (O.C.)
                        ...two, one... and we’re clear.

           Immediately Weston rears a fist back and DECKS Councilman 
           Wyatt full on. Nearly knocks him out of his seat.

                                 WESTON
                        You’re such a lying sack of shit, 
                        Greg. I did you a fucking favor 
                        giving you this spot.

           Wyatt is shocked stupid, hand to jaw. 

                                 COUNCILMAN WYATT
                        What the hell...?

           Susan’s eyes light up, more excited interest than worry.

                                 SUSAN SANCHEZ
                        Holy shit!
           INT. NEWS STUDIO - CONTROL BOOTH - CONTINUOUS

           PAUL DAVIS, 40, the voice in the sky, but really the handler, 
           blanches with familiar annoyance.

                                 DAVIS
                        Oh, Christ... Somebody! SOMEBODY!
                             (into a mic)
                        Stop Wes!

           THROUGH THE GLASS BOOTH

           To the far side of the set an intimidated young LINE PRODUCER 
           motions hands out.

                                 LINE PRODUCER (FROM MIC)
                        How?

                                 DAVIS
                        Use a tranc gun!

           INT. NEWS STUDIO - CONTINUOUS

           Weston looms over the stunned Councilman. 

                                 WESTON
                        You didn’t say anything about the 
                        school zoning! You’re double digits 
                        down in the polls.
                             (motions to studio)
                        This is like a Superbowl spot I 
                        gave you.

                                 COUNCILMAN WYATT
                        You’re out of your mind!

           All the producers and grips are baffled. Weston bristles as 
           Wyatt’s handlers and the Line Producer come rushing out.

                                 WESTON
                        I’m out of my mind!? I’m not the 
                        one out stumping for family values 
                        and then screwing my campaign 
                        manager while my postpartum wife’s 
                        at home hiding in the closet.

           All look aghast, including the foxy young campaign manager 
           that helps Wyatt up.

                                 WESTON (CONT’D)
                             (to the fox)
                        Yes, that would be you, sugar. 
                        You’re the king’s whore.
           Susan makes an audible laugh/gasp, covers her mouth.

                                 COUNCILMAN WYATT
                        Is this because of the car?

           The Line Producer pulls Weston back while Wyatt and his crew 
           make to exit. Wyatt calls out over his shoulder.

                                 COUNCILMAN WYATT (CONT’D)
                        The car was a piece of shit, Wes.

           Davis has made it down, gazes at the end of the scene.

                                 SUSAN SANCHEZ
                        Do you suppose he’ll sue?

           Davis doesn’t budge. He makes a grumbling exasperation.

           INT. WESTON’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Weston slams the door and slumps down in his chair. It’s a 
           medium-nice office befitting a medium-big power player. The 
           computer is one model down from the newest. The artwork 
           doesn’t break the bank.

           Exasperated, Weston douses a rag and starts running it across 
           his make-upped face. After two strokes he loses interest and 
           tosses it aside.

           He looks at his cluttered desk. Two BROCHURES are on top. 
           “ELWOOD PRIVATE ACADEMY” is a glorious looking school campus. 
           “BISHOP GALLWAY PRIVATE SCHOOL” is equally nice, and 
           expensive-looking. He opens to the tuition section where 
           previous scrawlings mark the page. The doodles encircle the 
           cost and turn into a noose choking well-coiffed, stick figure 
           Weston. Sharks nip at his feet. Planes drop bombs on him.

           He turns the page to the back and sees a few happy young 
           students. He tiredly extends his middle finger and tap, tap, 
           taps it at them. 

           INT. NEWS STUDIO - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER

           Davis, spin control on the brain, navigates the offices. His 
           assistant POLLY, 27 and ultra efficient, catches pace.

                                 POLLY
                        Holy shit, Paul.

                                 DAVIS
                        Yeah.
                                 POLLY
                        I mean, my God.

                                 DAVIS
                        Yeah.

                                 POLLY
                        She was screaming brimstone all the 
                        way to the limo.

                                 DAVIS
                        Yeah.
                             (beat)
                        Who?

                                 POLLY
                        The... king’s whore.

           Someone hands Davis some papers on the move. He doesn’t look 
           and Polly takes them from his hand and looks.

                                 POLLY (CONT’D)
                        Oh...

                                 DAVIS
                        He’s lucky he’s got the 25-54 demo.

                                 POLLY
                        Paul...

                                 DAVIS
                        Maybe his hairline starts to go he 
                        dips to second place in the market.

                                 POLLY
                        His lawyer reached out.

                                 DAVIS
                        Already, how’s that possible? 
                        They’re still in the parking lot.

                                 POLLY
                        No, Wes’s. Contract renewal.

           She holds up the document. Davis sighs.

                                 DAVIS
                        Jesus.

           He heads forward without blinking. Polly lets him go.
           INT. WESTON’S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           Weston is on the phone, waiting for the ring to pick up. 
           Finally, to voicemail. He shakes his head, annoyed.

                                 VOICE (ON PHONE)
                        This is Grevel. Leave me a message 
                        and I’ll get back to you.

                                 WESTON (INTO PHONE)
                        Grev, it’s Weston. Yeah, I know 
                        it’s late, but, what do you want, 
                        these are my hours. What’s the 
                        word, man? Am I coming out west? 
                             (a little desperate)
                        Am I giving out cash and prizes or 
                        what? Already got my teeth capped.
                             (hates himself for it)
                        Give me a call back tomorrow.

           He hangs up, reluctantly moves to another stack of papers on 
           his desk. Invoices, bills, documents, but all with a big 
           “WESTON/MARKS TOYOTA MILE OF CARS” logo on top. 

           He scans one list of numbers, comes to a final place where   
           “-384,231.45” is highlighted. This causes his eyes to glaze 
           over, so it’s bad.

           Finally, he leans back, looks around. Like he’s barely 
           keeping from screaming. He reaches into a desk drawer and 
           pulls out a BOTTLE OF SCOTCH. A completely empty bottle.

           He stares at it almost angrily. He unscrews the cap and takes 
           a deep, full-bodied sniff. Like he’s just coming out of the 
           ocean for air. It tempers him. A little.

           He leans back in his chair. A resigned sigh.

           INT. ROOM - NIGHT

           A couple dozen people are gathered in a lecture-like setting. 
           All have a kind of pained, desperate look about them. 

                                 MAN
                        ...it was like I couldn’t even 
                        remember how I felt about things, 
                        anything really, since before the 
                        booze. The simplest things, morning 
                        showers, can you believe that, 
                        morning showers felt different.
           Some grumbles in the seats. Weston sits with his face buried 
           in his hand, eyes cast to the ground, he looks like he wants 
           to kill himself. Or this guy. 

                                 MAN (CONT’D)
                        I hadn’t had sober sex in almost 
                        ten years.

           Weston closes his eyes. Unbearable.

           EXT. ROADSIDE - NIGHT

           A billboard for KPTV Action News Team is just off from a 
           small park. Weston and Susan smile to the passing cars.

           IN THE SMALL PARK ACROSS THE STREET dark hair dangles 
           upsidedown. A KID of some kind. Can’t see the face. A few 
           others bum around in a desolate playground.

                                 KID
                        I used to be able to do all sorts 
                        of flips and shit. When I was 
                        little.

           The Kid hangs off a pull up bar by the knees. Hands reach in 
           and tickle the Kid. A very girly yelp gives away the gender 
           and she falls on her head.

           BRAN, 16, the tickler, laughs. DAISY, 15, full of spunk, 
           kicks at him from the ground. 

                                 DAISY
                        Dick. I could have hurt myself on 
                        this fake granite spongey ground.

                                 BRAN
                        Did you know back in olden times 
                        they used actual granite instead? 
                        Not ouch-proof fake ground.

           He flops on the “ground” next to her, all teenage romance 
           cool.

                        Or wood chips. Peat moss. 

                                 DAISY
                        Shut up. Put your hands on me.

           He does as told and they kiss. Starting to get into it and 
           her phone chirps a text. Then another. Bummer, they know.
                                 BRAN
                        Mrs. Weston, you have a lovely 
                        daughter.

           She wriggles for her phone, plucks it from her pocket.

           Text is from “MA-MAMA MAMA-MO-MA-MUM”. It reads: “PAST 
           CURFEW.” The next text reads “YOU BETTER BE HERE BEFORE YOUR 
           FATHER GETS HOME.” Then a final text comes in. “YOUNG LADY.”

                                 DAISY
                        Daddy’s done informing greater 
                        Phoenix about road closures and 
                        local heroic pet stories.

           They look up at the billboard. He smiles down at her.

                                 BRAN
                        I want to be him someday.

           Such a jackass kid. A couple of their friends have climbed 
           the scaffolding and taken out spray paint. 

                                 DAISY
                        Do NOT paint a cock on my dad’s 
                        mouth!

           They look back at her. Hands out, ‘What, me?’

                                 SPRAY PAINT KID
                        Just a little dick.

                                 DAISY
                        Do it to her mouth.

           Dutifully, the painters step right and get to work.

                                 DAISY (CONT’D)
                        He wants to put me in Elwood. Or 
                        Gallway. Actually my mom does. 
                        Which means he has to.

                                 BRAN
                        That’s bullshit.

                                 DAISY
                        She thinks you’re gonna get me 
                        pregnant. I told her private school 
                        seed is way more potent.

           She gets up, grabbing his balls on the way. 
           INT. ROOM - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS

           Weston stands in front of the group. 

                                 WESTON
                        All of you make me sick. Just being 
                        this close to you makes me wish my 
                        mother had drowned me at birth. You 
                        look for any reason in the world to 
                        explain away your faults except 
                        accountability. You even have the 
                        nerve to call your shortcomings a 
                        disease. People with MS or leukemia 
                        or glaucoma should take up arms 
                        against you for belittling their 
                        unpreventable affliction. No one 
                        forced you to chug your first 
                        banana daiquiri, you made that 
                        choice all by yourself. Disease, my 
                        ass. Call it what it is: weakness 
                        of character. Stop hiding behind 
                        political correctness. Look at that 
                        reflection of yours right in the 
                        stink eye and fess up. The 
                        powerlessness you cling to is as 
                        offensive as it is desperate. 
                        There’s power to be had, you just 
                        don’t know how to use it so it’s 
                        easier to say ‘Oh no, don’t ask me. 
                        We are all powerless.’ I can handle 
                        what I am but my main fear is if I 
                        brush up too close to one of you 
                        you’re going to give me a case of 
                        crybaby. 
                             (starts to sit; remembers)
                        Oh, my name is Colin W.

           EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT

           A Mercedes parks in front of a fairly nice building. The 
           “WESTON/MARKS TOYOTA MILE OF CARS” logo is on the lip of the 
           trunk, complete with a crude outline of Weston’s smiling 
           face. It’s parked right next to a Toyota Prius, also with 
           logo and smiling face. He glances at it, small cursory 
           inspection. Leans in closer to the bottom of the driver’s 
           door. A few small scrapes. He fingers them, grinds his teeth 
           before heading up the steps.

           INT. APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER

           The door opens and a little yappy dog nips at him. 29-year-
           old MONA greets him with a smile and a kiss.
                                 MONA
                        Baby...

                                 WESTON
                        Oh my God, you smell nice.

                                 MONA
                        What do I smell like?

                                 WESTON
                        Freedom.

                                 MONA
                        Go America.

                                 WESTON
                        That’s not what I meant.

           Another kiss. 

                                 MONA
                        I know. I was ignoring the horribly 
                        crass connotation.

                                 WESTON
                        I need the Prius back. The shop is 
                        going to inventory this weekend.

           She looks almost ready to pout, but decides against it.

                                 MONA
                        The keys are on the desk.

           He paces through the well-furnished apartment.

                                 WESTON
                        You get a chance to read, uh, edit 
                        those book chapters I sent you?

                                 MONA
                        Well, I could only read-uh-edit one 
                        since that’s all you sent.

                                 WESTON
                        Really? I thought I had done a few.

                                 MONA
                        Honestly, babe, you haven’t even 
                        done the one. It was practically 
                        still just an outline. No real, you 
                        know, narrative. 

           He sours as he picks up the Prius keys. On the desk she has a 
           Word of the Day calender. Today’s word was “ENNUI”. 
           He peeks at tomorrow. “ANODYNE: NOT LIKELY TO PROVOKE DISSENT 
           OR OFFENSE; INOFFENSIVE, OFTEN DELIBERATELY SO”. 

                                 MONA (CONT’D)
                        So... what about next week?

                                 WESTON
                        I don’t know. I don’t know if it’s 
                        going to happen.

           She comes up to him. He loves her in his arms, but he also 
           look like he wants to get away.

                                 MONA
                        I’m not under delusions. Okay? I’m 
                        not some sad mistress who pines for 
                        what is never coming.  

                                 WESTON
                        I know. It’s what I like about you.

                                 MONA
                        I’m sure it is. Makes it a lot 
                        easier for you. I’ve come to terms 
                        with my own badness in this little 
                        scenario of ours.

                                 WESTON
                        So have I.

                                 MONA
                        Super. Since we’re both well-
                        adjusted scoundrels then we don’t 
                        ever have to dodge what we mean.
                             (beat)
                        I just want a vacation to LA.

           He squirms away from her.

                                 WESTON
                        And when I know, I’ll tell you. I 
                        just got all this shit going on...

           He’s letting his stress slip out. She sees it, comes in 
           again, soothing.

                                 MONA
                        Don’t worry. It’ll all be fine. 
                        You’ll be fine. 

           She rubs on his earlobe. Bizarrely, it makes him feel better.

                                 MONA (CONT’D)
                        Say it.
                                 WESTON
                        Come on...

                                 MONA
                        You come on.

           A long beat, she stares at him, prodding. Finally, a voice 
           comes out, amped up and full of showmanship.

                                 WESTON
                        Get ready to roll, because this is 
                        Rock Solid.

           He’s uncertain but she smiles.

                                 MONA
                        See, I’d fuck that guy. And that’s 
                        what they want.

                                 WESTON
                        ...Yeah.

           Another deep look. Of reassurance, hope, fear, lust, freedom, 
           everything.

           INT. MERCEDES (MOVING) - NIGHT

           Weston is behind the wheel, cruising the streets of Phoenix.

                                 WESTON
                        ...because this is Rock Solid. 
                        Because this is Roooock Solid.

           He snarls a little at that one. At a light, he glances at 
           teens at a bus stop. He locks eyes with one. A slight beat, 
           he flashes a big smile. She scowls, ‘fuck off creep’.

           Unbothered, he looks ahead.

                                 WESTON (CONT’D)
                        Get ready to roll... Geeeeet ready 
                        to roll.

           He enunciates, always landing on a smile.

           INT. WESTON’S HOUSE - NIGHT

           Nice inside. Pretty good Phoenix money goes far. Everything 
           looks very model home made up. Maybe a little static.

           No one is around as Weston enters. He takes a chicken leg 
           from the refrigerator. 
           INT. WESTON’S HOUSE - OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           NATALIE WESTON, 39, works at a computer, hair in a sloppy 
           bun, pencil between her teeth. Weston pokes his head inside. 

                                 WESTON
                        Hey, hon.

                                 NATALIE
                        Daisy was out past curfew.

                                 WESTON
                        All right, I’ll go beat her.

                                 NATALIE
                        Second time this week. She just 
                        doesn’t care about punishment.

           He walks in, still gnawing at the chicken leg.

                                 WESTON
                        Well, maybe we should actually 
                        enforce the punishment from now on 
                        so she fears it.

                                 NATALIE
                        I’d rather she just obeyed.

           Weston nods, sure, as he chews. She turns to him finally.

                                 NATALIE (CONT’D)
                        Did you look at the school 
                        brochures? 

                                 WESTON
                        Yeah, but, the price is what it is. 
                        Private school fees are the same as 
                        what Harvard cost when we were in 
                        high school. It’s fucking nuts.

                                 NATALIE
                        We have to put her in one.

                                 WESTON
                        We’re stretched out right now. Too 
                        many vacations and... fancy shoes. 
                        Besides public schools are fine --

                                 NATALIE
                        -- Wes, stop. They’re shit. The 
                        only one worth a fuck is in the 
                        Gable district, and unless we 
                        move...
                                 WESTON
                        ...Would you please? You know that 
                        stupid real estate investment set 
                        us back. I’m working on it though. 
                        We had... did you see the show 
                        tonight?

           She shakes ‘no.’

                                 WESTON (CONT’D)
                        We had Wyatt on and I got him to 
                        talk publicly about redistricting 
                        the school zones--

           Finished with the chicken, he sets the bone on the bureau. 

                                 NATALIE
                        Uh-uh.

           Weston withdraws it and is forced to just hold it.

                                 WESTON

                        spermy dick away from her for 
                        another semester. It’ll be fine.

           She sighs hard, not sold.

                        It won’t be fine. We need to move.

           She turns back to the computer. Weston stands there with his 
           chicken bone, no purpose anymore.

                                 WESTON
                        Supposed to talk to Grevel tomorrow

           Aside from a slightly darker smartass vibe, like any other 
           teenage girl’s room. Daisy ipads away as the door knocks.

                                 WESTON
                        Hey.

           He peeks inside. She looks up.

                                 DAISY
                        Hey.

                        Why are you reading that junk?

           She turns the ipad around. It’s the Local Profile segment of 
           his newscast. She gestures to Wyatt.

                                 DAISY
                        This guy is a total knob.

           It brightens him up. He comes in closer to her.

                                 WESTON
                        Yeah, he’s a jackass. Wanted to 
                        return a car. Big pain in the ass.

                        him because... favors.

                                 DAISY
                        You can see Susan get pissed when 
                        the camera moves to you at the 
                        beginning.

           She rewinds to the start of the segment.

           ON THE IPAD the newscast rolls and the camera tightens from a 
           wide shot of both of them to a single of Weston.

                                 WESTON (ON IPAD)

                        Local Profile series...
           She points to Susan as the camera racks focus. Just as Weston 
           speaks his first words Susan makes a ‘fuck him’ eye roll as 
           she’s pushed out of frame.

           Daisy laughs, plays it again. Weston snark smiles, watching.

                                 DAISY
                        Look at her face. She hates it.

                                 WESTON
                        ...Ahhhh, look at that. What a... 
                        bitch. She couldn’t stand it when I 
                        got my own profile segment.

                                 DAISY
                        That’s what you get when you suck, 
                        Sanchez. You can’t match the 
                        Weston.

           Weston eats the attention up, but knows he’s being played.

                                 WESTON
                        Two nights this week?

                        I was late by, like, ten minutes.

                                 WESTON
                        Ten minutes in mom time is like two 
                        hours. You know that.

                                 DAISY
                        Smooth it over for me.

           He kisses her on the head as he gets up.

                                 WESTON
                        Okay, Slick, just don’t make it so 
                        hard for me.

           She smiles big as he heads out.

           INT. WESTON’S HOUSE - OFFICE - NIGHT

           The house is asleep but Weston is still up. He checks email. 

           He opens one from SCRIBNER PUBLISHING, reading it like it’s 
           telling him he has cancer.

           “COLIN, WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN? ANXIOUSLY AWAITING FIRST DRAFT 
           OF YOUR MANUSCRIPT HARD NEWS. UNFORTUNATELY, WE CAN’T FORWARD 
           YOU ANOTHER ADVANCE. OF COURSE, I HAVE TO POINT OUT IT’S 
           ALREADY PAST DUE. BOSSES ARE ASKING FOR AN ETA.”
           Weston just sighs. Exits out of the email.

           EXT. WESTON/MARKS TOYOTA MILE OF CARS - MORNING

           The outline of Weston’s face looms large above a lot of new 
           and used cars. A handful of people mill around.

           A Prius pulls into the lot and Weston steps out.

           INT. WESTON/MARKS TOYOTA MILE OF CARS - OFFICE - MORNING

           Blinds plink open and a man stares out at Weston. Big JIM 
           MARKS, 56, might as well wear a cowboy hat, watches Weston 
           motion over one of the mechanics from the garage. He points 
           to the scrapes at the bottom of the door. 

           Marks furrows his brow. Been doing it for a while now.

           INT. WESTON/MARKS TOYOTA MILE OF CARS - SHOWROOM - MOMENTS 
           LATER

           Marks meets Weston as he comes inside the car-packed main 
           floor. Weston knows it’s coming.

                                 WESTON
                        I know...

                        We’re at a critical mass.

                        We’re a little down, we’ll figure 
                        it out.

           A couple in the shop spot him. The WIFE points him out to her 
           HUSBAND. Weston charms a smile to her.

                                 MARKS
                        Auditor went over the books, Wes. 
                        We’re too far in the red. I had to 
                        take out another loan.

                                 WESTON
                        Well, good. That gives us time.

                                 MARKS
                        Not really.

           The couple wanders over. Weston brings up the 10,000 watt 
           smile as the Wife shyly takes out her phone.
                                 WIFE
                        Mr. Weston, could I bother you for 
                        a picture?

                                 WESTON
                        Of course. Looking at cars today?

                                 WIFE
                        Maybe. Your hair looks so nice on 
                        TV.

                        It wasn’t a bank, they won’t extend 
                        us anymore. Private investors.

           Weston poses with her, the bored husband takes the shot.

                                 WESTON
                        Okay. A reasonable stake?
                             (to the couple)
                        More than just Toyotas. We got 
                        beamers, Infinitis, Lexus. Buy 
                        something nice for yourself.

           He smiles at them. The Wife is charmed. He forces a handshake 
           out of the uninterested Husband.

                                 WESTON (CONT’D)
                        You want a picture too?

                                 HUSBAND
                        The handshake was the thrill of my 
                        life.

           Weston smiles it away as they head off. He turns back to 
           Marks, on schmooze duty. 

                                 MARKS
                        The stake’s actually quite 
                        reasonable.

                                 WESTON
                        Fine then.

           Flashes the smile for him too.

           INT. WESTON/MARKS TOYOTA MILE OF CARS - OFFICE - MOMENTS 
           LATER

           The requisite golf photos and paraphernalia adorn the office. 
           Weston looks at a photo on the wall of him smiling and 
           “presenting” the lot of cars, ta-da style. “HE GIVES YOU THE 
           NEWS, NOW LET HIM GIVE YOU A RIDE!”
                                 WESTON

                        No, it’s a motorcycle club. Like

                                 MARKS
                        The stake is reasonable. The time 
                        frame they expect it back is not.

                                 WESTON

           Marks gestures ‘no’. Weston starts to wander in a stupor.

                        I’m sitting squarely on top of my 
                        nut, thank you.

                                 SUSAN SANCHEZ
                        They can fire you.

                                 WESTON
                        They can. They won’t. Not with 
                        those Local Profiles so popular.

           He makes a slight look to her before heading in another 
           direction. She watches for a beat. Buried envy.

           INT. WESTON’S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Weston walks inside. Davis is already sitting there. Weston 
           doesn’t break stride or demeanor.

                                 WESTON
                        Davis, my little gummy worm. What 
                        brings you here on so blah blah a 
                        whatever.

                                 DAVIS
                        Yeah, I wonder Wes. You slip out 
                        yesterday after broadcast because 
                        of the punch or the contract?

                                 WESTON
                        Give me one good reason why it 
                        couldn’t be both.

                                 DAVIS
                        Hefner came to see me. Want to know 
                        what he said?

                                 WESTON
                        The Pulitzer committee is finally 
                        considering muscle tone a factor.
           He gives a good triceps flex.

                                 DAVIS
                        Wes, god damn it!

           Weston relents the sarcasm and sits. The school brochures are 
           still there to taunt him.

                                 WESTON
                        Yeah, that sounds more like him.

                                 DAVIS
                        Is it the whiskey withdraw? Or are 
                        you just losing it? 

                                 WESTON
                        Careful...

                                 DAVIS
                        I swear to God, you better not drag 
                        me down too.

                                 WESTON
                        Drag you down? The numbers are 
                        stellar. I’m your prized pony. The 
                        face of Phoenix! You get to look 
                        good because I look awesome.

                                 DAVIS
                        Is that why you’re going to LA?

           Weston plays it in stride, Davis clearly wasn’t supposed to 
           know.

                                 WESTON
                        I had the vacation coming up. What 
                        I do with my time--

                                 DAVIS
                        --you’ll be in breach. Hefner said 
                        if you think the outrageous 
                        contract demands will give you an 
                        out, think again.

           Tough stance. Weston holds the line.

                                 WESTON
                        Do you go to the gym, Davis? 
                        Starting to show.

           Davis holds his look a beat and then heads for the door. 

                                 DAVIS
                        You’re on six o’clock tonight.
                                 WESTON
                        What!?

                                 DAVIS
                        Rick has the flu. You’re pulling 
                        six and eleven.

           Barely a linger and he heads out. Weston chews on it, gets 
           up. So angry he starts rocking against the desk.

                                 WESTON
                        ...son of a bitch. Scum-sucking six 
                        o’clock loser fuckfaces.

           INT. APARTMENT - DAY

           Weston’s desk rocking turns into his frustration fucking Mona 
           against the kitchen counter. She clearly just got home. Bags 
           of groceries are on the ground.

           As she moans he sees wine bottle on the counter. It’s been 
           opened, but is corked. Residue on the side. He arches and 
           leans in as he thrusts. Positioning gets awkward, but he gets 
           his nose close to the top of the bottle. A sniff... so good. 

           And then he slips and falls. Awkward as hell, tangled up in 
           his pants. Mona yelps and turns. Hard not to laugh seeing him 
           in such a brutally open and helpless state.

                                 MONA
                        Are you okay...?

                                 WESTON
                        -- Don’t acknowledge me now. Turn. 
                        Turn back. This has not happened... 

           She chuckles and turns around as he scrambles for dignity. As 
           he does he gets a clear view into one of the grocery bags. A 
           pregnancy test. He goes, well, limp, at the sight of it.

           He gets up, uncertain whether to pull his pants all the way 
           up. Mona hikes up her skirt, ass popping out just so as she 
           rounds the corner. Weston watches. Paranoia versus lust. He 
           doesn’t buckle up and follows her. 

           INT. APARTMENT - BEDROOM - LATER

           The bed shakes and rattles as Weston and Mona have rigorous 
           sex. Mona is in oblivion, but Weston is still preoccupied.

                                 MONA
                        ...Baby...
           Simple word, oddly timed. Weston cocks an eye though.

                                 MONA (CONT’D)
                        ...baby... baby, baby...

           Really throwing him now. He keeps moving though...

                                 MONA (CONT’D)
                        ...baby, baby, baby, baby, baby...

           In a flash he bounds off her and backs away, hands up.

                                 WESTON
                        What’s with the baby shit?

           Startled out of it, Mona turns to him, uncertain.

                                 MONA
                        What? 

                                 WESTON
                        What the hell was that? It was like 
                        a fertility mantra or something.

                                 MONA
                        What are you talking about?

                                 WESTON
                        What you were saying.

                                 MONA
                        What was I saying? I don’t know.

                                 WESTON
                        I was just, I, I, I... I don’t, I 
                        can’t... And I have to do the six 
                        o’clock fuckface hour.

                                 MONA
                             (no earthly idea)
                        What?

           Weston paces, agitation coming out.

                                 WESTON
                        Do you know what schools cost when 
                        babies grow up? 

                                 MONA
                        Okay, let’s calm down now.

           Weston’s phone rings. He does an ‘oh shit’ when he sees the 
           ID. He flutters out of the room leaving a baffled Mona.
           INT. APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           A naked Weston wanders into the bright room. He takes a 
           couple calming breaths and answers.

                                 WESTON (INTO PHONE)
                        Hey, Grev, buddy, what’s happening?

           INT. TALENT AGENCY - CONTINUOUS

           Slick LA offices way up on the go fuck yourself floor. Smoggy 
           LA out the window. GREVEL PIERSON, 40, rolls calls.

                                 GREVEL (INTO PHONE)
                        Wes, how’s the heartland?

                                 GREVEL (INTO PHONE)
                        Everything east of Vegas and west of 
                        the Holland Tunnel is the heartland. 
                        Shit, that’s good. I got to write 
                        that down and give it as a script 
                        note to a writer on something. 

                                 WESTON (INTO PHONE)
                        So, what’s the news?

           But Grevel actually is writing it down. Weston is forced to 
           wait what feels like forever. He strolls naked.

                                 GREVEL (INTO PHONE)
                        ...Yeah, so, it looks like 
                        probably.

                                 WESTON (INTO PHONE)
                        What does probably mean?

                                 GREVEL (INTO PHONE)
                        It means it’s you or one other guy. 
                        But they’re still doing it Monday, 
                        so we’ll know tomorrow.

                                 WESTON (INTO PHONE)
                        Jesus, what do I have to do?

                                 GREVEL (INTO PHONE)
                        I told you. You need to shake 
                        things up. Big shit in Phoenix is 
                        still just who gives a shit.

                        Yeah, okay, slugger. Look, it’s 
                        close. I think you’re going to get 
                        it. Just hang tight, but be 
                        thinking about grabbing attention. 
                        Dangerous. But safe.

                             (sheepish, embarrassed)
                        Right, okay.

                        I’ll talk to you later, buddy.

           He hangs up. Weston chews on it, sees Mona standing there.

                                 WESTON
                        I have to be dangerous, 
                        interesting, and exciting.

                                 WESTON
                        Yeah, but for pay. 

           Off Weston, considering it --

           INT. NEWS STUDIO - NIGHT

           Weston sits with six o’clock co-anchor SHEILA ABBOT, who 
           finishes rattling off a story. Weston glances up to the 
           control booth. Davis is up there, lording over him.

                                 SHEILA ABBOT
                        ...For more on this story we go to 
                        Nathan Frank in the field. Nathan?
           EXT. STATE CAPITOL BUILDING - DAY

           NATHAN FRANK, 35, has an on-the-steps interview going with 
           Attorney General HARVEY PLATT, 55. 

                                 NATHAN WEST
                        I’m here with state attorney 
                        general Harvey Platt. Do you see a 
                        reversal of Proposition 42 anytime 
                        this session?

                                 PLATT
                        Well, if we can get the state 
                        legislature to open a dialogue...

           INT. NEWS STUDIO - CONTINUOUS

           Operating his phone under the anchor desk, Weston scrolls 
           through emails. A new one from SCRIBNER PUBLISHING. The 
           Subject line reads “MANUSCRIPT?” He passes it. Another from 
           GREVEL. He opens it. It just reads “BE CRAZY!”

           Weston quietly sighs. Just then a new one comes in from MONA. 
           He opens it. It’s a scandalous bent over nudie shot. He 
           quickly exits it out and shoots an eye to co-anchor Sheila, 
           who’s eyeballing him. He puts it away.

           Davis watches, in control, enjoying making Weston eat crow.

           INT. NEWS STUDIO - CONTINUOUS

           Weston tap taps his fingers, chewing on some idea. He zones 
           back in to the interview.

           ON THE MONITOR Platt drones on.

                                 PLATT (ON THE MONITOR)
                        ...I think we can make it happen.

                                 WESTON
                        --Excuse me, Mr. Attorney General?

           INT. NEWS STUDIO - CONTROL BOOTH - CONTINUOUS

           Davis’s neck hairs spike up.
           EXT. STATE CAPITOL BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

           Both Platt and Nathan’s rhythm is thrown, not expecting 
           talkback from the studio.

           INT. NEWS STUDIO - CONTROL BOOTH - CONTINUOUS

           Sheila is totally unprepared for being thrown back to camera. 
           She’s caught picking her teeth.

                                 WESTON
                        This is Colin Weston back in the 
                        studio. Did you just say you think 
                        the bill can be reversed?

           ON THE MONITOR Platt hears him over the feed.

                                 PLATT (ON THE MONITOR)
                        Uh, yes. Hi Colin. 

                                 WESTON
                        Well, that’s quite a reversal from 
                        what you said earlier this year.

                                 PLATT (ON THE MONITOR)
                        Things have changed.

                                 WESTON
                        No, they haven’t.

           INT. NEWS STUDIO - CONTROL BOOTH - CONTINUOUS

           Polly has sidled up to Davis.

                                 POLLY
                        Is he supposed to be doing that?

           Davis just hawkeyes the monitor.

           EXT. STATE CAPITOL BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

           Nathan awkwardly holds the microphone for Platt.

                                 PLATT
                        Well, they have changed. The entire 
                        legislative docket is different--

           INT. NEWS STUDIO - CONTINUOUS

           Weston rolls right over him, suddenly profoundly put off.
                                 WESTON
                        --No, no, no. Don’t try to reverse 
                        your position now, Mr. Platt. These 
                        anodyne statements you’re making 
                        are trying to conceal the truth--

                                 PLATT (ON THE MONITOR)
                        --Anodyne? I’m just saying--

                                 WESTON
                        You’re doing it. Right now on live 
                        TV. You reprehensible scoundrel.

           INT. NEWS STUDIO - CONTROL BOOTH - CONTINUOUS

           Davis goes to high anxiety.

                                 DAVIS
                        Motherfuck.

           EXT. STATE CAPITOL BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

           Platt is taken aback. Nathan tries to intercede.

                                 NATHAN FRANK
                        I think what the Attorney Gen--

                                 PLATT
                        --This is extremely rude of you--

           INT. NEWS STUDIO - CONTINUOUS

                                 WESTON (ON TV)
                        Rude?! How do you have the nerve? 
                        You’re blatantly lying. I got to 
                        tell you, I’m getting very tired of 
                        politicians constantly reversing 
                        positions when the tides change.

                                 PLATT (ON THE MONITOR) 
                        I’m not reversing anything. You’re 
                        being belligerent. 

                                 WESTON
                        No, no, no. You do not get to 
                        insult me. You say that to me again 
                        and I challenge you to a DUEL!

           Platt looks flabbergasted. 
           INT. NEWS STUDIO - CONTROL BOOTH - CONTINUOUS

           Davis, Polly and the room go silent, mouths open.

           EXT. STATE CAPITOL BUILDING - CONTINUOUS

           A gawk of silence then Platt just shakes his head and leaves. 

                                 PLATT
                        Okay, I’m done.

           INT. NEWS STUDIO - CONTINUOUS

           Satisfied, Weston grins as a stunned Sheila picks it back up.

                                 SHEILA ABBOT
                        Okay... Nathan Frank at the capitol. 
                        When we come back we’ll meet a local 
                        labrador who became a prize winning 
                        race dog all while missing one of 
                        her back paws. Heartwarming story.

           The music plays and Sheila shuffles papers. Someone offscreen 
           shouts an “All Clear!” Sheila turns to Weston.

                                 SHEILA ABBOT (CONT’D)
                        The fuck?

           He rap taps the desk.

                                 WESTON
                        Ratings spike at 11pm, believe it. 
                        Six o’clock can suck it.

           INT. WESTON’S OFFICE - LATER

           Davis paces his fury away while Weston sits at his desk going 
           over news copy, scratching notes. The occasional scoff. 

                                 DAVIS
                        Punch a councilman, challenge the 
                        attorney general to a duel, maybe 
                        sodomize the governor next.

                                 WESTON
                        The punch was off air.

                                 DAVIS
                        Oh, well then why do it? If it’s 
                        all for press and ratings...
                                 WESTON
                        Davis, would you go away. I’m no 
                        longer fond of people.

                                 DAVIS
                        God, I wish there was 
                        accountability in life. 

                                 WESTON
                        Keep dreaming.
                             (holds up show copy)
                        Our copy editor Skip...

                                 DAVIS
                        Ted.

                                 WESTON
                        He went to community college, 
                        didn’t he?

           Davis picks up one of Weston’s Local News Award plaques.

                                 WESTON (CONT’D)
                        You know how I can tell?
                             (re: the copy)
                        This eleven o’clock copy... was 
                        written by a retarded person.

                                 DAVIS
                        Wes... let me explain something to 
                        you...

                                 WESTON 
                        Yes, yes. In one sentence I’ve 
                        managed to offend both retards and 
                        community colleges graduates.
                             (suddenly laughs)
                        That sounds funny, doesn’t it? 
                        ‘Community college graduate’? It’s 
                        like, cash register specialist.

                                 DAVIS
                        You know, one day the public you 
                        pretend to like is going to find 
                        out what you really think of them.

           Weston raises an “a-ha” finger.

                                 WESTON
                        At which point I’ll publicly not 
                        apologize. You know why?

           Davis looks at him, enlighten me.
                                 WESTON (CONT’D)
                        Because nobody likes a sissy. Not 
                        even the retards or cash register 
                        specialists.

           He tosses the copy on his desk and leaves Davis as he exits.

                                 WESTON (CONT’D)

                        broadcast ever. See you at 10:59. 

           INT. WESTON’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - EVENING

           Weston works a laptop with Daisy while Natalie cooks dinner. 

                                 WESTON
                        So it’s up on Youtube now?

                                 DAISY
                        And Vine. It just needs traffic.

           ON THE COMPUTER they look at video of the newscast.

                                 WESTON (ON THE COMPUTER)
                        ...You say that to me again and I 
                        challenge you to a DUEL!

                                 DAISY
                        Awesome.

                                 NATALIE
                        Not awesome. Wes, tell her.

           He plugs a fob into the computer.

                                 WESTON
                        Right, not awesome. Now do this one.

                                 DAISY
                        What’s this?

                                 WESTON
                        Some raw feed from the other night 
                        after the broadcast ended. 

           She plays the clip. Weston decks Wyatt and lords over him.

                                 WESTON (ON THE COMPUTER) (CONT’D)
                        You’re such a lying sack of shit, 
                        Greg. I did you a fucking favor...

                                 DAISY
                        Holy shit!
           Natalie moves in, watching in shock.

                                 NATALIE
                        What the hell was that?

                                 DAISY
                        You full on punched that guy in the 
                        face, dad!

                                 WESTON
                        Yeah, but not hard. I think it’ll 
                        play as righteously maverick. Do 
                        you download it to the same place?

                                 NATALIE
                        Wes! Stop!

           He turns, sees her face in total dismay. Weston sours. What? 
           She nods to Daisy who’s gawping at her father punching a guy.

           INT. WESTON’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - LATER

           Weston and Natalie get into it.

                                 WESTON
                        I was calling out lying politicians. 
                        That’s a good thing. It’s noble.

                                 NATALIE
                        Would you stop selling? Do I look 
                        like an idiot game show contestant?

           Like a low blow. It makes him simmer.

                                 NATALIE (CONT’D)
                        What are you doing all this for?

                                 WESTON
                        Are you kidding? Do you not realize 
                        what we’re up against every day? 
                        What it takes to keep it up? And 
                        we’re not even that extravagant. 
                        But it goes into this giant maw, 
                        becomes a cycle. And now it’s me or 
                        another guy. And I got to be sexy 
                        and crazy and viral, or, you know, 
                        Daise is pregnant by prom and the 
                        Sand Vipers repossess our house.

                                 NATALIE
                        What?
           His phone chimes. He looks, another email from SCRIBNER 
           PUBLISHING. The subject line reads “NEED MANUSCRIPT NOW”.

                                 WESTON
                        Fuck you!
                             (to Natalie)
                        Not you. Look, I’ll smooth it over 
                        with her. Tell her punching people 
                        is bad. I have to go back to the 
                        station for the power hour.

           He heads out leaving an annoyed Natalie standing there.

           INT. WESTON’S MERCEDES (MOVING) - NIGHT

           Weston drives, on the phone, trying to finesse his way out.

                                 WESTON
                        ...it’s just a little delay. It’s 
                        actually a good thing, because I’m 
                        in the middle of upping my profile 
                        in a big way, so there’s even more 
                        material for the book.

                                 RICKARD (FROM SPEAKER)
                        I still need pages. I need a draft 
                        of Hard News yesterday. The book is 
                        supposed to be ready for fall.

                                 WESTON
                        I hear you, and I’m saying you’re 
                        going to be getting it imminently.

           A HARLEY DUDE on a bike speeds up next to him. Wearing a 
           leather cut. Small chill goes through Weston.

                                 RICKARD (FROM SPEAKER)
                        When’s imminent?

                                 WESTON
                        It’s as imminent as imminent gets...

           A glance to Harley Dude. He gets a quick look back. Weston 
           tries to shrink in his seat. He slows a bit.

                                 RICKARD (FROM SPEAKER)
                        Because the president of the 
                        company is asking.

           The car in front of Harley Dude slows forcing him to slow and 
           even back up with Weston. 
                                 WESTON
                        ...Okay. Look, I’m going... I’m 
                        probably going to LA this weekend 
                        for this big, big deal...

           Traffic then halts completely. They’re side by side.

                                 RICKARD (FROM SPEAKER)
                        Great, we have an office out there.

           Harley Dude turns and looks directly at Weston, who’s caught 
           staring and can’t help himself from smiling big to a 
           potential fan. Harley Dude keeps looking, stone cold.

                                 WESTON
                        ...Yeah, okay, so...
                             (remembers)
                        Oh, about that additional advance--

                                 RICKARD (FROM SPEAKER)
                        --No.

           Harley Dude faces forward and roars off with the traffic.

                                 WESTON
                        ...Okay. Talk soon.

           He hangs up and breathes a small sigh.

           INT. NEWS STUDIO - NIGHT

           Weston walks the hall, when suddenly Susan Sanchez appears 
           and pushes him into a small supply closet.

           INT. NEWS STUDIO - SUPPLY CLOSET - CONTINUOUS

           Susan is on him like a tick.

                                 SUSAN SANCHEZ
                        Don’t fuck with me. Are you putting 
                        a national reel together? For cable 
                        or network? Are you being scouted? 

                                 WESTON
                        I don’t know, maybe.

           She points a daunting finger in his face and gesticulates it 
           for a beat as she considers.

                                 SUSAN SANCHEZ
                        Why else would you be acting so bug-
                        o? You start drinking again?
                                 WESTON
                             (calmly)
                        Susan... Your forehead is shiny on 
                        camera. And you mumble your “R’s”.

           He moves past her. Can’t help it. She rubs at her forehead.

           INT. NEWS STUDIO - CONTROL BOOTH - LATER

           Commercial break mid-broadcast, but Davis is on high alert, 
           laserbeaming Weston through the glass. Polly is nearby.

                                 POLLY
                        Good so far. He’s behaving.

           Davis watches Weston shuffle paper. The too-calm tension gets 
           to him and he abruptly grabs a headset.

                                 DAVIS (INTO HEADSET)
                        I know you’re fucking with me, Wes. 
                        Are you trying to get fired? Some 
                        contract negotiating tactic? You 
                        know we’ll litigate if you take 
                        another job. Non-compete limbo for 
                        two years? Full time car salesman, 
                        that’s you.

           Weston doesn’t waver. Doesn’t even look up. Polly and the 
           others in the room try not to look at the uncouth Davis.

           Then:

                                 WESTON
                        FUUUUUUUCK. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, 
                        fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck...

           He stays perfectly poised. Everyone is thrown, then one of 
           the ENGINEERS looks back to Davis.

                                 ENGINEER
                        Back from commercial in five...

           Graphics are up, what should he do? 

           INT. NEWS STUDIO - CONTINUOUS

           Weston keeps on, perfectly poised. Susan is utterly baffled.

                                 WESTON
                        Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck...

           INTERCUT WITH THE CONTROL BOOTH
           They all look worried.

                                 ENGINEER
                        ...four, three...

                                 WESTON
                        Fuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuckfuck...

           He looks up, makes a mock ‘Even I can’t stop it’ gesture.

                                 ENGINEER
                        ...two...

                                 DAVIS
                        Jesus, mute! MUTE HIM!

           One of the Engineers slaps a MUTE button.

           On the floor the Sound Guy points and cues “One” and Weston 
           abruptly stops “fuck”-ing and goes back to copy on a dime.

                                 WESTON
                        --Now we take you to a story...

           The Engineers scramble as no audio comes out over the feed.

                                 DAVIS
                        Shit! Unmute, unmute! Audio!

           They hit the button and audio pipes back in the feed.

                                 WESTON
                        ...about the homeless shelters in 
                        downtown Phoenix. Susan?

           He turns to her. She’s still fluttered. Tries to begin:

                                 SUSAN SANCHEZ
                        Rorr--

           Horrible mumbled “R”. She restarts, enunciates huge.

                                 SUSAN SANCHEZ (CONT’D)
                        Rory Kinkaid has been looking at 
                        several local shelters...

           Weston bites his smile.

           EXT. WESTON’S HOUSE - BACK PATIO - NIGHT

           Weston sits alone in the quiet night, a laptop open. He looks 
           at bank statements. Lots of withdraws and payments. He sighs 
           heavy before exiting the screen. The weight of it is obvious. 
           He looks at a file named ‘HARD NEWS’. The cursor hovers over 
           it a beat, but he feels beaten before he even opens it and 
           just closes the computer.

           He drinks from a Diet Coke can, but it’s empty. He swishes 
           it, looking at it, almost willing it to be something else. He 
           finally sets it down and grabs his car keys.

           He heads to a gate that leads to the driveway when Daisy 
           comes in from the same gate. Busted, she tries to play cool.

                                 DAISY
                        Hey, where are you going?

                                 WESTON
                        I’m going out--

                                 DAISY
                        --Do you think mom’s going to push 
                        this private school thing?

                                 WESTON
                        Are we really trying to pretend I 
                        didn’t just bust you sneaking back 
                        in? 

                                 DAISY
                        Dad, come on. I just went a few 
                        blocks over for, like, a half hour.

                                 WESTON
                        Where, to Johnny Mr. Boner’s house? 
                        Come on, Daise. You’re killing me 
                        with this.

                                 DAISY
                        Nothing happened. I’m not stupid.

                                 WESTON
                        You think you’re not stupid. But 
                        you’re young, so by definition you 
                        are. Most adults are stupid. People 
                        actually get stupider the older 
                        they get. 

                                 DAISY
                        So I’m the smartest one here?

                                 WESTON
                        I said most adults, wise ass.

           He recalibrates with a fatherly judgement sigh.
                                 WESTON (CONT’D)
                        Do you understand your mother and I 
                        aren’t trying to oppress you? That 
                        we’re doing our best to ensure the 
                        evil sticky icky world out there 
                        full of its stupid people keeps its 
                        claws off you for as long as 
                        possible?

                                 DAISY
                        I know that.

                                 WESTON
                        Because as smart as you may be, the 
                        world isn’t what you think it is. I 
                        promise you the reality of it will 
                        surprise you one day.

           It comes from a deep place within, and she can tell. She’s 
           actually appreciative of the conversation. She nods ‘okay’.

                                 DAISY
                        Mom...

           Waiting for the judgement. He sighs, hugs her, kisses her on 
           the top of her head.

                                 WESTON
                        Get back in before she notices. 
                        I’ll be back in a bit.

           He nods her off. She smiles and heads back inside. He watches 
           her a beat then heads out through the gate.

           EXT. CIVIC CENTER ADJUNCT BUILDING - NIGHT

           Weston paces up to a dumpy building. A few people loiter 
           outside, smoking. There’s a sign on the door. “AL ANON”. 
           Weston stops, looks at the people. They all look strung out 
           and miserable. Finally he backs away and turns around. 

           INT. LIQUOR STORE - NIGHT

           Weston is at the register.

                                 WESTON
                        Give me a bottle of the Blue Label.

                                 CLERK
                        The good stuff, huh?

           Weston merely glares. The Clerk reaches behind the counter.
                                 CLERK (CONT’D)
                        $192.28

           Weston forks over the bills, feeling the worth of every dollar.

           EXT. PARK - NIGHT

           Weston walks down a path, only a few are out this late. City 
           streets are still nearby. He spots a billboard overlooking 
           the park. KPTV Action News. His smiling face beams out.

           He spies a HOMELESS MAN on a bench and he sits down next to 
           him, barely a look, just continuing to gaze up at his own 
           face. The Homeless Man stares at him, uncertain, not used to 
           people approaching him. Still looking at his sign:

                                 WESTON
                        You a drunk?

           The Homeless Man stares. Who is this patrician gentleman?

                                 HOMELESS MAN
                        Yeah.

                                 WESTON
                        I miss the ease of it. The problem 
                        with all those meetings is they try 
                        and tell you there’s no solace in 
                        the bottle when they all know full 
                        well there is. It might be an 
                        illusion but it works out to the 
                        same thing.

                                 HOMELESS MAN
                        So don’t go.

                                 WESTON
                        Yeah. I don’t think I will.

           He finally turns to the Homeless Man and matches his stare. 
           He hands him the bottle. The Homeless Man wearily takes it.

           Weston watches as he twists the cap. The perforations snap 
           like music as he opens it. He slugs it back, a whiskey bead 
           hanging from his lip as he finishes. He offers it back.

           Weston stares at him, his dirt and scrapes. The torn clothes 
           and food scraps by his side. The bottle hangs in the air.

                                 WESTON (CONT’D)
                        The problem is I’m smart enough to 
                        recognize the illusions that 
                        matter.
           He gestures up to the billboard, his perfect face. The 
           Homeless Man squints at it.

                                 WESTON (CONT’D)
                        That one I believe in.
                             (re: the bottle)
                        That one just tricked me.
                             (then)
                        Shit’s chasing me, Fred. Feel like 
                        I’m getting swallowed up. A hell of 
                        my own making, sure. You can have 
                        so much, but somehow it’s never 
                        enough. One wrong left turn, and 
                        suddenly you’re in fucking Zimbabwe 
                        or something. How did that happen? 
                             (beat)
                        If she’s pregnant I swear to God...
                             (big sigh)
                        At least I smell better than you. 

           He gets up and walks off, leaving his pricey whiskey behind.

                                 HOMELESS MAN
                        My name’s not Fred.

                                 WESTON
                        Who cares?

           INT. WESTON’S HOUSE - BATHROOM - MORNING

           Morning sunlight shines into the spacious bathroom. Weston is 
           at the sink, hair askew, just getting the sleep out. He 
           yawn/stretches his mouth, making noises as if he’s getting 
           camera ready. Then he smiles. Smiles big. Smiles bigger. He 
           tries a couple quiet variations of ‘Hello’.

           A mock newscaster voice:

                                 NATALIE
                        Shocking news as a fire rampaged 
                        through a local school.

           Busted. She peeks in, slyly. He glances at her ‘yeah, yeah’.

                                 NATALIE (CONT’D)
                        The local Mounties were unable to get 
                        there in time to prevent tragedy.

                                 WESTON
                        You used ‘local’ twice. Bad copy.

                                 NATALIE
                        ...All the kids burned to death...
                                 WESTON
                        ...And Mounties is wrong for 
                        several reasons.

           She comes up beside him, a puckish grin.

                                 NATALIE
                        The community is beside themselves.

                                 WESTON
                        Itself.

                                 NATALIE
                        ...Mass suicides are expected.

                                 WESTON
                        Hoped for.

           She wraps an arm around him, looking at their reflection. For 
           her, the simple ease of morning. The day’s more loaded for him.

                                 NATALIE
                        You sure you can’t come today?

                                 WESTON
                        I got the stupid car thing. You 
                        guys can come by after you’re done.

                                 NATALIE
                        How much luck do you think I’ll 
                        have convincing her of that?

           He nods ‘right’. Her puckish grin turns into something else 
           as her hand roves across his chest.

                                 NATALIE (CONT’D)
                        You okay? You seem like you’ve been 
                        stressed. It’s not like you.

                                 WESTON
                        What is ‘like me’? I forget 
                        sometimes. Keeping all the plates 
                        spinning... the first thing to go 
                        is my actual perspective.

           The hint of genuine vulnerability peeks out. She wavers a 
           beat on how big a statement this is.

                                 NATALIE
                        Come on, you don’t mean that. 
                        You’re a jungle tiger.

           She scoots right past it, opting for positive reinforcement. 
           Weston grins it away, goes safely back to coy.
                                 WESTON
                        ...do the newscaster voice again.

           She grins, happy he’s playing.

                                 NATALIE
                        Gunfire today at the state capitol...

                                 WESTON
                        Oh, baby...

           Pretend hot. She laughs and they slip back into easy mode.

           INT. WESTON’S HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING

           Onions get diced as Weston prepares an omelet. Natalie has 
           the school brochures out trying to force-excite Daisy.

                                 NATALIE
                        They have an Olympic size pool.

                                 DAISY
                        Mom, I never learned how to swim.

                                 NATALIE
                        Weird they gave you those 
                        competition medals then.

           Weston checks his cell phone. “NO MISSED CALLS”. He grimaces.

           A TV is on a local morning talk show. Plastic co-hosts go 
           back and forth over inane blather. 

                                 PLASTIC MALE HOST (ON TV)
                        ...there is no accountability in 
                        media these days.

                                 PLASTIC FEMALE HOST (ON TV)
                        Well, at least we got some colorful 
                        local figures like Colin Weston.

           Weston does a sort of sing-song head nod to that.

                                 PLASTIC MALE HOST (ON TV)
                        I know! Wow, if there was ever a 
                        better display of a public 
                        meltdown...

           Natalie and Daisy turn their heads to it, then to Weston. He 
           calmly shakes his head, ‘no worry.’

                                 PLASTIC FEMALE HOST (ON TV)
                        He’s just bucking for attention.
                                 PLASTIC MALE HOST (ON TV)
                        He’s bucking for a sedative. He’s 
                        an embarrassment to the profession. 
                        The network has to be taking steps.

           Natalie gets up and turns it off. A mostly sweet look to him.

                                 NATALIE
                        You brought it on yourself.

           He smiles pleasantly and she kisses him. Daisy gets up too.

                                 DAISY
                        Dad, why aren’t you coming to this 
                        forced relocation program with us?

                                 WESTON
                        I have to go make money so we can 
                        be safe and free.

                                 NATALIE
                        Looks good. Save the leftovers.
                             (to Daisy)
                        Come on, you poor put-upon child.

           She makes a whip lashing sound and they shuffle out. After a 
           beat of being alone Weston turns the television back on.

                                 PLASTIC MALE HOST (ON TV)
                        You ask me he should be thrown out. 
                        There’s a Youtube clip going around 
                        of him punching a city Councilman.

           Weston makes a small ‘yes!’ gesture.

                                 PLASTIC MALE HOST (ON TV) (CONT’D)
                        All I’m saying is there’s nothing 
                        more pathetic than a punch drunk 
                        boxer that doesn’t know he’s passed 
                        his sell-by date.

           Weston starts to get a grin.

           INT. MORNING TALK SHOW STUDIO - MORNING

           The show is still in progress. Grips, producers, and line 
           people all make the show happen.

           A side door opens and Weston walks inside, a determined 
           confidence to his gait. A Grip does a doubletake when he 
           recognizes him. Weston heads right for the live set.
                                 GRIP
                        Hey, you can’t--

           No use. Weston walks right into the live shot. The Plastic 
           Hosts and their guest, a WOMAN making arts and crafts ducks 
           made out of socks, can’t hide their shock.

           INT. MORNING TALK SHOW STUDIO - CONTROL BOOTH - CONTINUOUS

           All the techs and producers are stunned motionless.

                                 PRODUCER
                        What. The. Hell.

           INT. MORNING TALK SHOW STUDIO - CONTINUOUS

           Weston looms over the Plastic Hosts.

                                 WESTON
                        All right then. Tough guys. So what 
                        was that again?

           The Plastic Male Host is the first to recover speech.

                                 PLASTIC MALE HOST
                        Colin Weston, ladies and gentleman. 
                        We don’t usually get walk ins from 
                        competing channels much... ever. 

           A slight beat as he simply stares.

                                 PLASTIC MALE HOST (CONT’D)
                        You didn’t bring your dueling 
                        pistols, did you, Colin?

                                 WESTON
                        I use swords.

           Both Plastics look for any kind of direction from offstage.

           INT. MORNING TALK SHOW STUDIO - CONTROL BOOTH - CONTINUOUS

           The room watches, rapt.

                                 PROGRAMMER
                        Do you want to cut away?

                                 PRODUCER
                        Are you kidding? 
           INT. MORNING TALK SHOW STUDIO - CONTINUOUS

           Both Plastic Hosts wait for some kind of tell from Weston.

                                 PLASTIC FEMALE HOST
                        That’s a pretty good stare down, 
                        but was there something you wanted? 

                                 WESTON
                        I’d like you to have a sudden, 
                        violent on-air bowel movement but I 
                        just don’t expect it.

           A Cameraman chuckles. THROUGH HIS LENS the shot is framed.

                                 PLASTIC MALE HOST
                        Uh... wow Colin. We’ve had a lot of 
                        guests wish we’d do a lot of 
                        things. Never that.

                                 WESTON
                        Sure they have. They just haven’t 
                        said it to your face.

                                 PLASTIC MALE HOST
                        Did you want to sit down and 
                        discuss... media?

                                 WESTON
                        With you two? She’s a clown and 
                        you’re a fraud.

                                 PLASTIC MALE HOST
                        I’m a fraud, am I?

           Tries to toughen his stance, but Weston glares hard.

                                 WESTON
                        You’re not for real. Vitriol is all 
                        you have to offer because you know 
                        you can’t outthink a professional. 
                        Sound bites and headlines because 
                        you lack depth of insight. 
                             (re: Guest with crafts)
                        Duck ladies because it’s the extent 
                        of your IQ. You make a point to sit 
                        next to bald men so no one notices 
                        your thinning hairline. You think 
                        that makes you crafty, it makes you a 
                        subspecies. You impress your own 
                        shortcomings on viewers thinking 
                        their embrace validates you, but it 
                        just shows you’re reaching for the 
                        low-hanging fruit.

                                 WESTON (CONT'D)
                        But I’m an embarrassment? I’m not the 
                        one taking remedial math my senior 
                        year. But if being the valedictorian 
                        of summer school is the only plaque 
                        you’re ever going to get, I suppose 
                        you have to hang it on the wall, 
                        right?

           The Plastic Male Host smugly grins, tired of it now.

                                 WESTON (CONT’D)
                        You’re the one that brings the 
                        media down to its knees, and you do 
                        it because on your knees is the one 
                        place you know you really get to 
                        shine.

           He turns to leave a dead silent studio.

           EXT. WESTON/MARKS TOYOTA MILE OF CARS - DAY

           THROUGH A CAMERA LENS an ELEPHANT rears its trunk and 
           bellows. Weston sits atop the animal with a giant smile. He 
           wears a hat with his own face on it.

                                 WESTON
                        Hellooooo, Phoenix! Yeah!

           Full promotional blitz on the car lot. Popcorn machines, 
           balloons, clowns, some sad horses, and that even sadder 
           elephant. A WOMAN is strapped on behind Weston as he waves at 
           the medium-sized crowd. “YEAR’S BEST PRICES!” banners are up.

                                 WESTON (CONT’D)
                        Great deals today at Weston/Marks 
                        Toyota. Zero down financing. Come 
                        on down and take a ride!

           The Cameraman wraps and the elephant is lead to its Trainer 
           who summons it to kneel. The Woman passenger is guided off. 
           Marks comes up beside it.

                                 MARKS
                        Volume isn’t up as much as we need. 
                        You have to keep going a bit longer. 
                        Got a good TV spot at least.

                                 WESTON
                        I’m going to march this elephant to 
                        your car and have it shit in the 
                        sunroof, you know that, right?
           He smiles as another WOMAN comes up with a pen and paper. He 
           reaches down and signs then poses as the Woman leans up 
           against the elephant and her bored HUSBAND takes the pic.

                                 MARKS
                        Any more passengers?

                                 MONA (O.S.)
                        Sure, I’ll take a ride.

           Mona emerges through the crowd. Weston winces as a smiling 
           Marks helps her up on the elephant.

                                 MARKS
                        Step right up, little lady. Take a 
                        ride with Phoenix’s own Colin 
                        Weston, then take a ride --

                                 WESTON
                        --Yeah, yeah. She’s got it.

           They get up and the elephant starts its lazy route.

                                 MONA
                        Oooh, so exotic.

                                 WESTON
                        It’s basically like the Serengeti 
                        right now. You can tell people 
                        you’ve been to Africa and it’s more 
                        or less true.

           She wraps an arm around him, seemingly for safety. They keep 
           eyes forward.

                                 WESTON (CONT’D)
                        My wife and daughter might come 
                        here.

                                 MONA
                        I’m just a fan of local newsmen and 
                        a potential car buyer riding an 
                        elephant.

                                 WESTON
                        I hate my life. Sometimes.

                                 MONA
                        So not all the time.

                                 WESTON
                        No. The other times I love the idea 
                        of my life.
           They cruise the lot at low speed. 

                                 MONA
                        So you saw that pregnancy test in 
                        the grocery bag.

                                 WESTON
                        Yeah.

                                 MONA
                        And I took it.

                                 WESTON
                        Yeah.

                                 MONA
                        And I’m pregnant

                                 WESTON
                        ...Yeah.

           He keeps a smile out to the grazing people despite the epic 
           lightening going on behind his eyes. Mona plays it cool.

           At the side of the lot BIKERS ride in. A dozen Sand Vipers. 
           They circle around and line up towards the edge of the event.

           Everyone looks. The Sand Vipers don’t do anything, just hang 
           out. But the leather and chains send out an eerie vibe. Marks 
           looks uncertain what to do. It even momentarily diverts Mona.

                                 MONA
                        What’s that about?

           Before he can catalogue it into his head Weston’s phone 
           rings. His future is on the line. He stares at it a beat, 
           then finally answers.

                                 WESTON (INTO PHONE)
                        Yeah?

                                 GREVEL (FROM PHONE)
                        You got it, buddy! You’re it!

                                 WESTON (INTO PHONE)
                        ...Okay...

           Tries like hell to keep it level, doesn’t want to tip Mona.

                                 GREVEL (FROM PHONE)
                        They liked your reel best.

                                 WESTON (INTO PHONE)
                        They saw the Youtube clips?
                                 GREVEL (FROM PHONE)
                        What Youtube clips?

                                 WESTON (INTO PHONE)
                        Ummm...

                                 GREVEL (FROM PHONE)
                        Doesn’t matter! Get your ass here 
                        by tomorrow. Tape Monday. Scream to 
                        the fucking heavens, man!

                                 WESTON (INTO PHONE)
                        I’m on an elephant. 

                                 GREVEL (FROM PHONE)
                        Uh, okay, is that... what?

           He glances back to Mona, sees the vulnerable look she’s 
           trying to bury. Also the Bikers in the background and Marks 
           looking nervous as hell about them.

                                 WESTON (INTO PHONE)
                        We’ll do that... We’ll talk later.

           He hangs up. She’s right on him.

                                 MONA
                        Anything important?

                                 WESTON
                        No.

                                 MONA
                        Pregnant.

           Wildly differing emotions as he looks at her. He comes up 
           with:

                                 WESTON
                        Gestation period for an elephant is 
                        fourteen months. Longest in the 
                        animal kingdom.

                                 MONA
                        Mine will be shorter.

           A tense, telling, exposed beat for both.

                                 WESTON
                        I want to tell you it will be okay, 
                        and I want that to be true. I don’t 
                        know how yet... but I do mean it.
           He’s sincere, and she reads that from him. It helps keep back 
           tears and they both keep it together. Atop the elephant. 

           ...Which Weston notices is veering off course and heading 
           towards the Sand Vipers standing vigil.

                                 WESTON (CONT’D)
                        ...Uh, no. Stop...

           He futilely tries to guide it back like a horse.

                                 WESTON (CONT’D)
                        Go left, you stupid pachyderm.

           But it keeps going. They get up close to the Bikers and 
           Weston smiles big for them. They just glare up at him as the 
           Trainer comes running over to wrangle the elephant.

           INT. WESTON’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - LATE DAY

           Clothes get thrown into a suitcase as Weston feverishly packs 
           for immediate departure. Natalie watches him.

                                 NATALIE
                        Why are you leaving tonight? It’s 
                        like you’re sprinting out of here.

                                 WESTON
                        No, I just... have to be there early.

                                 NATALIE
                        Does that mean all this punching 
                        and freaking out at work is over?

                                 WESTON
                        I suppose.
                             (beat)
                        Though, I’m finding it very easy to 
                        vent about it all. 

                                 NATALIE
                        We have to jump on this opportunity 
                        for the school. Slots go fast. And 
                        she actually liked it, even though 
                        she’s pretending not to care.

                                 WESTON
                        I’ll look at trying to move some 
                        money around, but you know, it’s...

                                 NATALIE
                        I know. I’m proud of you.
           That stops his flurrying. Sincerity gets lost in marriages, 
           and when it lands, it can land hard. It does here.

                                 WESTON
                        This can be really big for us. Just 
                        a trial run. Five episodes not even 
                        for broadcast. But it could be... 

           She knows. The chaos of his mind slows when he sees her 
           simple loving eyes. He gives her a kiss. She kisses back.

                                 DAISY (O.S.)
                        Barf.

           They turn, she’s standing in the door. It resets him.

                                 WESTON
                        And I really have to finish the 
                        book and get it to the publishers.

                                 NATALIE
                        I thought you said you were done.

                                 WESTON
                        I have maybe a little more to do.

           He finishes and gathers his things, looks at them, excitement 
           is fighting its way past anxiety finally.

                                 WESTON (CONT’D)
                        Ladies... what do we say?

                                 DAISY
                        Pat Sajack can eat a bag of dicks.

                                 WESTON
                        ...What else do we say?

           So dorky, they hate it. But they’re happy for him.

                                 NATALIE & DAISY
                        ...Get ready to r--

           INT. WESTON’S MERCEDES (MOVING) - NIGHT

           Weston at the wheel. Spirits up.

                                 WESTON
                        --Rooooollll, motherfucker!

           Probably been saying it for the last 500 miles. The car phone 
           rings, and the automated voice announces it.
                                 CAR VOICE
                        You have an incoming calling 
                        from... Puke Face. Would you like 
                        to accept?

           He taps the accept button.

                                 WESTON
                        Davis, we have a Friday night rule 
                        that you’re breaking.

           INT. NEWS STUDIO - OFFICE - NIGHT

           Davis stands in his executive office while HEFNER, 62, old 
           school news man, the big boss, sits down.

                                 DAVIS
                        Walking on a competing news show?

           INTERCUT WITH WESTON IN HIS CAR

                                 WESTON
                        Good stuff, right?

                                 DAVIS
                        Slander comes to mind.

                                 WESTON
                        How were the overnight ratings?

           Davis and Hefner exchange an annoyed, binding look.

                                 HEFNER
                        It’s the only reason we’re not 
                        firing you.

                                 WESTON
                        Oh, hey Brenan. It’s a good reason 
                        though, isn’t it?

                                 HEFNER
                        Not good enough to renew this 
                        contract at the rate you’re asking.

                                 WESTON
                        I think it is.

                                 DAVIS
                        No one makes double.

                                 WESTON
                        You’re right. Triple is better.
           He grins at his own gall. Hefner steams. 

                                 HEFNER
                        Are you in LA?

                                 WESTON
                        Just about.

                                 HEFNER
                        You’re a newsman, not a fucking 
                        game show host!

                                 WESTON
                        Jack of all trades.

                                 HEFNER
                        We’ll sue. And get an injunction.

                                 WESTON
                        Fire me, which triggers the large 
                        payout you owe me. Fail to come to 
                        terms with my contract, and release 
                        me. Or pay triple and keep me.

           Davis looks at Hefner for a clue. He’s only getting madder.

                                 HEFNER
                        This is a dangerous game you’re 
                        playing.

                                 WESTON
                        Nope, just hosting. Okay, I’m 
                        enjoying my week off now. Goodbye.

           He hangs up. He cruises for a beat, trying not to let doubt 
           creep in. Very small:

                                 WESTON (CONT’D)
                        ...shit.

           EXT. LOS ANGELES - NIGHT

           Hollywood sign, walk of fame, Chinese theatre, all that stuff. 

           INT. WESTON’S MERCEDES (MOVING) - NIGHT

           The Sunset Boulevard nightlife is always there. Weston peers 
           at a couple women dressed for clubbing, then their giant 
           boyfriends. He smiles at them. They actually smile back.
                                 WESTON
                        You are my demo. You will pay for 
                        everything I want in life.

           A small smile and he drives on, up to the Roosevelt Hotel.

           INT. HOLLYWOOD ROOSEVELT HOTEL - ROOM - NIGHT

           Swank room. Big TV. Big view. Suitcases are laid out and 
           Weston strolls. He spreads his arms to the glitz below. 

                                                               FADE TO:

           EXT. CUVEE - PATIO - DAY

           A trendy spot on Robertson where people pretend not to 
           rubberneck. Grevel picks at an egg white omelet with a side 
           of kale whatever while Weston goes over some papers.

                                 WESTON
                        What kind of changes exactly?

                                 GREVEL
                        Some format stuff. They’ll go over 
                        it with you on set. It’s fucked 
                        having to work on the weekend, but 
                        it is what it is.

                                 WESTON
                        I’m fine with it.

                                 GREVEL
                        I meant me.

                                 WESTON
                        This is working?

                                 GREVEL
                        Look. 
                             (nods across the room)
                        The guy in the stupid chukkas. 
                        Billionaire.

           Weston looks. Chukka isn’t even 40. He eats with two models.

                                 GREVEL (CONT’D)
                        Hedge fund money. Now he wants to 
                        play movie studio. Fuck him, let 
                        him spend, then find out how stupid 
                        he is.
                                 WESTON

                        Hey, what was that Youtube stuff? 
                        That was nuts. You reamed those two 
                        idiots, and punched that other guy.

                                 WESTON
                        Meant every word too. Nice to be 
                        able to combine ideals and work 
                        goals. It was liberating. Saw the 
                        hits are getting up to a million. 
                        The link was on Huffington Post.

                                 GREVEL
                        That really freaked Tributary out. 
                        They saw it after they chose you. 
                        Actually called and talked about 
                        trying to back out. 

                                 WESTON
                        What!?

                                 GREVEL
                        Relax, I smoothed it out. They 
                        already committed earlier in the 
                        day and we had the paperwork.

                        Oop, double afternoon delight. 
                        Fucking asshole.

           He watches as Chukka gets up and leaves with the models. 
           Weston is still locked in.

                                 WESTON
                        You said get crazy, get something 
                        to go viral. 

                                 GREVEL
                        Yeah, but not, like, unstable. I 
                        meant like an edgy Funny or Die 
                        thing. They thought maybe you were 
                        having psychological problems, or 
                        on drugs. I said no to both those.

                                 WESTON
                        Jesus...

                                 GREVEL
                        Don’t worry. Everything’s good.

           Weston’s phone buzzes a text. He looks. Mona. “WHERE ARE YOU? 
           CAN YOU COME OVER?” He puts it away and holds a sigh inside.
                                 GREVEL (CONT’D)
                        Kick the shit out of these tester 
                        episodes and then it’s syndication 
                        and profit participation.

           Weston grins through a wince. Or tries to.

           INT. TRIBUTARY OFFICES - DAY

           CHARLIE BANNER, a 60-year-old seen-it-all executive producer 
           is at his desk fiddling with a baseball. He’s on the phone 
           hardassing some deal.

                                 BANNER (INTO PHONE)
                        ...I need at least 70% of the 
                        market... well then you’re 14% 
                        short, aren’t you?... If we don’t 
                        have east coast affiliates we can’t 
                        make our numbers and then I’m just 
                        a schmuck for taking a bad deal...

           He shakes his head, tired. He grips the baseball, positions 
           his fingers just so. To someone in front of him:

                                 BANNER (CONT’D)
                        This is how you throw a knuckle 
                        ball.

           We see Weston is seated in a chair facing him, listening to 
           him berate the poor bastard. He gets instantly bored arguing.

                                 BANNER (INTO PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        ...Look, look, look. Shut up. If 
                        you have 56% you have nothing I 
                        want. Get New England by end of day 
                        Monday or I pull the plug and move 
                        on to Pre-Packaged Game Show #278.

           He hangs up and keeps fingering the baseball.

                                 BANNER (CONT’D)
                        Threw a no hitter once senior year 
                        of high school. Scouts came the 
                        next game and I gave up three two-
                        run homers by the fourth. Still 
                        stings.

           A sneer of regret as he reaches around and wedges the ball 
           between two Emmys on his shelf.

                                 WESTON
                        I was a wrestler.
                                 BANNER
                        Now there’s a business model. You 
                        know how much Vince McMahon pulled 
                        down last year?

                                 WESTON
                        A galactic ton.

                                 BANNER
                        And that was just broadcast rights. 
                        Plus live events, merchandising...

                                 WESTON
                        Maybe I should practice my 
                        backbreaker some.

           He grins, but Banner has moved on to just staring at him.

                                 BANNER
                        So you’re our face man. Our 
                        Seacrest. A little old.
                             (beat)
                        My wife said she’d wanna fuck you 
                        though. 

           Weston keeps a medium smile up, not sure what to say.

                                 BANNER (CONT’D)
                        Well, more than the other guy.

           He grabs a headshot from his desk and flashes it.

                                 BANNER (CONT’D)
                        She’s a good barometer for the 
                        podunks in Missouri who’ll watch 
                        this. 

                                 WESTON
                        Podunks are my people.

           Banner scoffs as he gets up.

                                 BANNER
                        No, they’re not. You’re so 
                        patrician you practically scream 
                        yacht club. But that’s okay.

           He takes out some graphic design work and brings it over.

                        Leaning to more a Jeopardy thing 
                        than a Price is Right thing so we 
                        need a whiff of sophistication. Just 
                        a whiff though.

           Weston looks at the artwork.

                                 WESTON
                        This is... quite different.

                                 BANNER
                        Yeah, but you still just smile and 
                        dole out the questions and prizes 
                        to the cattle that comes in from 
                        Ohio for their big TV moment.

                                 WESTON
                        ...Okay. 

                                 BANNER
                        What’s that Youtube shit about? 
                        Just some Bill O’Reilly freakout?

           Weston turns to him, about to muster up something.

                                 WESTON
                        Well...

                                 BANNER
                        Nah, it’s fine. I get it, people 
                        are stupid. Sometimes they have to 
                        be yelled at. Personality is good 
                        outside of the show. Edge is good. 
                        Soft edge. All the way to dangerous 
                        is bad. Sexy is so close to sexist 
                        now it’s hard to tell the 
                        difference. You can’t be even a 
                        little homophobic anymore. No Jew 
                        stuff. No racist anything. Can’t be 
                        a drug guy. Weed is the only thing 
                        you could get away with, but that’s 
                        Bill Maher’s thing and it’s too 
                        dicey for five o’clock anyway. 

           Weston tries to absorb it all.

                                 BANNER (CONT’D)
                        What you can be is socially active. 
                        Causes are okay as long as they’re 
                        low key. Animal lover is good, 
                        environment is fine just no climate 
                        change talk.

                        You shouldn’t be talking about any 
                        of this anyway, just, you know, 
                        throwing a line out here and there 
                        to show you’re deep. 
                             (opens the door, screams)
                        Hey!
                             (back to Weston)
                        Get Pet Monthly or Vegetarian 
                        Magazine to put you on their sexy 
                        list. National profile shit.

           He sizes him up again. Weston isn’t sure how to react.

                                 BANNER (CONT’D)
                        My producer thought you were just a 
                        good haircut. I thought maybe more.

           A woman, AMITA, 32, beckoned from the yell, comes inside. 
           She’s immune from all charms in Hollywood, in life.

                                 BANNER (CONT’D)
                        This is her, Amita. You’ll be fine. 
                        Soft edge. But don’t leave your 
                        guts back in Phoenix. Dig deep for 
                        charm because I got an unforgiving 
                        streak. I won’t let weak chins onto 
                        my stage, you understand? I’ll 
                        bounce you like you’re Conan.

           Weston waits for more, but finally:

                                 BANNER (CONT’D)
                        That’s it. You ready?

           He stands there with Amita. Weston digs deep for that charm.

                                 WESTON
                        Ready to roll, because this is roc--

                                 BANNER
                        --We changed the title.

           Weston abruptly stops. Okay.

           EXT. SUNSET GOWER STUDIOS - DAY

           Amita leads him through the small lot, which is mostly empty.

                                 AMITA
                        The stages are still being rebuilt 
                        to the changes. Paying crew double 
                        for weekend work so you know 
                        someone’s gonna get fired.
                                 WESTON
                        What’s it called now?

                                 AMITA
                        Pacemaker, maybe? Or something.

                                 WESTON
                        Is there a... catch phrase?

                                 AMITA
                        There’s barely a concept.

                                 WESTON
                        But the studio still feels good 
                        about this going the distance?

                                 AMITA
                        As long as their new face doesn’t 
                        screw it up.

           A look so droll he can barely tell if it’s a joke. She guides 
           them to a set of giant elephant doors on a stage. They’re 
           cracked open and they both slip inside. 

           INT. STAGE - CONTINUOUS

           Workers hammer away at building a giant game show backdrop. 
           Hard to tell what it all is exactly, but it’s colorful and 
           bursting with lights and oversize props.

           Weston stares at it all.

                                 AMITA
                        Welcome to the bigs, rook.

                                 WESTON
                        I’m not exactly a...

           But she’s already left. He looks at it, wondering what to do.

           INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

           A busy midday coffee crowd. Natalie is in line with a 
           girlfriend, JANET.

                                 NATALIE
                        Two shot latte with almond milk, 
                        please.

           She hands over a credit card to the BARISTA.
                                 JANET
                        My son hated Gallway at first. By 
                        sophomore year he would have run 
                        away if we put him back in public.

                                 NATALIE
                        She’s just acting tough because she 
                        has to. There’s a boy.

                                 JANET
                        And there will be more. And then 
                        eventually there will be men. Then 
                        it’s over.

           They chuckle. The Barista cuts in to Natalie.

                                 BARISTA
                        I’m sorry, do you have another 
                        card? This one didn’t go through.

           A little awkward for him, more for her. She’s incredulous.

                                 NATALIE
                        ...Are you sure?

                                 BARISTA
                        Ran it twice.

                                 NATALIE
                        Weird... I’ll just use cash.

           A slight wince as she takes it back. She sends an embarrassed 
           eye to Janet as she digs for cash.

           INT. NEWS STUDIO - OFFICE - DAY

           Crisis meeting going on with Davis, Hefner, and a couple 
           other suit and tie MEN, dressed down for Saturday. 

                                 HEFNER
                        He could be bluffing.

                                 DAVIS
                        He’s not bluffing.

                                 HEFNER
                        I’m not paying him triple.

           One of the Suits has an ipad showing Weston punching Wyatt, 
           then cuts to him screaming his duel challenge to the attorney 
           general, then to him saying ‘...on your knees is the one 
           place you really get to shine’ to the Plastic Host. 
                                 SUIT #1
                        Someone made a remix. There’s a 
                        dance version too. We’ve certainly 
                        never gotten attention like this. 
                        Look at all these comments...

           Davis looks in, reads.

                                 DAVIS
                        ‘I love this dude.’ ‘This guy is 
                        the shit, yo.’ ‘They figured out 
                        how to make me care about news. Now 
                        add tits.’
                             (sighs)
                        I hate that this is the demo we 
                        covet.

                                 HEFNER
                        Even if we rein him in - under 
                        contract or court order - we can’t 
                        have him behaving like this.

                                 DAVIS
                        He’s just trying to drum up some 
                        pizzazz to get the game show.

                                 HEFNER
                        Are we sure? Are we sure it’s not 
                        something more, and the pizzazz is 
                        just covering it up?

           They all consider it. 

           INT. STAGE - LATE DAY

           A giant title design headboard is raised above the stage. 
           “KINGMAKER” is written in fancy cursive letters. Grips go 
           about securing it to the mount.

           Weston watches from a podium just underneath. Amita and a 
           STAGE DIRECTOR guide him through paces.

                                 STAGE DIRECTOR
                        ...Okay, so after the opening round 
                        we do the walk over and Q&A with 
                        the contestants...

           He motions Weston to cross the stage with him.

                                 STAGE DIRECTOR (CONT’D)
                        ...listen to all their exciting 
                        stories about their teacup 
                        collection back home...
           He moves Weston along stage.

                                 STAGE DIRECTOR (CONT’D)
                        ...then to our celebrity and he/she 
                        does their bit...

                                 WESTON
                        Wait, what? Celebrity? We’re having 
                        celebrities now?

                                 AMITA
                        For the mentoring part. They give 
                        them good advice/bad advice. 
                        Whatever.

                                 GRIP
                        --Coming down.

           A piece of rigging crashes on the stage next to Weston. He 
           hops a little but everyone else is oblivious.

                                 WESTON
                        When did this happen? Who are the 
                        celebrities?

                                 AMITA
                        I don’t know. People.

                                 WESTON
                        Like...?

                                 AMITA
                        Let’s say Jennifer Lawrence and 
                        move on remembering that it’s 
                        Saturday.

           She routes a flustered Weston around the fallen rigging and 
           takes him over to an “Event Stage”.

                                 STAGE DIRECTOR
                        The Career Path obstacle course. 
                        Act Two. John and Susie Idaho will 
                        have a couple different categories 
                        to choose from...

           Weston listens, trying to ignore the sinking feeling.

           INT. NEWS STUDIO - MAIN OFFICE AREA - LATE DAY

           Polly sits with Davis watching clips of newscasters. ON THE 
           COMPUTER a bland Man chats with his cohost.
                                 NEWSCASTER #1 (ON THE COMPUTER)
                        Things are really heating up in 
                        Phoenix this week. Jill, have you--

                                 DAVIS
                        Christ, no.

           Polly switches to a different clip. Slightly different bland.

                                 NEWSCASTER #2 (ON THE COMPUTER)
                        Tonight, police activity downtown, 
                        just south of Piedmont, as a fiery--

                                 DAVIS
                        No. Make it stop.

           Polly hits pause. Davis scratches his head, frustrated.

                                 POLLY
                        Dancy is the best of them. He’s no 
                        Weston, but, you know.

                                 DAVIS
                        Dancy can’t anchor eleven. He’s a 
                        weekend man. Too much eyebrow. 

                                 POLLY
                        Hey, look.

           Down the hall, Mona tentatively walks up, looks for and spots 
           Weston’s office, deflates when she sees it’s darkened. She 
           knocks anyway, peaks in through the blinds.

                                 POLLY (CONT’D)
                        He’s not here.

           Mona turns, sees them, suddenly sheepish.

                                 MONA
                        Oh, okay. I figured. Just thought 
                        I’d check.

                                 POLLY
                        How’d you get in here?

                                 MONA
                        He gave me a visitor pass.

           Doesn’t want to make a scene to the strangers, turns to go.

                                 DAVIS
                        He gave you a visitor pass and 
                        didn’t bother to tell you he left 
                        the state? That seems about right.
           This halts her. Davis and Polly see the stutter step.

                                 MONA
                        Right. Of course...

           She goes for a ‘silly me’ gesture but doesn’t really sell it. 
           She moves on quick. Davis and Polly look to each other.

                                 DAVIS
                        What was that?

           INT. STAGE - EARLY EVENING

           Weston is at a secluded part of the stage, just staring at 
           the half-constructed set. He blankly watches a few Grips 
           negotiate a giant prop of a king’s crown.

                                 GRIP
                        ...It has to go behind the Career 
                        Milestone.  

                                 GRIP #2
                        No, it goes before it.

                                 GRIP
                        What sense does that make?

           Weston rubs at his eyes. A little too hard. He’s in a near 
           trance.

           His Phone rings. He lets it go a beat before finally looking 
           at it. Another beat and he answers. 

                                 WESTON (INTO PHONE)
                        Hey Nat.

           INT. WESTON’S HOUSE - OFFICE - CONTINUOUS

           Natalie is at the computer, looking at bank accounts.

                                 NATALIE (INTO PHONE)
                        What’s going on with our accounts?

           INTERCUT WITH WESTON ON THE STAGE

           Maybe his trance state helps because he takes it in stride.

                                 WESTON (INTO PHONE)
                        Oh, I had to move some stuff.

                                 NATALIE (INTO PHONE)
                        Yeah, I see that. To where?
                                 WESTON (INTO PHONE)
                        A different, uh, corporate thing...

           The lie refocuses him. He steps out from the wings and moves 
           around the set, going through his marks. 

                                 NATALIE (INTO PHONE)
                        Why?

                                 WESTON (INTO PHONE)
                        I just needed a cash flow setup for 
                        the dealership. You know, personal 
                        versus corporate. It’s tax stuff. 

                                 NATALIE (INTO PHONE)
                        Because I bounced a card or 
                        whatever you call it today.

                                 WESTON (INTO PHONE)
                        Oh, sorry. I’ll straighten it out 
                        when I get back. Should have told 
                        you about that.

                                 NATALIE (INTO PHONE)
                        You think?
                             (feeling better)
                        How’s it going?

                                 WESTON (INTO PHONE)
                        Great.

           He watches vacantly as Prop Guys haul in a giant throne.

                                 WESTON (INTO PHONE) (CONT’D)
                        They’re adding a celebrity quotient.

                                 NATALIE (INTO PHONE)
                        Really. Who?

                                 WESTON (INTO PHONE)
                        I’m not sure. I heard some talk 
                        about Jennifer Lawrence.

                                 NATALIE (INTO PHONE)
                        Ooh, she’s good.

           Prop Guys bump the throne into the dais. The “KINGMAKER” sign 
           wobbles.

                                 WESTON (INTO PHONE)
                        Got to go. Tell Daisy I love her.

           He hangs up, continues to stare as the Prop Guys wait to see 
           if the “KINGMAKER” sign will hold. It does.
           EXT. FAST FOOD PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           In a seating area, Daisy leans against Bran as he watches the 
           Weston GIF on his phone. 

                                 BRAN
                        It’s like I want to make fun of 
                        him, except he actually is starting 
                        to become my hero.

           A couple of their friends goof around the fast food lot 
           scoping out cars, looking at trunks.

                                 KID
                        Found one.

                                 DAISY
                        My mom’s trying to move me by 
                        spring semester.

                                 KID
                        Found another.

           It’s a Weston/Marks car with Weston’s outlined face. He takes 
           out a razor blade and begins carefully peeling it off.

                                 BRAN
                        Tell her you can’t because of your 
                        dad’s notoriety.

                                 DAISY
                        Because what about it?

                                 BRAN
                        It’s... traumatizing you.

                                 DAISY
                        She won’t care. 

           She takes the phone away from him and watches. She zooms up 
           on her father’s face.

           The other Kids come back from the cars. They have several 
           sticky outlines of Weston’s face dangling from their fingers.

                                 KID
                        Branding.

           He slaps one on a window of the fast food place. Then slaps 
           one on his buddy’s back. They run off swatting at each other.

                                 BRAN
                        Say trauma. Because she can’t prove 
                        that it’s not happening.
                                 DAISY
                        That’s completely stupid.

           She keeps looking at the video of her father, then to the 
           window branding.

           INT. ROOSEVELT HOTEL - WESTON’S ROOM - NIGHT

           A computer is on and a Word file is open. The title page 
           reads “HARD NEWS BY COLIN WESTON”. 

           Weston stares at it, looks at the page count. 26.

           He gets up and paces around his fancy room. He looks out the 
           window at the nightlife below. Giant billboards of models and 
           movie stars. Not a wistful sigh, but a quiet consideration.

           He turns back to the room, sees the mini bar. Unopened liquor 
           bottles sit atop the shelf. He just has to stare at it until 
           something else happens. 

           His phone buzzes and he turns his look to it. It keeps 
           buzzing but he holds his place, staring at it.

           EXT. HOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD - NIGHT

           Young people are out looking for the next bar to hit. Weston 
           cuts through them as he walks the street. Someone tries to 
           stick a flier in his hand.

                                 WORKER
                        You want to go to a taping of a 
                        show?

           Before he can say anything the Man shoves it in his palm and 
           turns his attention to other passing couples.

                                 WORKER (CONT’D)
                        Hey, you want to see a live show?

           Weston glances at the flier.

           INT. MUSSO AND FRANK’S - LATER

           A glass of seltzer sweats beads onto a coaster at the old 
           Hollywood supper club. Weston fiddles with a swizzle stick as 
           he stares at the flier on the bar. “WHEEL OF FORTUNE - BE AN 
           AUDIENCE MEMBER!”

           He uses the swizzle stick and seltzer water to draw an anvil 
           above Pat Sajack’s head. 
                                 PRETTY WOMAN
                        He’s certainly got it coming.

           Weston glances to her. 30, hip, by herself.

                                 PRETTY WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        Pure evil. Turning those letters 
                        for all those years.

                                 WESTON
                        That’s Vanna. Pat just says, ‘your 
                        turn to spin the wheel, Jeff.’

                                 PRETTY WOMAN
                        I’ve never actually seen it.
                             (glances to flier)
                        Is that an anvil crushing his head?

                                 WESTON
                        Yes, it is actually. Well done. And 
                        those little bits are splashes of 
                        blood and brains squirting out.

                                 PRETTY WOMAN
                        That’s a lot of game show host 
                        hate.

           He gives her a vague smile.

                                 WESTON
                        I’d love to tell you about that 
                        metaphor. Though as soon as I start 
                        my phone will ring. Because life 
                        has no sense of shame.

           She’s uncertain. His drifting indignation starts to rise.

                                 WESTON (CONT’D)
                        Didn’t use to be that way. I didn’t 
                        start like that. Selling an idea 
                        and selling an ideal were not 
                        mutually exclusive.

                                 PRETTY WOMAN
                        Now I always get those confused. 
                        Does not mutually exclusive mean 
                        they are exclusive?

           Trying to be charming with her inquisitiveness. Who is this 
           handsome man? Someone important? Weston looks right through 
           her.
                                 WESTON
                        You try and have a point of view, 
                        in business, in life. They always 
                        merge though. You’re a doctor, a 
                        mechanic, they’re going to merge. 
                        Work and life. And then that’s the 
                        prism from which you view 
                        everything. And you find yourself 
                        in a town literally based on make 
                        believe. You’re an actress, right? 
                        Out trolling for producers and 
                        agents. What do you think that does 
                        to your point of view? Selling 
                        something that is inherently false. 
                        Making shiny objects for a living. 
                        Basing everything - our value, our 
                        life - on a fat and sedated 
                        public’s appetite for a shiny bit 
                        of manufactured sparkle. Does it 
                        flatten your soul? You, probably 
                        not, you still got five or six 
                        years left before you hit the bad 
                        half of your thirties and realize 
                        you’re not going to make it. But I 
                        started out ahead. I always had a 
                        brain and a soul. So it hurts more.

           She looks at him, attraction having long since curdled.

                                 PRETTY WOMAN
                        Maybe it’s time to take it easy on 
                        that seltzer water, Pat.

           Weston watches her leave then turns back to the flier.

           EXT. SUNSET GOWER STUDIOS - DAY

           Banner walks with Weston through the lot.

                                 BANNER
                        You ever try and go national in the 
                        news business?

                                 WESTON
                        I thought about it a while back. 
                        But it hardly seems like news 
                        anymore. Just talking heads and 
                        celebrity. No --
                             (coughs)
                        -- hard news. And if that’s the 
                        case, then...

           Banner cocks an eye at him, small smile.
                                 BANNER
                        We’re doing three, then two. Shoot 
                        three episodes on Monday, and two 
                        on Tuesday. Buffer time for tweaks. 

           A young P.A. comes up to him holding up some reports.

                                 P.A.
                        Do you want these?

           Banner just waves him off and keeps moving. 

                                 BANNER
                        If I had my druthers we’d be 
                        attaching the pickup to the renewal  
                        of one of our talk shows. Make it 
                        impossible for them to say no.
                             (to P.A.)
                        Hey, wait! Back, back!

           The P.A. swings back. Banner sorts through the reports.

                                 BANNER (CONT’D)
                        ...In congress they would call that 
                        pork barrel politics...
                             (to P.A.)
                        Give me the rest after lunch.

           The P.A. heads off again as Banner keeps moving and looks 
           through the papers he selected.

                                 BANNER (CONT’D)
                        ...but we can’t get away with D.C.-
                        level fuckery out here. It’d be 
                        nice though. You feel good?

           He looks back up at Weston, who pulls out the pearly whites. 

                                 WESTON
                        Like a million dollars.

                                 BANNER
                        A million ain’t that much.

                                 WESTON
                        Then I feel like more.

           Banner grins and splits off from Weston.

           INT. STAGE - DAY

           The set is nearly together. Crew works at making finishing 
           touches. It’s pretty elaborate. 
           Besides the main dais there’s different swing sets, full of 
           royal imagery. But also other sets with a Wall Street-like 
           business setting, and another with a Hollywood setting.

           Weston stares at it with the Stage Director.

                                 STAGE DIRECTOR
                        Looks good, huh?

                                 WESTON
                        It looks like Alice in Wonderland 
                        fucked Las Vegas.

                                 STAGE DIRECTOR
                        Right?

           He heads off. Weston looks at his phone. “17 TEXT MESSAGES”. 

           INT. STAGE - LATER

           Amita sits in the “CELEBRITY” seat playing the role as they 
           go through the prep motions. Droll as can be:

                                 AMITA
                        I think you should take that idea 
                        to Wall Street.

                                 WESTON
                        Oh, it looks like we have an 
                        endorsement. What’ll it be? 

           Weston looks to a Grip filling in as a contestant.

                                 GRIP
                        Hollywood.

                                 AMITA
                        But I’m Angelina Jolie and I give 
                        you my years of experience... and 
                        suggest Wall Street.

                                 GRIP
                        Okay, Wall Street.

           The Stage Director motions from the side.

                                 STAGE DIRECTOR
                        Then you walk Oklahoma dickhead to 
                        the swing set, and end Act Two. Cut 
                        to selling Pampers and boner pills.

                                 WESTON
                        How is this more a Jeopardy thing?
                                 STAGE DIRECTOR
                        What?

                                 WESTON
                        Nothing. I’ll be back in a minute.

           He walks off the main set and heads toward a far exit.

           INT. STAGE - BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS

           Weston tracks through a darkened area. He’s amid the props. 
           No people around. He stops for a beat and holds on to the 
           edge of a couple stacked storage crates, as if for support. 

           Suddenly he smashes his head against it. Then he does it 
           again, violently. He breathes heavy, steadying. A trickle of 
           blood slides down the side of his head.

           He just stands there calmly, eyes closed.

           EXT. HOUSE - BACK PATIO - DAY

           Grevel watches a baseball game through his windows while he 
           smokes a cigarette. He’s on the phone.

                                 GREVEL (INTO PHONE)
                        What kind of conflict?

           EXT. SUNSET GOWER STUDIOS - CONTINUOUS

           Weston sits on the steps outside the soundstage. He holds a 
           hand to his head, clogging the trickle of blood.

                                 WESTON (INTO PHONE)
                        It’s only if they don’t fire me, 
                        which they will.

           INTERCUT WITH GREVEL AT HIS HOUSE

                                 GREVEL (INTO PHONE)
                        Okay. And if not you quit.

                                 WESTON (INTO PHONE)
                        I can’t quit. That triggers a no 
                        compete clause.

                                 GREVEL (INTO PHONE)
                        I don’t understand. You’re just 
                        learning about this now?

           Weston gets an incoming call. “WESTON/MARKS”. He hits ignore.
                                 WESTON (INTO PHONE)
                        No, I knew it. I just figured it 
                        would have played out by now. I 
                        made unreasonable demands in the 
                        contract renewal. Plus, uh, some 
                        theatrics let’s say. They have to 
                        let me go.

                                 GREVEL (INTO PHONE)
                        Okay, well--
                             (re: baseball game on TV)
                        --Run, you fuckin’ pussy! God damn 
                        it.
                             (back to Weston)
                        Sorry, fucking Dodgers. Okay, so, 
                        all right, they fire you and we’re 
                        clear for Rock Solid. No worries.

                                 WESTON (INTO PHONE)
                        It’s Kingmaker now.

                                 GREVEL (INTO PHONE)
                        It is? Okay, well, there you go.

           Weston gets another incoming call. “PUKE FACE”. Hits ignore.

                                 WESTON (INTO PHONE)
                        The only thing is they found out I 
                        was taping these episodes. They 
                        know what I’m aiming for.

                                 GREVEL (INTO PHONE)
                        Motherfucker! Sorry, game. Uh, 
                        that’s okay. Doesn’t change your 
                        stance. It’s all a negotiation 
                        anyway. We’ll figure it out.

                                 WESTON (INTO PHONE)
                        Right.

                                 GREVEL (INTO PHONE)
                        Don’t worry about it, buddy. It’s 
                        all good. We’ll get you squared 
                        away. Just put on a charm offensive 
                        and crush this week.

           Weston gets a text. From Mona. “YOU’RE A FUCKING ASSHOLE”.

                                 WESTON (INTO PHONE)
                        Yep.

           They hang up. Grevel opens the patio door but his WIFE is 
           there and does a ‘Nope’ and shoos him back out. He grumbles 
           and stubs out the cigarette, ‘You happy?’ then goes inside. 
           Weston quietly rubs at his eyes.

           INT. FIG AND OLIVE - NIGHT

           Nice restaurant. Alone at his table, Weston finishes dinner 
           as he goes over the Kingmaker format script. 

           A Couple next to him is having an animated conversation as he 
           flips pages. He looks at photographs of his podium and the 
           contestant dais. He reads some script. Quietly, half speaks:

                                 WESTON
                        ...many paths to a rich future. To 
                        a... rich future...

           The conversation next to him has begun to pick up. Weston 
           peeks up at them. The Man resolutely sets his drink down.

                                 MAN
                        ...I can’t keep doing this. I’m 
                        through with it.

                                 WOMAN
                        ‘Through with it.’ What are you 
                        saying? Are you--?

                                 MAN
                        I’m saying I want a divorce.

           Hard for him to get it out. The Woman is stunned.

           Weston watches them. He’s entranced, like watching a botched 
           heart surgery. The couple is still relatively quiet.

                                 WOMAN
                        ...this is... how the fuck are you 
                        doing this here? In public.

                                 MAN
                        Honestly, I thought it was a way to 
                        make it go more civil. I-- 

                                 WOMAN
                        --Are you fucking high? What’s 
                        wrong with you? Jesus!

           Weston can’t look away. Other patrons notice. It’s brutal.

                                 WOMAN (CONT’D)
                        ...how is this happening...? What 
                        about the kids?
                                 MAN
                        They’ll be fine. We... we have the 
                        right to think about ourselves.

           His resolution wobbles too, which causes her tears to flood.

                                 WOMAN
                        You’re such an asshole. I hate 
                        you... I hate your fucking guts.

           She gets up and hurries out of the restaurant. The Man sighs 
           heavy, a hell just beginning.

           Weston sits calmly, quietly. Keeps staring at the Man.

           EXT. HOLLYWOOD BLOCK - NIGHT

           Weston paces, deeply in his head. His pace starts to quicken, 
           a resolute demeanor starting to crack. The heaving starts 
           slow, but it builds. Difficult to hold back the emotion.

           A kiosk blocks him, five or six people standing there reading 
           magazines. He looks as if he may literally burst any second. 
           He quick turns the other way into a random shop.

           INT. BARBER SHOPPE - CONTINUOUS

           The door bells chime as Weston wanders inside. It’s empty 
           except two old Barbers and one old client. They look up as he 
           swirls in his emotional whirlwind trying not to lose it.

                                 OLD BARBER
                        Evening, sir. Can we help you?

           Weston finally breaks and a half-stifled quiver starts to 
           take hold of his chin. He sits in a chair. The two old 
           Barbers look to each other, uncertain.

                                 OLD BARBER (CONT’D)
                        Sir? Sir, are you okay?

           It’s only a few tears but Weston puts a hand up to cover it. 
           The Barber puts a tentative hand on his shoulder.

                                 OLD BARBER (CONT’D)
                        Sir?

           Weston whimpers a little bit more but is mostly able to pull 
           it together before he really erupts.

                                 OLD BARBER (CONT’D)
                        Do you need me to call someone?
           Suddenly very embarrassed Weston rises again.

                                 WESTON
                        No, I’m... I’m sorry. I’m sorry to 
                        bother you.

           He collects himself and heads back out the door leaving the 
           confused Barber staring after him.

           INT. ROOSEVELT HOTEL - WESTON’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Weston sits at the desk with his computer out, the only light 
           in the room. He reads a website, the article “PHOENIX NEWSMAN 
           ON HARD TRUTH KICK”. He hits the video clip.

                                 WESTON (ON THE COMPUTER)
                        ...you’re the one that brings the 
                        media to its knees... and you do it 
                        because on your knees is the one 
                        place you know you get to shine.

           It’s a meme, animated with all sorts of new bits. He scrolls 
           to pictures from around Phoenix. One is a pic of a bus stop. 
           It’s an ad for KPTV Action News but someone spray painted 
           “THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO” leading up to Colin Weston’s name. 

           The computer flashes its uneven glow on Weston as he stares 
           at the screen, clicking through the posts.

                                                               FADE TO:

           INT. ROOSEVELT HOTEL - WESTON’S ROOM - BATHROOM - MORNING

           Steam covers the mirror. After a beat Weston wipes it and 
           takes a look. He’s fresh as a daisy and clear-eyed. Looks 
           like a million bucks. He starts brushing his teeth.

           INT. ROOSEVELT HOTEL - WESTON’S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Casual suit on, Weston ties his shoes. He yawn/stretches his 
           mouth, making the camera ready noises.

           A final jacket straighten and he smiles in the mirror.

           INT. ROOSEVELT HOTEL - LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER

           Weston bounds through the room, all smooth cool.

                                 BALDWIN (O.S.)
                        Colin. Colin Weston?
           It halts Weston. He searches for the voice. Spots him. 45, 
           professional rank, all west coast. He approaches.

                                 BALDWIN (CONT’D)
                        I’m Neil Baldwin.
                             (beat)
                        Scribner Publishing.

           His blood might have run cold, but Weston covers it well.

                                 WESTON
                        Hi...

                                 BALDWIN
                        Rickard told you I’d stop by? 

                                 WESTON
                        ...Did he?

                                 BALDWIN
                        We have offices out here, and since 
                        you were coming to town... He said 
                        you had the Hard News manuscript? 
                             (beat)
                        We’re all very excited for it.

                                 WESTON
                        ...Right. Right.

           Baldwin stands firm, obviously savvy. Both play a careful 
           game. Weston finds his silver tongue.

                                 WESTON (CONT’D)
                        You know, I didn’t bring my 
                        computer with me. I only have a 
                        hard copy, got my notes in it...

                                 BALDWIN
                        That’s fine.

                                 WESTON
                        Okay. Let me go upstairs and get 
                        it.

                                 BALDWIN
                        I’ll wait here.

           Weston heads to the elevator.

           INT. HOLLYWOOD ROOSEVELT HOTEL - ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Weston quickly scours the internet, the hotel room phone to 
           his ear. He clicks on a few things. 
                                 WESTON (INTO PHONE)
                        I’m going to need you to print 
                        something for me and run it up to 
                        my room. I’ll send you the file 
                        now. What’s your email?

           INT. HOLLYWOOD ROOSEVELT HOTEL - LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER

           Weston comes back down with a sealed manila envelope, fat 
           with a document. Baldwin rises as he approaches.

                                 WESTON
                        Sorry it took so long. I got 
                        slammed with calls. All these 
                        meetings. And I have more I have to 
                        run off to.

           He hands over the envelope, looks him square in the eye.

                                 WESTON (CONT’D)
                        Sorry about all these mix ups and 
                        communication breakdowns. I look 
                        forward to hearing your thoughts.

                                 BALDWIN
                        Great. Thank you, Colin. We’ll be 
                        in touch.

           Weston heads out, but looks back with a smile.

                                 WESTON
                        Call me Wes.

           Keeps moving.

           INT. TRIBUTARY OFFICES - DAY

           THROUGH THE PARTED BLINDS a long line of audience members are 
           waiting by the stage. Pretty much all tourists.

           Weston turns back as the Costumers and Hair people prep him.

                                 AMITA
                        Just don’t imagine they’re all 
                        naked.

                                 WESTON
                        The trick is getting them to 
                        imagine me naked.

           He grins at her as the Hair Stylist brushes his hair. Weston 
           suddenly recoils with an ‘Ow!’ A trickle of blood rolls down.
                                 HAIR STYLIST
                        Oh, God. I’m sorry.

           Weston dabs at his head. The Hair Stylist peers in his hair.

                                 HAIR STYLIST (CONT’D)
                        Looks like a nasty gash...

                                 WESTON
                        It’s okay. I cut myself the other 
                        day. Bumped into a door.

           He dabs at it, blotting.

           EXT. SUNSET GOWER STUDIOS - DAY

           Weston crosses the lot as the audience is being moved inside. 
           A TEENAGER with his tourist family spots him and points.

                                 TEENAGER
                        Holy shit, dude. It’s Colin Weston 
                        from Channel 4.

           He slugs his brother, ‘Look!’ The parents look too. They all 
           seem to confirm it’s him. 

                                 MOM
                        We’re from Phoenix! Are you a part 
                        of this show? 

                                 WESTON
                        The Host.

                                 TEENAGER
                        That was awesome when you punched 
                        that guy.

           Weston gives an awkward smile as he moves to his entrance.

                                 MOM
                        We love your hair.

           The Dad looks at his wife. ‘What?’

           INT. STAGE - BACKSTAGE - DAY

           Banner peeks out from the side of the stage. The full house 
           is getting a warm up from an MC. The Stage Director comes up.

                                 BANNER
                        Is Wink ready?
                                 STAGE DIRECTOR
                        Haven’t seen him. Amita went to get 
                        him ten minutes ago.

           INT. STAGE - BACK ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           A small dressing room. Legs are sprawled on a couch... Two 
           pair... It’s Weston and Amita.  

           But fully clothed. She’s holding him, like a mother would a 
           child, only far more awkward. She looks slightly more 
           uncomfortable than he does. 

           There’s a knock on the door. He doesn’t move.

                                 AMITA
                        Well, the bus is here. Time for 
                        school.

                                 WESTON
                        Yeah.

           He gets up, she does too. A careful look.

                                 WESTON (CONT’D)
                        Thank you. I was more drained from 
                        all this than I realized. Just 
                        needed a bit of emotional...
                             (beat)
                        Don’t tell any--

                                 AMITA
                        --Good God, no.

           He straightens his suit, looks in the mirror. And smiles.

           INT. STAGE - MOMENTS LATER

           The game stage is dazzling, if overwrought. Lights and colors 
           start to flash and move.

                                 ANNOUNCER (O.C.)
                        Here’s your host... Colin Weston!

           The crowd claps and Weston bounds out from behind the stage, 
           all smiles, looking like a movie star. 

                                 WESTON
                        Hi, everyone thanks for joining us 
                        today. Everyone’s excited to be 
                        here for our first show, right?
           The audience dutifully applauds.

                                 WESTON (CONT’D)
                        We had a strict Beautiful Person 
                        Only policy in effect today, so 
                        really, applaud for your own 
                        gorgeousness. You deserve it.

           They titter. He has the crowd. He flashes the big smile.

                                 WESTON (CONT’D)
                        Now get ready to roll because this 
                        is Rock Sol-- Kingmaker!

           BESIDE THE STAGE Banner glances at Amita.

           The unknowing crowd just claps as Weston moves to his podium, 
           smiling through his wince.

           INT. STAGE - LATER

           Weston is at his podium. Three CONTESTANTS are at their dais. 
           A computer board flashes a question.

                                 WESTON
                        What was the name of Henry VIII’s 
                        fourth wife?

           The middle contestant, DIRK, Midwest yokel, ponders it.

                                 DIRK
                        Let’s see... I’m actually a history 
                        buff... Aragon, Boleyn, Seymour, 
                        Anne of Cleves... it’s Anne of 
                        Cleves.

           Weston pauses a dramatic beat.

                                 WESTON
                        That’s right.

           Audience claps. Some lights shine around the room.

                                 WESTON (CONT’D)
                        Okay, Dirk, there you go. You’ve 
                        earned a walk down the Career Path.

           He beckons Dirk over and they start to really discuss it.

                                 WESTON (CONT’D)
                        What are you thinking? Wall Street 
                        or Hollywood? What is it, money or 
                        fame? Both risky.
           Dirk seems to dwell on it. Smiling Weston glances offstage to 
           Amita and the Stage Director. They do a ‘keep it moving’ 
           gesture.  

                                 WESTON (CONT’D)
                        You said you were a big Aerosmith 
                        fan, right?

                                 DIRK
                        Huge.

                                 WESTON
                        They’re out in Hollywood.

                                 DIRK
                        Actually from Boston.

                                 WESTON
                        Well, their careers are situated 
                        from LA, let me assure you.

                                 DIRK
                        Tricky.

                                 WESTON
                        Do you need an assist from our 
                        celebrity kingmaker?

                                 DIRK
                        Yeah, I think so.

           Weston turns to a side panel where a giant throne sits. The 
           lights turn to it.

                                 WESTON
                        Harry Dean Stanton, you’re being 
                        called on.

           89-year-old actor HARRY DEAN STANTON sits in the throne like 
           a bag of old shovels.

                                 WESTON (CONT’D)
                        Lend us some wisdom and help out 
                        Dirk from Boston.

                                 DIRK
                        I’m from Dayton. Aerosmith is from 
                        Boston.

                                 WESTON
                        Right. Harry?

                                 HARRY DEAN STANTON
                        You seem like a bright young man.
                                 DIRK
                        I’m 46. Got two kids.

                                 HARRY DEAN STANTON
                        Yep, gotta be young for Hollywood. 
                        I say go for it.

                                 DIRK
                        Why?

           Harry just grins and feebly claps it away.

                                 WESTON
                        Okay, Dirk, what’ll it be? Clock’s 
                        ticking.

           He gestures up to a clock, which is not ticking. Fraudulent 
           tension sits there. And sits there.

                                 DIRK
                        Okay, Hollywood.

           Weston claps him on the back, and turns to camera.

                                 WESTON
                        When we come back... the hills of 
                        Beverly!

           The lights do their zigging and zagging show and the audience 
           claps. The production goes idle for an Act break pause.

           Weston promptly walks offstage into the wings.

           INT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           A nervy Weston washes his hands in front of the mirror. 

                                 WESTON
                        So god damn sick of all this. Sick 
                        of looking at people’s ugly fucking 
                        horse faces. I swear I’m going to 
                        just soil myself. I’m going to sit 
                        there caked in my own feces on the 
                        stage, or Wall Street Land, and 
                        dare the inbred Cornhuskers to say 
                        something. This is what you paid 
                        for. This is what you get. You 
                        don’t even care I’m here anyway so 
                        long as I eventually die for you. 

           He stares in the mirror, at his wits end. But the reflection 
           staring back is a polished and smiling Weston. His best self. 
                                 WESTON (CONT’D)
                        I’m sick of getting teased that I 
                        can hold it together. It shouldn’t 
                        have lasted this long. Just let a 
                        domino fucking drop. Let me be the 
                        failure, but leave me alone and 
                        stop following me. I don’t want to 
                        give you my blood, you invisible 
                        fucking vampire.

           He sighs heavy at his smiling reflection, breaking his 
           trance. He reaches a hand out to a P.A. who gives him a 
           towel, and seems to have not heard any of it. Did it happen? 

                                 WESTON (CONT’D)
                        Thank you.

           Weston shudders before heading back out.

           INT. STAGE - LATER

           In Wall Street Land, Weston, now wearing a different suit,  
           stands with DOROTHY, 33, who’s holding a few bulky prop 
           boards; a DOLLAR SIGN, a LIGHT BULB, and a TV. She’s got 
           confusion/excitement going through her. Weston has only 
           anxiety. Sweat on his brow.

                                 WESTON
                        What do you say, Dorothy? You ready 
                        to face the board of directors? You 
                        got the idea, the financing, and 
                        the marketing.

                                 DOROTHY
                        ...I don’t know...

                                 WESTON
                        Harry?

                                 HARRY DEAN STANTON
                        Go for it. Yep.

           From his throne he points her on. But she wavers.

                                 DOROTHY
                        ...I’m not sure...

                                 WESTON
                        You have everything you need. All 
                        the components.
           She still wavers. Weston gets way too conscious of the time 
           clicking away. He looks up to the not-ticking clock, but 
           hears every LOUD TICK. 

                                 WESTON (CONT’D)
                        There’s really nothing else.

           A bead of sweaty BLOOD rolls down the side of his face from 
           his hairline.

                                 WESTON (CONT’D)
                        Even Harry Dean Stanton says so.
                             (beat)
                        Just go.

           A little brusque. She looks at him. He recovers, smiles big.

                                 DOROTHY
                        You’re bleeding.

           INT. STAGE CONTROL BOOTH - CONTINUOUS

           Banner stands immobile with Amita, glaring as it plays out.

                                 BANNER
                        Sure, that’s what was missing.

           The CAMERA pulls a CLOSE UP of the blood dripping.

           INT. STAGE - CONTINUOUS

           Weston takes out a handkerchief and dabs at his blood. He 
           keeps up the newscaster/car dealer/game show host face.

                                 WESTON
                        You ready for that board, Dorothy?

           More spooked by his creepy calm than anything:

                                 DOROTHY
                        ...Okay...

                                 WESTON
                        We’re moving on, Harry.

                                 HARRY DEAN STANTON
                        ...Yesssss.

                                 WESTON
                        Into the boardroom!

           They march into another set.
           INT. STAGE CONTROL BOOTH - CONTINUOUS

           The Stage Director talks with one of the Engineers.

                                 STAGE DIRECTOR
                        We can edit after Harry confirms 
                        she should go.

                                 BANNER
                        How about after, ‘Hello, and 
                        welcome...”.

           A doleful look out to the stage below.

           INT. STAGE - LATER

           In his third suit, Weston is at his podium and three new 
           contestants are at their dais.

                                 WESTON
                        Okay, Judy. Who is the only person 
                        to win the Nobel prize twice, and 
                        in two different categories?

           Judy has no idea. She hems and haws. 

                                 JUDY
                        ...oh, I don’t know... Is it... 
                        Albert Einstein?

                                 WESTON
                        No, I’m sorry. Linus Pauling. For 
                        peace and chemistry. Okay...

           From the audience there’s some hysterical laughter. It’s 
           stark, and singular. Weston tries to smirk it away.

                                 WESTON (CONT’D)
                        ...Okay, we’re all having a good 
                        time. Tough question. 

                                 AUDIENCE MEMBER (O.C.)
                        It’s not tough! Linus Pauling, 
                        easy. She’s just fucking stupid.

           Some rumbles from the crowd. Weston goes into smile control.

                                 WESTON
                        Okay, there’s no need for that.
           INT. STAGE CONTROL BOOTH - CONTINUOUS

           Amita and the Stage Director both go for mics.

                                 AMITA
                        Security, we need a patron escorted 
                        out immediately.

           INT. STAGE - CONTINUOUS

           Uneasy rumbles as Weston stands, trapped under the lights.

                                 AUDIENCE MEMBER (O.C.)
                        Not as stupid as you though. You 
                        little fucking sissy.

           Weston tries to pinpoint the audience member, and finally 
           spots him when he stands. He’s a big burly Man, beard, 
           tattoos. Wearing a leather cut. When Guards come at him he 
           pivots enough for Weston to see the Sand Viper emblem.

                                 WESTON
                        Oh, you got to be kidding me...

           IN THE AUDIENCE the Teenager with his family takes out his 
           phone and starts recording.

                                 TEENAGER
                        Holy shit...

           The Sand Viper swats away the Guard with ease. Suddenly two 
           more burly Men stand up. They take off jackets revealing 
           leather cuts and Sand Viper rockers. The first Sand Viper 
           hops the podium and climbs on stage.

           INT. STAGE CONTROL BOOTH - CONTINUOUS

           Everyone is stunned. Banner and Amita watch as it quickly 
           gets out of control.

                                 STAGE DIRECTOR
                        Security! More security!

           INT. STAGE - CONTINUOUS

           A half dozen bikers are now kicking through patrons and 
           unprepared Security Guards moving towards the stage.

           Weston is a deer in headlights. The lead Viper approaches. 
                                 SAND VIPER
                        You look scared? Why are you 
                        scared?

           The other Bikers tromp up to the stage, rattle the set 
           pieces, spook the contestants.  

                                 WESTON
                        ...What are you doing?

                                 SAND VIPER
                        Supposed to give you a message from 
                        our brothers in Phoenix.

                                 WESTON
                        ...right... now?

                                 SAND VIPER
                        Why not now? You busy?

           More Guards flood the stages. Some small scuffles but not too 
           unruly.

                                 SAND VIPER (CONT’D)
                        They say you’re in deep. Wanted us 
                        to relay our strict finance policy.

           He gets in close to Weston’s face. He’s rattled, but holds 
           his ground, more out of paralysis.

                                 SAND VIPER (CONT’D)
                        NO LATE PAYMENTS.

           Weston nods ‘okay,’ barely able to blink, his head doing 
           somersaults, almost wondering if it’s all real. 

           The Guards have control of the other bikers, who were never 
           putting up a real fight, just causing a disruption. Guards 
           come on the stage for the lead Viper. Before they get to him 
           he throws an arm around the frozen Weston and smiles big for 
           the crowd, like the two are a team accepting applause.

           INT. TRIBUTARY OFFICES - LATE DAY

           Weston is barely any less stilted as he sits on the couch. 
           Banner and Amita are speechless as well. Finally:

                                 BANNER
                        We have coverage to cut around all 
                        the fuck ups?
                                 AMITA
                        Probably. Second episode might be 
                        tough. And the third.

           Banner chews on it. Quietly stares at the spaced out Weston.

                                 BANNER
                        If the stage wasn’t already rented 
                        for tomorrow, the sets built, and 
                        the crew paid for...

           Weston zones back in, matches eyes with Banner.

                                 BANNER (CONT’D)
                        Nice retirement plan in Phoenix?

           Barely a drip of emotion from Weston.

           INT. NEWS STUDIO - OFFICE - EVENING

           A crowd is gathered around a desk watching a computer. Susan 
           Sanchez is laughing louder than anyone. Polly is behind her.

                                 SUSAN SANCHEZ
                        Play it again, play it again!

           Polly spots Davis and waves him over.

                                 POLLY
                        Come here!

           Davis gets close to see the computer as it replays.  

           ON THE COMPUTER chaos erupts and the lead Viper marches up to 
           Weston, who from the phone camera, looks especially stricken.

                                 SAND VIPER (ON THE COMPUTER)
                        You look scared? Why are you 
                        scared?

           Susan erupts with laughter again.

                                 SUSAN SANCHEZ
                        That’s my favorite part!

           Davis watches, rapt. 

                                 DAVIS
                        What else were they saying?

                                 POLLY
                        He said ‘no late payments’.
           Davis is agog.

                                 POLLY (CONT’D)
                        How do you end up owing a biker 
                        gang money?

           The computer pauses on the image of the smiling Sand Viper 
           with his arm around the stricken Weston.

           INT. WESTON’S HOUSE - OFFICE - NIGHT

           The same paused image of Weston and the Sand Viper is on the 
           computer. Natalie is on the phone. Daisy sits at the desk, 
           looking at the image.

                                 NATALIE (INTO PHONE)
                        ...so it was not a stunt?

           INT. WESTON’S MERCEDES (MOVING) - CONTINUOUS

           A still spaced Weston drives down Sunset, talking on the 
           speaker phone.

                                 WESTON
                        No, but it was fine. They were 
                        just... being a little rowdy.

           INTERCUT WITH NATALIE AT HOME

                                 NATALIE (INTO PHONE)
                        Because I’ve seen those guys here.

                                 DAISY
                        They’re hardcore bikers. Some of 
                        their patches mean they’ve killed 
                        for the club.

                                 NATALIE
                        Daisy, shut up. I’m talking.

                                 WESTON
                        Same motorcycle club. They were 
                        just the LA branch, whatever you 
                        call it.

                                 NATALIE (INTO PHONE)
                        ...Okay. If everything’s fine. 
                        How’d it go otherwise?

           He can barely muster the lie.
                                 WESTON
                        ...Great.

                                 NATALIE (INTO PHONE)
                        Really? You sound not as excited as 
                        you’re supposed to...

                                 WESTON
                        I’m just tired. Long day.

                                 NATALIE (INTO PHONE)
                        Okay. I’ll let you go. Oh, how’d 
                        Jennifer Lawrence look?

                                 WESTON
                        Older than you’d expect.

                                 NATALIE (INTO PHONE)
                        I knew it. All right, I love you. 
                        Get some sleep.

                                 WESTON
                        ...Love you.

           She hangs up. 

           He’s stopped at a traffic light. Deep in his head. He watches 
           as a Toyota inches its way into traffic at a yellow light. It 
           just barely veers away from a speeding Mercedes. Screeching 
           tires and honking horns. Almost a devastating collision.

           Weston just waits there for a beat, watching the scene that 
           almost happened. Dwelling on it.

           INT. HOLLYWOOD ROOSEVELT HOTEL - LOBBY - NIGHT

           Weston paces into the hotel. At the couches, Baldwin, the 
           Scribner editor, has been waiting. He stands with the manila 
           envelope in his hand. Weston barely stutter steps at all. 

                                 BALDWIN
                        Mr. Weston. 

                                 WESTON
                        Editor publishing guy. Sorry I 
                        didn’t commit your memory to name. 
                        I mean your... name to memory.

           He plops down on the couch. Baldwin calmly sits down.

                                 BALDWIN
                        I had a chance to go over your 
                        manuscript.
           He touches the envelope. Weston plays it steady, nods “sure”.

                                 BALDWIN (CONT’D)
                        I thought it was interesting you 
                        chose to write your memoirs from 
                        the perspective of a young girl.

                                 WESTON
                        I had to find a way to spruce it 
                        up.

           Baldwin opens the envelope and straightens the pages. The 
           title page reads “THE ADVENTURES OF PIPPI LONGSTOCKING  BY 
           ASTRID LINDGREN”. The author’s name is scratched out and 
           “COLIN WESTON” is penciled in.

                                 BALDWIN
                        Did you take a job hosting a game 
                        show?

                                 WESTON
                        The best answer I can give you to 
                        that is maybe. At the moment that’s 
                        accurate.

                                 BALDWIN
                        This undermines the credibility, 
                        such that it is, of marketing a 
                        newsman’s memoir, don’t you think?

           Weston just calmly nods that it does. Baldwin finally gets 
           tired of the pretenses.

                                 BALDWIN (CONT’D)
                        Our lawyers will be in contact. 
                        We’ll be suing you for 
                        reimbursement of funds. And fraud 
                        if possible.
                             (gets up)
                        Good luck with the game show.

           He heads out. Weston sits there a beat. He takes out his 
           phone, opens the internet. He goes to a ‘NEWS ANCHOR SPEAKS 
           HARD TRUTH’ site. Looks at the hit count. ‘2,385,325’.

           He scrolls through a web search. There’s hundreds of sites 
           carrying stories. ‘ANGRY ANCHOR IN BIKER BRAWL,’ ‘FIGHTING 
           NEWSMAN PALS WITH BIKERS’. The screen shot of the lead Viper 
           with his arm wrapped around him is everywhere. Memes are 
           already up. Weston and the Viper embracing at the Grand 
           Canyon. At the White House. At a gay wedding.

                                 HIPSTER
                        You’re him. You’re that guy.
           Weston looks up. A couple guys with interesting facial hair 
           and ugly shoes stop as they’re passing through the lobby. 

                                 HIPSTER (CONT’D)
                        No way, dude, do you mind?

           He holds up his phone ‘can I take a selfie?’ Without waiting 
           for a response he moves in close to Weston, who barely moves 
           or changes his empty expression, as he takes a pic. 

           The Hipsters smile a ‘right on’ and move along their way. 
           Weston just stares ahead.

           INT. ROOSEVELT HOTEL - WESTON’S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Weston shuffles inside, looking whipped by the day, the 
           month, the year. He takes off his jacket but stutters a 
           moment when he sees Mona is there. 

           She stands and they face off, both more flustered and 
           anticipatory than angry.

                                 MONA
                        I called the local fancy hotels, 
                        asked if you were staying. The maid 
                        let me in. I said I was your wife.

           He nods ‘right,’ seems to take her presence in stride. He 
           paces by her, to the window, glances outside.

                                 WESTON
                        This hotel is supposed to be 
                        haunted. Montgomery Clift, Marilyn 
                        Monroe both lost their shit here.

           He looks out at the ledge, the long drop to the street below.

                                 MONA
                        There’s worse places to lose it.

           He turns back around and tosses his jacket on the bureau, but 
           his aim goes askew and it knocks into the liquor on the 
           adjoining minibar. A couple bottles fall. He stares at them.

                                 MONA (CONT’D)
                        When I got in the car it was rage. 
                        Then self-pity, then pining. Not 
                        sure what it is now. It’s not 
                        acceptance. It’s something else.

                                 WESTON
                        Perfectly handled chaos.
                                 MONA
                        No.

           Weston finally turns his look from the Jack Daniels.

                                 WESTON
                        I’m not sure I was talking about 
                        you. 

                                 MONA
                        Oh, bullshit, Wes. You make all 
                        your own choices, and you pride 
                        yourself on understanding the world 
                        better than everyone else.

           He quietly sits on the bed, closes his eyes at that.

                                 MONA (CONT’D)
                        This is happening to me, not you.

           A heavy beat. She walks closer to him, right in front of him.

                                 WESTON
                        Something else is happening to me.

           He looks at her. Sees right past her to his own reflection in 
           the mirror. Once again, polished and smiling. His best self.

                                 MONA
                        Oh, you’re the one who’s going to 
                        deal with this? Have to raise a 
                        child alone and tell her she’s the 
                        result of bad judgement...

           She starts to pace as she rants. But it drowns out with WHITE 
           NOISE. The whole visage starts to shake slightly.

           Weston quietly holds his head.

                                 WESTON
                        ...I think I’m having a nervous 
                        breakdown.

           She doesn’t hear it. He looks at her, but she tunnels, starts 
           to mute. 

           BLACKNESS

           She fades back in. Just a blip. She catches sight of him.

                                 MONA
                        ...Hey. Hey...

           It’s dull. She tunnels again.
           BLACKNESS

           Fades back in.

                                 MONA (CONT’D)
                        Wes... Wes... Hey.

           She’s on him now, and he focuses on her. She props him up. 

                                 MONA (CONT’D)
                        Just relax, you jackass.

           A look of vague compassion. His head is swimming.

                                 MONA (CONT’D)
                        Hang on.

           She gets up and heads into the bathroom.

           IN THE BATHROOM she goes for a towel, runs it under water.

                                 MONA (CONT’D)
                        Pretty sure I’m the one who’s 
                        supposed to be having fainting 
                        spells. I’m not... I don’t expect 
                        you to leave your family. 

           She rings it out and heads back. 

           IN THE MAIN ROOM she walks in with the cold rag.

                                 MONA (CONT’D)
                        I just knew it would be easier to 
                        talk here and settle some things 
                        without our lives in the way...

           Weston is gone. She looks around, incredulous. Pissed.

           EXT. HOLLYWOOD STREETS - NIGHT

           The glitzy nightlife. There for the taking. Weston’s Mercedes 
           moves through it all.

           INT. WESTON’S MERCEDES (MOVING) - NIGHT

           Weston drives, a blank look on his face.

           EXT. LOS ANGELES STREETS - NIGHT

           The glitz gives way to some of the seedier LA elements. More 
           liquor stores. More pawn shops. More XXX joints.
           INT. WESTON’S MERCEDES (MOVING) - NIGHT

           The empty gas light is on. The car starts to chug chug clunk. 
           That bad sound as it dies. Weston just stares at it blankly.

           EXT. ROAD - CONTINUOUS

           The Mercedes pulls off the road gurgling its last breath. Run 
           down corner shops and crappy squat houses all around. Weston 
           gets out. He ambles a bit, bends to tie his shoe. His face is 
           right next to the smiling etch of his face on the trunk. The 
           real and the fake. He gets up, starts walking.

           EXT. STREET - LATER

           Cars fly by Weston, he barely flinches. He passes a bus stop. 
           A few tough youths, all black and Latino, give him some hard 
           stares. Way out of his element, he doesn’t acknowledge them.

           EXT. CITY BLOCK - LATER

           Cars whizz by. Some of them honk. Weston is a step away from 
           the speeding cars, almost teetering. He looks at the road a 
           beat, lost in contemplation. 

           He then looks up at the sad, shitty block to which he’s 
           wandered. Laundromat, liquor store, corner market. And a hole 
           in the wall bar.

           INT. BAR - NIGHT

           A shot glass sits on the counter. Scotch tips forward and 
           fills the glass. Weston takes the glass and holds it.

           An African American female Bartender watches him.

                                 BARTENDER
                        You do this a lot?

                                 WESTON
                        No. I don’t really drink anymore.

                                 BARTENDER
                        That ain’t what I meant.

           She gestures to the bar. A run down dump and not a white face 
           to be seen. Tough crowd too. A few look at him, well-to-do 
           white guy in his expensive suit. A couple stools over a YOUNG 
           GANG HOOD stares at him. Weston faces forward, unconcerned.
                                 WESTON
                        You know LA had one of the highest 
                        crime rates in the country just 
                        fifteen years ago? Not anymore. 
                        It’s safer than most big cities.

           INT. NEWS STUDIO - OFFICE - NIGHT

           Davis sits with Hefner and a few other suits, computers with 
           pics of Weston and the Viper are out. 

                                 SUIT #1
                        Ratings and awareness are as high 
                        as we’ve ever seen them. It’s a 
                        question of what that’s worth.

                                 DAVIS
                        We know where his bargaining 
                        position is coming from, at least. 
                        He’s hard up for cash.

           Hefner looks at other memes of Weston walking onto the 
           morning show set.

           INT. BAR - CONTINUOUS

           Weston looks at the Bartender.

                                 WESTON
                        In the same time span Facebook, 
                        Twitter, all-access-media-all-the-
                        time becomes omnipresent, violent 
                        crime goes down. That seem weird to 
                        you?

                                 BARTENDER
                        That ain’t what seem weird to me.

                                 WESTON
                        It can’t reach everybody though, 
                        pervasive as it is. Some are always 
                        going to stick with crime.

           He lazily gestures to the Hood as he examines the scotch. The 
           Bartender’s eyes go wide. The Hood keeps very still.

                                 LEROY
                        You, uh, you sayin’ somethin’ to me?

           Weston doesn’t waver. Bartender tries to make cool.
                                 BARTENDER
                        Leroy, he didn’t...

                                 WESTON
                        The worst crimes are the ones you 
                        never hear about. The government 
                        burying the cure for cancer, CEOs 
                        buying the white house. 

                                 RANDOM PATRON
                        Ain’t no cure for cancer. You can’t 
                        buy the white house.

                                 WESTON
                        That’s what I just said. Keep up.
                             (back to the Bartender)
                        The bullshit stickup stuff Leroy 
                        here pulls is just something a 
                        talking head blathers on about on 
                        local news in a place like, let’s 
                        say Phoenix. People forget 
                        immediately. It just doesn’t 
                        matter. He doesn’t make a lasting 
                        impression. You know who does 
                        though? That blathering talking 
                        head. You know why? Capped teeth.

                                 LEROY
                        Is that the way of it?

           Movement is starting to happen in the bar as Leroy moves in. 
           Weston still doesn’t waver. He turns directly to Leroy.

                                 WESTON
                        What’s the worst thing you ever 
                        did?

                                 LEROY
                        I’m about to show you.

                                 WESTON
                        Before you do, let me see if I can 
                        explain to you why you don’t 
                        matter. I’ve been told I have a 
                        gift of charm and persuasion.

           Leroy dead eyes a fearless Weston.

           INT. WESTON’S HOUSE - DAISY’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Daisy ichats with Bran. But she has another window open on 
           her ipad. Sites of Weston and his antics.  
                                 BRAN (FROM ICHAT)
                        ...I knew this kid from Gallway 
                        once. We went to summer camp 
                        together back in the day. He would 
                        only go to the bathroom when 
                        everyone else left. 

           Barely paying attention to him, Daisy clicks on a site that 
           claims ‘NEW RAW FEED OF CRAZY ANCHOR’. She clicks on it and 
           it shows Weston bellowing his ‘...fuck, fuck, fuck...’ rant 
           in the studio. Daisy frowns a little at it.

                                 BRAN (FROM ICHAT) (CONT’D)
                        Didn’t want to take his pants down 
                        in front of us or something.

                                 DAISY
                        Yeah, whatever. I got to go.

           Before Bran can object she clicks him away, drops the ipad 
           and heads down the hall. 

           INT. WESTON’S HOUSE - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Daisy knocks on the door and peeks inside. Natalie sits on 
           the bed going over papers.

                                 DAISY
                        Hey, mom?

           Natalie looks up, ‘Yeah?’

           INT. BAR - CONTINUOUS

           Several other Men have come up to stand behind Weston. Leroy 
           maintains a cool calm, never breaking eye contact.

                                 WESTON
                        First, I want to eliminate race. 
                        That has nothing to do with it. I’m 
                        going to guess you’re poor. 
                        Correct?

                                 LEROY
                        Ain’t rich.

                                 WESTON
                        Okay, also not a factor. You see, 
                        people will look at a man, listen 
                        to a man, buy anything from a man 
                        as long as he appears to know more 
                        than them.
           INT. ROOSEVELT HOTEL - WESTON’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Natalie lies on the bed, fighting back the sadness and anger 
           and confusion and disappointment.  

                                 WESTON (V.O.)
                        It doesn’t matter if he does. It 
                        doesn’t matter if he’s good. It 
                        doesn’t even matter if he has 
                        anything worth a damn to sell. 

           INT. BAR - CONTINUOUS

           Weston continues to the quiet but bristling room. He lifts 
           the still untouched scotch.

                                 WESTON
                        Because people secretly want to be 
                        told how stupid they are. Directly 
                        or indirectly. 

           He sets the scotch back down.

                                 WESTON (CONT’D)
                        Mostly indirectly because they lack 
                        any kind of self-awareness or 
                        perspicacity -- that means wits.

           POP! Leroy suddenly punches Weston square in the face for the 
           condescension. Startled, Weston is able to stay on his stool. 
           A bit of blood drips from his lip. 

                                 WESTON (CONT’D)
                        Whoa. Good jab there, Leroy. Caught 
                        me off guard. But, stay with me...

           Leroy and the crowd stays primed but Weston keeps his cool. 

                                 WESTON (CONT’D)
                        I’ve been selling to people for 
                        years. Insurance, cars, ideas, 
                        smiles, promises. 

           EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT

           Weston’s face looms large over Phoenix on a billboard.

                                 WESTON (V.O.)
                        They’re all so willing to believe. 
                        And trust me, you can make a 
                        juggler doubt he has hands with a 
                        smile and a good enough line.
           INT. BAR - CONTINUOUS

           Weston is clear-eyed. Leroy is calm, but on a hair-trigger. 

                                 WESTON
                        It gets to the point where you 
                        start to wonder what’s wrong with 
                        them. What’s a person’s capacity to 
                        ingest so much nonsense and 
                        bullshit? Turns out quite a lot. 
                        They like the taste. You know what 
                        I’m talking about, Leroy.

           POP! Leroy smacks him again. Weston’s head violently jerks to 
           the punch but he stays on his stool. More blood from his lip. 

                                 WESTON (CONT’D)
                        ...Woof. Okay, here you go. Because 
                        I can sense you have somewhere to 
                        be. Honest about self now. The self-
                        sabotage and bad choices - that’s 
                        part personal weakness...

           INT. TRIBUTARY OFFICES - NIGHT

           In the edit bay, Amita goes over footage of the taping with 
           an Editor. She comes to a camera shot of Weston frazzled.

                                 WESTON (V.O.)
                        But the other part, really the most 
                        important part, was because I knew 
                        it wouldn’t matter. Because people 
                        prefer the lie.

           The Editor comes up with a different shot and Weston looks 
           like a million bucks, his best self.

                                 AMITA
                        That one.

           INT. BAR - CONTINUOUS

           Weston keeps the moment going, jitters just starting to peek 
           out under the surface.

                                 WESTON
                        And in the end, no matter how 
                        significant the truth is, a pretty 
                        lie will last longer. 

           Leroy is cool as ice. Weston looks at him. 
                                 WESTON (CONT’D)
                        Are you understanding this? You 
                        want me to do a baseball metaphor 
                        about Astroturf?

           POP! Another punch. Weston wobbles hard, getting dizzy.

                                 WESTON (CONT’D)
                        Shit, Leroy. You’re right, that 
                        doesn’t hold because Astroturf 
                        sucks and everyone hates it. Okay, 
                        I’m almost done. 

           He lowers his head, looks level at the scotch. 

                                 WESTON (CONT’D)
                        This is where you come in. You see, 
                        you’re reality. I’m the lie. You 
                        might rob somebody, Leroy, you 
                        might kill them, but I smile at 
                        them. Now, do you understand why 
                        none of you faggots matter?

           Leroy violently slams Weston’s face to the counter. In a rush 
           all the other Men pile on.

           Light shines into the room. The bed is ruffled and legs begin 
           to stir. Mona wakes up. Bleary, tired eyes. Not a lot of 
           sleep. She looks around the room. No one but her.

                        The great divide between the

                        vast you could fit a couple solar 
                        systems in it. 

           They watch memes of Weston and the lead Viper superimposed on 
           police footage of a bank robbery, cc footage of a convenience 
           store hold up, and home video of a junior high dance recital.

                                 RECEPTIONIST
                        Checking in?

           Natalie and Daisy each have a day bag

                                 NATALIE
                        My husband’s actually already 
                        checked in. We’re just joining him. 
                        Can you tell me which room?

           She turns back to Daisy. ‘Good idea to come.’

           INT. NEWS STUDIO - OFFICE - DAY

           Davis and Hefner have Weston’s contract on the desk.

                                 DAVIS
                        If we want to keep him I can deal 
                        with him. He’s a giant pain in my 
                        ass, but I can take up yoga or 
                        something if it means keeping the 
                        demo for another decade. We know 
                        where it’s all been coming from 
                        now, so we can get ahead of it.

           Hefner just glances at him, ‘Can we?’

                                 HEFNER
                        What’s crazy worth?
                                 DAVIS
                        If he’s cash hungry, and got some 
                        little pixie on the side he’s 
                        trying to keep secret, we can 
                        probably hardline for a better 
                        deal.

           Hefner looks at a picture of a smiling Weston on the wall.

                                 HEFNER
                        Hard to trust a desperate man.

           EXT. SUNSET GOWER STUDIOS - DAY

           A long line of tourists wait for the taping. Amita walks by, 
           half of them watch footage on their phone of the Sand Vipers 
           taking the stage, or other Weston memes. A P.A. directs them.

                                 P.A.
                        Okay, we’re going to start taking 
                        you in in groups now...

           INT. TRIBUTARY OFFICES - LATER

           Banner is on the phone, getting hot. Amita goes over prep.

                                 BANNER (INTO PHONE)
                        ...I don’t know, he’s not answering 
                        his phone. 

           INT. TALENT AGENCY - DAY

           Grevel is on the phone in his office.

                                 GREVEL (INTO PHONE)
                        I’m sure he’s on his way. Traffic 
                        is, you know... balls.

           INTERCUT WITH BANNER AT THE TRIBUTARY OFFICES

                                 BANNER (INTO PHONE)
                        I don’t care about traffic. I care 
                        about my empty stage, and I’m 
                        already past start time. 

           A squawk comes in over Amita’s headset.

                                 AMITA
                        They got him at the gate. He’s 
                        going to change in his dressing 
                        room.
                                 BANNER (INTO PHONE)
                        Neat trick.

                                 GREVEL (INTO PHONE)
                        Happy to help.

           They hang up. Banner sighs. He picks up his baseball. Fixes 
           the knuckle ball grip. He sighs again.

           INT. STAGE - BACKSTAGE - MOMENTS LATER

           Amita moves through the narrow halls and comes to Weston’s 
           door. It’s closed, she knocks.

                                 AMITA
                        Hey, you good?

           Nothing. She knocks again.

                                 AMITA (CONT’D)
                        Wes? We’re past cameras ready.

           Nothing. She tries the door. It’s locked. She’s about to 
           speak into her headset, but then through the door--

                                 WESTON (O.S.)
                        Give me just a second.

           She lets go the headset mic. 

           INT. STAGE - WESTON’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           A rumpled, torn suit is on the couch. 

           FROM BEHIND, Weston wears a crisp, new suit. Hair is perfect. 
           He’s at the vanity mirror. Make up jars are open on the 
           counter and he’s applying it. 

           CLOSE UP REFLECTION IN THE MIRROR as he dabs at his face.

                                 WESTON
                        ...just have to put the illusion 
                        together...

           He’s talking quietly, more to himself.

                                 WESTON (CONT’D)
                        ...suit, face, smile...

                                 AMITA (O.S.)
                        What? I can’t hear you.
           He dabs a few more spots. 

                                 WESTON
                        ...all the pieces...

           He steps back, looks in the mirror.

           Pretty much the man on the billboards. A little bit of a 
           thick tan from the extra make up, but cleaned up nice. 

           He stares at himself and flashes the smile. Pure Weston.

           INT. STAGE - BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS

           Amita waits outside, gets a squawk from the headset.

                                 AMITA
                        They’re asking if you’re ready to 
                        start the intro.

                                 WESTON (O.S.)
                        Tell them to roll, I’m headed to 
                        stage.

                                 AMITA (INTO HEADET)
                        That’s affirmative. We’re ready. 
                        He’s on his way.

           A P.A. comes up from behind Amita.

                                 P.A.
                        Is he coming?

           She turns around to the P.A.

                                 AMITA
                        I just told them--

           The door opens and Weston blows right past her toward the 
           stage.

                                 AMITA (INTO HEADET) (CONT’D)
                        Walking up.

           She follows after Weston.

           INT. STAGE - MOMENTS LATER

           The audience is packed and loaded. Excitement is up. 

           At the far end on the front row, Natalie and Daisy sit 
           quietly, noticeably out of rhythm with everybody else.
                                 DAISY
                        Mom, let’s just go.

           But Natalie has a tense, bristling look to her. Just then the 
           lights start zig zagging doing their thing. The crowd cheers.

                                 ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
                        It’s time for Kingmaker! 

           Daisy grimaces quietly.

           INT. STAGE - BACKSTAGE - CONTINUOUS

           TRACK Weston as he quickly moves through the narrow halls, 
           Amita trailing him. A Stage Hand spots him just as he passes 
           by. She blanches as he heads out. 

           INT. STAGE - CONTINUOUS

           The room is full and ready.

                                 ANNOUNCER (O.S.)
                        Here’s your host... Colin Weston!

           Weston bounds out from the side and heads center stage.

                                 WESTON
                        Good athternoon, and thankths for 
                        coming out...

           There’s a collective gasp from the audience. Weston’s face is 
           beaten to a pulp. Poorly applied make up doesn’t come close 
           to covering the cuts and bruising. A large gash with barely 
           fresh scabbing runs down his cheek from temple to lip. At 
           least three teeth are missing. One eye is near shut from 
           swelling.

           Natalie is stricken silent, Daisy screams.

                                 WESTON (CONT’D)
                        Thith ith day two of our queth to 
                        crown a king...

           He’s in oblivion as he goes on.

           BESIDE THE STAGE Amita finally sees him in the light.

                                 AMITA
                        Oh, my God...
           INT. STAGE CONTROL BOOTH - CONTINUOUS

           The engineers are dumbstruck. Banner tries to set his coffee 
           down but it misses the table.

           INT. STAGE - CONTINUOUS

           The audience is audibly rumbling. Camera phones come out.

                                 WESTON
                        I hope you brought your dreamth, 
                        becauth we’re here to make them.

           He starts to get the hint of off rhythm from the audience.

                                 WESTON (CONT’D)
                        We have Harry Dean Thtanton back. 
                        Harry...

           He looks back to the throne. Harry sits there squinting at 
           Weston, uncertain.

           Weston looks queerly at the audience.

                                 WESTON (CONT’D)
                        All right, people. We need 
                        energy...

                                 DAISY (O.S.)
                        Dad!

           It startles him. He looks around.

                                 DAISY (CONT’D)
                        Dad!

           Daisy moves forward tentatively from the seats. Natalie puts 
           a hand on her to stop, but not forceful. The Security Guards 
           are so thrown by Weston she slips by them.

           Weston finally spots her, sees her horrified face.

                                 WESTON
                        Daise?

           Suddenly, it turns for him. Seeing her begins the flood.

                                 DAISY
                        ...Dad, what happened to you?

           All at once he can hear the crowd rumbling in stupefied awe. 
           All at once the pain, the shame. 
           INT. STAGE CONTROL BOOTH - CONTINUOUS

           Everyone is transfixed.

                                 ENGINEER
                        ...What... what do we...

                                 BANNER
                        Cut tape.

           Banner snaps out of it when the Engineer delays.

                                 BANNER (CONT’D)
                        Now, god damn it! Cut the fucking 
                        tape!

           The Engineer does. Recording lights go dim. The screens are 
           still up though. ON THE MONITOR Weston now looks like a 
           wounded animal in flood lights. He backs away from Daisy as 
           she approaches.

           INT. STAGE - CONTINUOUS

           Daisy makes her way forward to Weston. Fear and worry start 
           to come out of her. Which just pushes it all into overdrive 
           for him. He continues backing up as she moves to him.

                                 DAISY
                        Dad, what’s going on?

                                 WESTON
                        ...I’m doing the... show...

           Last grasps, clinging to the delusion... He looks out and sees 
           the entranced, gawking crowd. It starts to overwhelm him.

                                 DAISY
                        What’s wrong with you? Why are you 
                        acting this way?

                                 NATALIE
                        Daisy.

           She has come toward them, still mystified by it all, but she 
           has found her grounding.

                                 NATALIE (CONT’D)
                        Daisy, come here.

           Daisy stays on her father. 

                                 DAISY
                        Who was the woman in your room?
           The daughter asks, but it’s Natalie who has eyes on Weston. 
           The whole family together now, center stage, spotlights.

           Weston looks at his wife, the sadness and anger in her eyes 
           brings it crashing down. He looks to his daughter. The same.

           He looks out to the audience. Then next to all the cameras he 
           sees a monitor showing his mangled, wrecked image.

                                 WESTON
                        Oh, my.

           He finally looks back at Natalie and Daisy, seems to have 
           found some control. He’s about to speak, then reconsiders. 

                                 NATALIE
                        Wes...

           He looks away from them. Then moves to the monitor at the side 
           of the stage, picking up pace. He’s almost running for it...

           ...And attacks it, ferociously, clumsily, knocking it over. 
           His picture blips out. In his fervor he turns to the random 
           CAMERAMAN capturing his image. Weston goes at him with sloppy 
           blind rage. The Cameraman has no clue what to do.

                                 NATALIE (CONT’D)
                        Wes!

           Weston keeps at him, dragging the man down, pummeling him. 
           Weston grabs a blunt piece of the smashed monitor and rears 
           it back to hit the Cameraman. The audience gasps in horror...

           A GRIP rushes in and tackles Weston. He struggles, but in an 
           instant more Grips are in the fray pinning him to the ground.

           Natalie and Daisy watch in complete and total horror.

           Weston fights the hands keeping him down, fighting with 
           everything he has left, screaming, letting out all his 
           demons, but he’s stuck, going nowhere, forced to keep them.

                                                              FADE OUT.

                                                               FADE IN:

                                    “20 MONTHS LATER”

           EXT. PRISON - DAY

           A bleak, gray place. A taxi waits for a lone person walking 
           from the structure.
                                 INTERVIEWER (V.O.)
                        You spent the first five months of 
                        your sentence in the medical ward.

                                 WESTON (V.O.)
                        Medical ward and pysch ward, yes. 
                        Then eventually they moved me into 
                        general population.

           Weston gets into the taxi and it drives away.

           INT. TAXI (MOVING) - LATER

           Weston sits in the back. His face is healed, but he now has a 
           large, vivid scar running across his cheek.

                                 INTERVIEWER (V.O.)
                        Were you surprised to learn that a 
                        federal case had been in the works 
                        against you? Do you even remember 
                        your sentencing?

                                 WESTON (V.O.)
                        I honestly don’t know. I don’t know 
                        if I remember it, or just lawyers 
                        telling me about it later. It 
                        happened so soon after Los Angeles.

                                 INTERVIEWER (V.O.)
                        Bank fraud, misappropriation of 
                        funds, and falsifying federal tax 
                        records related to your part 
                        ownership in a Phoenix car 
                        dealership.

           INT. STUDIO - DAY

           The INTERVIEWER, a woman, 45, all professional, looks 
           directly at her subject, Colin Weston. He has a solemn, but 
           clear and open expression.

                                 WESTON
                        Yes. And then later I was sued for 
                        divorce, as well as recovery of 
                        funds from a publishing house.

           He says it regretfully, but poised.

                                 INTERVIEWER
                        You lost your position as news 
                        anchor for KPTV news.
                                 WESTON
                        Yeah, well, that one was a 
                        certainty.

           EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY

           Weston walks up to a modest two-story complex and heads to an 
           apartment. Unlocks it.

                                 WESTON (V.O.)
                        After the conviction they found I 
                        had violated some ethics clauses so 
                        they were able to void any payments 
                        or buyouts for early termination.

           INT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS

           A simple, modest one-bedroom. Furniture and decoration is on 
           the medium-to-low end.

                                 INTERVIEWER (V.O.)
                        And of course the game show you 
                        were hosting never materialized. 
                        With you or anyone else.

                                 WESTON (V.O.)
                        No. I suppose it would have been 
                        hard for them to move forward after 
                        all the... notoriety. 

           INT. STUDIO - CONTINUOUS

           The Interviewer stays on Weston.

                                 INTERVIEWER
                        Some phone camera footage leaked 
                        out. Have you seen it?

                                 WESTON
                        Yeah, I’ve seen it. It’s... tough. 
                        I am grateful that Charlie Banner 
                        cut tape when it started... when I 
                        started... It surely would have 
                        leaked, and in full audio and hi-
                        def, it would have been so much 
                        worse. I appreciate his integrity 
                        at that moment.

                                 INTERVIEWER
                        What do you remember about that 
                        taping?
           Hard, but Weston digs deep.

                                 WESTON
                        I remember two things. I remember 
                        the Kingmaker emblem was crooked on 
                        the dais. Weirdly, I don’t know why 
                        I remember that. And I remember my 
                        daughter’s face when she first 
                        called out to me and approached the 
                        stage.

           It chokes him. But he keeps it together. 

                                 INTERVIEWER
                        Have you spoken to her?

                                 WESTON
                        Yeah. Lots of times. We see each 
                        other fairly regularly. And I have 
                        a young son that lives with his 
                        mother.

                                 INTERVIEWER
                        But you don’t see her. Or your ex-
                        wife.

           EXT. ROADSIDE - DAY

           A billboard looms over a busy street. “KPTV ACTION NEWS WITH 
           SUSAN SANCHEZ AND PETER DANCY” Their smiling faces greet the 
           city.

                                 WESTON (V.O.)
                        No.

                                 INTERVIEWER (V.O.)
                        After so much attention, what do 
                        you expect the public to think 
                        about you?

           INT. STUDIO - CONTINUOUS

           Weston considers the question heavily.

                                 WESTON
                        Well, I had a spectacularly public 
                        embarrassment. All my sins and 
                        shortcomings on full display. And 
                        they all got away from me, and I 
                        just popped. The medical profession 
                        calls it an acute time-limited 
                        reactive disorder.
                                 INTERVIEWER
                        But...

                                 WESTON
                        But, the thing is, I hold fast to 
                        much of what I said. It wasn’t all 
                        just a ploy for ratings, or 
                        attention, or contract leverage. 
                        People reacted because they saw 
                        something real mixed up in it. I 
                        was offering something that they 
                        wanted, and that was a yearning to 
                        speak the truth. That’s what I 
                        think they reacted to, so I can’t 
                        apologize for that.

                                 INTERVIEWER
                        And that’s how you would want to 
                        leave the public thinking about 
                        your story?

                                 WESTON
                        I don’t want to leave them with it, 
                        I want them to continue thinking 
                        about it. Because my story’s not a 
                        flameout story.

           He looks to the camera.

                                 WESTON (CONT’D)
                        It’s a comeback story.

           He smiles his million dollar smile, now with scar.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK.

                                         THE END
