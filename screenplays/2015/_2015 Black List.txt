           The Black List was compiled from the suggestions of over 250 film executives, each of whom contributed the 
           names of up to ten of his or her favorite scripts that were written in, or are somehow uniquely associated with, 
           2015 and will not have begun principal photography during this calendar year.

           This year, scripts had to receive at least six mentions to be included on the Black List.

           All reasonable effort has been made to confirm the information contained herein.

           The  Black  List  apologizes  for  all  misspellings,  misattributions,  incorrect  representation  identification,  and 
           questionable 2015 affiliations.

           It has been said many times, but it’s worth repeating:

           The Black List is not a “best of” list. It is, at best, a “most liked” list.
                                                                Keep ranting.
                                               We know who’s really doing the planting.

           something else: the final opportunity to uphold promises and obligations to the people of South Vietnam.
