                                    CARNIVAL 

                                         by 

                                    Matías Caruso 
           FADE IN:

           A CIRCUS FLIER

           Floating in the night air like a falling Autumn leaf.

           “Shiv” is the name of the KNIFE THROWER, written in sharp, 
           gleaming font. A stylish illustration depicts a hooded man 
           hurling knives at us, blades reflecting a cheering crowd.

           A sharp WHISTLE - the poster TEARS as:

           A REAL KNIFE

           Cuts right THROUGH it... 

           Time slowing down as we follow it FLY... 

           WHOOSH! WHOOSH! - twisting and turning...

           WHOOSH! WHOOSH! - the blade reflecting fleeting GLIMPSES of 
           its surroundings:

           Circus tents BURNING in the night...

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        I hear them talk. They all talk so 
                        much. About the war.

           Shadows outlined against crackling flames... GANGBANGERS 
           firing semiautomatics...

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        I hear them say it was about 
                        revenge.

           Carnival PERFORMERS defending their territory... a LION TAMER 
           cracks her WHIP at a chain-wielding THUG arching in pain...

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        That it was about betrayal.

           A FIRE BREATHER blows a plume of FIRE... torching two THUGS 
           alive...

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        About money.

           The KNIFE keeps flying... STABS into a THUG’s neck...

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        But that’s just part of it.
           Blood SPURTS against the side of a trailer, and the CIRCUS 
           FLIER glued to it: “Zodiac” is the name of the FORTUNE 
           TELLER, written in sensual red font.

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        It was also about fate...

           The poster depicts a gypsy beauty holding a fan of tarot 
           cards. Wild eyes reflect flickering flames. A jewel-encrusted 
           circlet adorns her head.

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        And about love.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. THE CARNIVAL - NIGHT

           CIRCUS TENTS clustered together like a mountain range, 
           surrounded by trailers and rides. An oasis of color nested in 
           a high DESERT AREA.

           MIDWAY

           Bright. Loud. Sword swallowers and beds of nails. Music and 
           laughter. Rigged game stands with stuffed animal prizes. 
           Carnies conning money out of townies.

           CLACK!

           A knife THRUSTS between two fingers spread on a table. We’re 
           now at...

           INT. BACKSTAGE TENT - NIGHT

           A hooded man sits in darkness playing five-finger fillet.

           CLACK! CLACK! CLACK! - he stabs back and forth - faster and 
           faster while muttering something to himself. 

           It’s the knife thrower from the flier. SHIV (20). One of the 
           carnival’s star performers. We will never see him smile.

           The knife CHANGES hands - now he stabs with his left - his 
           blade a BLUR of speed as he effortlessly repeats tongue 
           twisters:
                                 SHIV
                        I thought a thought. But the 
                        thought I thought wasn't the 
                        thought I thought I thought. If the 
                        thought I thought I thought had 
                        been the thought I thought --

                                 AYLEEN (O.S.)
                        -- then I wouldn't have thought so 
                        much.

           AYLEEN (22), his ever-cheerful sister and assistant, walks in 
           and places her hand by his --

           The knife now flies over TEN FINGERS as:

                                 AYLEEN
                        We’re up, bro. Crowd is huge. Crowd 
                        is hungry. How about we give them 
                        something special tonight?

                                 SHIV
                        We do that every night.

                                 AYLEEN
                        Not talking about your knives. I’m 
                        talking about...

           She pushes the corners of his mouth up with her fingers, 
           forcing a smile.

                                 AYLEEN
                        There we go.

           But the smile doesn’t last long.

           She pulls his hood back.

                                 AYLEEN
                        And stop hiding that pretty face of 
                        yours.

           INT. BIG TOP - PERFORMANCE RING - LATER

           A spotlight slices the darkened ring with white light. It 
           follows Ayleen as she enters alone, speaking through a 
           wireless MIC.

                                 AYLEEN
                        Howdy!

           CHEERS from the public, an eclectic mix of scum: 
           Gangsta types too young to afford the gold they wear. Chronic 
           drunks holding hipflasks. Rich assholes with silicone trophy 
           wives seated on their laps.

           Ayleen’s mood suddenly darkens as...

                                 AYLEEN
                        I’m afraid I got some bad news for 
                        you. My bro isn’t feeling too well.

           Cheers dwindle into silence.

                                 AYLEEN
                        So he ain’t doing any throwing 
                        tonight.

           Silence turns into antsy murmurs.

                                 AYLEEN
                        Instead you’ll see a dancing number 
                        or some shit.

           Antsy murmurs build to angry BOOS.

                                 AYLEEN
                        Yeah I know, it sucks donkey balls. 
                        But look at the bright side... I’m 
                        just fucking with ya!!!

           Enter Shiv as he pulls his hood back up - all SPOTLIGHTS on 
           him - CHEERS! - the public gives him a rockstar welcome.

                                 AYLEEN
                        Damn right he’s throwing!
                             (dramatic voice)
                        And heee’s... in a baaaad... 
                        moooood...

           A light DAZZLES Shiv - he whips out a KNIFE and HURLS it 
           towards the SPOTLIGHT bothering him --

           CRASH! - problem solved.

                                 AYLEEN
                        See?! That’s what I’m talking 
                        about!

           The crowd ROARS in celebration.

           LATER

           Ayleen SPINS, strapped to a spinning wheel. Holds an ORCHID 
           between her teeth. 
           Twenty meters away from her, Shiv readies a knife, its sharp 
           edge GLINTING like a deadly weapon, not a circus prop.

           ACROBATS enter the stage, combining dance techniques with 
           cartwheels, flip-flops, handwalking, and other moves --

           Doing their performance right between Shiv and his target.

           He zeroes in on the flower stem, takes aim... despite the 
           dancing sea of flesh that now stands in his way...

           Crowd goes SILENT. Is he nuts?

           He is. He THROWS --

           His KNIFE flies with a razored whistle...

           Whizzing OVER an acrobat’s head...

           Flying right BETWEEN a handwalker’s legs...

           Jockeying through a web of limbs and flesh until...

           CLACK! - the knife CHOPS OFF the tip of Ayleen’s orchid!

           CROWD GOES NUTS.

           LATER

           Ayleen now stands before a 20-foot tall pile of WOODEN 
           CRATES.

           She JUMPS - hand reaching up - like a climber trying to find 
           a crevice to hold on to --

           CLACK! - a knife comes flying and STICKS into the wood --

           Her hand grasps the handle.

           CLACK! - another blade STABS right under her shoe as she 
           STEPS on the butt --

           She HOISTS herself up - her other hand reaching -- 

           CLACK! - another knife STICKS into a crate - she grabs the 
           butt --

           Shiv keeps throwing knives as she CLIMBS up the pile.

           It’s seamless. Fluid. Precise. Knives stab into crates 
           milliseconds before she reaches for them. Each throw 
           celebrated with ROARING cheers.
           But something seems to be bothering Shiv. As he keeps 
           throwing, he shoots fleeting glances at the crowd.

           Discomfort quickly builds into anger until:

           He TURNS and HURLS a knife right at the public!

           WE follow it FLY...

           The dazzling glint of spotlights on its blade...

           It sails towards a blurry crowd of cheering faces...

           Towards a smoking OLD WOMAN...

           We notice a PICKPOCKET seated behind her... his hand reaching 
           over towards her purse...

           CLACK! - the blade PINS the pickpocket’s sleeve to the back 
           of her chair --

           She whips her head - notices the thief.

           PSSS! - burns his face with her cigarette --

           INSTANT BRAWL.

           INT. BIG TOP’S ENTRANCE TENT - LATER

           Number over, Shiv and Ayleen exit the ring.

                                 AYLEEN
                        Is it me, or did you do something 
                        nice back in there?

                                 SHIV
                        He was distracting me.

                                 AYLEEN
                        Oh shut up “Mr. I Hate The World”. 
                        You did do something nice.
                             (then)
                        Don’t worry, I won’t tell anyone.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. THE CARNIVAL - NIGHT

           CARS leave the parking lot. The fair’s lights start to die.
           EXT. TRAILER AREA - LATER

           A beacon of fiery light GLOWS in the surrounding blackness. 

           A BONFIRE burns, silhouetting shadows dancing to a 
           mesmerizing gypsy beat. 

           Townies are gone, drunken carnies have some fun. Ayleen among 
           them, dancing with MIRAGE (30s) the handsome Illusionist:

           Quick SLEIGHT of hand - a flower appears - a gift to her.

           She puts it behind her ear and KISSES him.

           Shiv sits alone on a log, holding a BEER MUG. His stare 
           focused with absorbed concentration.

           HIS EYES

           Reflect the shadow of a woman outlined against the fire’s 
           glow. She dances alone. Carefree. Sensual.

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        I see her dance and wonder once 
                        again how did I get infected with 
                        the idea of her.

           We PUSH INTO his eyes until her reflection becomes reality:

           BY THE BONFIRE

           The woman smokes a joint as she dances, lost in her own 
           world. This is ZODIAC (25). The fortune teller from the 
           flier. A feline brunette of mystic beauty.

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        I watch every inch of her and can’t 
                        help but think of the midway’s game 
                        booths.

           She now dances with Mirage, he holds her hand and makes her 
           SPIN.

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        Nice and shiny, they encourage 
                        suckers to play.

           She now dances with a young TRAPEZIST.

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        And they’re rigged to screw them 
                        over.
           Shiv puts his beer down, eyes on the prize.

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        Yet the stubborn sons of bitches 
                        can’t stop playing.

           He’s about to get up when --

           Zodiac TURNS to him first, as if she sensed what he was about 
           to do. Her stare fixed on him. 

           Then she APPROACHES. Kneels in front of him.

                                 ZODIAC
                        I just had a vision. A vision about 
                        you. You stand up and ask me for a 
                        dance.

                                 SHIV
                        And what do you say?

                                 ZODIAC
                        I ignore you.

                                 SHIV
                        Did I happen to ask why you despise 
                        me like I killed your mother?

                                 ZODIAC
                        I don’t despise you. You’re just 
                        not my type.

                                 SHIV
                        And what’s your type?

                                 ZODIAC
                        Asking doesn’t help. My type would 
                        know that.

           She walks away and soon she’s dancing with someone else.

           EXT. MENAGERIE - NIGHT

           PANTHERS pace inside CAGE TRAILERS. Moonlight paints their 
           restless shadows on the floor as Shiv walks by.

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        She’s like a puzzle without the 
                        picture on the box...

           He stops when he sees:
           Shrouded in darkness, Zodiac is having sex with a CIRCUS 
           PERFORMER against a trailer.

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        And pieces are rigged to give an 
                        electric shock each time you try to 
                        fit them where they don’t belong.

           SLING!

           A hand UNSHEATHES a knife - the blade reflecting the full 
           moon - we are now at:

           INT. SHIV’S TRAILER - NIGHT

           Moonlight seeps in through a window, painting a square of 
           silver light in the dark. Shiv sits on his cot --

           Cutting his arm with the knife.

           Previous scars reveal this self-punishment is a common 
           practice for him.

           Wild-eyed. SWEATING hard. BREATHING harder.

           BAM! - door flies open - Ayleen bursts in - sees him.

                                 AYLEEN
                        Oh hell no.

           She RUSHES over to him - STOPS his hand - struggling to take 
           his knife --

                                 AYLEEN
                        Gimme that!

                                 SHIV
                        I’m fine --

                                 AYLEEN
                        Fine my ass. You’re having one of 
                        your anxiety attacks --

                                 SHIV
                        I’m taking care of it --

                                 AYLEEN
                        Not this way --

           She manages to PRY the knife out of his hand.
                                 AYLEEN
                        Good, now lie down.

           She pushes his head down so he lies down on the cot.

                                 AYLEEN
                        Take a good deep breath through 
                        your nose.

           He keeps hyperventilating.

                                 AYLEEN
                        C’mon, I know you can. We’ve done 
                        it before.

           He tries to take a deep breath.

                                 AYLEEN
                        Nice and deep. Deeper.

           He follows her lead.

                                 AYLEEN
                        Now gently blow the air out. 
                        Slowly. Very slowly.

           He does.

                                 AYLEEN
                        That’s it. Clear your mind. Focus 
                        on the breathing. Nothing else.

           LATER

           Shiv is still on edge, but his breathing is steadying.

                                 AYLEEN
                        Again.

           Another deep breath.

           LATER

           She caresses his forehead.

                                 AYLEEN
                        And slowly let the air out.

           He does, feeling much better now.
                                 AYLEEN
                        Wish I could open that head of 
                        yours and take all the crap away.
                        Starting with her.

                                 SHIV
                        I had this thing long before I met 
                        her.

                                 AYLEEN
                        But she surely doesn’t help. She’s 
                        poison. You need to let go.

           Shiv touches the flower behind her ear - Mirage’s gift.

                                 SHIV
                        Could you let go?

                                 AYLEEN
                        It’s different. We’re in love.

                                 SHIV
                        Maybe I’m in love as well.

                                 AYLEEN
                        Love takes two.

                                 SHIV
                        Says who?

                                 AYLEEN
                        Ever saw Marion and Dante kiss? 
                        Have a good look next time you see 
                        them. Notice how she takes his mask 
                        off, how she doesn’t care about the 
                        charred skin on his face. Notice 
                        how he doesn’t let anyone see his 
                        mug... except her. That’s love. A 
                        two-way street. The one-way street? 
                        That one’s named “obsession”.

           Shiv takes this in as she stands up to go.

                                 AYLEEN
                        Now get some sleep, handsome.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. THE CARNIVAL - DAWN

           A fiery SUNBALL rises behind the heat-wave distorted circus 
           tents.
           INT. BACKSTAGE TENT - DAY

           CLACK! - a knife THRUSTS between two fingers.

           Shiv, alone, plays five-finger fillet. Warm-up for the show.

                                 SHIV
                        I thought a thought. But the 
                        thought I thought wasn't the 
                        thought I thought I thought. If the 
                        thought I thought I thought had 
                        been the thought I thought --

           Something breaks his focus - he STOPS.

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        Where is she?

           He looks around. No Ayleen.

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        She’s never late.

           EXT. MIDWAY - DAY

           Townies test their skill and chance amid a cacophony of 
           lights, sounds and drunken laughter. A feel of heightened joy 
           all around except...

           Shiv paces along, head down. A hooded figure weaving solemnly 
           through the crowd like a cursed ghost.

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        The desert sun makes the carnival 
                        grounds swelter in a triple digit 
                        hell, yet I have this cold feeling 
                        in my chest as I head for Tigra’s 
                        tent.

           A CIRCUS FLIER

           “Tigra” is the name of the LION TAMER, written in font made 
           of sharp canine teeth. A woman clad in leather, cracks a whip 
           while holding two fierce PANTHERS on a leash.

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        Her father used to be the 
                        ringmaster but died when she was 
                        seventeen. She started barking 
                        orders even before the funeral was 
                        over. And since that day her word 
                        is law.
           The flier is glued to:

           EXT. TIGRA’S TENT - DAY

           Shiv TOLLS a bell.

                                 TIGRA (O.S.)
                        I’m busy!

           He enters nonetheless --

           INT. TIGRA’S TENT

           Shiv paces over the Persian rug to find...

           TIGRA (40s) in bed, having sex with a circus ROUSTABOUT and 
           smoking at the same time. She doesn’t stop riding him as she 
           turns to Shiv.

                                 TIGRA
                        Someone better be dead.

                                 SHIV
                        My sister is missing.

                                 TIGRA
                        Ask her boyfriend.

                                 SHIV
                        He’s missing too.

                                 TIGRA
                        Sent him to town to get some 
                        supplies. I think she tagged along. 
                        They should be back by now.

           EXT. THE CARNIVAL - TIME LAPSE

           The SUN plummets behind the horizon - circus tents’ shadows 
           stretch across the arid soil like reaching fingers. 

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        Time crawls by like a dying man in 
                        the desert.

           EXT. THE CARNIVAL - ROAD - NIGHT

           Shiv stands in the middle of a misty DIRT ROAD, circus lights 
           glowing behind his back.
                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        The wait kills my hope bit by bit, 
                        feeding a growing thirst to go out 
                        and find her.

           His stare, fixed on the sinful glow of distant CITY LIGHTS:

           EXT. BABYLON - NIGHT

           A mini Vegas - what it lacks in size, it makes up for in 
           bustling energy. Casinos, hotels, and strip joints PULSE with 
           a kaleidoscope of NEON LIGHTS.

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        But Babylon is a cesspool of crime 
                        and sin.

           Top class HOOKERS on display. GANGBANGERS work their corners, 
           selling dope like candy.

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        Nasty enough to keep me searching 
                        for three lifetimes.

           PRE-LAP: the sound of KNOCKING on a door --

           EXT. ZODIAC’S TRAILER - NIGHT

           Zodiac opens her door, not very pleased to find:

                                 SHIV
                        I need your eyes.

                                 ZODIAC
                        Can’t see the lottery numbers or 
                        cheat in any game of chance. 
                        Believe me, I tried.

                                 SHIV
                        My sister’s missing.

                                 ZODIAC
                        Go see Tigra.

                                 SHIV
                        She’s busy getting laid.

                                 ZODIAC
                        Bet your sister is too.

           She steps back inside and CLOSES the door in his face.
           Yet he stands there. Stoic. Unflinching.

           He’s not going anywhere.

           No, sir.

                                 ZODIAC (O.S.)
                        I can feel you standing outside.

           He doesn’t move.

           The door opens, she comes out again.

                                 ZODIAC
                        So what’s the plan? Keep standing 
                        there until I help you?

                                 SHIV
                        Correct.

           Off Zodiac, considering giving in to his demands...

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. THE CARNIVAL - ROAD - NIGHT

           Shiv watches as Zodiac feels various sets of tire tracks on 
           the dirt with her hands.

           She moves from one to another. Until she finds the one she 
           was looking for.

                                 ZODIAC
                        Found them.

           Her eyes roll back into her head.

                                 ZODIAC
                        She left with Mirage earlier 
                        today... but they never made it to 
                        Babylon.

                                 SHIV
                        What happened?

                                 ZODIAC
                        It’s blurry. I need to get closer.

           EXT. DIRT ROAD - NIGHT

           Twin headlights SHINE through the MIST. 
           A CARNIE TRUCK cruises a lonely road cutting through a 
           sprawling desertscape.

           INT. CARNIE TRUCK

           Shiv drives. Zodiac rides shotgun, staring out the window, 
           looking bored.

           He shoots quick glances at her, as if she was a puzzle he’s 
           trying to figure out.

           She catches him staring.

                                 ZODIAC
                        What?

                                 SHIV
                        Just wondering.

                                 ZODIAC
                        What?

                                 SHIV
                        Same thing everyone else is 
                        wondering. What are you hiding?

                                 ZODIAC
                        Hiding?

                                 SHIV
                        You joined us two years ago. Yet 
                        nobody knows a thing about you.

                                 ZODIAC
                        Good.

           EXT. DIRT ROAD - LATER

           The truck has pulled over. Shiv and Zodiac silhouetted 
           against the headlights as she feels the road with her hands.

                                 ZODIAC
                        I see... a tree.

           EXT. DESERT - NIGHT

           The shadow of a DEAD TREE outlined against a massive silver 
           moon. Its gnarled limbs seem to be twisting in pain.

           Shiv approaches the tree, overflown by VULTURES. Pulls his 
           hood back as he notices...
           Two BODIES dangle from one of its branches, hanging from 
           their ankles. They sway in the desert wind to the tune of 
           creaking rope. The bodies SPIN to reveal their faces:

           Mirage and Ayleen.

           Eyes glassy like dolls. Bullet holes in their heads.

           Shiv drops to his knees and PUKES as...

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        Two bullets. Two corpses. Pro work. 
                        He didn’t bother to hide the 
                        bodies. Hanged them on display like 
                        Christmas ornaments. Someone hired 
                        him to send a message.

           He spots two thorny BLACK ROSES lying on the ground under the 
           corpses.

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        And he left his employer’s card: 
                        The Black Rose.

           He picks one of the flowers as it MORPHS into:

           A BLACK ROSE TATTOO

           On a woman’s neck.

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        They control everything.

           We are inside a...

           BABYLON’S CITY HALL

           DESERT MOUNTAIN RETREAT

           A BLACK ROSE BOUQUET inside a vase, sitting on a table by a

                        And it’s not just Babylon.

           Through a window of this lavish home study, we see the sun 
           drop - the flowers’ shadows stretch - reaching the map - 
           spreading blackness over the Western half of the U.S. as...

                        The Black Rose is a cancer 
                        spreading across the country...

           A suited OLD MAN - his back to us - tends to the roses with a 
           pair of ROSE CLIPPERS.

           A Black Rose engraved on his GOLD TIE CLIP.

                        They call him “The Thorn” and he’s 
                        untouchable like a king.

           The flower design of the tie clip MORPHS into --

           DESERT - NIGHT

           -- the ROSE in Shiv’s hand. He SQUEEZES it hard, thorns dig 
           into his flesh and draw out BLOOD as...

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        Hell will freeze over before 
                        someone does time for this hit.

           EXT. THE CARNIVAL - NIGHT

           Lights out. Townies have left.

           EXT. TRAILER AREA

           Onlooking ROUSTABOUTS and PERFORMERS split to let Shiv pass, 
           carrying AYLEEN’S BODY in his arms.

           Zodiac watches too. Maybe there’s a hint of sadness in her 
           face. Maybe.

                                                                CUT TO:

           A SHOVEL

           Digs into the dirt.

           EXT. THE CARNIVAL - OUTSKIRTS - NIGHT

           Ayleen’s body rests on the ground as Shiv DIGS a grave.

           Odd: he already dug two other graves. 

           Zodiac approaches, wondering...

                                 ZODIAC
                        Why three graves?

                                 SHIV
                        One for her. One for the shooter. 
                        One for whoever hired the hit.
           She smiles an emasculating smile as...

                                 ZODIAC
                        Might wanna dig a fourth grave for 
                        yourself while you’re at it.

                                 SHIV
                        That a prediction?

                                 ZODIAC
                        That’s common sense.

                                 SHIV
                        I need your eyes, not your common 
                        sense.

                                 ZODIAC
                        I’d rather stab my eyes out than 
                        use them to go against the Black 
                        Rose.

           Shiv keeps digging. HARDER.

                                 ZODIAC
                        If you go out to play with the big 
                        boys, you’re gonna get yourself 
                        killed.

           And HARDER.

           EXT. MIDWAY - NIGHT

           From the back of a WHITE VAN, ROUSTABOUTS unload boxes filled 
           with STUFFED ANIMALS. Prizes for the game stands.

           Tigra oversees them. Smoking. Always smoking.

           Shiv approaches.

                                 SHIV
                        What was he up to?

                                 TIGRA
                        Who?

                                 SHIV
                        The Illusionist.

                                 TIGRA
                        Who cares?

                                 SHIV
                        I care. He was the target.
                                 TIGRA
                        Says who?

                                 SHIV
                        My sister didn’t have any dealings 
                        with the Black Rose.

                                 TIGRA
                        Now neither does he. Whatever it 
                        was, it’s settled.

           He turns and walks away with a purpose. 

           She watches him go, not liking it one bit.

           INT. BACKSTAGE TENT - LATER

           Shiv fixes KNIFE SHEATHS around his arms. 

           His torso.

           His legs.

           He’s now carrying at least twenty blades.

           And that’s how Tigra finds him when she walks in.

                                 TIGRA
                        You said you weren’t throwing 
                        tonight.

                                 SHIV
                        Correct.

                                 TIGRA
                        Then what’s with the blades?

                                 SHIV
                        I’m off to Babylon. Need to loosen 
                        some tongues. Probably cut some.

                                 TIGRA
                        You poke the hornet’s nest, we all 
                        get stung. I won’t let you start a 
                        war with the Black Rose.

                                 SHIV
                        War has already started. And they 
                        fired first.

                                 TIGRA
                        She’s gone, brat. And there’s 
                        nothing you can do about it.
                                 SHIV
                        Then you got nothing to worry 
                        about.

                                 TIGRA
                        Remember what I told you the day I 
                        took you in?

                                 SHIV
                        No.

           He leaves as...

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        Of course I remember.

           EXT. COOKHOUSE - NIGHT

           Circus staff has early dinner, seated at long tables set 
           under a PRECARIOUS AWNING stretched tight with rope.

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        When we were kids, my sister and I 
                        used to sneak out of the orphanage 
                        to gatecrash into the new Carnival 
                        in town.

           Shiv hurries along, his knives now concealed under his HOODED 
           CLOAK.

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        It cheered up our pathetic lives so 
                        much that when they packed and 
                        left, we decided to go with them.

           He doesn’t know that Tigra follows him. Slowly catching up 
           with him. Carrying her WHIP.

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        Tigra was pissed when she found the 
                        two little stowaways, but decided 
                        to take us in. She had one warning 
                        though: “You mess with my business, 
                        I whip your ass”.

           Tigra SWINGS her WHIP!

           WHOOSH! - Shiv hears the deadly whistle - DUCKS his head --

           CRACK! - the whip HITS a wooden post - SPLINTERS fly!

           Every head turns.
           Tigra SWINGS again - Shiv dives under a TABLE --

           WHOOSH-CRACK! - the whip SHATTERS a glass jar to FLYING 
           PIECES!

           Shiv raises an empty CHAIR as a shield --

           WHOOSH-CRACK! - the whip SPLITS it in half --

           He HURLS a knife - it FLIES and CUTS a cord --

           The AWNING comes down! 

           The fabric BLOCKING Tigra’s view --

           By the time she manages to PULL the canvas out of her way --

           She finds one of Shiv’s knives PRESSED against her neck.

           She stares deep into his eyes. Unfazed.

           The rest of the circus staff watches the tense standoff in 
           silence.

           Zodiac among them.

                                 TIGRA
                        Alright. Go. But you’ll take a team 
                        with you. You need help.

                                 SHIV
                        Not from your snitches.

           She WHISPERS into his ear:

                                 TIGRA
                        I’ll put her on the team.

           Shiv shoots a quick glance at Zodiac.

                                 TIGRA
                        Don’t you think her eyes could help 
                        your quest?

           Off Shiv, more and more interested in her offer...

                                                                CUT TO:

           A CIRCUS FLIER

           “Dante” is the name of the FIRE BREATHER and the letters are 
           formed by lava streams spewing out from a volcano. Under 
           raining ash, the performer blows a hellish plume of FIRE.
           The illustration MORPHS into:

           INT. BIG TOP - PERFORMANCE RING - NIGHT

           WHOOSH! - the real DANTE (30s) blows a huge FIREBALL for his 
           audience’s delight -- 

           Half his face hidden by a stylish VENETIAN MASK.

           He performs inside a circle of fire along with his sexy wife 
           MARION (30s). 

           Their hellish breaths MELT an ICE ANGEL’s wings.

           INT. BACKSTAGE TENT - LATER

           Dante and Marion stand side by side, facing Tigra.

                                 DANTE
                        What’s your angle?

                                 TIGRA
                        This could be a scuffle or a full 
                        blown war. Need eyes and ears on 
                        the team to keep me in the loop and 
                        help me minimize the damage.

                                 DANTE
                        You’re lying.

                                 TIGRA
                        How do you know?

                                 DANTE
                        Your lips are moving.

                                 TIGRA
                        That brat is about to party way too 
                        hard and he needs a designated 
                        driver. That’s it.

                                 MARION
                        What makes you think he’ll sign up 
                        for this?

                                 TIGRA
                        He liked Ayleen.

                                 MARION
                        Everyone liked Ayleen.
           Tigra takes a puff of smoke. Lets it roll off her lips as she 
           stares at Dante with her probing eyes.

                                 TIGRA
                        Why did you walk into that 
                        building?

                                 DANTE
                        What building?

                                 TIGRA
                        The burning building. The night of 
                        the accident.

                                 DANTE
                        It was my job.

                                 TIGRA
                        It was also the other firemen’s 
                        job. Why weren’t they inside when 
                        the roof collapsed?

           She caresses Dante’s mask as...

                                 TIGRA
                        Why didn’t they suffer burns on 55% 
                        of their bodies to save that girl?

                                 DANTE
                        You could say they made a better 
                        judgement call.

                                 TIGRA
                        You could also say you’re a sucker 
                        for doing the right thing.
                             (to Marion)
                        That’s why I think he’ll sign up 
                        for this.
                             (back to Dante)
                        Because, annoying as the brat may 
                        be, he deserves some answers. His 
                        sister was murdered. He’s on a 
                        righteous path --

                                 MARION
                        A dangerous path. Please don’t go 
                        against the Black Rose --

                                 TIGRA
                        Listen to your wife. Bet she sounds 
                        like your coworkers that night 
                        right before going in. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 TIGRA (CONT'D)
                        I wonder what would have happened 
                        to that girl you saved if you 
                        listened to them.

           Dante takes this in. Gives it some thought. Doesn’t like it. 
           But he can’t help himself...

                                 DANTE
                        I want Goliath on the team.

                                 TIGRA
                        Done.

                                                                CUT TO:

           A CIRCUS FLIER

           “Goliath” is the name of the STRONGMAN and it’s written in 
           font that looks made of solid granite.

           A hulk of a man pulls a tow chain hooked up to the bumper of 
           a CARNIE TRUCK. A tug of war between man and machine. 

           The illustration MORPHS into...

           INT. BIG TOP - PERFORMANCE RING - NIGHT

           The real GOLIATH (30’s). Tanned ladies man. Tight tank top 
           exposing ripping muscles inked with TATS. He YANKS the tow 
           chain, testing his strength against a crappy CARNIE TRUCK --

           Its tires SKID on dirt - can’t take off - engine SMOKING --

           The audience going NUTS.

           INT. BACKSTAGE TENT - LATER

           Goliath CHEWS tobacco as he signs an autograph on a female’s 
           fan AMPLE CLEAVAGE.

                                 TIGRA
                        You liked Ayleen --

                                 GOLIATH
                        Everyone liked Ayleen. What’s in it 
                        for me?

                                 TIGRA
                        The opportunity to let it out.
                                 GOLIATH
                        Let out what?

                                 TIGRA
                        Whatever it is that makes you wanna 
                        wrestle with my panthers each time 
                        you’re drunk. Whatever it is that 
                        makes you like a good brawl more 
                        than I like a good lay.

                                 GOLIATH
                        This ain’t no brawl or some stupid 
                        kitty in a cage. This is big, lady.

                                 TIGRA
                        That’s why you won’t miss it.

           Goliath considers. Spits tobacco.

                                 GOLIATH
                        I want a bigger trailer. With AC.

                                 TIGRA
                        No.

                                 GOLIATH
                        I’m in.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. ZODIAC’S TRAILER - NIGHT

           Tigra is about to knock on the door when -- 

           Zodiac yanks it open first.

                                 ZODIAC
                        Hell, no.

           Tigra smiles a maternal smile, takes Zodiac’s face in her 
           hands and kisses her forehead.

                                 TIGRA
                        You like it here, sugar?

                                 ZODIAC
                        Yes.

                                 TIGRA
                        Then you better do what I tell you.
           Off Zodiac, visibly intimidated by Tigra’s authority...

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. CARNIVAL - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           Circus lights shine in the distance as Goliath, Dante and 
           Zodiac march past parked cars. They reach a CARNIE TRUCK 
           where Shiv awaits, seated on its bed.

           He inspects the trio, like a general assessing his troops.

                                 SHIV
                        Just to be clear. I’m calling the 
                        shots. Not Tigra.

                                 GOLIATH
                             (smirks)
                        Whatever you say, knife boy.

           Shiv hands Zodiac the BLACK ROSE he found with the bodies. 

           She smells it. For a fleeting moment, it seems like just a 
           boy giving a flower to a girl, but then her eyes turn WHITE 
           as she has a --

           VISION

           SNIP - sharp SCISSORS cut a flower’s stem -- 

           The hand wears a GARDENING GLOVE embroidered with a flower 
           shop’s name: “Elysian Fields”.

           PARKING LOT

           Zodiac comes out of her trance.

                                 ZODIAC
                        Flowers were bought in a flower 
                        shop downtown. “Elysian Fields”.

                                 SHIV
                        I’m driving.

           As they climb into the truck...

           A hand GRABS Dante’s hand --

           He turns, finds Marion standing right in front of him.
           Shiv notices how she takes off his mask... how he turns his 
           back so nobody but her can see his face... how she kisses him 
           without caring about his charred facial skin... 

           Shiv keeps staring, mesmerized, as we --

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. BABYLON STREET - NIGHT

           The CARNIE TRUCK weaves along traffic, speeding past shinny 
           SPORTS CARS, BUZZING CASINOS and loud TITTY BARS. 

           The ugly and rusted vehicle contrasting with vibrant 
           surroundings that ooze luxury and sensuality.

           TRUCK’S BED

           Dante and Goliath sit side by side.

           Dante’s eyes take in his surroundings with careful scrutiny. 
           City lights reflect off his polished mask, caressing the 
           white porcelain ceramic with a multicolored splash.

           Goliath chews tobacco. Turns to the sound of THUMPING MUSIC 
           booming from:

           Two spoiled PARTY GIRLS in a shiny CONVERTIBLE, driving by 
           the truck’s side. They notice Goliath and shamelessly check 
           out his muscled body.

           He stares back with a smile, CONTRACTING and RELAXING his 
           right bicep rhythmically, “dancing” to the beat of the music.

           The driver turns down the volume - Goliath’s bicep FREEZES.

           She turns up the volume - the bicep resumes its “dance”.

           Girls GIGGLE and drive off.

           Still smiling, Goliath turns to Dante, taking in his somber 
           expression.

                                 GOLIATH
                        Something wrong, friend?

                                 DANTE
                        Just a feeling.

                                 GOLIATH
                        What feeling?
                                 DANTE
                        That there’s something the Fortune 
                        Teller isn’t telling us.
                             (then)
                        Or is it just me?

                                 GOLIATH
                        Doesn’t matter. If you’re worried, 
                        I’m worried.

                                 DANTE
                             (smiles)
                        That’s why I got you on the team.

           TRUCK’S CABIN

           Shiv drives. Zodiac rides shotgun, still holding the BLACK 
           ROSE.

                                 SHIV
                             (re: the flower)
                        Give it another try. Maybe you can 
                        pick up something else.

                                 ZODIAC
                        Doesn’t work like that. I can’t 
                        push it so much.

                                 SHIV
                        How does it work?

                                 ZODIAC
                        Sometimes I see too little. 
                        Sometimes, too much. Sometimes 
                        visions come to me in dreams. 
                        Sometimes, when I’m awake. It can 
                        be triggered by touching something 
                        or someone, by reading palm lines, 
                        or for no reason at all.
                             (bottom line:)
                        I’ve no idea how it works.

           She hands the flower back to him. But he doesn’t take it.

                                 SHIV
                        Keep it. It’s for you.

                                 ZODIAC
                             (chuckles)
                        You’re giving me a flower?

           She casually throws the flower out the window --
           THE ROSE

           Falls to the pavement... rolls to a stop by a GUTTER.

           TRUCK’S CABIN

           She lights a JOINT.

           Off Shiv’s look:

                                 ZODIAC
                        What? Want me to smile? Tell you 
                        you’re sweet? Get your hopes up in 
                        vain? That would be cruel.

           Off Shiv, trying to process her twisted logic...

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. “ELYSIAN FIELDS” - NIGHT

           Flowers on display are a spatter of color against the dull 
           greys of this grimy block.

           A FLOWER SHOP in a quiet part of town.

           The CARNIE TRUCK pulls up into view. Shiv’s circus flier 
           glued to its side.

           INT. ELYSIAN FIELDS - LATER

           Shiv stands before the OWNER (60s), a man with a glass eye 
           and a charming smile. He inspects the black rose Shiv just 
           gave him.

                                 OWNER
                        Of course it’s ours. Our baccaras 
                        are a very dark shade of red, 
                        actually. But we deepen their color 
                        with a unique burning method --

                                 SHIV
                        I need to know who bought it.

                                 OWNER
                        Many customers buy these.

                                 SHIV
                        Let’s start with the last batch you 
                        sold.
                                 OWNER
                        Oh, he’s a regular. He’s supposed 
                        to pick an order tonight. Wait a 
                        second.

           The sweet old man reaches under the counter, looking for 
           something. He keeps smiling his charming smile as:

           He takes out a SHOTGUN and aims it right at Shiv’s face.

                                 OWNER
                        I’m sure he’ll be most pleased to 
                        meet you.

           INT. GREENHOUSE - NIGHT

           Moonbeams slice through the dark. Shiv, at gunpoint, enters 
           the greenhouse located in the shop’s BACKYARD. 

           The owner’s HELPER (30s) watches in silence while operating a 
           PULLEY that opens the GLASS SKYLIGHTS in the ceiling.

           EXT. “ELYSIAN FIELDS” - NIGHT

           Goliath and Dante sit on the truck’s bed, waiting for Shiv to 
           come out. But instead they see:

           Two BLACK HUMMER TRUCKS pull up in front of the shop.

                                 DANTE
                        Not good.

           INT. GREENHOUSE - NIGHT

           Shiv watches as ten THUGS enter the greenhouse. Piercings on 
           their skin. GLOCKS in their pants.

           Their leader, DOUG (50s) is the one with most piercings of 
           the group - even the ROTTWEILER he’s got on a CHAIN LEASH has 
           fucking piercings.

           Drool hangs from deadly canine teeth - the dog lets out a 
           deep guttural GROWL, hungry for some Shiv.

                                 DOUG
                        Damn, it’s just a kid. How’d you 
                        find this place, boy?

                                 SHIV
                        You the hitman?
                                 DOUG
                        We hold the guns. We ask the 
                        questions.

                                 SHIV
                        I need to know who did the magician 
                        and his girl.

                                 DOUG
                        Alright. Let’s start again.
                             (to one of the thugs)
                        Shoot him in the knee.

           The THUG takes out his gun, about to fire when --

           Shiv HURLS a KNIFE.

           It flies - CUTS the pulley’s rope - SKYLIGHTS close too fast:

           CRASH! - SHOWER OF GLASS!

           Shiv DIVES under a table for cover as --

           Deadly GLASS SHARDS rain over the goons.

           Stabbing. 

           Screaming.

           Doug hits the floor with a sharp SHARD OF GLASS stuck into 
           his back - his hand LETS GO of the leash --

           The ROTTWEILER starts after Shiv - BARKING - flashing teeth 
           sharp like knives - its CHAIN LEASH thrashing behind its back 
           like an angry snake --

           Shiv sees it coming - no time to run - raises the table as a 
           SHIELD --

           THUD! - the rottweiler SLAMS against the wood - knocks Shiv 
           down as --

           In a FLASH - Shiv grabs the leash - STABS a knife through a 
           chain link - PINS the chain against the wooden floor - ROLLS 
           out of the way - the ROTTWEILER going after him again but -- 

           The leash goes TAUT - stops the dog - its POWERFUL JAW snaps 
           shut millimeters away from Shiv’s face as --

           Injured SURVIVORS turn their guns to Shiv --

           But he melts into the shadows. Gone.
           They SPLIT. Prowl the darkened aisles. Moonlight glinting off 
           polished silencers. Where is he?

           WHOOSH! WHOOSH! - a knife comes flying from the darkness --

           SWASH! - stabs into a thug’s neck --

           A fleeting GLIMPSE of Shiv - melting back into the shadows 
           like a ghost.

           WHOOSH! WHOOSH! - there comes another one - SWASH! - another 
           thug goes down --

           PANIC! - everyone FIRES blindly into the dark - flower POTS 
           blown to FLYING PIECES --

           Muzzle FLASHES create a STROBE EFFECT as we get glimpses of:

           Flower petals floating in the air.

           Shiv THROWS blade after blade after blade --

           Flying knives SLICE flowers on their way to their targets...

           Stabbing backs... throats... chests...

           Foes falling one by one... victory is close...

           But then the shop’s OWNER spots Shiv --

           BOOM! - fires his shotgun - Shiv DIVES out of the way -- 

           KACHUNK-BOOM! - he reloads and FIRES - Shiv DUCKS -- 

           KACHUNK-BOOM! - flower pots EXPLODING -- 

           KACHUNK-BOOM! - Shiv running for his life --

           Enter GOLIATH - SWINGING his tow chain -- 

           The HOOK flies in a wide arc...

           CRASHING through a flower pot... two flower pots... three 
           flower pots... broken PIECES FLYING as...

           SWASH! - the hook BURIES into the owner’s skull --

           Enter the HELPER - CHARGING at Goliath with a pair of sharp 
           gardener’s SCISSORS --

           A torch FIRES UP in the dark - Dante is REVEALED:

           WHOOSH! - he blows a lethal plume of FIRE at the helper --
           He BURNS, SCREAMS and ROLLS on the floor.

           The carnie team watches him burn until he finally goes STILL.

           The greenhouse now littered with BODIES, broken pots and 
           pieces of jagged glass. No more foes left.

           Shiv approaches Doug, still lying on the floor with the SHARD 
           stuck into his back. His breath now a wheeze.

                                 SHIV
                        Alright. Let’s start again.

                                 DOUG
                        I didn’t --
                             (cough)
                        Pull the trigger... 

                                 SHIV
                        You bought the flowers.

                                 DOUG
                        I’m just the hitman’s handler. A 
                        middle man. I book his gigs...

           His voice trails off, his eyes glazing over.

           Shiv SLAPS him back into consciousness.

                                 SHIV
                        Don’t die on me, asshole.

                                 DOUG
                        I book his gigs with the Black 
                        Rose.

                                 SHIV
                        Where can I find him?

                                 DOUG
                        We’ve never met. We use a dead 
                        drop. Lockers --

           He COUGHS, fading. Hands Shiv a KEY.

                                 DOUG
                        Train station.

                                 SHIV
                        Who hired the hit?

                                 DOUG
                        Heard he had some beef with a stash 
                        house manager.
                                 SHIV
                        The Black Rose has stash houses all 
                        over town. Which one?

           Doug’s cough gets worse... and worse... 

           Until he lets out a final wheeze... taking the rest of the 
           answers to his grave.

           Shiv searches the body. Finds an ENVELOPE. He’s about to 
           check what’s inside when...

           Zodiac enters the greenhouse, spots the thugs butchered by 
           Shiv’s blades.

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        As she takes in the bloodbath and 
                        turns to me, I notice something’s 
                        changed in her eyes.

           A KNIFE

           Stuck into a thug’s chest reflects her face.

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        She no longer looks at me like I’m 
                        some kind of joke.

           EXT. CARNIE TRUCK - NIGHT

           Racing along with a purpose as neon lights dance across its 
           WINDSHIELD. Shiv drives, blood smeared on his face like war 
           paint. Steely stare fixed dead ahead.

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        I hear Ayleen’s voice warning me it 
                        shouldn’t take mayhem and murder to 
                        earn a girl’s attention. That this 
                        isn’t some kind of goddess I must 
                        please with blood sacrifices.

           Zodiac rides shotgun, shoots a quick glance at him.

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        But the other voices are legion and 
                        they scream louder, telling me to 
                        keep the blood flowing.
           INT. CARNIE TRUCK

                                 SHIV
                        Tell me something about yourself.

           Her eyes bore into him for a beat.

                                 ZODIAC
                        You can ask one thing.

                                 SHIV
                        Where are you from?

                                 ZODIAC
                        Many places.

                                 SHIV
                        Where did you spend the most time?

                                 ZODIAC
                        Prison.

           Off Shiv, taking in the answer he didn’t expect...

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. TRAIN STATION - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           The CARNIE TRUCK parked by a lamp post, bathed in a white 
           circle of light.

           The team in mid-debate:

                                 DANTE
                        If we watch the dead drop, sooner 
                        or later the shooter will show up.

                                 SHIV
                        I’m not here to watch a stupid 
                        locker.

                                 DANTE
                        That stupid locker is our only 
                        lead.

                                 SHIV
                        He’s a pro. We stay there too long, 
                        he might see us. And if we spook 
                        him, he’ll vanish.

                                 DANTE
                        If you have a better idea...
           Shiv produces the ENVELOPE he got from the Handler and 
           empties its contents over the truck’s hood:

           A stack of bills. 

           A black rose. 

           A picture of an OLD MAN - the TARGET.

                                 SHIV
                        We don’t know how to find him. But 
                        we know how to hire him.

           He throws the target’s picture away.

           Then RIPS his own CIRCUS FLIER from the truck’s side. 

           And puts it in the envelope along with the flower and the 
           cash.

                                 SHIV
                        I can make him come to me.

                                 DANTE
                        By hiring a hit on yourself?

                                 SHIV
                        Correct.

           Everyone seems taken aback by his suicidal stupidity, except:

                                 GOLIATH
                        You’re an ass, knife boy. But I 
                        think I’m starting to like you.

           INT. TRAIN STATION - LUGGAGE LOCKERS - NIGHT

           Shiv and Zodiac hurry along the corridor and stop at one of 
           the lockers.

           He produces the key he got from the handler - opens the 
           locker - it’s EMPTY.

           Zodiac feels the cabinet with her hands, eyes GOING WHITE as 
           she’s hit by a --

           VISION

           A lone FIGURE stands in a dark alley, holding a silenced 
           handgun --
           Wait - it's actually TWO FIGURES standing in tandem - the 
           illusion of one from the previous perspective.

           TWIN HITMEN. Elegantly dressed, yet eerily menacing. Standing 
           amid a DOZEN BODIES on the murky floor.

           ZODIAC

           Snaps out from her trance.

                                 ZODIAC
                        I saw two gunmen. Probably 
                        partners. Definitely pros.

                                 SHIV
                        Anything I can use?

                                 ZODIAC
                        You could use what I just told you 
                        and think better of this --

           He THROWS the envelope into the locker - SLAMS the door shut 
           as we --

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. DIRT ROAD - NIGHT

           The CARNIE TRUCK speeds through the desert on its way back to 
           the carnival.

           TRUCK’S BED

           Zodiac and Goliath sit in silence. He catches her staring at 
           him. Smiles his playboy smile.

                                 GOLIATH
                        Do I owe you money, gypsy queen?

                                 ZODIAC
                        Rumor has it you screwed three 
                        burlesque dancers. Two trapezists. 
                        The snake charmer. Tigra. One of 
                        the juggler’s assistants --

                                 GOLIATH
                        I’m blushing already.

                                 ZODIAC
                        How come you never even made a move 
                        on me?
                                 GOLIATH
                        You’re trouble, of the bad kind.

                                 ZODIAC
                        Says who?

                                 GOLIATH
                        I know your type.

                                 ZODIAC
                        From experience, I take it.

                                 GOLIATH
                        Get out of my head.

                                 ZODIAC
                        Who’s Cindy?

           The name hits a nerve with Goliath.

                                 GOLIATH
                        Stop using your sight on me.

                                 ZODIAC
                        Didn’t have to. I can read your 
                        tat.

           Her probing gaze is fixed on the TRIBAL TATTOO covering his 
           right shoulder:

           As we see what she sees, for a moment, part of the design 
           fades away to REVEAL the name “Cindy” cleverly camouflaged 
           inside the tribal design.

                                 ZODIAC
                        Nice cover up.
                             (off his silence)
                        But you still love her, don’t you?
                             (off his silence)
                        How sad.

                                 GOLIATH
                        Gonna let this one pass. But next 
                        time... next time I’ll hit you 
                        back.

           TRUCK’S CABIN

           Shiv drives while chatting with:

                                 DANTE
                        Two shooters?
                                 SHIV
                        That’s what she saw.

                                 DANTE
                        And you went ahead with it, without 
                        giving it the slightest thought --

                                 SHIV
                        I thought about it.

                                 DANTE
                        Didn’t see you hesitate.

                                 SHIV
                        I think fast.

                                 DANTE
                        I think you are trying to impress 
                        that girl.

                                 SHIV
                        Think she’s impressed?

                                 DANTE
                        I’m impressed. You just hired a hit 
                        on yourself and look where your 
                        head is at.

                                 SHIV
                        Funny it’s you telling me not to 
                        play with fire.

                                 DANTE
                        Didn’t burn my mug “playing”.

                                 SHIV
                        Then how?

                                 DANTE
                        I used to be a fireman. I used to 
                        “think fast”.

           Shiv digests this in silence.

                                 SHIV
                        Think the hitmen will smell the 
                        trap?

                                 DANTE
                        Probably. But at least now your 
                        head is in the right place.

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. MIDWAY - DAY

           THRONGS of townies pace back and forth.

           Shiv among the crowd. Walking alone. His bleak stare 
           contrasting with the music and the cacophony of joy.

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        I scan the crowd every day, 
                        wondering if the shooters are 
                        already here doing reconnaissance 
                        for the job...

           His hand fiddles with a knife - twisting and turning in his 
           fingers - the blade reflecting RANDOM FACES in the crowd as:

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        Wondering if I just walked past my 
                        sister’s murderer.

           As he keeps walking, he turns to see:

           BETWEEN TWO TENTS

           Tigra oversees the ROUSTABOUTS unloading boxes with STUFFED 
           ANIMALS from a VAN. 

           She spots Shiv passing by.

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        I turned myself into bait and her 
                        turf into the fishing pond. She 
                        doesn’t say a thing. Lets her eyes 
                        do the talking.

           Her GLARE burns hotter than the tip of the cigarette dangling 
           from her lips.

           INT. SHIV’S TRAILER - NIGHT

           Shiv lies on his cot by the window, the moon bleeding silver 
           into the darkened room.

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        The wait takes away the thrill of 
                        the kill. And my mind bounces back 
                        to the usual places. Dark places.

           Cold sweat and hard breathing. Another ANXIETY ATTACK.

           He tries to calm down, wishing his sister was here, but all 
           he’s got are memories that come to him as DISTANT ECHOES:
                                 AYLEEN (V.O.)
                        Take a good deep breath through 
                        your nose.

           He does.

                                 AYLEEN (V.O.)
                        Nice and deep. Deeper.

           He closes his eyes, focusing.

                                 AYLEEN (V.O.)
                        Now gently blow the air out. 
                        Slowly. Very slowly.

           He’s trying. He’s really trying.

                                 AYLEEN (V.O.)
                        That’s it. Clear your mind. Focus 
                        on the breathing. Nothing else --

           Her soothing voice suddenly interrupted by a CHAOTIC string 
           of other voices:

                                 TIGRA (V.O.)
                        She’s gone, brat. And there’s 
                        nothing you can do about it --

                                 ZODIAC (V.O.)
                        You stand up and ask me for a 
                        dance.

           His hands CLUTCH the sheets, his breath QUICKENS.

                                 DOUG (V.O.)
                        Damn, it’s just a kid --

                                 ZODIAC (V.O.)
                        I ignore you.

           His heart now about to explode inside his chest.

                                 AYLEEN (V.O.)
                        Love takes two.

           He CLOSES his eyes, but the voices won’t go away. 

                                 ZODIAC (V.O.)
                        I don’t despise you. You’re just 
                        not my type.

           Fuck it - he sits on the bed -- 
           SLING! - unsheathes a KNIFE - cuts his arm - a wave of RELIEF 
           washing over his face as the pain makes the voices slowly 
           FADE AWAY.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. COOKHOUSE - DAY

           A lone DUST DEVIL sweeps across the carnival grounds.

           Shiv and Zodiac sit at a table while she gives him a PALM 
           READING. Her lips move but we don’t hear what she says.

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        She tells me the hitmen are coming 
                        for me this very night...

           She traces a finger across his palm.

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        But all I can think about is the 
                        softness of her touch, and a part 
                        of myself wonders how the hell 
                        could I get this dumb.
                             (then)
                        I need to focus.

           INT. BIG TOP - PERFORMANCE RING - NIGHT

           EMPTY and dark. A SPOTLIGHT casts a circle of light in the 
           middle of the ring: Shiv sits at a table, playing FIVE-FINGER 
           FILLET as...

                                 SHIV
                        I thought a thought. But the 
                        thought I thought wasn't the 
                        thought I thought I thought --

           He keeps repeating his routine as...

           IN A FAR CORNER

           A switchblade CUTS AN OPENING into the tent from outside.

           Two men crawl in through the gap. The TWIN HITMEN carrying 
           silenced handguns.

           They split and prowl towards...
           PERFORMANCE RING

           Shiv suddenly STOPS stabbing, as if alerted by a sixth sense.

           He HURLS the knife - it FLIES towards the spotlight --

           CRASH! - instant DARKNESS.

           He readies another knife - can’t see a thing but: 

           Zodiac joins him, her EYES ROLLED BACK, her finger pointing 
           somewhere into the surrounding BLACKNESS.

           He THROWS in the pointed direction - the knife flies away - 
           swallowed in shadow - a SCREAM rings out!

           One of the hitmen gets STABBED in his leg as:

           Shiv and Zodiac stand CLOSE - he uses her pointing finger as 
           his crosshairs - HURLS another blade - another SCREAM!

           The other hitman gets a KNIFE in his shoulder. Both try to 
           flee while:

           Zodiac keeps marking targets. Shiv keeps throwing blades into 
           the darkness, using her eyes.

           Time seems to slow down as they keep close to each other... 

           Moving and turning together as she points... 

           As he throws...

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        I get to dance with her after all.

           Their choreography is deadly... yet almost sensual...

           Her gypsy dress flowing like waves in the breeze...

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        We don’t miss a step.

           Flying knives disappear into the surrounding darkness... 
           drawing out distant screams...

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        She’s the Reaper’s eyes tonight and 
                        I am his Scythe.

           His arm around her waist as they turn...

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        I want this dance to last forever.
           LATER

           The HITMEN now both lie DEAD on the floor, stabbed with a 
           DOZEN KNIVES each.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. THE CARNIVAL - MIDWAY - NIGHT

           The CIRCUS CROWD watches as Shiv pushes a WHEELBARROW, 
           carrying the TWIN HITMEN’S bodies.

           Tigra clocks him in silence -- 

           Calculating eyes behind WISPS of cigarette smoke.

           EXT. THE CARNIVAL - OUTSKIRTS - NIGHT

           Shiv dumps the bodies into an empty grave.

           Checks them. Gets their WALLETS.

           Then starts shoveling dirt.

           One of the graves he dug is still EMPTY...

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. ZODIAC’S TRAILER - NIGHT

           Shiv KNOCKS on her door.

           It creaks open - Zodiac’s figure outlined against the white 
           glow coming from inside.

           He offers her the hitmen’s WALLETS.

                                 SHIV
                        Tell me what you see.

                                 ZODIAC
                        I see the hitmen are dead. Don’t 
                        you?

                                 SHIV
                        Hitmen were pawns. I need to find 
                        out who’s moving the pieces.

                                 ZODIAC
                        And I need a drink.
           INT. ZODIAC’S TRAILER - LATER

           He sits on her cot, watching as she pours herself a glass of 
           SCOTCH.

           He spots a deck of TAROT CARDS on the bed. Picks one:

           It depicts three gleaming swords piercing a human heart. It’s 
           disturbingly beautiful.

                                 ZODIAC
                             (re: the card)
                        Three of Swords: Heartbreak. 
                        Loneliness. Betrayal.

           He tries bending the card, but it’s plated and hard - he 
           accidentally CUTS his thumb with its keen edge.

                                 ZODIAC
                        Used that deck in prison. Doing 
                        readings in exchange for favors.

                                 SHIV
                        These can kill.

                                 ZODIAC
                        They did a few times. Tuned them up 
                        for self defense.

                                 SHIV
                        You were allowed to carry these?

                                 ZODIAC
                        Had to pay the Chief prison guard.

                                 SHIV
                        With readings?

                                 ZODIAC
                             (smirks)
                        She was a dyke.

                                 SHIV
                        So you were her bitch.

                                 ZODIAC
                        We’re all someone’s bitch. Sooner 
                        or later we all have to make a 
                        deal.

                                 SHIV
                        That’s why you do everything Tigra 
                        says?
           She downs the drink, catches her reflection at the bottom of 
           the empty glass. Doesn’t like what she sees.

                                 SHIV
                        You’re not in prison anymore.

                                 ZODIAC
                        Rules are the same.

                                 SHIV
                        You can leave.

                                 ZODIAC
                        Wouldn’t get far with my rap sheet. 
                        Don’t wanna end up in a brothel 
                        with a black rose painted on my 
                        cheek.

                                 SHIV
                        What did you do time for?

                                 ZODIAC
                        You ask too many questions.

                                 SHIV
                        You invited me in.

                                 ZODIAC
                        Not to chit chat.

                                 SHIV
                        Then what for?

           She puts down the glass, then sits by his side.

                                 ZODIAC
                        Take a guess.

                                 SHIV
                        To make a deal.

                                 ZODIAC
                        You learn fast.

                                 SHIV
                        What deal?

                                 ZODIAC
                        You tell Tigra I couldn’t find any 
                        clues in those wallets. You tell 
                        her you hit a dead end and that you 
                        don’t need me anymore.
                                 SHIV
                        Why?

                                 ZODIAC
                        We keep climbing up the ladder, 
                        it’s gonna get really nasty and I 
                        don’t want to be part of it. I want 
                        you to let me off the hook.

                                 SHIV
                        You want me to betray my sister.

                                 ZODIAC
                        We all want something.

           She grabs his thumb, still bleeding from the cut. Sticks out 
           her tongue to LICK the blood.

                                 ZODIAC
                        What do you want?

                                 SHIV
                        You’re asking me to choose between 
                        you and Ayleen?

                                 ZODIAC
                        Short answer: yes. Long answer --

           He gets up and LEAVES.

           INT. CHANGING ROOM - SHOWERS - NIGHT

           A LIGHT BULB hangs from the ceiling, casting someone’s SHADOW 
           on a cracked tile wall.

           Shiv stands naked under the shower, water hitting his face. 
           He hears someone coming, opens his eyes to see --

           Zodiac joins him, the STEAM enveloping their bodies.

                                 ZODIAC
                        Checked the wallets. Found some 
                        contract money in them. Was able to 
                        see the money trail when I touched 
                        the bills. Hitmen got them from 
                        their handler, the guy at the 
                        greenhouse. And the handler got 
                        them from the man who hired the 
                        hit. I saw flashes of a meeting.

           FLASH: a white patch of light in the pitch blackness - Doug 
           and two other MEN sit at a table engulfed in a cloud of cigar 
           smoke.
                                 ZODIAC
                        Heard of the place. Very exclusive.

           FLASH: a hand flicks cigarette ash into an ASHTRAY painted 
           with a black swan logo.

                                 ZODIAC
                        An opium den named “The Dream 
                        Pond”. Handler was meeting with two 
                        men. The older one was definitely 
                        Black Rose. Wore a ring that 
                        screamed of rank.

           FLASH: KAYNE (50s). A bear of a man. Face rugged like tree 
           bark. Expensive suit. Piercings. A RING engraved with a black 
           rose on his index finger. He’s missing a pinky.

                                 ZODIAC
                        The younger one was probably just 
                        an underling.

           FLASH: ACE (30s). Foxy sleekness. Razor thin smile. Face 
           covered in tats.

                                 ZODIAC
                        I saw the older one pulling out the 
                        money to hire the hit. I think he 
                        owns the place.

           FLASH: Kayne’s fingerless HAND digs into a wall safe to take 
           a WAD OF CASH.

           Shiv, in deep thought, takes in the new intel.

                                 ZODIAC
                        So what’s next? Wanna hit “The 
                        Dream Pond”? Wanna get ourselves 
                        killed?

           Now she stands cruelly close to him.

                                 ZODIAC
                        Or maybe we should forget all about 
                        this nonsense? And have some real 
                        fun?

                                 SHIV
                        Has a man ever turned you down?

                                 ZODIAC
                        Yes.

                                 SHIV
                        Twice?
                                 ZODIAC
                        No.

           On the wall: his shadow walks away from her shadow.

           EXT. GOLIATH’S TRAILER - NIGHT

           Rocking HARD - some serious fucking going on inside.

           Zodiac KNOCKS on the door. The rocking STOPS.

           The door opens, Goliath steps out from the dark, his hulking 
           shape filling the frame.

                                 GOLIATH
                        Better be important. Better be 
                        good.

           Four FEMALE HANDS come out from the blackness behind him to 
           caress his chest, trying to pull him back inside.

                                 GOLIATH
                        Better be fast.

                                 ZODIAC
                        A Black Rose’s big wig is now in 
                        the idiot’s crosshairs. He thinks 
                        he’s throwing knives when he’s 
                        actually throwing boomerangs that 
                        will soon come back to hit us. It’s 
                        getting dangerous. It’s getting 
                        foolish. It’s getting out of hand.

                                 GOLIATH
                        Good.

                                 ZODIAC
                        Help me stop this madness --

                                 GOLIATH
                        And miss all the fun? Speaking of 
                        which... I’ve got better things to 
                        do right now.

           He’s about to close the door when Zodiac holds it, PISSED.

                                 ZODIAC
                        Do what? Fill with women that 
                        gaping hole in your soul that Cindy 
                        left? Why bother? It’s not working. 

                                 GOLIATH
                        Says who?
                                 ZODIAC
                        Bet that’s where all the anger is 
                        coming from. Some girl broke your 
                        heart, so now you want to break 
                        some bones in return --

                                 GOLIATH
                        And where’s your anger coming from, 
                        gypsy queen? Why are you even 
                        talking to me to begin with? Knife 
                        boy turned you down?

           She grits her teeth.

                                 GOLIATH
                        Oohh, so that’s what happened. 
                        Pretty lady bangs her way through 
                        life, using her body as a weapon, 
                        but she just fired blanks, hasn’t 
                        she? Must be driving you nuts.

           His con man’s smile pisses her even more. She storms away.

                                 GOLIATH
                             (spits tobacco)
                        Told ya’ I’d hit you back.

           He CLOSES the door as we --

                                                                CUT TO:

           A BLACK SWAN LOGO

           Embroidered on a silk handkerchief sticking out from a suit’s 
           POCKET.

           Two dark-suited BOUNCERS man an OAK DOOR.

           We are at...

           EXT. “THE DREAM POND” - NIGHT

           A three-story ANTIQUE BUILDING squeezed into a row of grimy 
           brownstones in a residential part of town.

           A BLACK HUMMER pulls up by the entrance. Kayne gets down from 
           the back, followed by Ace.

           A bouncer opens the door for them to get in, giving them a 
           respectful NOD.
                                 BOUNCER
                        Ace. Kayne.

           Ace and Kayne nod back.

           INT. “THE DREAM POND” - CORRIDOR - LATER

           Ace and Kayne pace along, crossing paths with another THUG 
           who gives them a nod.

           Ace and Kayne nod back again.

                                 KAYNE
                        My men used to ignore you. Now they 
                        like you.
                             (off Ace’s look)
                        You’ve come a long way since I 
                        pulled you out of the gutter.

                                 ACE
                        They don’t like me. They fear me.
                        That’s what an underling is 
                        supposed to do.

           Kayne smiles patronizingly. Oh really?

                                 KAYNE
                        And how about you...? Do you like 
                        me or fear me?

                                 ACE
                        Neither.
                             (smiles)
                        I love you.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. “THE DREAM POND” - NIGHT

           Shiv, alone, approaches the door. Stops in front of the 
           BOUNCERS blocking his way.

                                 SHIV
                        I need to speak to the owner.

                                 BOUNCER
                        Who does?

                                 SHIV
                        A friend.

           The bouncer traces his finger down a GUEST LIST.
                                 BOUNCER
                        Friend... friend... friend...

           He finishes his “search”.

                                 BOUNCER
                        Nope. No “friend”. Sorry, pal. 
                        Can’t come in.

                                 SHIV
                        Then tell him to come out.

                                 BOUNCER
                        Sure. I’ll text him.

           The bouncer takes out his phone and pretends, very badly, to 
           punch some keys.

                                 BOUNCER
                        There you go. I’ll let you know 
                        when he answers back.

           Shiv. Unfazed. He turns and walks away. Over his shoulder we 
           can see the bouncers flashing shit-eating grins.

           BACK OF THE BUILDING

           A vandalized LAMP POST flickers ON and OFF.

           ON: a glimpse of a grimy alley.

           And OFF - pitch BLACKNESS.

           ON: Shiv and the rest of the team now in the alley --

           And OFF.

           ON: Shiv unleashes a hail of KNIVES against the wooden wall.

           And OFF.

           ON: Shiv CLIMBS up the wall grabbing the knives’ handles like 
           Ayleen during her number - SLINKS in through a window --

           And OFF.

           ON: the rest of the team now waits in front of a rusted STEEL 
           DOOR --

           And OFF.

           ON: the sound of locks unlatching behind the door - Shiv 
           opens it for them to enter --
           And OFF.

           FADE IN:

           A WOMAN’S LIPS

           Painted cherry red - blowing a twirling WISP of smoke.

           INT. “THE DREAM POND” - FIRST FLOOR - NIGHT

           The WOMAN, in a cocktail dress, lies over a mound of tapestry 
           cushions, smoking an OPIUM PIPE.

           Clusters of GUESTS strewn around the gloomy place, getting 
           high. Night dresses and suits. Flowing satin curtains. 

           High-class kind of joint.

           Our heroes march along, amid GHOSTLY STRANDS of smoke that 
           hang in the air.

           Guests shoot awkward glances at the carnie scum intruding 
           into their turf.

           Meanwhile...

           KAYNE’S OFFICE

           A BLACK HORSE charges across a CHESSBOARD --

           Ace plays a CHESS MATCH against Kayne.

           STAIRWELL

           The carnie team climbs up the SPIRAL STAIRS.

           Zodiac’s eyes go WHITE as she points at a CLOSED DOOR.

           Shiv HURLS a knife at the door - nobody there but --

           Door opens right on time to reveal a GUARD - he gets STABBED.

           ACE

           Takes one of Kayne’s pawns.
           SHIV

           Takes down another guard.

           OFFICE

           Ace takes a rook with his queen --

                                 ACE
                        Check mate.

           Kayne flicks his king down in surrender... the piece is about 
           to hit the board when --

           BAM! - door flies open - the carnie team STORMS in --

           A GUARD standing by the door whips out his GUN --

           BLAM!

           HE SHOOTS ZODIAC IN THE HEAD!

           Time slows down as her body falls...

           Her dead eyes staring into the void...

           But then this image TURNS TO:

           A REFLECTION IN AN EYE

           A woman’s eye.

           This is the eye of:

           ZODIAC

           Alive, BURSTS into the office AGAIN, just like in her vision.

           But this time she SLAPS the GUARD’s wrist - BLAM! - shot goes 
           wide --

           Her TAROT DECK springs out from her sleeve like magic - cards 
           wedged into a holding contraption that SPREADS open like a 
           FAN - she SWINGS --

           SWASH! - slashes open the Guard’s neck - he HITS the floor --

           Two GUARDS level their guns --

           Shiv HURLS a knife - wait - it’s actually TWO that SPREAD in 
           flight --
           Both guards GO DOWN.

           Zodiac sees Kayne - notices the MISSING FINGER - points at 
           him.

                                 ZODIAC
                             (to Shiv)
                        That’s him.

           Shiv readies a KNIFE --

           But Kayne is already RUSHING out through a side door.

           The team hauls ass in hot pursuit, running past Ace who sits 
           frozen on his chair.

           THIRD FLOOR - GUEST AREA

           The CHASE is on - our heroes RUNNING after Kayne - jumping 
           over stoned GUESTS --

           GUARDS coming at them from everywhere.

           Zodiac SLASHES her fan across a SUITED GUARD’s chest - half a 
           tie goes flying into the air --

           Dante TORCHES two guards alive - flowing curtains catching 
           fire --

           Goliath swings his TOW CHAIN - the HOOK smashes a face - 
           teeth FLY --

           Shiv SLINGS a knife --

           It flies through the air...

           Cutting across thick strands of smoke...

           Disrupting their mesmerizing flow... leaving a trail like a 
           bullet in the water...

           Headed right towards Kayne’s back...

           But a HULKING GOON appears - heaves a TABLE just in time --

           CLACK! - the knife sticks into the wood of the improvised 
           shield.

           Kayne disappears into the STAIRWELL.

           The hulking goon now CHARGES towards Shiv, who unleashes a 
           flurry of flying knives -- 
           But the goon holds up the table --

           CLACK! CLACK! CLACK! - blades keep stabbing into the wood as 
           he charges forward and --

           CRASH! - slams the table against Shiv’s body!

           The rest of the team keeps kicking ass in the background 
           while:

           Shiv struggles to his feet - groggy - tries to draw a knife --

           WHAM! - but the goon PUNCHES him first --

           WHAM! - Shiv stumbling back --

           WHAM! - no time to counter --

           WHAM! - he falls out the window!

           But manages to HOLD ONTO the window sill.

           His body hanging - a three-story fall!

           The goon STOMPS on Shiv’s hands with his foot!

           Shiv takes the pain as much as he can but --

           He lets go and drops!

           Time SLOWS DOWN as:

           OUTSIDE

           Shiv hangs in mid-air...

           A deadly fall he won’t survive...

           Unless...

           SLING! - he UNSHEATHES two knives --

           CLACK! - stabs them both into the wooden wall - holds to the 
           handles - STOPPING his fall --

           He lets go - FALLS a few feet - then --

           CLACK! - stabs another pair of knives - stops his fall again.

           He keeps stabbing his way down the building.

           Then SLIPS back inside through an open window as:
           STAIRWELL

           Kayne scoots down the stairs, his frantic steps echoing 
           across the empty SHAFT as --

           BAM! - a side door flies open --

           Shiv POUNCES on Kayne and sticks a knife into his chest.

           Shiv kneels by his side, watches his prey slowly die.

                                 KAYNE
                             (dumbfounded)
                        The hell are you?

                                 SHIV
                        When your hitmen took out The 
                        Illusionist, they also did his 
                        girlfriend. She was my sister.

           Kayne chuckles bitterly.

                                 KAYNE
                        I didn’t greenlight The 
                        Illusionist.

                                 SHIV
                        Bullshit.

                                 KAYNE
                        Dead men don’t lie, boy. 

           Kayne keeps talking as...

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        Bastard knows his last words are 
                        about to mess up my world big time. 
                        So he lets it all out with a smile 
                        that gets wider even as his lungs 
                        fill up with blood.

           OUTSIDE THE DREAM POND

           Ace hops into a BLACK HUMMER.

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        He says “Ace” is his second in 
                        command. And greedier than a herd 
                        of swine.

           The HUMMER races the hell away from there, swiftly 
           disappearing into the night.
                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        Kayne heard rumors his underling 
                        might make a move to take him out 
                        and climb up the ladder. And he 
                        thinks it’s no coincidence I showed 
                        up at his joint thirsty for blood. 
                        He’s sure that --

           STAIRWELL

                                 KAYNE
                        Someone’s playing you like a 
                        violin.

           KAYNE’S OFFICE

           Kayne grabs a chunk of cash from a wall safe, just like in 
           Zodiac’s vision.

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        He admits he bankrolled the kill, 
                        but it was Ace, the one who ordered 
                        and hired the hit.

           He gives the wad of cash to Ace.

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        Ace runs a net of stash houses and 
                        it turns out that Mirage was 
                        interfering with his business.

           A CIRCUS FLIER

           “Mirage” is the name of the ILLUSIONIST, handwritten in 
           elegant font. Four crystal balls containing fire, earth, air, 
           and water float over the hands of the mystic performer.

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        Turns out... Mirage was an 
                        undercover cop. 

           MIDWAY

           Tigra watches as her boys unload boxes with STUFFED ANIMALS 
           from the WHITE VAN.

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        When I ask what was a cop doing in 
                        our turf, Kayne drops the nuke:
           STAIRWELL

           Kayne COUGHS, wincing.

                                 KAYNE
                        The lion tamer has been running a 
                        distribution center right under 
                        your wet noses.

           STORAGE TRAILER

           Shiv, alone, picks a STUFFED ANIMAL from a box - CUTS it open 
           with his knife to find:

           A BRICK of heroin labeled with a black rose.

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        He says Mirage infiltrated us as 
                        part of a sting operation, 
                        spearheaded by some hot shot D.A. 
                        now rotting in a ditch. He spits 
                        blood on my face and says that -- 

           STAIRWELL

                                 KAYNE
                        You know nothing, boy. You’re just 
                        a pawn. You --

           Shiv PULLS OUT the knife - Kayne wheezes his last breath as 
           his eyes stare far away and we --

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. BABYLON STREET - NIGHT

           The CARNIE TRUCK speeds along, weaving through traffic.

           INT. CARNIE TRUCK

           Shiv drives in deep thought.

           Zodiac rides shotgun, smoking an OPIUM PIPE, a souvenir she 
           brought from the den.

           Shadow and light dances across their faces as city lights 
           whip by.

                                 SHIV
                        You sure Kayne hired the hit?
                                 ZODIAC
                        I’m sure I saw him pulling the 
                        money from that safe. Why?
                             (off his silence)
                        Did he say anything?
                             (off his silence)
                        What’d he say?

                                 SHIV
                        He didn’t say nothing.

                                 ZODIAC
                        You a virgin?

                                 SHIV
                        What does that have to do with 
                        anything?

                                 ZODIAC
                        I’ll take that as a “yes”.

           Insulted, he extends his hand. 

           She does a palm reading. After a few seconds...

                                 ZODIAC
                        So he did say something.

           He pulls out his hand.

                                 ZODIAC
                        And whores don’t count, by the way.

                                 SHIV
                        Hell they don’t.

                                 ZODIAC
                        They don’t do it for love. Or even 
                        attraction. They just want 
                        something from you.

                                 SHIV
                        Like you did back in the showers?

                                 ZODIAC
                             (amused)
                        You just called me a “whore”?

           She laughs, coughs as she CHOKES with the smoke.

                                 ZODIAC
                        Alright. Had that coming. But for 
                        the record, I’m actually a good 
                        girl.
                                 SHIV
                        Who did time.

                                 ZODIAC
                        Ever told you why?

                                 SHIV
                        No, and I’m done asking.

                                 ZODIAC
                        I had this vision when I was 
                        thirteen. Saw my stepfather coming 
                        back from work and then raping my 
                        younger sister. I had tried to stop 
                        premonitions from happening before, 
                        but it never worked. You can change 
                        little things here and there, but 
                        fate has a way of correcting 
                        itself.

           She looks out the window in deep thought.

                                 ZODIAC
                        Didn’t want to take chances this 
                        time, so I cracked his skull with a 
                        fire poker. Fate couldn’t correct 
                        that. My sister went on with her 
                        life. I think she’s now a doctor or 
                        something. I ran away, got caught 
                        and was tried as an adult.

                                 SHIV
                        Didn’t you see you’d end up in 
                        prison?

                                 ZODIAC
                        I did.

                                 SHIV
                        Then why go ahead with the murder?

                                 ZODIAC
                        Told you. I’m a good girl.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. THE CARNIVAL - DAWN

           The DESERT SUN rises once again to bake the carnival grounds.
           INT. CARNIVAL STORAGE TRAILER - DAY

           Fluffs of cotton float in the air like snow. Tigra HURLS 
           boxes across the room, getting more PISSED by the second 
           because:

           Every single stuffed toy has been cut open. Butchered by the 
           thief that stole her product.

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        There’s only one place where I can 
                        stick my knife to hurt her enough 
                        to make her spill everything she 
                        knows. Her pocket.

           She freezes when she notices a teddy bear pinned to the wall 
           with a KNIFE. Shiv’s calling card.

           INT. BACKSTAGE TENT - DAY

           Shiv plays five-finger fillet as Tigra takes a seat in front 
           of him. He keeps stabbing as:

                                 TIGRA
                        You took my stash.

                                 SHIV
                        Correct.

                                 TIGRA
                        You have no idea what you’re 
                        getting yourself into --

                                 SHIV
                        I know you’re in business with The 
                        Black Rose. When you figured out 
                        Mirage was a mole, you ratted him 
                        out to Ace, who hired the hitmen to 
                        do him in.

           His knife keeps STABBING back and forth between his fingers.

                                 SHIV
                        Problem was my sister went down as 
                        well. You didn’t want me to go 
                        after your business partner. But 
                        you couldn’t stop me. So instead 
                        you decided to use me.

           The knife stabs FASTER.
                                 SHIV
                        Ace had been scheming to make a 
                        move on Kayne for some time, so you 
                        partnered with him to make it 
                        happen.

           The stabbing BLADE now a blur of speed.

                                 SHIV
                        You bullied Zodiac into betraying 
                        me. And she guided my knives 
                        towards Kayne instead of Ace. So I 
                        killed the wrong guy, Ace got a 
                        promotion and now he likely gave 
                        you a better deal in return. And 
                        now my sister’s murderer is still 
                        on the loose while she rots 
                        underground.

           Shiv STOPS doing the finger fillet.

                                 SHIV
                        What did I miss?

           She glares. Not much apparently.

                                 TIGRA
                        It’s a big stash, brat. Much bigger 
                        than the amount Ace usually moves. 
                        I need it back.

                                 SHIV
                        And I want Ace.

                                 TIGRA
                        Ace is protecting us!

                                 SHIV
                        From what?

                                 TIGRA
                        From the Black rose burning this 
                        circus to the ground to show 
                        Babylon what happens when you mess 
                        with them.

                                 SHIV
                        Why would he protect us?

                                 TIGRA
                        We travel all over the west and he 
                        wants to use us to expand his 
                        heroin trade.

                                 TIGRA (CONT'D)
                             (then)
                        That’s what you missed.

                                 SHIV
                        Kayne is on you. You deal with the 
                        fallout.

                                 TIGRA
                        I don’t want a war.

                                 SHIV
                        And what do you think will happen  
                        once the Black Rose finds out you 
                        lost their product?

                                 TIGRA
                        What do you think will happen when 
                        they find out you stole their 
                        product?

                                 SHIV
                        I’m a target already. I don’t give 
                        a damn.

                                 TIGRA
                        Ace’s gone dark. After the raid on 
                        the Dream Pond, he moved his 
                        headquarters somewhere else. I 
                        can’t find him.

                                 SHIV
                        Just like your stash.

           Tigra seethes in silence. Weighing her options. Until 
           finally:

                                 TIGRA
                        I’ll see what I can dig up.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. TRAILER AREA - NIGHT

           Shiv walks alone, a shadow in the mist. He shoots a glance at 
           Zodiac’s trailer as he walks past.

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        I hear the song of a hundred Sirens 
                        telling me to knock on her door and 
                        believe all the lies she’ll tell to 
                        cover up the previous ones. But I 
                        do the smart thing for once and I 
                        don’t listen.
           INT. SHIV’S TRAILER - NIGHT

           A BLADE cuts across a forearm.

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        I don’t even bother with the 
                        breathing tonight. I go straight to 
                        the cutting.

           Shiv’s eyes are lost in deep thought as...

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        The pain washes everything away. I 
                        cut her out of my mind until 
                        nothing of her remains.

           He closes his eyes, lies back in bliss.

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        Until I’m free.

           The door SQUEAKS open. Zodiac steps in without knocking.

           He turns to her. Fuck.

           She takes in his cuts.

                                 ZODIAC
                        I used to cut myself too. Back in 
                        prison.

           She lifts her dress a bit to show him some cutting scars on 
           her (sexy) thigh.

                                 ZODIAC
                        Good times.

                                 SHIV
                        You played me.

                                 ZODIAC
                        Thank you.

                                 SHIV
                        For what?

                                 ZODIAC
                        For pointing your finger at me 
                        like I was the genius mastermind, 
                        when I’m actually just another pawn 
                        like you.
                                 SHIV
                        But you knew you were a pawn and 
                        you went along with it.

                                 ZODIAC
                        We’re all someone’s bitch.

                                 SHIV
                        Why are you here?

           She takes a seat on the bed by his side.

                                 ZODIAC
                        To tell you about the vision.

                                 SHIV
                        What vision?

                                 ZODIAC
                        The vision I’ve been having every 
                        goddamn day since Tigra took me in.

                                 SHIV
                        Why should I care?

                                 ZODIAC
                        Because you’re in it.

                                                              FLASH TO:

           ZODIAC’S VISION

           Silhouetted against roaring flames: Shiv and Zodiac’s shadow 
           embracing each other lovingly.

                                 ZODIAC (V.O.)
                        I see ourselves in each other’s 
                        arms. I’m wounded. Dying.

           Shiv keeps holding her, caressing her hair, but her arms now 
           hang loose at her side and her head tilts back.

                                 ZODIAC (V.O.)
                        You hold me tight until my body 
                        goes cold.

           He kisses her.

                                 ZODIAC (V.O.)
                        And then you kiss my dead lips 
                        goodbye.

                                                               BACK TO:
           SHIV’S TRAILER

           Shiv’s head is spinning.

                                 ZODIAC
                        I die in your arms.

                                 SHIV
                        Why? How?

                                 ZODIAC
                        I can’t see that... yet.

                                 SHIV
                        But can you stop it?

                                 ZODIAC
                        Maybe... if I make sure I don’t end 
                        up in your arms in the first place.

                                 SHIV
                        So that’s why you’ve been such a 
                        cruel bitch to me.

                                 ZODIAC
                        “Cruel bitch”. That’s what I get 
                        for opening up and telling the 
                        truth for once.

           She takes out a handkerchief, dabs his cuts.

                                 SHIV
                        You don’t have to do that.

                                 ZODIAC
                        I know. I just feel like relieving 
                        some of the pain that I caused.

           She looks up, their faces close. 

           She moves in closer. And closer.

                                 SHIV
                        What do you want in return this 
                        time?

                                 ZODIAC
                        Nothing.

                                 SHIV
                        Why now? What’s changed?

                                 ZODIAC
                        Nothing’s changed.
                                 SHIV
                        Then what’s this, pity sex?

                                 ZODIAC
                        Take it or leave it sex.

           He TAKES it. They ROLL on the bed, tearing at each other’s 
           clothes as...

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        This is wrong. This is sad.

           LATER

           Moonlight spills over bodies in motion.

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        This is shameful and pathetic.

           Her head tilts back in ecstasy as he kisses her neck.

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        This is my happiest moment in 
                        years.

           INT. SHIV’S TRAILER - DAY

           A shaft of SUNLIGHT spills over Shiv as he wakes up. He turns 
           to face the empty spot where Zodiac should be.

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        I wake up to see her gone and start 
                        to feel like she was never even 
                        there. Probably she never was. 
                        Probably it was one of those stupid 
                        dreams again.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. MENAGERIE - DAY

           Shiv approaches Tigra, who’s INSIDE one of the cages, petting 
           a PANTHER like it was just a kitty.

                                 SHIV
                        Where’s Ace?

                                 TIGRA
                        Wanna know what I’m thinking?
                                 SHIV
                        Money and dick. That’s all you ever 
                        think about.

                                 TIGRA
                        I think you’re stretching out this 
                        quest for revenge because you’re 
                        afraid of grieving. I think that 
                        behind those deadly knives there’s 
                        a pathetic little brat who’s too 
                        scared to face the fact that his 
                        sister is gone.

                                 SHIV
                        Correct.
                             (then)
                        Where’s Ace?

           Tigra sighs, hating this brat more and more.

                                 TIGRA
                        Tried to set up a meet but no dice. 
                        His men told me to talk to the 
                        Black Rose accountant instead.

                                 SHIV
                        And you think he knows where Ace 
                        might be?

                                 TIGRA
                        Don’t know. But I’d shake that tree 
                        if I were you. He’s a regular at a 
                        crappy bar downtown owned by Ace.

           She hands him a written piece of paper through the bars.

                                 TIGRA
                        You didn’t get this from me.

           Shiv walks away.

                                 TIGRA
                        I want my stash back.

                                 SHIV
                             (re: paper)
                        Then this better be solid.

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. BABYLON STREET - NIGHT

           The CARNIE TRUCK weaves through traffic. Fast. The driving 
           style of an impatient driver:

           TRUCK’S CABIN

           Shiv drives. Hands clutching the wheel. Eyes beaming intense 
           focus.

           Dante rides shotgun, looking at Shiv. Wondering:

                                 DANTE
                        When does this end, boy?

                                 SHIV
                        When I fill the last grave.

                                 DANTE
                        Will you ever run out of graves to 
                        fill?

                                 SHIV
                        Sadly, yes.

                                 DANTE
                        You need to bury this.

                                 SHIV
                        I will, along with the asshole that 
                        hired the hit.

                                 DANTE
                        You did the shooters already. Why 
                        not call it a day? Why keep going?

           Shiv takes a beat to think about it.

                                 SHIV
                        Why did you decide to become a fire 
                        breather?

                                 DANTE
                        You’re changing the subject.

                                 SHIV
                        I’m not.

           Dante looks away, remembering painful thoughts.

                                 DANTE
                        The accident scarred both my body 
                        and my mind. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 DANTE (CONT'D)
                        I left my job and my fiancee left 
                        me. I had hit rock bottom. But one 
                        night, as irony would have it, I 
                        fell for a fire breather while 
                        watching her perform. So I decided 
                        to join the circus, to follow 
                        Marion, and to leave my previous 
                        life behind. At first I was just a 
                        roustabout, but soon I realized 
                        that to feel whole again, I needed 
                        to conquer what I feared the most. 
                        Fire.

                                 SHIV
                        So basically, it was a big “suck 
                        it” to that fateful night when you 
                        lost everything.

                                 DANTE
                        Pretty much.

                                 SHIV
                        My sister was everything to me. And 
                        this is my big “suck it”.

                                                                CUT TO:

           A DART BOARD ON A WALL

           CLACK! - a DART hits close to the center --

           CLACK! - then another - and then:

           CLACK! - a KNIFE stabs into the bulls-eye - FRACTURING the 
           board - sending splinters and pieces of broken darts FLYING --

           INT. SHADY BAR - NIGHT

           DART PLAYERS turn -- 

           Their hostile stares scan the poorly lit shithole, looking 
           for the asshole responsible.

           They spot Shiv at the entrance. Dante, Goliath and Zodiac 
           standing right behind him.

           Shiv’s eyes scan the place, setting on THE ACCOUNTANT (30s), 
           a scum in a cheap suit, getting hammered at the bar.

                                 SHIV
                        I’m looking for Ace.
           The Accountant smiles a fuck you smile.

                                 ACCOUNTANT
                        He’s not here. May I take a 
                        message?

                                 SHIV
                        You may.

           He gets rid of his cloak to SHOW OFF the insane amount of 
           KNIVES he’s carrying.

                                 SHIV
                        But I don’t want to trouble you.

           SHADY PATRONS grab bottles.

           Chairs.

           More bottles.

           And more chairs.

                                 ACCOUNTANT
                        No trouble at all.

           A tense beat... and then...

           PANDEMONIUM! - bottles, knives and chairs FLY!

           Goliath SWINGS his chain - Dante BLOWS plumes of FIRE - 
           Zodiac SLASHES throats open with her TAROT FAN --

           Shiv HURLS knives lightning fast - we STAY with him as:

           A chair HITS a rusty HANGING LIGHT - it SQUEAKS as it SWINGS 
           back and forth --

           BACK - it leaves the battlefield in DARKNESS --

           AND FORTH: Shiv revealed hurling KNIVES --

           BACK --

           AND FORTH: Shiv slides across the floor - his knife SLASHING 
           two Achilles’ tendons with ONE SWIPE as patrons go down --

           BACK --

           AND FORTH: Shiv THROWS - three patrons left --

           BACK --

           AND FORTH: Shiv STABS - one patron left --
           BACK --

           AND FORTH: the accountant makes a RUN for the exit.

           But finds himself CUT OFF by Goliath, Dante and Zodiac.

           LATER

           The accountant now sits at a table, a BABYLON MAP spread in 
           front of him.

                                 SHIV
                        Where is he?

                                 ACCOUNTANT
                        I don’t know.

                                 SHIV
                        Zodiac.

           Zodiac takes the accountant’s hand for a palm reading. But he 
           closes it in a TIGHT FIST.

           SLING! - Shiv unsheathes a knife.

                                 SHIV
                        Does the hand need to be attached 
                        to the rest of the body?

                                 ZODIAC
                        No.

                                 SHIV
                        Good.

           He brings the knife close to the accountant’s wrist --

           But the accountant opens his hand in defeat. 

           Zodiac’s eyes go WHITE as she reads his palm.

                                 ZODIAC
                        I see Kayne’s funeral...

           EXT. CEMETERY - DAY (VISION)

           Crosses and tombstones under a foreboding overcast sky. The 
           Accountant and a crowd of THUGS throw black roses at a COFFIN 
           being lowered into the ground. 
                                 ZODIAC (V.O.)
                        I see pain. Anger. A thirst for 
                        retribution.

           Knotted jaws. Clenched fists.

                                 ZODIAC (V.O.)
                        Rippling all the way up to the top 
                        of the syndicate.

           The crowd splits as a newcomer makes his way through the 
           mourners: THE THORN (60s). Gaunt and pale. Eyes glassy like a 
           cat’s. We recognize the Black Rose engraved on his gold tie 
           clip.

                                 ZODIAC (V.O.)
                        The Thorn is in town.

           No one dares to look at him in the eye as he lays a BLACK 
           ROSE into the grave.

                                 ZODIAC (V.O.)
                        He’s come to say goodbye to Kayne.

           LATER

           Funeral over, The Thorn’s BLACK CHOPPER sits on the cemetery 
           lawn, surrounded by The Accountant and SIX Black Rose 
           LIEUTENANTS.

                                 ZODIAC (V.O.)
                        And to anoint Ace to replace him.

           Inside the chopper’s OPEN BAY, Ace gives The Thorn a WOODEN 
           BOX with a Black Rose painted on its lid.

           He opens it, finding a SEVERED FINGER inside along with some 
           ROSE CLIPPERS.

           Ace is now missing a pinky just like Kayne.

           INSIDE ACE’S NEW HEADQUARTERS (VISION)

           A heated discussion takes place between Ace, SIX Black Rose 
           LIEUTENANTS and The Accountant.

                                 ZODIAC (V.O.)
                        Many lieutenants are thirsty for 
                        blood. But Ace needs to remain in 
                        business with Tigra and find the 
                        missing stash. So he’s holding 
                        them off.
           Enough chit chat - Ace whips out a GLOCK and blows a 
           lieutenant’s brains out - discussion over.

                                                               BACK TO:

           SHADY BAR

           Zodiac BREATHES hard, eyes still white. 

           Frowns, doesn’t like what she sees next. Not one bit.

                                 SHIV
                        What is it? What else do you see?

           She comes out from his trance, still on edge.

                                 ZODIAC
                        You take him out... we go to war.

           Dante doesn’t like the sound of that.

                                 SHIV
                        Where is Ace?

                                 DANTE
                        Let’s take a minute to think about 
                        this --

                                 SHIV
                             (to Zodiac)
                        Where is he?

                                 ZODIAC
                        I don’t know. Couldn’t see 
                        anything.

                                 SHIV
                        Look again.

                                 ZODIAC
                        He doesn’t know. He’s telling the 
                        truth.

                                 SHIV
                        No, he’s not.

           He puts a knife to her throat.

                                 SHIV
                        And neither are you.

                                 ZODIAC
                        I told you --
                                 SHIV
                        Why are you lying to me --

                                 ZODIAC
                        I couldn’t see --

                                 SHIV
                        What’s your angle --

                                 ZODIAC
                        There’s no angle --

                                 SHIV
                        Tell me what you saw!

                                 ZODIAC
                        I --

                                 SHIV
                        Tell me!

                                 ZODIAC
                        I die in the war!

           Shiv processes this in silence.

                                 ZODIAC
                        Just like I told you. The vision 
                        it’s getting clearer.

                                 GOLIATH
                        What vision?

                                 SHIV
                        Screw this.

           CLACK! - Shiv STABS the accountant’s hand - PINS it to the 
           table - makes him SCREAM in pain as:

                                 SHIV
                        Where is he?!

                                 ACCOUNTANT
                        I don’t know!

           SLING! - Shiv unsheathes another knife --

                                 ACCOUNTANT
                        Alright! Alright!

           His trembling finger points to an area on the map.

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. BABYLON STREET - NIGHT

           The CARNIE TRUCK cruises through a sea of neon.

           TRUCK’S CABIN

           Shiv drives, soaked in a dozen different blood types.

                                 SHIV
                        I won’t let you die.

                                 ZODIAC
                        Then don’t kill Ace.

                                 SHIV
                        You’re asking me to choose between 
                        you and my sister?

                                 ZODIAC
                        This time is different.

                                 SHIV
                        What’s changed?

           She rests her head on his shoulder.

                                 ZODIAC
                        Everything’s changed.

                                 SHIV
                        How convenient for you.

                                 ZODIAC
                        I didn’t plan this.

                                 SHIV
                        The other night was a mistake.

                                 ZODIAC
                        I know.

           He caresses her hair.

                                 SHIV
                        A nice mistake.

                                 ZODIAC
                        I know.

                                 SHIV
                        I need to think.

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. THE CARNIVAL - NIGHT

           Glittering lights surrounded by inky darkness.

           EXT. MIDWAY - NIGHT

           Marion (Dante’s wife) strides along, PISSED. She weaves 
           through the crowd, against the tide of flowing townies.

           INT. DANTE’S TRAILER - LATER

           Marion enters, finds Dante in mid-deliberation with Goliath.

                                 MARION
                             (to Goliath)
                        Please, we need a minute.

           Goliath nods and leaves them alone.

           Once he closes the door...

                                 MARION
                        The fortune teller told me 
                        everything.

                                 DANTE
                        Everything? I doubt that. She 
                        always has a hidden angle.

                                 MARION
                        We’re going to war with the Black 
                        Rose. Nothing hidden about that.

                                 DANTE
                        I tried talking the kid out of it. 
                        I really tried, Marion. But he just 
                        won’t quit...

                                 MARION
                        Doesn’t matter. You’ll quit.

                                 DANTE
                        He can’t storm Ace’s headquarters 
                        on his own.

                                 MARION
                        That’s why you’ll quit. We can’t 
                        let him start a war. Many lives are 
                        at stake, not just his.

           Off Dante, giving some serious thought to this...
           INT. BACKSTAGE TENT - NIGHT

           Dante enters to find Shiv SHARPENING his knives with a 
           whetstone.

                                 SHIV
                        Saw Zodiac talking to your wife. I 
                        can imagine what she told her. And 
                        what your wife told you. And what 
                        you’re about to tell me. Don’t 
                        bother. I’m going after Ace.

                                 DANTE
                        I’m out.

                                 SHIV
                        You’re free to do whatever you 
                        want.

                                 DANTE
                        But you’re not. I won’t let you do 
                        this.

           Shiv packs his sharpened knives as...

                                 SHIV
                        Don’t make me dig another grave.

           He heads for the exit. About to leave when --

           Goliath appears at the entrance, blocking his way.

                                 GOLIATH
                        If he’s not going, I’m not going. 
                        Speaking of which, you’re not going 
                        either.

           Shiv turns back to Dante.

                                 SHIV
                        I want you to picture your wife 
                        with a bullet in her head, her 
                        body hanging from a tree while 
                        vultures feast on her flesh. What 
                        would you do?

           Dante thinks hard about it.

                                 SHIV
                        What would you do, Dante?

                                 DANTE
                             (sighs in defeat)
                        The right thing.
                                 SHIV
                        Not asking you to come. Just to let 
                        me go.

           Dante nods at Goliath... who steps out of the way, letting 
           Shiv through. He’s about to leave when --

                                 GOLIATH
                        Knife boy.

           Shiv stops.

                                 GOLIATH
                        Watch out for Tigra. She’s a 
                        cornered beast, and she ain’t 
                        stopping till she gets that stash 
                        back.

                                 SHIV
                        She’ll never find it.

                                 GOLIATH
                        What makes you so sure?

                                 SHIV
                        I burned it.

                                 GOLIATH & DANTE
                             (oh shit)
                        Why?

                                 SHIV
                        Because fuck her. That’s why.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. MIDWAY - NIGHT

           Shiv and Zodiac standing close - the flowing throngs of 
           people behind them are just a BLUR.

                                 ZODIAC
                        You can’t go alone.

                                 SHIV
                        That’s why you knocked my team down 
                        piece by piece like a set of 
                        dominos?

                                 ZODIAC
                        You really expected me to do 
                        nothing while you start a war and I 
                        get crushed by the ripple effect?
                                 SHIV
                        No.

           He hands her an ENVELOPE in which she finds:

                                 ZODIAC
                        Train ticket?

                                 SHIV
                        Don’t come back until I call you.

                                 ZODIAC
                        Why...?

                                 SHIV
                        So the fallout won’t touch you.

                                 ZODIAC
                        It’s not that easy --

                                 SHIV
                        It is if you board that train and 
                        get the hell away from this.

                                 ZODIAC
                        Fate has a way of correcting 
                        itself.

                                 SHIV
                        You stopped your stepfather.

                                 ZODIAC
                        Somebody had to die.

                                 SHIV
                        Not this time.

                                 ZODIAC
                        Tigra won’t like this --

                                 SHIV
                        You’re out of this, even if I have 
                        to slaughter Tigra and an army of 
                        her goddamn minions.

                                 ZODIAC
                             (means it)
                        You’re so sweet.

           He KISSES her.
                                 SHIV
                        Cross me again and I won’t be.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. ZODIAC’S TRAILER - NIGHT

           With her BAGS PACKED, Zodiac sits alone on her cot, staring 
           at Shiv’s TRAIN TICKET.

           She stares at it hard, as if it was a puzzle to be solved.

           Her chest heaves as she gets more and more tense. Her eyes 
           start welling up with tears.

           EXT. DARK DIRT ROAD - NIGHT

           The CARNIE TRUCK speeds along on a mission, headlights 
           cutting across the misty blackness.

           Shiv behind the windshield, eyes beaming focus.

           Just a long stretch of empty road ahead until...

           A BLOCKADE - two black CHEVY PICKUP TRUCKS parked across.

           He hits the brakes -- 

           Ten THUGS step down from the CHEVYS - wielding UZIs.

           Shiv tries to back away in REVERSE but --

           Two more CHEVYS skid to a halt behind him and CUT him off.

           And then --

           RATATATATAT!! - muzzle FLASHES - thugs unleash a shitstorm of 
           GUNFIRE --

           The TRUCK’s tires BURST --

           IN THE TRUCK

           Hell - windows CRASHING - bullets PINGING --

           Shiv lays low as the RELENTLESS FIRE continues and glass 
           keeps raining down on him.

           Then the firing STOPS.

           And then, oddly, he hears an engine starting. 
           And another. 

           And then another. 

           It may appear the thugs are taking off. He risks a peek to 
           confirm -- 

           Yes, they’re leaving. 

           Huh?

           LATER

           Shiv, alone, surveys what’s left of his ride. Someone left an 
           envelope on the hood. He opens it and finds:

           Zodiac’s train ticket.

           With a scribbled message on it.

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        I recognize Tigra’s handwriting on 
                        Zodiac’s ticket. She turned her 
                        over to Ace and now they want to 
                        trade her for the dope.

           He lets go off the ticket in deep thought... the wind carries 
           it away as...

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        Zodiac’s words come back to hit me 
                        like a punch in the face... “Fate 
                        has a way of correcting itself”.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. ACE’S NEW HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

           A luxurious RESIDENTIAL COMPOUND in Babylon’s outskirts. 
           Window lights glow in the mist - bright yellow halos in the 
           darkness of night.

           A few GUARDS patrol the inside perimeter of a PICKET FENCE.

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        I’m supposed to get the product and 
                        be at Ace’s place by midnight to 
                        make the exchange.

           Shiv’s shadowy FIGURE slinks toward the house, approaching 
           its surrounding fence.
                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        But instead I show up two hours 
                        early with nothing on me but the 
                        nagging feeling that this is the 
                        night she dies in my arms, just 
                        like in her vision.

           He watches the PICKET FENCE from a distance.

           Focuses on the light spilling through the cracks. A passing 
           shadow betrays the position of a sentinel patrolling the 
           other side.

           His eyes follow that shadow as he readies a knife.

           Then THROWS -- 

           The blade flies with a furtive whistle -- 

           Slips through a crack in the fence with surgical precision.

           And TAKES DOWN the guard on the other side.

           LATER

           Shiv jumps over the fence unnoticed, lands without a sound.

           Approaches the HOUSE, knives ready.

           Spots a GUARD turning from around the corner - DROPS him.

           Spots TWO GUARDS on the roof - DROPS them.

           KITCHEN

           Three GUARDS playing cards. They hear a noise - turn - spot 
           Shiv at the door:

           One THROW - three KNIVES fly at once - spreading in flight -- 

           Guards go down.

           LIVING AREA

           A GUARD watches TV - the light of the tube spilling his 
           stretched shadow across a fur rug.

           A DESK FAN whirs some cool air at him.

           Looking THROUGH its spinning BLADES we get intermittent 
           glimpses of an intruder:
           Shiv sneaks along behind the guard’s back. Silent as the 
           night until --

           CREAK! - fucking floorboard -- 

           The guard turns - reaches for his gun --

           Shiv takes aim - no time for a better angle - THROWS --

           HIS KNIFE

           Whooshes across the darkened room...

           Towards the guard...

           Slipping THROUGH the spinning fan blades with perfect timing.

           And STABBING into the guard’s chest...

           CORRIDOR

           Shiv reaches an elbow, presses his back against the wall.

           Holds a KNIFE out, using the blade’s reflection so he can see 
           around the corner.

           Spots an armed GUARD coming his way.

           Approaching in 3... 2... 1...

           Shiv breaks cover and SLASHES open the guard’s throat.

           As he watches him fall to his knees and die...

           A GUST of wind blows through an open window - a CURTAIN flows 
           into view - OBSCURING our sight of Shiv for just one second -- 

           When the curtain retreats, Shiv is GONE.

           BASEMENT

           Dark. Dank. Rat-infested.

           A high window spills moonlight over ZODIAC, tied by her 
           wrists to a RUSTED PIPE above her head.

           The door WHINES open. Shiv sneaks inside.

           She turns, a tad embarrassed. Her face caked with dirt.
                                 ZODIAC
                        Tried to leave, but they snatched 
                        me at the train station.

           He CUTS her loose. Her knees falter, he CATCHES her.

                                 SHIV
                        Don’t worry. You’ll be alright.

                                 ZODIAC
                        I know.

           SHE TAKES ONE OF HIS KNIVES AND STABS HIM IN THE BACK!

           Shiv GASPS for air - takes a few steps back - wide eyed. 

           He trips and FALLS - bleeding fast - getting weaker.

           Unable to read her poker face.

                                 SHIV
                        Why did you...?

           Ace emerges from the shadows with a victorious grin.

           Shiv’s eyelids grow heavy. 

           His view of them distorts to a BLUR. 

           Until his mind finally slips into a thick -- 

           BLACKNESS.

           FADE IN:

           A RAT

           Scurrying along a RUSTED PIPE. Stops. Grinds its SHARP TEETH 
           together.

           INT. BASEMENT - NIGHT

           Now it’s Shiv the one tied and hanging from the PIPE.

           His torn clothes reveal fresh stitches on the cut on his 
           back. Probably infected. Lousy job.

           His eyes flutter open to see:
                                 TIGRA
                        Where’s the stash?

                                 SHIV
                        I burned it.

           She SWINGS her WHIP - it coils in the air like a snake --

           WHOOSH-CRACK! - cuts a GASH across Shiv’s chest.

           LATER

           Shiv now answers to Ace and his THUGS.

                                 SHIV
                        I burned it.

           WHAM! - a flying fist SMACKS Shiv’s face hard.

           LATER

           Interlude.

           Shiv, alone, opens his eyes. Takes in every inch of the room. 
           Spots TWO RATS darting along the pipe just ABOVE his head.

           He SWINGS his body back and forth - back and forth - raises 
           his legs - tries to CATCH one of the rats between his feet -- 

           But it scurries free at the last second.

           LATER

           WHAM! - Ace and his thugs are at it again.

                                 SHIV
                        Bring in the fortune teller. She’ll 
                        tell you --

           WHAM!

                                 ACE
                        Where’s the fun in that?

           LATER

           A THUG tries another approach, goes to a corner where Shiv’s 
           sheathes lie on a chair. Picks a knife.

           Then CUTS Shiv’s chest --
           But, to his surprise, this seems to relax Shiv.

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        Oh, how I needed that.

           WHAM! - back to the punching.

           LATER

           Interlude. Shiv SWINGS his body. For some reason, he wants 
           really badly to catch a rat between his feet.

           Misses again.

           LATER

           Shiv opens his swollen eyes, finds Zodiac standing in front 
           of him.

                                 ZODIAC
                        Where’s the dope?

           He just looks at her, his stare cutting like his knives.

           She nods to a couple of THUGS.

           They cut Shiv down - he drops to the floor - a bloody mess.

           Zodiac takes Shiv’s hands and does a palm reading. 

           Her eyes go white.

           She concentrates really hard. She clenches her teeth. Doesn’t 
           like what she sees.

           She looks up to meet his gaze. 

           That glare. It’s getting on her nerves.

                                 ZODIAC
                        Stop looking at me like that. 
                        You’ve no idea what’s going on or 
                        why I had to do what I did --

                                 SHIV
                        You were the one who figured out 
                        Mirage was a mole.

                                                              FLASH TO:
           THE BONFIRE

           Mirage holds Zodiac’s hand as they dance - as she SPINS away 
           from him, her eyes turn white and her smile suddenly DIES.

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        He had everyone fooled but wasn’t 
                        counting on your gift.

           TIGRA’S TENT

           Tigra GRIPS her whip TIGHTER as she listens to Zodiac talk.

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        So you ratted him out to Tigra who 
                        then ratted him out to the Black 
                        Rose.

           CARNIVAL - PARKING LOT

           Mirage starts a TRUCK. 

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        She sent him on an errand knowing 
                        pretty well he’d never come back.

           From the distance, Tigra watches the truck about to take off 
           when... Brake lights. The truck stops. Ayleen comes running 
           over and hops into the passenger’s side.

           She frowns. This wasn’t in the plans but:

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        She didn’t give a damn if something 
                        happened to my sister as well.

           Zodiac joins Tigra, sees the parting truck. Trades an uneasy 
           glance with Tigra. They watch the truck leave as...

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        And neither did you.

           ROAD TO BABYLON

           Zodiac’s hands feel the tire tracks on the dirt.

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        You helped me find the body to get 
                        me off your back and go back to 
                        ignoring me as soon as possible.
           ZODIAC’S TRAILER

           Tigra takes Zodiac’s face in her hands.

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        But then Tigra bullied you into 
                        helping her take down Kayne.

           CARNIE TRUCK

           Zodiac rides shotgun as Shiv drives.

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        And you found yourself by my side 
                        once again. Getting closer.

           SHOWERS

           Zodiac joins Shiv at the shower.

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        And closer.

           SHIV’S TRAILER

           Zodiac and Shiv in bed.

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        And closer.

           MIDWAY

           Shiv listens to Zodiac.

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        You tried to talk me out of going 
                        after Ace in order to stop the war. 
                        To stop your vision from happening. 
                        I didn’t budge, true --

           He hands her the train ticket.

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        But I gave you a ticket out. Yet 
                        doubt was eating you alive because 
                        of what you had told me before:
           CARNIE TRUCK

           Zodiac talks MOS, mouthing exactly:

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        “Fate has a way of correcting 
                        itself.”

           TIGRA’S TENT

           Zodiac hands the train ticket to Tigra.

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        You’re the scorpion on the frog and 
                        you had to sting. You helped them 
                        weave the web I’m now caught in.

                                                               BACK TO:

           BASEMENT

           Zodiac listens to every word.

                                 SHIV
                        All to make sure I don’t kill Ace, 
                        that there won’t be a war, and that 
                        you won’t get killed in it. But 
                        when you just read my hands you 
                        couldn’t find the stash, because 
                        there was one vision blocking out 
                        everything else: you still die. And 
                        now that you betrayed me, you 
                        figured out who’s the killer: me.
                             (then)
                        What did I miss?

                                 ZODIAC
                        What we had... it was real.

                                 SHIV
                        Whores don’t count.

                                 ZODIAC
                             (to the thugs)
                        Make sure those ropes are tight.

           LATER

           Ropes are tight.

           WHAM!
           LATER

           Interlude. Shiv is alone once again.

           His eyes fixed on a RAT scurrying along the PIPE.

           He SWINGS his body - raises his legs - and this time:

           Success! 

           His legs swing back down - a squirming RAT now trapped 
           between his feet.

           He brings his legs up again so his tied HANDS take the rat.

           CRACK! - he SNAPS the rodent’s neck.

           And then uses the rat’s sharp incisors to SCRAPE the rope 
           binding his wrists.

           LATER

           Bare feet hit the ground --

           Shiv is FREE.

           He goes to get his knife sheaths.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. ACE’S NEW HEADQUARTERS - NIGHT

           Ace RUNS for his life - thugs dropping dead all around him - 
           a SHITSTORM of flying knives coming hard at them --

           Thugs FIRE blindly behind their backs - but they keep getting 
           hit - blades WHIZ out from the blackness - as if thrown by 
           the night itself --

           Ace blasts through the PICKET FENCE’s gate.

           A thug CLOSES it and makes a stand.

           But Shiv HURLS knives at the thug’s legs - brings him down 
           screaming to his knees as --

           Shiv LEAPS onto the goon’s back...

           Hurtling himself into the air...

           Flying over the fence...
           On course to pounce on the fleeing Ace...

           Unsheathing TWO KNIVES in mid-flight... like a falcon 
           readying its claws to dive for prey...

           Ace turns... spots Shiv... realizing this is the last thing 
           he’ll ever see --

           SWASH! - Shiv STABS Ace in the back with BOTH BLADES.

           Ace GASPS. 

           And then, with his last breath:

                                 ACE
                        You’ve no idea who you’re messing 
                        with. The Thorn will --

           Shiv yanks the knives out - shutting him up as we --

                                                                CUT TO:

           ZODIAC

           Breathing hard with her eyes milk white. Bad vision.

           EXT. THE CARNIVAL - ROAD - NIGHT

           She stands in the middle of the road, facing the distant CITY 
           LIGHTS. The moon hangs low in the sky, rising BLOOD RED.

           Tigra joins her, growing concerned as well.

                                 TIGRA
                        What is it? What’s wrong?

                                 ZODIAC
                        Everything.

           DESERT MOUNTAIN RETREAT (VISION)

           In his study, The Thorn hands out WOODEN BOXES to FIVE Black 
           Rose LIEUTENANTS.

                                 ZODIAC (V.O.)
                        The Thorn put a bounty on our 
                        heads. The reward is Ace’s  
                        position.

           Lieutenants open the boxes, finding ROSE CLIPPERS inside.
                                 ZODIAC (V.O.)
                        Shiv merely cut one rose...

           They all take the clippers without hesitation.

                                 ZODIAC (V.O.)
                        There are many others in the bush.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. TRAILER AREA - NIGHT

           A circus CROWD gathers in awe to watch Shiv’s return.

           He paces along without a word, dragging Ace’s DEAD BODY.

           Zodiac and Tigra can’t believe their eyes.

           Tigra steps in his way, making him stop. They trade hard 
           stares.

                                 TIGRA
                        You brought war upon us --

                                 SHIV
                        You started this mess. Take some 
                        responsibility --

                                 TIGRA
                        I don’t answer to you, brat --

           SLING! - Shiv unsheathes a KNIFE --

           Tigra UNFURLS her WHIP --

           Zodiac opens her deck of cards in a FAN --

           Shit about to get ugly when:

                                 DANTE (O.S.)
                        ENOUGH!

           Dante steps between them to prevent the fight. 

                                 DANTE
                        The Black Rose is coming! You think 
                        we can survive a full scale attack 
                        if we don’t stand together?

           Goliath steps in as well.
                                 GOLIATH
                        He’s right.
                             (spits tobacco)
                        Group hug. Now.

           Shiv SHEATHES his knife. Shoots one last look at Tigra and 
           Zodiac. And then continues on his way.

           EXT. THE CARNIVAL - OUTSKIRTS - NIGHT

           Shiv drops Ace’s body into the remaining empty grave.

           Starts shoveling dirt.

           The three graves he dug are now filled.

           LATER

           Shiv has just finished digging a NEW GRAVE.

           He throws the shovel and walks away.

           ZODIAC AND TIGRA

           Watch from the distance with a chill running down their 
           spines. They look at each other. Which one will it be?

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. THE CARNIVAL - ROAD - NIGHT

           Shiv stands just outside the carnival grounds, checking on 
           Zodiac as she feels the road with her hands.

           Her eyes are rolled back. She’s seeing something. Something 
           disturbing.

                                 ZODIAC
                        They’re coming.

                                 SHIV
                        How many?

                                 ZODIAC
                        An army.
           POLICE STATION (VISION)

           SCUMBAGS pour out the front door and jump onto a couple of 
           CHEVY PICKUP trucks waiting for them.

                        They emptied the jails.

           As they do, a Black Rose LIEUTENANT with a MISSING FINGER 
           hands them MOLOTOV COCKTAILS.

           SLUMS (VISION)

           Two LIEUTENANTS with missing fingers distribute KNIVES and

           CARNIVAL ROAD

           Shiv turns to go --

                                 SHIV
                        I’ll warn the rest.

                                 ZODIAC
                        Shiv.

           He stops.

                                 ZODIAC
                        I’m sorry.

                                 SHIV
                        No, you’re not. But you will be.

                                 ZODIAC
                        Tigra won’t wait for you make the 
                        first move. She’ll try to kill you 
                        first.
                                 SHIV
                        I know.

                                 ZODIAC
                        I could be your eyes again. I could 
                        help you.

           He LEAVES without another word.

           Off Zodiac, sensing the walls of Fate closing in on her...

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. THE CARNIVAL - NIGHT

           Closed to the public. Lights out. The night is quiet as the 
           calm before the storm.

           BACKSTAGE TENT

           Shiv gets ready, sheathing knives. We’ve never seen him 
           carrying so many.

           ZODIAC’S TRAILER

           Zodiac downs a glass of scotch and then picks her TAROT 
           CARDS.

           MIDWAY

           Tigra marches along, whip in hand, followed by a squad of 
           burly ROUSTABOUTS carrying WOOD PLANKS and TIRE IRONS.

           A general leading the troops.

           PERFORMANCE RING

           Goliath unhooks a nasty TOW CHAIN from a TRUCK.

           BACKSTAGE TENT

           Dante and Marion grab their TORCHES and FUEL BOTTLES.

           ROAD TO BABYLON

           Headlights glow in the distance. The Black Rose is coming.
           THE CARNIVAL - BIRD’S EYE VIEW

           Circus tents poke through a thick FOG BANK, like mountain 
           peaks through clouds.

           The road, shrouded in mist, is aglow with twenty pairs of 
           headlights moving in line along the winding path. 

           From above, the Black Rose’s convoy looks like a SNAKE OF 
           LIGHT slithering closer to its prey.

           DOWN BELOW

           Twenty CHEVY PICKUP TRUCKS approach the CARNIVAL GATES, 
           carrying a small ARMY on their beds.

           Thugs armed with handguns. Bottles. Chains. Knives.

           WHAM! - gates FLY OPEN as the first chevy SMASHES through --

           And then it’s on.

           THUGS throw Molotov cocktails --

           WHOOSH! - tents BURST into flames.

                                 TIGRA
                        Now!

           Carnies counter - ROUSTABOUTS hiding behind a trailer pull 
           from a rope.

           Dragging a BED OF NAILS right in front of a CHEVY’s path.

           Tires BURST - the ride useless. 

           Instant AMBUSH - Tigra’s boys are onto that truck like flies 
           to shit --

           A GOON levels his HANDGUN --

           WHOOSH-CRACK! - Tigra’s WHIP sends the weapon flying out of 
           his hand.

           Roustabouts SWING iron tires - CRUSHING skulls --

           MIDWAY

           A CHEVY speeds along wreaking havoc. Chock full of THUGS on 
           its bed, throwing Molotovs.

           The DRIVER frowns as he sees:
           Goliath up ahead, tow chain in hand, RUNNING right towards 
           the oncoming vehicle.

           The driver pushes the pedal to the mat to meet him head on.

           Engine ROARS as the CHEVY picks up speed.

           Odd... Goliath keeps running straight. 

           Seems like he’s playing chicken against a frickin’ TRUCK.

           A head-on collision between man and machine is imminent.

           The driver smiles. He’s going to enjoy this.

           The CHEVY will crush Goliath like a bug in 3... 2... 1...

           Goliath dives head-on

           UNDER THE CHEVY

           turning to fall on his back - HOOKS the tow chain to the 
           FRONT AXLE - lies flat to let the truck pass over him and 
           YANKS the chain with all his might, causing

           THE CHEVY

           to LOSE its front wheels - its front BURROWS into the ground - 
           the ride TOPPLES over - catapulting THUGS into the air:

           Birds without wings...

           Shiv appears - unleashing a hail of WHIZZING KNIVES - his 
           arms a BLUR --

           He stabs foes in mid-air before they even fall.

           They’re all dead meat by the time they THUD to the ground.

           ROUSTABOUTS

           Drag another BED OF NAILS across the ground --

           Tires BURST - another CHEVY is ambushed.

           A THUG on its bed jumps down - lit Molotov in hand - about to 
           throw it when:

           Tigra CRACKS her whip - the bottle BURSTS in his hand - the 
           cocktail EXPLODES in his face.
           Knife-wielding GOONS hop down to engage the Roustabouts.

           Zodiac fights among them...

           SLASHING throats open with her TAROT FAN...

           Twisting and turning to duck their knife swings...

           Her dress flowing like the cape of a Spartan warrior...

           Mouth open in a powerful battlecry as she SLASHES open a 
           fingerless LIEUTENANT’s neck...

           TRAILER AREA

           Goliath SWINGS the tow chain above his head - big fucking 
           smile on his face - like a cowboy readying to rope some 
           cattle - he THROWS --

           The HOOK goes flying - CLANK! - buries into the side of a 
           passing Chevy --

           He YANKS the chain - RIPS an opening in the fuel tank - now 
           leaking gas --

           The Chevy keeps going as:

           WHOOSH! - Dante blows a FIREBALL as he does a 360 spin - 
           incinerating the THUGS surrounding him --

           Then KICKS a BURNING FOE’s chest who hits the ground - a line 
           of fuel IGNITES under him --

           Fire SPREADS along the line - chasing after the Chevy - 
           catching up with the leaking fuel tank as --

           BOOOOM! - the roaring FIREBALL lights up the night.

           Outlining clusters of battling shadows all around.

           A CARNIE TRUCK

           Speeds across carnival grounds - Shiv on its bed - slinging 
           knives at everything that moves --

           Including a fingerless LIEUTENANT who gets a KNIFE in his 
           throat - he THUDS to the ground...
           TIGRA

           Has TANGLED her whip around two GOONS’ necks - she STRANGLES 
           them both at the same time --

           GOLIATH

           Pins another LIEUTENANT against a trailer - PUNCHES his face 
           again and again - wrecking ball force - the wood behind the 
           goon’s head SPLINTERS and CRACKS --

           DANTE AND MARION

           Incinerate foes with their DRAGON BREATHS.

           BIRD’S EYE VIEW

           Burning tents. Gunfire FLASHES in the mist, like lightning in 
           storm clouds. A war zone.

           DOWN BELOW

           Overturned and burning CHEVY PICKUPS. Goons’ bodies strewn 
           all around. 

           The Black Rose is taking heavy casualties.

           TRAILER AREA

           Shiv retrieves some KNIVES stuck into fallen foes.

           Climbs onto the CARNIE TRUCK’s bed. Taps the cabin’s window.

                                 SHIV
                        Let’s go!

           The DRIVER guns it - steers the TRUCK back into battle - Shiv 
           resumes taking down goons as:

           MIDWAY

           The Black Rose is now clearly outnumbered. Thugs start to 
           FLEE.

           Tigra stands proud amid the carnage with a victorious smile 
           on her face.

           She spots the TRUCK carrying Shiv.
           Nods to the truck’s DRIVER. Do it.

           The Driver TURNS, now headed towards Tigra.

           Shiv doesn’t notice - he’s too busy slinging knives.

           The Driver SLAMS the brakes HARD - catches Shiv off guard --

           Newton’s first law sends him FLYING over the cabin - 
           dumbstruck - splayed out in the air --

           He HITS the ground hard - rolling amid a CLOUD OF DIRT - 
           finally scraping to a painful halt.

           He COUGHS - the dust clears - the first thing he sees is:

           Tigra appears and STRANGLES him with her whip.

           His hand reaches for a KNIFE but --

           Two burly ROUSTABOUTS hold him down.

           Tigra TIGHTENS her grip to the tune of SQUEAKING leather and 
           GARGLING chokes --

           Shiv’s face REDDENS - eyes BULGING out - he’s pinned down - 
           can’t move - tries to GASP for air --

           Twitching desperately. 

           But losing strength fast.

           The twitching slows down.

           Until there’s no more fight left in him. 

           And he lies still. 

           His empty stare now fixed somewhere far away.

           SHIV IS DEAD.

           Tigra releases her grip.

           But then this image TURNS TO:

           A REFLECTION IN AN EYE

           A woman’s eye.

           This is the eye of:
           ZODIAC

           She puts a hand on Shiv’s shoulder. We are...

           BEHIND A TRAILER

           Shiv and Zodiac face to face.

                                 ZODIAC
                        That’s how she’ll do it. Trust me 
                        on this.

                                 SHIV
                        We’ll see.

           He RUNS off --

           TRAILER AREA

           Shiv retrieves some KNIVES from fallen foes, just like in 
           Zodiac’s vision.

           Climbs onto the TRUCK waiting for him. Taps the cabin’s 
           window.

                                 SHIV
                        Let’s go!

           The DRIVER guns it --

           MIDWAY - LATER

           Tigra spots the TRUCK.

           Nods her treacherous nod. Do it.

           The Driver SLAMS the brakes --

           But now Shiv is ready.

           He goes FLYING...

           But this time he does a SOMERSAULT... sailing through the air 
           with the grace of an Olympic diver...

           His body unfurls...

           He starts hurling KNIVES in mid-air...

           Taking down Tigra’s minions...
           He LANDS... does a ROLL amid a cloud of dirt...

           Stands up in one fluid motion and --

           THRUSTS a knife forth.

           The dust CLEARS to reveal...

           Tigra GARGLING with his knife stuck into her throat.

           He TWISTS the blade.

           THE BIG TOP - PERFORMANCE RING

           Zodiac CUTS foes down - takes them down without mercy.

           She’s about to slay the last one standing when --

           SWASH! - a KNIFE takes him down first - he hits the floor to 
           reveal: 

           Shiv has entered the arena.

           His eyes bore into her.

           She swallows hard.

           They stare at each other for a moment. 

           Like gunslingers about to draw.

           The tent is starting to BURN - ash flakes float in the air 
           like apocalyptic snow.

           SLING! - he unsheathes another knife.

                                 ZODIAC
                        I helped you.

                                 SHIV
                        You did what you did to save your 
                        ass. Like you always do.

           She takes this in. Considers her next move very carefully. 

           And then...

           She throws her TAROT CARDS away, like a soldier laying down 
           his weapon.
                                 ZODIAC
                        I won’t fight you. You want a piece 
                        of me? You’ll have to murder me in 
                        cold blood.

           This wasn’t in his plans.

                                 ZODIAC
                        The question is, can you do it?

           His hand GRIPS the handle tighter.

                                 ZODIAC
                        I don’t think you can.

           She walks towards him.

                                 ZODIAC
                        Wanna know why?

           She now stands right in front of him.

                                 ZODIAC
                        Because despite all the stupid 
                        mistakes I made... I’m still the 
                        same girl you fell in love with.

           He doesn’t notice that:

           She’s still got a TAROT CARD up her sleeve.

           And it slowly SLIDES OUT into her hand, like a snake coming 
           out its hole --

           It’s the THREE OF SWORDS.

                                 ZODIAC
                        Deep down inside you still love me, 
                        don’t you?

           It happens in less than a second - her jaw tightens - she 
           makes a move to swipe his throat --

           BUT HE STABS HER FIRST.

           She gasps in pain and surprise.

                                 SHIV
                        Love takes two.

           She drops like a puppet cuts off its strings - he catches 
           her. 
           He’s CRUSHED by this. Can’t help himself, he hugs her tight 
           as she breathes her last breaths.

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        I can think of a hundred cruel 
                        things she could say to punish me 
                        for what I did. But she does 
                        something worse.

           She HUGS him back.

           Silhouetted against roaring flames: Shiv and Zodiac’s shadow 
           embracing each other lovingly, just like in her vision.

           LATER

           Shiv keeps holding her, caressing her hair, but her arms now 
           hang loose at her side and her head tilts back.

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        I hold her tight until her body 
                        goes cold.

           One last kiss.

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        And then I kiss her dead lips 
                        goodbye.

                                                                CUT TO:

           A BLACK ROSE

           Lying by a gutter. It’s the one that Zodiac threw out the 
           window. Hours go by in seconds as the flower WITHERS and 
           DIES...

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        News of our victory spread 
                        throughout Babylon.

           POLICE STATION HOLDING CELLS

           A POLICE OFFICER opens a cell door - SHOVES inside two GOONS 
           wearing Black Rose tats on their necks.

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        Cops and judges grow some balls.
           CITY HALL

           A BURLY CITIZEN rolls up his sleeves and starts scrubbing off 
           the Black Rose graffiti. A SUITED CITIZEN puts down his 
           briefcase and joins him. Then another one. Make that two.

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        The Black Rose took a big hit.

           THE CARNIVAL

           Shiv BURIES Zodiac along with Tigra.

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        We all did.

           Zodiac’s body gradually disappears under shovels of dirt. Her 
           skin, eerily pale. Death gifted her with a doll-like beauty.

           SHIV’S TRAILER

           Shiv stirs on his cot, sweating and hyperventilating. Bad 
           anxiety attack.

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        I sheath my knives and finally face 
                        the fact that Ayleen’s gone.

           ZODIAC’S CIRCUS FLIER

           Grimy and half-burned.

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        Zodiac’s ghost still haunts my 
                        thoughts now and then.

           SHIV’S TRAILER

           Shiv battles the anxiety rush. Tries to breathe like Ayleen 
           taught him. 

           In and out. In... and out...

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        And it probably will for a long 
                        time.
           ZODIAC’S GRAVE

           Her face DISAPPEARS under a shovel of dirt.

           SHIV’S TRAILER

           Shiv now breathes steadily, his eyes closing in peaceful 
           sleep.

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        But at least I don’t dream of her 
                        anymore.

           EXT. DESERT ROAD - DAY

           A caravan of CARNIE TRUCKS kicks up dust, speeding along a 
           dirt road that cuts through the middle of nowhere.

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        We hit a new town, always on the 
                        move.

           EXT. CARNIVAL - DAY

           ROUSTABOUTS unpack and set up tents.

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        We lose some performers...

           A hand RIPS Zodiac’s poster from the side of a TRAILER.

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        But we gain some too.

           Another POSTER is glued in its place:

           “MALIKA” is the name of the VOODOO PRIESTESS, written with 
           letters made of interweaving thorny vines. A feral AFRICAN 
           WOMAN stirs a caldron, its swirling steam forms ghostly claws 
           that caress her body, making her arch in ECSTASY.

           INT. THE THORN’S BLACK CHOPPER - NIGHT (FLYING)

           The Thorn holds Shiv’s poster in his hand, staring at it with 
           his cold, catlike eyes.

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        I know the Black Rose is coming for 
                        me.
           INT. BIG TOP - PERFORMANCE RING - NIGHT

           The stands are PACKED, the public watching as... 

           ACROBATS enter the stage, combining dance techniques and 
           various other moves, doing their performance right between 
           Shiv and an ASSISTANT strapped to a spinning wheel.

           Shiv is BLINDFOLDED. He can’t see the ACROBATS, but he can 
           HEAR them because they wear RATTLES strapped to their arms 
           and legs.

           Shiv THROWS a knife --

           It flies across the ring...

           Slipping through the flowing mass of acrobats...

           Flying inches above an acrobat’s head who just crouched to do 
           a ROLL...

           Slicing a lock of another acrobat’s hair, who’s doing a 
           cartwheel...

           Jockeying through a web of limbs and flesh until...

           CLACK! - the knife SEVERS the tip of a flower caught between 
           the assistant’s teeth - it’s a BLACK ROSE --

           The severed BUD flies like a chopped off head in battle, 
           hanging in the air as...

                                 SHIV (V.O.)
                        Bring it.

                                                        SMASH TO BLACK.
