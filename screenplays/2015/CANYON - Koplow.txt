           INT. FOXFIELD FOREST OFFICES - CONFERENCE ROOM - MORNING 

           ERIC DAVIDSON (30) scribbles a realistic sketch of a stoic 
           bald man in a suit. This man, an HR REP (50s), sits across a 
           conference table from Eric. 

           Surrounding them are several cardboard cut-outs of cartoon 
           foxes, deer, and moose. The characters of the hit kids’ show, 
           “FOXFIELD FOREST”. Behind the HR Rep, Farley the Fox wears 
           sunglasses and a fedora and beams a cartoonish, toothy grin.

           Eric’s boss, MR. COHEN (40), enters the conference room and 
           excitedly approaches the colorful cut-out of Farley.

                                 MR. COHEN 
                            (to the cut-out)
                        Thanks for meeting with us, Eric! 

           Mr. Cohen eyes Eric, pantomiming an exaggerated double-take. 
           Eric plays along, pulling his sunglasses out from his bag.  

                                 ERIC
                        Haha! I just left the hat at home!

                                 MR. COHEN
                        What? You’re over there? I can’t 
                        tell you two apart! That’s how well 
                        you’re bringing Farley to life! 

           Mr Cohen sits down at the conference table. 

                                 MR. COHEN (CONT’D)
                        The sponsors are so happy. What was 
                        the Crate & Barrel tweet last week? 
                        About redesigning your living room?

                                 ERIC
                        “Get your paws down to Crate & 
                        Barrel and redecorate your den!”

           Mr. Cohen grins at Eric with puzzled enthusiasm. 

                                 ERIC (CONT’D)
                        Like, the den in a house... and 
                        foxes live in dens.  

           Mr. Cohen erupts in boisterous laughter. The HR Rep stares 
           back at him sternly. Mr. Cohen stiffens up in response. 

                                 MR. COHEN
                        Eric, we know you’re focused on 
                        advancing with the show. Exhibiting 
                        more creativity. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MR. COHEN (CONT'D)
                        So we’re proud to announce you’re 
                        no longer our Assistant Director of 
                        Social Marketing. You’re our new 
                        Vice Manager of Social Accounts!

           Eric stares back blankly. Crestfallen. 

                                 MR. COHEN (CONT’D)
                        That’s a promotion! 

                                 ERIC
                        I, uh, thank you. But, didn’t you 
                        get all the illustrations I sent?

           Mr. Cohen releases a deep, sympathetic breath and nods.  

                                 ERIC (CONT’D)
                        Yeah, so I thought that’s what this 
                        meeting was gonna be about. 

                                 MR. COHEN
                        Well, that kind of is what this 
                        meeting’s about. The illustrators 
                        are fully staffed this year. 
                        There’s no space for you.

                                 ERIC
                        Again? But when I started, you 
                        always said I could transfer over. 
                        You knew that was my whole plan. 

                                 MR. COHEN
                        That was six years ago, Eric. You 
                        were an intern. We weren’t paying 
                        you. We had to tell you something. 

           Mr. Cohen slides a stack of papers across the table. 

                                 MR. COHEN (CONT’D)
                        Foxfield Forest wants you focused 
                        on your new title. That’s how we 
                        want you being creative. Because we 
                        got a big, new account. 

           Eric scans the paperwork. His boss nods emphatically.

                                 ERIC
                        EnerCron? The coal company? Aren’t 
                        they like the world’s leading agent 
                        of deforestation? How can I promote 
                        them with forest animals?
                                 MR. COHEN
                        I dunno, Eric. But that’s what 
                        you’re good at! So go get ‘em!

           INT. FOXFIELD FOREST OFFICES - ERIC’S OFFICE - LATER

           In his cramped office, Eric stares at the poster of Farley 
           the Fox that covers his wall. Eric fixates on Farley’s 
           cartoonish grin. It taunts Eric. 

           He spins around in his chair and attacks his keyboard. 

           We get close-up flashes of Eric’s jittery typing: “RABID”, 
           “SPONSORS”, “INSUFFERABLE”, “TARGET”, “KIDS”, “FOXES”, “DIE”, 
           “HEYNUS”. Eric deletes as red lines appear under the last 
           word. He types “HYENA-US”. He deletes again. “HEINOUS!!!” 

           INT. FOXFIELD FOREST OFFICES - OFFICE BULLPEN - LATER

           Mr. Cohen stomps across the office bullpen, parting a sea of 
           cubicles while frantically scrolling on his phone. 

                                 MR. COHEN
                        What is he doing? What the hell is 
                        he doing? Eric, delete those posts!

           Dozens of interns bunkered in the gray cubicles pop their 
           heads up. They offer Mr. Cohen only blank stares. 

                                 MR. COHEN (CONT’D)
                        Take them down now! Are you crazy?

           Mr. Cohen grabs the doorknob to Eric’s tiny office. Locked.

                                 MR. COHEN (CONT’D)
                        Do you get some sick pleasure from 
                        scaring the shit out of hundreds of 
                        thousands of children? 

           INT. MODERN OFFICE BUILDING - ERIC’S OFFICE - MORNING

           Eerily placid, Eric continues to post profane statuses. 
           Farley’s cartoonish grin looms over his shoulder.

                                 MR. COHEN (O.S.)
                        Security is on its way. You’re 
                        done, Eric! You’re done!

           At his messy desk, Eric calmly closes his eyes. 
           INT. ERIC AND AMY’S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - SIX WEEKS LATER

           Eric stares at his shirtless reflection in the bathroom 
           mirror. He pokes at the saggy-ness of budding man-boobs. 

           Eric’s scowls at his weight, but he’s more distressed to 
           discover patches of wispy hair on his shoulder blades.

                                 ERIC
                        Where the hell did you come from?

           Eric sloppily dabs shaving cream on his back. He twists, 
           struggling to see his reflection to shave his back. 

           He secures his phone to the towel rack with rubber bands, 
           angling the camera to show his back in the mirror. 

           He makes awkward strokes with the razor, carefully watching 
           his movement in the screen of his phone. But the phone 
           changes from the camera to an incoming phone call. ‘MOM’.

           Eric’s hand slips. The old plastic razor drags across his 
           back. A red blob of blood grows in the white shaving cream. 

                                 ERIC (CONT’D)
                        Shit!

           His Mom’s voicemail plays as Eric towels himself off. 

                                 MARY (O.S.)
                        How’s my little California boy? 
                        We’re so excited to come see you 
                        and Amy and your sister and Kevin! 

           INT. MARY AND DONALD’S HOUSE - EAST COAST - MORNING

           MARY DAVIDSON (60), short hair, well-dressed, crosses her 
           bedroom. A phone’s squeezed between her ear and shoulder. 

                                 MARY
                        Did you get the itinerary I emailed 
                        you? Three days until the big hike! 

           DONALD DAVIDSON (60), skinny, clean-shaven, and dressed in a 
           track suit, jogs in the hallway outside of their bedroom. 
           Glimpses of him appear only as he passes the doorway. 

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        Your father’s been preparing like 
                        crazy. Gym after work. Jogging 
                        nonstop. Are you exercising?
                                 DONALD
                        Make him guess how many miles I ran 
                        yesterday.

                                 MARY
                        It’s a message. He can’t guess! 

                                 DONALD
                        You already asked him a bunch of 
                        questions! 

           INT. ERIC AND AMY’S APARTMENT - EXTRA BEDROOM - MORNING

           On a desk littered with art supplies, Eric, still shirtless, 
           sketches colorful cartoonish animals similar to the ones in 
           his old office. Eric’s clearly talented.

                                 DONALD (O.S.)
                        Fourteen miles, Eric! 

                                 MARY (O.S.)
                        Fourteen miles all in here? We’ll 
                        have to replace the carpet!

                                 DONALD (O.S.)
                        Think you’ll be able to jog 
                        fourteen miles when you’re sixty? 

           Eric crumples up his sketches, dismayed, and stuffs them into 
           a teeming trash can adorned with super heroes.

           INT. MARY AND DONALD’S HOUSE - BATHROOM - MORNING

           Donald scurries past Mary into the shower. 

                                 DONALD
                        Leaving for the airport in twenty! 

                                 MARY
                        I’m ready. I’m ready. 

           Donald enters the shower. As Mary packs her bathroom items, 
           something catches her eye in Donald’s open toiletry kit. 

           A prescription of VIAGRA in Donald’s name. Mary playfully 
           cocks an eye at his silhouette in the shower. 

           INT. ERIC AND AMY’S APARTMENT - MORNING

           Eric’s girlfriend, AMY (27) a smart, attractive brunette, 
           enters in a suit with a briefcase and a bag of take-out.   
           Their furniture is a mismatched collection of Amy and Eric’s 
           styles. With his framed animated cels and her framed 
           diplomas. Suggesting a recent blend of their belongings.

                                 AMY
                        Hi! I left right after my meeting 
                        and got us breakfast! How are ya?

                                 ERIC
                        Well, I thought I found a carcinoma 
                        in my jawbone this morning. Turned 
                        out just to be a cankersore. 

           Amy rolls her eyes. His false self-diagnoses are routine. 

                                 AMY
                        What a relief. You send out your 
                        portfolio today? 

                                 ERIC
                        It’s not ready yet. 

           Amy gives him a kiss and a supportive squeeze. 

                                 AMY
                        Your illustrations are great! 

                                 ERIC
                        But once they’re out there, they’re 
                        out there. No changes. No control. 
                        Just out there. 

                                 AMY
                        But once they’re out there, other 
                        people will see how great they are. 
                        And you can get on a show. And then 
                        we can get out of this apartment!

                                 ERIC
                        I like our apartment.

                                 AMY
                        I know you do.

           They smile at each other and kiss again. 

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        Well I am excited for my first 
                        Davidson family road trip! And to 
                        finally relax and take a vay-

           Amy’s phone emits a flurry of notifications. She groans.  
                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        I gotta go back to the office. I’ll 
                        meet you at your sister’s place?

           She hurries to the door. Eric hands Amy her briefcase.

                                 ERIC
                        I love you. 

                                 AMY
                        -You, too!

           Amy’s out the door in a flash, leaving Eric standing alone 
           with the bag of take-out. His phone rings. “MOM” again. 

           INT. DULLES AIRPORT - MORNING

           Mary and Donald sit at their gate. Mary leaves another 
           rambling message on Eric’s phone. 

                                 MARY
                        Dad wants to know if they have Five 
                        Hour Energy drinks in LA. It’s a 
                        yellow bottle of raspberry liquid 
                        except it doesn’t taste like 
                        raspberries. You drink it, and I 
                        guess it gives you energy?

           INT. ERIC AND AMY’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - MORNING

           Seated on his futon, Eric eats from both boxes of food Amy 
           brought home. He rubs his back where he cut himself shaving.

                                 MARY (O.S.)
                        Dad drinks half of one when he has 
                        to go to court, but now it’s part 
                        of his exercise routine- Oh, 
                        Tessa’s calling on the other line!

                                 DONALD (O.S.)
                        There aren’t “lines” anymore, Mary.

           Eric searches ‘staph infection’ on WebMD. We see the many 
           other diseases and disorders he’s searched, “WEIRD SOUND WHEN 
           URINATING”, “CANCER FROM CHEESE?”, and “REVERSE ALOPECIA”. 

                                 MARY (O.S.)
                        You hear that, Eric? Your sister 
                        voluntarily calls us!

           Eric gawks at nauseating images of pus and staph infections 
           while chomping into a breakfast burrito.  
           INT. AIRPLANE - MORNING

           Like a Pavlovian response to the on board ‘DING’, Donald and 
           the other DC businessmen simultaneously fling open their 
           laptops. Mary reads a thick novel in the middle seat. 

           INT. ERIC’S CAR - NOON

           In an old sedan that looks destined to break down on the 405, 
           Eric navigates the obstacles of LA traffic: potholes, back 
           ups for left turns, abandoned shopping carts, and cyclists. 
           He’s familiar with the city.

           Eric parks by a nice apartment building in Santa Monica. He 
           searches ‘FOXFIELD FOREST’, grimacing at the top results: 
           “MAJOR FOX UP” and “KEEP YOUR KIDS OUT OF THIS FOREST”. 

           INT. AIRPLANE - NOON

           Donald’s attention is glued to his laptop. Mary rattles the 
           ice in her cup of diet soda. 

                                 MARY
                        Isn’t this great?

                                 DONALD
                        What’s that?

                                 MARY
                        Gathering up all the kids, and you, 
                        for another a road trip. Feels like 
                        I never see any of you anymore. 

           Donald looks at Mary. He smiles and shuts his laptop.

                                 DONALD
                        Sorry, I’ve been travelling too 
                        much recently. But, I did get you 
                        something special for the trip. 
                        Well it’s sort of for both of us. 

           He looks at Mary with a wry grin. Remembering the VIAGRA she 
           discovered that morning, Mary coyly smiles back. 

                                 MARY
                        I thought I saw something special 
                        this morning. 

                                 DONALD
                        Want me to give it to you now?
                                 MARY
                            (whispering)
                        Donald! On the plane?

                                 DONALD
                        What?

           She blushes and looks away. Donald smiles confidently.

           INT. TESSA AND KEVIN’S APARTMENT - NOON

           Eric’s sister, TESSA DAVIDSON (27), opens the door to her 
           apartment. Tessa is blonde and tiny, but with a strong 
           presence that defies her stature. 

                                 TESSA
                        Where’s Amy? 

                                 ERIC
                        She had to go back to work. And 
                        hello to you, too. 

           Eric awkwardly tugs their luggage into Tessa’s apartment. 
           Socks, old plane tickets, and a nearly empty bottle of hand 
           sanitizer tumble out of an unzipped pocket in Eric’s bag. 

                                 TESSA
                        Come on! You’re a mess!

           Tessa’s color-coordinated apartment is the opposite of 
           Eric’s. Fresh flowers and family photos adorn every surface. 

           Tessa picks up his trail of trash and stuffs it in the bin by 
           the door. Eric sees her grab the hand sanitizer. 

                                 ERIC
                        Whoa, whoa! I need that. 

           Plucking a tissue from a box, Eric wraps his hand and pulls 
           the sanitizer from the trash. He squirts some onto his palms. 

                                 TESSA
                        How can you be a hypochondriac and 
                        yet so filthy?

                                 ERIC
                        I’m an enigma, I know.

           Eric looks at a photo of Tessa and Amy. Tessa eyes her phone.

                                 TESSA
                        Mom says they’re picking up the 
                        rental car and headed here. 
           Eric picks up a framed photo of what we can tell is their 
           family many years earlier, posed on the rim of the Grand 
           Canyon. They all have sour expressions. Tessa takes it from 
           him and meticulously re-angles the frame on the shelf. 

                                 TESSA (CONT’D)
                        Amy’s worried you didn’t prepare 
                        for the Grand Canyon enough. 

           Eric points to the photo of them as kids at the Grand Canyon. 

                                 ERIC
                        I could’ve finished the hike 
                        fifteen years ago! And why is Amy 
                        even talking to you about that? 

                                 TESSA
                        That’s what happens when you date 
                        my best friend. And she’s right. 
                        The hike’s twenty-two miles in one 
                        day. You should’ve been coming to 
                        CrossFit with me and Kevin. 

                                 ERIC
                        Have you noticed that the ropes and 
                        boxes for those workouts are the 
                        same things a zoo throws in the 
                        gorilla enclosure? 

                                 TESSA
                        So you’re saying we have the 
                        physical strength of gorillas?

                                 ERIC
                        I’m saying you have the mental 
                        strength of-

           Tessa eyes her brother, knowing where his joke’s headed. 

           There’s a patterned knock at the door. Tessa jumps up and 
           checks herself in the mirror. Eric tenses up.

                                 ERIC (CONT’D)
                        Please don’t mention work. Dad 
                        doesn’t know I was fired. 

                                 TESSA
                        What? It’s been six weeks! 

                                 ERIC
                        Mom promised not to say anything 
                        until after the trip. You can too.
                                 TESSA
                        Tell him now. Get it over with!

                                 ERIC
                        No, it’ll be summers in high school 
                        all over again. He’ll wake me up at 
                        dawn to search the Classifieds for 
                        jobs. I won’t ruin this hike again. 

           Tessa’s scowl at Eric disappears as she opens the door. 

                                 TESSA
                        Mom!

           Mary pulls Tessa into a hug. Donald bursts in.

                                 DONALD
                        Three days until the Grand Canyon!

           INT. TESSA AND KEVIN’S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON

           Mary excitedly paces Tessa’s apartment, scanning the room. 
           Her attention lands on a large stack of bridal magazines. 

                                 MARY
                        The ring! How could I forget? Let 
                        me see! Let me see!

           Tessa jabs her left hand into Mary’s lap, showing off a 
           dazzling engagement ring. Mary fawns over the ring.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        It’s even more beautiful in person. 

                                 DONALD
                        That Kevin is a keeper. 

                                 TESSA
                        Yeah, Dad. That’s the whole idea. 

                                 DONALD
                        Eric, how’s work? 

           Tessa covers her face. Mary watches her son lie.

                                 ERIC
                        It’s... fine. But, you know, If I’m 
                        gonna be an illustrator, I should 
                        actually be illustrating. Maybe my 
                        position isn’t right for me.
                                 DONALD
                        Money. Making money is right for 
                        you. With the path Amy’s on at the 
                        firm, she’ll be raking it in soon. 
                        And no son of mine is gonna leech 
                        off his girlfriend. 

           Eric looks away, eager for the topic to change. Mary notices.

                                 MARY
                        Let’s have some wine!

                                 DONALD
                        It’s one o’clock. 

                                 MARY
                        It’s vacation!

                                 ERIC
                        How about two and a half hours of 
                        an energy drink?

                                 TESSA
                        Sorry, Mom. Kevin and I cut out 
                        alcohol as part of training for the 
                        hike. Not a drop for seven weeks.

                                 DONALD
                        I love that dedication! 

                                 TESSA
                        Although I think Kevin is hoping 
                        it’s a sign that I’m pregnant.

           On opposite sides of the room, Donald and Mary turn to Tessa. 

                                 TESSA (CONT’D)
                        Which I’m not!

           Donald examines the back packs, boots, walking sticks, and 
           other hiking gear that’s resting by the front door. 

                                 DONALD
                        Eric, how have you trained?

                                 ERIC
                        People hike the Grand Canyon all 
                        the time. I’m people. I’ll be fine. 

           Donald looks at him dismissively.
                                 TESSA
                        Just because you’ve kept dressing 
                        like a teenager for the last ten 
                        years, it doesn’t mean you still 
                        have the endurance of one.

           Eric fakes being hurt. Donald leaps up off the couch.

                                 DONALD
                        Time to pack up! Let’s go!

           EXT. PARKING LOT - AFTERNOON

           Donald stacks luggage and hiking gear into the back of the 
           bright red minivan they’ve rented for the trip. He pulls out 
           bags and rearranges them to maximize space. Every Dad’s 
           favorite game of Tetris.

           Tessa’ fiancee KEVIN (27), a thin, aging hipster, has joined 
           the group and helps Tessa carry luggage.

           Donald pulls Eric aside and takes a check from his wallet.

                                 ERIC
                        Dad, I don’t need-

                                 DONALD
                        Just don’t tell your mother. I 
                        promised I’d be harder on you.

                                 ERIC
                        Thank you. This means a lot. 

           Donald looks at him sternly. 

                                 DONALD
                        It’s money. It is a lot.

           Amy hurries to the car from around the corner.

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        There she is!

                                 AMY
                        Sorry I’m late! Great to see you!

           She hugs them all. As Amy is about to join Eric in middle row 
           for the drive, Tessa intervenes. 

                                 TESSA
                        You get to spend every night with 
                        Amy. I’m stealing her back. Kevin, 
                        climb up there with Eric. 
           Kevin presses against Eric, giving him an exaggerated smile. 

                                 KEVIN
                        Hey, brother! 

                                 ERIC
                        We’re not brothers. 

                                 KEVIN
                        We’re gonna be!

           Eric squeezes the rest of his hand sanitizer into his palm. 

           INT. RENTAL CAR - EARLY AFTERNOON - TRAVELING

           And they’re off! They speed up a major highway north of Los 
           Angeles. Eric unfolds a tattered road map. 

                                 ERIC
                        Is this the same map from our first 
                        drive to the Grand Canyon?

                                 DONALD
                        Yep! I highlighted the route for 
                        the whole trip. Today through 
                        Sequoia Park. Tomorrow into Death 
                        Valley. Then a quick-as-possible 
                        stay at your aunt’s house. And 
                        finally onto the Grand Canyon!

                                 AMY
                        Why didn’t you guys do the hike the 
                        first time you drove out here?

                                 ERIC
                        We planned to, but once we got to 
                        the Rim, Mom forbid it because she 
                        didn’t believe we could finish. 

                                 MARY
                        And they’ve constantly reminded me 
                        for fifteen years. Like they’re 
                        committed to proving me wrong. 

                                 DONALD
                        It’s not about proving you wrong-

           Donald clarifies in a tone that does prove her wrong. 

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        It’s proving what this family can 
                        do together! 
                                 MARY
                        The hike is dangerous! The kids 
                        were way too young.

                                 DONALD
                        Well, no excuses this time.

           Eric drops the map on the floor. Donald notices. 

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        Hey! The directions!

                                 ERIC
                        I’ll just use my phone.

                                 DONALD
                        But I taught you how to navigate 
                        with real maps. If you let your 
                        phone do all the work, you’ll be 
                        dependent on that thing. 

                                 ERIC
                        Yet for the last fifteen years, you 
                        felt obligated to keep a two dollar 
                        map for a state you don’t even live 
                        in? That sounds really independent. 

           INT. RENTAL CAR - AFTERNOON - TRAVELING 

           The minivan shoots up the 5 highway. The sweeping hills and 
           desert vistas north of LA become wooded and green. Mary turns 
           away from the landscape to her kids in the backseat.

                                 MARY
                        California has stolen all of you 
                        away from me, huh?

                                 TESSA
                        We didn’t move to get away from 
                        you. We came for school and work. 

                                 MARY
                        You could teach back home. There’s  
                        great schools in the suburbs.

                                 TESSA
                        Don’t act like we’re the first ever 
                        deserters. You and Dad moved away 
                        from your home town.

                                 MARY
                        We grew up in the middle of 
                        nowhere.

                                 MARY (CONT'D)
                        Either you left as soon as 
                        possible, or you sank in forever. 
                        DC has options.

                                 TESSA
                        DC has politics, humidity, and 
                        everyone I went to high school 
                        with. California is great! 

                                 MARY
                        I lived in California once, you 
                        know.

                                 TESSA
                        No you didn’t. When?

                                 MARY
                        I waited tables for a summer at my 
                        cousin’s restaurant in San Diego, 
                        when your father was in law school. 

                                 TESSA
                        How could I not know this?

                                 MARY
                        Oh, everyone has their secrets.

           Mary looks away from the backseat and eyes Donald. He’s 
           focused on the road and doesn’t notice her gaze.

           EXT. RURAL GAS STATION - AFTERNOON

           The minivan pulls into a gas station. Everyone exits the car, 
           stretching and heading inside as Donald fuels up. 

           INT. RURAL GAS STATION - AFTERNOON

           Tessa, Mary, and Amy wander the aisles of the gas station 
           store. Mary pulls a large diet soda from a fridge. 

                                 MARY
                        How are your students?

                                 TESSA
                        Summer vacation is around the 
                        corner. The heat’s kicking in. The 
                        hormones are kicking in. God, the 
                        kids smell awful. 

                                 AMY
                        Do you miss teaching, Mary?
                                 MARY
                        I like improvising my days. But 
                        Donald’s still so busy. Sometimes I 
                        wonder why I retired just to be by 
                        myself. I do miss the kids. The 
                        daily reminders to look at things 
                        from another perspective. 

           Mary stares into space. 

                                 TESSA
                        A fourth grader called me a MILF 
                        yesterday. 

                                 MARY
                        What did you do?

                                 TESSA
                        I took him to the principal’s 
                        office, and then I took my birth 
                        control. 

           Mary smiles as they stroll down the aisle.

                                 MARY
                        Oh look-

           Mary pulls three Three Musketeers bars from the shelf. 

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        Remember when I’d visit you two and 
                        I’d bring boxes of these for us?!? 

           Tessa rolls her eyes. Amy smiles.

                                 TESSA
                        Come on, Mom. That was cheesy back 
                        then. You know how much sugar is in 
                        one of these?

           Deflated, Mary puts the candy bars back on the shelf.

                                 MARY
                        Fine. Too mature to eat chocolate 
                        with your poor mother. I get it. 

                                 TESSA
                        They’re snacks, Mom. Don’t get 
                        wistful about snacks. 

           Amy reaches around Tessa and grabs a couple of the bars.

                                 AMY
                        I’ll have one with you, Mary. 
                                 MARY
                        Well thank you! Glad someone’s 
                        still willing to have fun. 

           Mary and Amy walk ahead to the register. Amy winks at Tessa.

           EXT. RURAL GAS STATION - AFTERNOON

           Everyone waits outside of the locked car. Donald hurries back 
           with a bag of his own snacks. 

                                 DONALD
                        Who wants a pickle?

                                 ERIC
                        Dad! Not the pickle jar. 

                                 DONALD
                        We’re already behind schedule.

                                 KEVIN
                        What? I’ll take a pickle.

           Kevin claws one from the jar and mocks wiping the juice on 
           Eric. Donald takes two pickles and chomps into them. 

                                 DONALD
                        No? Nobody else? OK, time to get 
                        back on the road! 

           Donald upends the jar, dumping the remaining pickles into a 
           trash can. Mary appears from the other side of the car. 

                                 MARY
                        Donald, we’re not doing the pickle 
                        jar. If someone needs to stop for a 
                        bathroom, we’ll stop. 

           Mary gives Donald a sneer that no one would dare argue with. 
           A puddle of yellow pickle juice sloshes around the bottom of 
           the jar. Donald drops it into the trash.  

           INT. RENTAL CAR - AFTERNOON - TRAVELING 

           Driving up a smaller country road escalating in altitude, the 
           surrounding landscape is vibrantly green. 

                                 DONALD
                        Eric, we saw your buddy Dougie 
                        Anderson at the mall the other day. 
                                 ERIC
                        He’s not my buddy, Dad. We were on 
                        the same baseball team when we 
                        were, like, twelve. 

                                 DONALD
                        And he went on to be the star of 
                        your school. Scholarship to 
                        Virginia Tech. Almost made it all 
                        the way to the majors. And you were 
                        his back-up! With more persistence, 
                        that could’ve been you. 

                                 ERIC
                        I could’ve been my own back up?

                                 DONALD
                        You had talent! You were an amazing 
                        bunter! Who knows where you’d be if 
                        you had Dougie’s dedication. 

                                 MARY
                        That’s enough, Donald. 

           Mary puts up a hand in protest of Donald’s pestering. 

                                 DONALD
                        What’s Dougie up to these days?

                                 ERIC
                        Let’s see, last time I saw Ol’ 
                        Dougie, he was getting kicked out 
                        of our high school reunion for 
                        snorting coke in the handicap 
                        bathroom stall. 

                                 DONALD
                        That doesn’t sound like Dougie. 

                                 ERIC
                        I don’t know, Dad. He was really 
                        dedicated to the coke. 

                                 DONALD
                        Still. One hell of a shortstop. 

           Eric shrugs, eager for the approval Donald shows a stranger. 

           INT. RENTAL CAR - AFTERNOON - TRAVELING 

           The kids in the backseat are glued to their windows, watching 
           the dense parkland develop. It’s violently green compared to 
           the dying palm trees and concrete they are used to in LA. 
                                 MARY
                        DONALD!

           A group of elk darts across the road right in front of them. 
           Donald slams on the brakes. The car skids to a stop. 

           Mary flings an arm across Donald’s chest. An instinct to 
           protect. She pulls it back as the adrenaline subsides. 

                                 DONALD
                        Sorry. Sorry, everyone!

                                 MARY
                        Pull over if you want to look 
                        around. We’ll wait. 

                                 DONALD
                        We’re on a tight schedule. 

                                 MARY
                        Well, getting all of us killed is 
                        going to disrupt the...

           Mary looks up. The large bull elk stands frozen in the center 
           of the road. Its regal antlers loom in front of the minivan. 

                                 KEVIN
                        Why isn’t it moving?

                                 TESSA
                        The same reason we aren’t moving.

                                 ERIC
                        I feel like we’re in a diorama at 
                        the Natural History Museum. 

           Everyone’s fixated on the large male. But Mary eyes the 
           cluster of smaller elk at the forest’s edge.

                                 MARY
                        It’s a whole family of them. 

           Donald inches the minivan around the male and drives off.

                                 ERIC
                        It’s a gang. 

                                 AMY
                        What?

                                 ERIC
                        A group of elk is called a gang of 
                        elk. Or a herd.  
                                 TESSA
                        How do you know that?

                                 ERIC
                        From my show. I had to learn all 
                        the collective names for animals. 
                        They’re crazy. A Gang of Elk. A 
                        Congress of Salamanders. A Kettle 
                        of Vultures. A Business of Ferrets. 
                        They all sound so made up. 

                                 KEVIN
                        Every word was made up by somebody. 

                                 ERIC
                        Thank you for that insightful 
                        addition, Kevin. 

                                 KEVIN
                        The names should at least have to 
                        rhyme. Like... a shelf of elk. 

                                 ERIC
                        You’re off to a great start. 

                                 TESSA
                        How come only animals get special 
                        treatment? Why not other words?

           Mary stares forward with a hand on her brow.

                                 MARY
                        Pillows of Exhaustion. 

           Everyone in the car thinks for a second, and offers their own 
           addition to the new group names, working around the backseat. 

                                 ERIC
                        A Trash Can of Illustrations. 

                                 KEVIN
                        An Embrace of Brothers!

           Kevin reaches to the back seat and wraps Eric in a showy hug. 
           Eric wriggles free with mock disgust. 

                                 TESSA
                        A Road Trip of Egos. 

                                 DONALD
                        A Family of Davidsons!

           Eric and Tessa turn to Amy. She struggles to take part.
                                 AMY
                        I don’t know... 

                                 TESSA
                        Come on!

                                 ERIC
                        It can be anything. 

                                 AMY
                        Uhh... Ecstasy of Pizzas. 

                                 DONALD
                        Good one!

           Surrounded by his family, Donald beams a wide grin.

           INT. RENTAL CAR - SEQUOIA NATIONAL FOREST - AFTERNOON

           The minivan putters by the entrance to Sequoia National 
           Forest. Donald collects a brochure from the ranger. 

                                 ERIC
                        So this is the first of three 
                        National Parks? Sequoia, Death 
                        Valley, and Grand Canyon?

           Kevin turns around from the middle seat.

                                 KEVIN
                        Actually we’re not in Sequoia 
                        National Park yet. This is Sequoia 
                        National Forest. 

                                 ERIC
                        You know, just because you’re 
                        marrying Tessa doesn’t mean you 
                        have to adopt her obsession with 
                        every nit-picky detail. 

                                 KEVIN
                        Just reciting the brochure!

           INT. RENTAL CAR - SEQUOIA NATIONAL FOREST - LATER

           A sweeping landscape of lush hills unfolds before them. 
           Donald aligns the car so that a sign describing the view is 
           in front of Mary. She reads it aloud with no prompting.

                                 MARY
                        “Sequoia tree rings tell a story of 
                        survival and adaptation. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MARY (CONT'D)
                        Cross-sections don’t reveal a 
                        perfect array of concentric growth 
                        rings. There are scars, indicating 
                        fire damage or drought, and warped 
                        rings, growth on top of the scars.”

           Donald cranes his neck to scope the views. As soon as Mary 
           stops reading, he shifts the car into gear and drives off. 

           EXT. SEQUOIA NATIONAL PARK - LATE AFTERNOON 

           Donald parks near an area populated with the massive Sequoia 
           trees. The family walks by two frazzled parents struggling 
           with their young son and daughter. The girl sneaks a punch on 
           her brother when the parents aren’t looking. Tessa smiles.

                                 KEVIN
                        That’s gonna be us!

           Kevin wraps an arm around Tessa. She’s confused.

                                 TESSA
                        The brother and sister?

                                 KEVIN
                        What? The parents. Toting around a 
                        carload of kids.

           Kevin smiles at the parents and walks ahead. 

                                 MARY
                        He’s really eager for kids, huh?

           Tessa warily nods. 

                                 TESSA
                        Kids make you so... accountable. 
                        You can’t mess up anymore.

                                 MARY
                        Well I’ll take that as a compliment 
                        to our parenting, but it’s 
                        certainly not true. 

           Mary and Tessa join the others on short path leading into the 
           forest. The trees dwarf everything in sight. 

                                 DONALD
                        Race you to the top of that rock!

           Eric and Donald sprint toward a large boulder. Eric struggles 
           to get a foothold as Donald steadily scales the other side.
                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        Can’t keep up, huh? Hope this is no 
                        indication of how much you’re gonna 
                        struggle on the Grand Canyon hike!

           Eric follows Donald’s path up the rock. Donald tugs him up 
           over the edge. Eric heaves deep breaths as they gaze into the 
           lush forest.

                                 ERIC
                        Remember how I had sports-induced 
                        asthma as a kid. And then in high 
                        school, a deviated septum? Do you 
                        think I’m working up the ladder? 
                        Like, lung cancer is next?

                                 DONALD
                        That surgery repaired your septum. 
                        We re-viated it. You’re fine. 

                                 ERIC
                        Yeah. For now.

           Eric keeps breathing heavy.

           EXT. SEQUOIA NATIONAL PARK - LATE AFTERNOON 

           Tessa, Amy, and Mary convene around a trunk of a massive 
           Sequoia tree. Some of the thick trees are thousands of years 
           old, majestically sky-rocketing hundreds of feet straight up. 

                                 AMY
                        It makes you feel so small. 

           Mary strolls the long path around the trunk’s circumference. 

                                 MARY
                        Certainly humbling standing before 
                        something so massive and stoic. 

           Mary braces herself against the trunk, her fingers digging 
           into the bark’s wide grooves. She stares up, the trees 
           seemingly recede into infinity. 

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        But it’s also empowering, almost 
                        supernatural. Touching something 
                        that’s been alive for a thousand 
                        years. It’s like time travel. Or 
                        taking Communion.
                                 AMY
                        Inconsequential or miraculous. 
                        Tough to know how to interpret it.

                                 MARY
                        I’m right on the edge. 

           Mary strolls away, further into the forest. 

                                 TESSA
                        She’s acting weird. 

                                 AMY
                        I think she’s just a little lonely. 
                        But it’s tough for me to tell. 

                                 TESSA
                        What do you mean?

                                 AMY
                        Well in college she felt like a big 
                        sister, but ever since Eric and I 
                        have been together, it’s like she 
                        reverted me back to that confused 
                        eighteen year old who was assigned 
                        to your dorm room.  

                                 TESSA
                        Oh you’re inventing that. 

                                 AMY
                        I’m not! It’s like I’m a threat to 
                        your family. So I have to be 
                        aggressively nice to compensate. 
                        It’s exhausting. 

                                 TESSA
                        She’s just afraid anyone Eric and I 
                        see is gonna take us from her. 

                                 AMY
                        But Eric and I are just dating. I 
                        get enough tension with my family. 
                        I don’t need it around yours.

           INT. RENTAL CAR - SEQUOIA NATIONAL FOREST - SUNSET 

           The setting sun makes the woodlands glow. Everyone in the car 
           sits in hushed reverence as the forest fades to black. Theirs 
           are the only headlights on the road. 

           On the center console, Donald’s phone dings with a message. 
                                 MARY
                        I thought you told the office not 
                        to bother you this week. 

                                 DONALD
                        I did. 

           Donald reads the text and tucks the phone away in the 
           compartment in his door. He gives an exaggerated shrug.  

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        You know they never listen. 

           Donald stares ahead and reaches a hand to Mary’s thigh. 

           INT. RESTAURANT - TABLE - NIGHT

           The family’s pulled over at a nice restaurant. Eric’s the 
           last to place his order. 

                                 ERIC
                        The venison, please. Medium-rare. 

                                 AMY
                        Venison? That’s pretty far down the 
                        menu, huh? 

                                 ERIC
                        What do you mean?

           Amy looks away from him, wishing she hadn’t said anything.

                                 AMY
                        It’s just... haven’t you noticed 
                        when we go out to dinner you always 
                        order the second item on a menu?

                                 ERIC
                        It’s always where they put chicken. 
                        I like chicken- if I feel good 
                        about the odds against salmonella. 

                                 AMY
                        And you’re just trying something 
                        new tonight? OK. That’s great! 

           Eric looks confused. Amy turns to the rest of the table. 

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        Donald, I missed you at the 
                        conference in Denver last week. Did 
                        you get stuck in DC?
                                 MARY
                        Donald went to Denver. 

                                 DONALD
                        Yeah, I went. I was stuck in my 
                        hotel the whole time hammering out 
                        the details on that Peterson case. 

                                 AMY
                        Which case?

           Shielding herself with her glass of wine, Mary suspiciously 
           eyes Donald. Donald waves off Amy’s questions. 

                                 DONALD
                        Peterson. Only a DC deal. But that 
                        reminds me, we’ve been paying close 
                        attention to your great work. Would 
                        you ever consider making the move 
                        to join us at the head office?

                                 AMY
                        Really? I’d jump at the chance!

           Amy’s eyes light up with mention of the job opportunity.  

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        But LA has become a second home. 
                        Tessa and my college friends are 
                        there. Eric expects to stay there.  

                                 DONALD
                        Right. The drawing. 

           Eric stares at his dad, hurt by Donald’s flippancy.

                                 MARY
                        Eric, you haven’t sent me any of 
                        your work lately. 

                                 ERIC
                        I can’t finish anything.  

                                 AMY
                        His illustrations are great! I have 
                        some hanging in my office. 

                                 DONALD
                        Isn’t it fantastic that we get to 
                        relive this family road trip, with 
                        two great new members! Raise your 
                        wine, your waters, your whatever, 
                        and cheers to the Grand Canyon! 
           Everyone clinks their glasses and drinks up. 

           INT. RENTAL CAR - NIGHT - TRAVELING 

           Eric and Amy are asleep in the back row. Tessa leans forward 
           in her seat, talking to Mary about her wedding planning.

                                 TESSA
                        I’m considering infinity signs with 
                        our names as the logo for our Save 
                        The Date cards. I know it’s kind of 
                        cliché, but infinity is what it’s 
                        all about, right? Together forever. 

           Mary nods. The long day of travel is catching up with her. 

                                 TESSA (CONT’D)
                        What did you guys have on your Save 
                        The Dates? Mom?

                                 MARY
                        We didn’t have any. I don’t think 
                        we even had invitations. I remember 
                        calling our families on the phone.

           The minivan pulls into a parking lot for a chain hotel.

                                 TESSA
                        How could that be?

                                 MARY
                        We didn’t have any money. Things 
                        have changed, sweetie. 

                                 DONALD
                        But that doesn’t mean your mother 
                        and I aren’t together for infinity! 

           EXT. HOTEL PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           Eric, Donald, and Mary take luggage from the back of the car. 
           Two attractive blondes walk by. Donald nudges Eric. 

                                 DONALD
                        I see why you like California! 

           Mary sees Donald gives the girls a wide smile and a wink. 
           Eric, Amy, Tessa, and Kevin head inside the hotel. 

           From their carry-on bag Mary pulls out an electric toothbrush 
           still in its box. She doesn’t recognize it. 
                                 MARY
                        What is this?

           Donald’s smile widens.

                                 DONALD
                        Your own electric toothbrush! It’s 
                        your present! Well, our present.

                                 MARY
                        Wait. An electric toothbrush? 
                        That’s the present to both of us?

                                 DONALD
                        Because you kept getting annoyed at 
                        me when I’d take the other one when 
                        I traveled. What? No good?

           Mary stares at the toothbrush. She’s processing the long day. 
           Her grip tightens on the box. Her face sinks. 

                                 MARY
                        You’re doing it again. 

                                 DONALD
                        What?

           Mary covers her face with her hands. She can’t believe it. 

                                 MARY
                        You didn’t go to Denver, did you?

                                 DONALD
                        What are you talking about?

                                 MARY
                        You have a prescription for Viagra 
                        which you’re not home enough to 
                        use. And your gift to me is a 
                        fucking toothbrush?

                                 DONALD
                        Where’d you see Viagra?

           Mary staggers back. Her color flees her cheeks. 

                                 MARY
                        How dumb can I be? I thought the 
                        prescription was for us. But of 
                        course. I can’t believe you’re 
                        doing it again. 

           Mary rushes to the driver’s seat. Donald hurries after her.
                                 DONALD
                        Doing what, Mary? What’s wrong?

           Mary unlocks his phone and opens the messages. Her face 
           sinks. Her bloodshot eyes frantically dart. She squirms away.

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        No, Mary! What are you doing?

           INT. HOTEL - LOBBY - NIGHT

           The kids are huddled inside the lobby, surrounded by their 
           luggage as they wait for their parents to check in.  

           The lobby’s automatic doors whoosh open. Mary enters with 
           tears filling her eyes. The doors open again and Donald races 
           in after her. Mary sees the kids and shrieks.

                                 MARY
                        We’re getting a divorce!

           No one moves. Donald’s face sinks. Bags fall from his arms. 

                                 TESSA
                        What the hell is going on?

                                 MARY
                        He’s seeing another woman! He was 
                        going to leave us.

                                 ERIC
                        What other woman? Dad?

           Mary bee-lines past them, pushing through the door to the 
           stairs. Everyone else spins to Donald, who is motionless.

           Beyond them, a group of kids and parents stand in wet bathing 
           suits, on their way from the pool to the elevators. Other 
           hotel guests stand agape. Smooth jazz trickles out of the 
           speakers, the only sound in the lobby. 

           INT. HOTEL STAIRWELL - NIGHT 

           Mary’s lumped on the stairwell’s bottom step with her head 
           buried in her hands, crying and shaking with anger. Tessa, 
           pale and wide-eyed, rubs her mom’s back. 

           The stairwell’s halogen lights buzz and beam down on Mary as 
           if she’s confessing in a police interrogation.
                                 MARY
                        He was texting her all day. In the 
                        car. With us. No wonder he’s been 
                        traveling so much. God I’m dumb!

                                 TESSA
                        Mom. Don’t. 

                                 MARY
                        The messages just kept going!

           Mary gestures scrolling through texts with a trembling hand. 

                                 TESSA
                        Do you know who she is? 

           Mary shrugs and leans against Tessa for support. 

                                 MARY
                        Her contact info had an email 
                        address from the firm. Some summer 
                        intern, probably.

                                 TESSA
                        Do you remember her name?

                                 MARY
                        Liz McKenzie. 

                                 TESSA
                        What a stupid name.

           Tessa attacks her phone. Mary covers her face in her arms. 

                                 MARY
                        He sent her so many messages. He 
                        used those fucking smiley face 
                        things!

                                 TESSA
                        I’m checking the firm’s site. Here 
                        she is! Shit. She’s... old. 

           Tessa shows Mary the picture of a woman in her 60s.

                                 MARY
                        She’s my age. 

                                 TESSA
                        Yeah... 

           Mary glares at her daughter. 
                                 TESSA (CONT’D)
                        Do you know her? Have you met her?

           Mary re-examines the picture.

                                 MARY
                        Yes. Christ, you’ve met her. 
                        Remember last year at that banquet 
                        for Dad? She was there when he got 
                        that award. They give him awards. 

           INT. DONALD’S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Eric sits in the corner, white-knuckling the armrests of a 
           chair. There’s no eye contact. The TV flickers next to him.

           Donald extracts two tiny bottles of Scotch from the mini bar. 
           He empties them into two glasses and hands one to Eric. 

           Donald sits back down on one of the queen beds. After an 
           intense silence, he motions to the TV with his glass.

                                 DONALD
                        The Dodgers look good this year. 

                                 ERIC
                        Yeah... Bullpen needs another 
                        lefty... but playoffs probably. 

                                 DONALD
                        Good. Playoffs are good. 

           Donald and Eric eagerly gulp their Scotch. Eric grabs two 
           more bottles from the mini bar and chugs both. 

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        I didn’t expect this, you know. We 
                        worked together on a case and... 
                        she’s a lovely woman. You’d really 
                        like her. Whip-smart. Funny.

                                 ERIC
                        Shit, Dad! Don’t tell me about her. 

           Donald gulps his Scotch. They both look glassy-eyed.  

                                 DONALD
                        We shouldn’t over do it. Don’t want 
                        this stuff lingering in our system. 
                        Dehydrating us for the Canyon hike. 

                                 ERIC
                        We’re not gonna do the hike, Dad. 
                                 DONALD
                        But we have reservations. 

           Donald can barely look up. Repercussions haven’t sunk in. 

           INT. HOTEL STAIRWELL - NIGHT 

           Kevin inches into the stairwell. He holds their overnight 
           bags and some of their hiking gear. 

                                 KEVIN
                        Hi... how are you? Is that a dumb 
                        question?

                                 MARY
                        I’m not sure how I am. Sorry that 
                        you’re marrying into such a mess. 

                                 KEVIN
                        Are you kidding? My family’s really 
                        fucked up. You’ll fit right in.

                                 TESSA
                        Kevin!

                                 MARY
                        That’s oddly sweet. Thank you. 

           Tessa sits side by side with her Mom on the bottom stair. 

                                 TESSA
                        So what do we do now? 

                                 MARY
                        I don’t know what to do with the 
                        next few days, let alone the next 
                        few years. 

           Mary sighs, conceding control of the moment. Tessa pounces.

                                 TESSA
                        Let’s go to Aunt June’s house like 
                        planned. Just you and me. Unwind. 

                                 MARY
                        But this was supposed to be a 
                        family trip. Our last trip.

                                 TESSA
                        But you should have some space. 

           Mary rises off the stairs. 
                                 MARY
                        No. I’ve had enough space. All I’ve 
                        had recently is space. Everyone’s 
                        off doing their own thing, and I’m 
                        alone at home, stuck with space. 

           Mary fixates on Kevin’s hiking gear.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        We’ve all wanted to go back to the 
                        Grand Canyon for fifteen years. 
                        You’ve trained. You’ve dieted. I 
                        won’t be blamed for cancelling this 
                        hike again. I won’t be the victim 
                        and the victimizer in all this. 

                                 KEVIN
                        No, it’s fine. Really. 

                                 TESSA
                        We’re not gonna go. That’s crazy!

           Mary’s determined. She won’t lose anymore control.

                                 MARY
                        We’re still gonna go. 

                                 TESSA
                        Let’s talk about this tomorrow.

                                 MARY
                        You can talk about it all you want 
                        tomorrow. We’re still going.

                                 TESSA
                        So Dad stays here?

                                 MARY
                        No. No, he’ll come. He trained and 
                        prepared, too. This is it. This is 
                        our last family trip. I know it’ll 
                        be weird. It’s weirdest for me.  

                                 TESSA
                        Mom, it won’t be weird. It will be 
                        unbearable. Are we supposed to 
                        pretend like nothing happened? 

                                 MARY
                        No, you can be angry. Lord knows 
                        I’ll be angry. 
                                 KEVIN
                        A car full of passive-aggression? 
                        This sounds exactly like one of my 
                        family vacations. 

           INT. DONALD’S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           There’s a knock at the door. Eric picks himself out of his 
           chair, wobbling from the Scotch. Amy enters. 

                                 DONALD
                        There she is! How are you?

           Donald gives her an awkward hug. Amy’s resistant to Donald’s 
           touch but tries not to show it. She eyes Eric. 

                                 AMY
                        Tessa wants to talk downstairs.

           Eric quickly follows her to escape the room. 

           INT. HOTEL - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           Eric crumples against the wall as they wait for the elevator. 

                                 AMY
                        What the hell? He’s so normal. 

                                 ERIC
                        My dad is the king of pretending 
                        everything is OK. Wish I inherited 
                        that trait. I searched ‘panic 
                        attacks’ and the symptoms are way 
                        tamer than what I’m feeling.

                                 AMY
                        I’m so sorry.

                                 ERIC
                        Why did she have to tell us in a 
                        fucking hotel lobby?

                                 AMY
                        I know. I know. 

                                 ERIC
                        Promise this will never be us. 

                                 AMY
                        Of course not. We’re dating. We get 
                        to stay happy. 
           Eric looks sideways at Amy but doesn’t press the issue.

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        Since when do you drink Scotch?

                                 ERIC
                        It’s my dad’s Bad News Scotch. For 
                        whenever he lost in court, or if we 
                        broke a bone, or when the Orioles 
                        missed the playoffs. 

                                 AMY
                        We better stock up for the rest of 
                        the trip.

           INT. HOTEL - INDOOR POOL - NIGHT

           Tessa, Eric, Amy, and Kevin stand around the indoor pool. The 
           underwater lights shine up, painting the room an eerie teal. 

                                 TESSA
                        Mom wants to finish the trip. The 
                        drive. The Canyon. The hike. 

                                 ERIC
                        What? You’re kidding.

                                 AMY
                        Do we all get a vote in this?

                                 TESSA
                        I don’t know how this is gonna 
                        work. But she needs us.

           They glance at each other. No one knows what to expect.

                                 ERIC
                        Fuck!

           His scream echoes around the dark, cavernous room, clashing 
           with the tranquility of the still blue water. 

                                 ERIC (CONT’D)
                        I knew it! I knew something bad was 
                        going to happen to me. I assumed 
                        it’d be some multisyllabic fatal 
                        disorder. Not di-vorce. 

           Eric’s enunciation highlights divorce’s two syllables. 

                                 TESSA
                        How can you make this about you?
                                 ERIC
                        I’m not! Mom knows how much this 
                        trip means to us. She could’ve 
                        waited to tell us or something.

                                 TESSA
                        Are you seriously blaming her? Dad 
                        was fucking around. This is all on 
                        him. Talk some sense into him, Amy. 

                                 ERIC
                        Amy’s on my side.

           Tessa and Eric spin towards Amy. She stands in between them, 
           torn between her best friend and her boyfriend. 

                                 AMY
                        You’re not on different sides. 
                        You’re both angry. 

                                 KEVIN
                        Let’s get to bed, guys.

                                 TESSA
                        Christ! How do we even do that?

                                 AMY
                        Let your mom have her room. Tessa 
                        and I will split one. You guys OK 
                        bunking with your dad?

           Eric reluctantly nods. Kevin walks over to him and puts an 
           arm on Eric’s shoulder. Eric wriggles out from under it. 

           INT. DONALD’S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Eric and Kevin enter the dark hotel room they’re sharing with 
           Donald. Instantly they’re smacked by Donald’s loud snoring. 

                                 KEVIN
                        How was he able to sleep with two 
                        women when he sounds like that?

           They change clothes and climb into the room’s other tiny 
           queen bed. Donald continues to produce a barrage of snores. 

                                 ERIC
                        Shut up!

                                 KEVIN
                        Me or your dad?
                                 ERIC
                        Both of you!

           Eric kicks at the covers. Kevin pulls back for the blanket. 

                                 KEVIN
                        By the way, I snore too. 

           Kevin’s snoring fills Donald’s gaps. Noise is constant. 

           Eric scrambles out of bed with a blanket and a pillow. He 
           takes them to the bathroom and lies down in the tub. 

           INT. MARY’S HOTEL ROOM - BATHROOM - NIGHT

           Mary stands in the shower. The steaming water pelts her, 
           turning her chest a fiery red. She pulls her wet hair back 
           and leans against the shower’s plastic basin for support. 

           INT. TESSA AND AMY’S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Amy exits the bathroom and joins Tessa on the bed. Tessa sits 
           on the bed’s edge, staring into space.

                                 AMY
                        How ya doing?

                                 TESSA
                        Did you ever play that game MASH as 
                        a kid? To predict your home and 
                        husband and stuff?

                                 AMY
                        Mansion. Apartment. Shack. House. 
                        Yeah, we’d play at recess a lot. 

                                 TESSA
                        It’s not like I thought the 
                        predictions were gonna come true, 
                        but I remember the future feeling 
                        stable back then. Like if you got 
                        the house, you kept the house. If 
                        the game matched you with the nerd, 
                        the nerd didn’t cheat on you. 
                        Whatever you got is what you kept.

           Amy shakes her head. 

                                 AMY
                        No, I kept playing until I got the 
                        exact future I wanted. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 AMY (CONT'D)
                        I knew things could change because 
                        of my parents. I went from a nice 
                        house to splitting two tiny 
                        apartments. So now I’m working for 
                        my mansion. 

                                 TESSA
                        At least you never got the shack.

                                 AMY
                        No shack. Although, sometimes 
                        living with your brother...

           Tessa envelops Amy in an big hug and turns out the lights. 

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - MORNING

           Donald slides open the drab curtains. Sunlight spills into 
           the room. Yesterday’s lush forests have been replaced by the 
           desert’s gray ocher, as if everything’s turned to stone. 

           Donald opens the bathroom door. Eric sits in the tub, groggy.  

                                 DONALD
                        Good morning.

                                 ERIC
                        I doubt that. 

           EXT. HOTEL - PARKING LOT - MORNING 

           The steady sound of suitcase wheels rolling over the bumpy 
           gravel parking lot. Mary stares forward, doing her best to 
           appear unaffected as she leads her bag to the car. 

           She passes her kids loading up the car and meets Donald 
           behind the minivan. 

                                 MARY
                        Let’s get one thing straight. This 
                        is in no way a sign of acceptance 
                        of what you’ve done. As far as 
                        anger and embarrassment go, we are 
                        at the tip of my fucking iceberg. 
                        So I’m gonna ride back here with my 
                        family while we still have it. 

           Donald slowly nods. 

                                 DONALD
                        I got you a soda. 
           Mary rips the bottle of diet soda from his hand. 

                                 MARY
                        Well that makes up for everything!

           Mary climbs into the backseat with Tessa. Eric and Amy take 
           the middle seat. Kevin takes the passenger next to Donald. No 
           one speaks. Eric eyes Tessa, unsure how to proceed. 

                                 DONALD
                            (meekly)
                        Two days until the Grand Canyon. 

           EXT. DEATH VALLEY NATIONAL PARK - MORNING

           The minivan speeds by the entrance to Death Valley National 
           Park. The terrain lives up to the park’s name. Spires of 
           black mountains loom. Heat emanates off the cracked desert. 

           Donald pulls into a scenic overlook and positions the car so 
           an informative sign sits in front of Mary in the backseat.  

           After moments of idling, Donald turns around from the 
           driver’s seat and looks at Mary. 

                                 DONALD
                        You’re not gonna read it?

                                 MARY
                        No, I’m not gonna read it!

                                 TESSA
                        Dad! What are you doing? 

                                 DONALD
                        Should I get out of the car so you 
                        can read it to everyone but me? Is 
                        that what you want?

           When Mary doesn’t respond, Donald exits the minivan and 
           stomps around the car to read the sign. Mary reads the sign.

                                 MARY
                        “Although the expansive lands 
                        before you appear barren, a variety 
                        of life teems within Death 
                        Valley...”

                                 ERIC
                        Mom, none of us care what it says. 

           Donald dramatically stares into the distance and re-enters. 
                                 DONALD
                        It’s teeming with life out there. 

           INT. RENTAL CAR - NOON - TRAVELING

           Everyone stares out the windows at the breathtaking deserts 
           of Death Valley. Kevin reads National Park brochures.

                                 KEVIN
                        This Grand Canyon brochure 
                        specifically says not to hike from 
                        one Rim to the other Rim all in one 
                        day. Should that concern us?

                                 DONALD
                        No, they just have to write that in 
                        the brochure because there was a 
                        good lawyer involved at some point. 

                                 TESSA
                        By ‘good’ lawyer, do you mean one 
                        who wins lots of cases in court, or 
                        one who doesn’t cheat on his wife?

                                 MARY
                        Hey. Relax. 

                                 TESSA
                        What? Why are you defending him?

                                 MARY
                        I’m not defending him. I’m 
                        defending the silence we had before 
                        right now. I’m defending my desire 
                        to stare at the desert’s emptiness. 

           Silence spreads throughout the car. Donald’s kept his eyes 
           straight ahead on the road the whole time. 

                                 DONALD
                        And Tessa, a good lawyer settles 
                        before a case even gets to court. 

                                 ERIC
                        Dad! Shut up!

           EXT. DEATH VALLEY NATIONAL PARK - NOON

           A scenic overlook with another descriptive sign. Donald pulls 
           over in front of the sign. He waits. 
                                 DONALD
                        Oh, right. 

           Donald exits the car and reads the sign. He scans the horizon 
           with a hand shielding his eyes. 

                                 AMY
                        Is he gonna do this at every sign?

           Mary nods and watches Donald with a satisfied grin.

           EXT. DEATH VALLEY NATIONAL PARK - OVERLOOK - AFTERNOON

           Donald parks in a small lot for a desert overlook. Dark 
           mountaintops soar over the white expanses of desert. The sand 
           appears to glow from the intense sun.

                                 DONALD
                        Let’s go check out the view from 
                        that cliff up there!

           Eric and Tessa glance at one another and then back at Mary. 
           Donald’s smile deflates. He walks up to the overlook alone. 

           Eric, Tessa, and Kevin wander off in the other direction. 
           Mary catches Amy before she follows them.

                                 MARY
                        How’s Eric doing?

                                 AMY
                        Um, I don’t think he’s processed 
                        any of this yet.

                                 MARY
                        Beyond this. Let me think about 
                        something other than this. How’s he 
                        doing with losing his job? 

                                 AMY
                        It was a mess. Luckily he’s in an 
                        industry where having a breakdown 
                        on your resumé might actually count 
                        as street cred.

                                 MARY
                        Is he getting back to illustrating?

                                 AMY
                        He wants to, but he’s not 
                        submitting anything. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 AMY (CONT'D)
                        He spends a lot of time researching 
                        rare diseases, convinced he’s 
                        contracted them. It’s like he’s 
                        living a Choose Your Own Adventure 
                        book. 

                                 MARY
                        And disease is the adventure?

                                 AMY
                        I think part of him believes it’ll 
                        make him more sympathetic. Or 
                        marketable. Like people will be 
                        more interested in an illustrator 
                        with lupus.

           Amy scans the family. Donald, Eric, Tessa, and Mary stand 
           apart. Disjointed, like the horizon’s spindly mountaintops. 

                                 MARY
                        He was always stuck on the idea 
                        that creativity relied on being 
                        tortured. I told him to look at our 
                        family. We have plenty of disasters 
                        for inspiration. 

                                 AMY
                        Well, maybe this trip will help. 

           Amy eyes Mary, unsure how she’ll respond. As Amy is about to 
           apologize, Mary reveals a thin smile. 

                                 MARY
                        Watch after him for me. You seem to 
                        be the only one he wants to spend 
                        time with anymore.

           Mary’s tone is equally sweet and threatening. 

                                 AMY
                        We’ve been meaning to visit more. 
                        It’s just my job’s really busy and- 

                                 MARY
                        I know. It’s a busy job. I know all 
                        that it entails.

           EXT. DEATH VALLEY NATIONAL PARK - OVERLOOK - AFTERNOON

           Eric sits on a rock and traces his finger through the trail 
           dust. He draws the landscape in the dirt as Tessa approaches.
                                 TESSA
                        Your next masterpiece?

                                 ERIC
                        Piece of something.

           Eric sighs and rubs the dirt, erasing the drawing. 

                                 ERIC (CONT’D)
                        Tess, I don’t know what I’m 
                        supposed to say to you right now.

                                 TESSA
                        That’s fine. I don’t know what I’d 
                        want to hear right now. 

           They sit side by side in the heat as they stare out together 
           at the expansive desert and uncertain futures. 

           EXT. DEATH VALLEY NATIONAL PARK - OUTCROPPING - AFTERNOON

           Alone on a rock outcropping, Donald looks over his shoulder 
           at his family scattered around the overlook.

           Donald tip-toes to the edge, eyeing the long drop. Gravel 
           plummets off the rock as he inches closer to the edge. Donald 
           looks down, sweating, swaying, as if he’s considering a jump. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. RENTAL CAR - PARK ROAD - AFTERNOON - TRAVELING 

           Donald speeds along a road in Death Valley. Another of the 
           informational signposts appears on the roadside up ahead. 
           Donald streams past it. From the backseat Amy turns around 
           and watches it disappear behind them. 

                                 AMY
                        He missed one. 

                                 ERIC
                        I guess he’s in a rush to get to my 
                        Aunt’s house. Can’t imagine why.

           EXT. JERRY AND JUNE’S RANCH HOUSE - NEVADA - EVENING

           The dirt-coated minivan parks in front of a terra cotta ranch 
           house in the desert outside Las Vegas.
           JUNE (55) is Mary’s sister. She emerges from the front door 
           with her husband, JERRY (60). June is tan with braided gray 
           hair and a long dress. The look of a wealthy hippie. 

           They exit the minivan and Eric hugs June. Donald stands 
           sheepishly by the car, as if he’s waiting for judgment. 

                                 ERIC
                        Aunt June, this is Amy.

                                 JUNE
                        She’s beautiful! This is what 
                        lawyers look like now? My God! My 
                        lawyer looks like a foot.  

           June pulls Amy into a exuberant hug. Then she sees Kevin. 

                                 JUNE (CONT’D)
                        And is this the man who wants to 
                        marry my spectacular niece?

           June sizes Kevin up, suddenly serious.

                                 JUNE (CONT’D)
                        Are you unemployed?

                                 KEVIN
                        No. 

                                 JUNE
                        You smoke drugs?

                                 KEVIN
                        No.

                                 JUNE
                        You ever vote Republican?

                                 KEVIN
                        No. 

                                 JUNE
                        Great! That last one’s the only 
                        answer that matters. 

           She gives Kevin and Tessa big hugs. 

                                 JUNE (CONT’D)
                        Now where is my much older sister?

           Mary finally exits the minivan, smiling at June. They hug. 
           June keeps her arm around Mary. They stride toward the house.
                                 JUNE (CONT’D)
                        You look good. Adultery treats you 
                        well. 

           Mary smiles. June turns around to the others. 

                                 JUNE (CONT’D)
                        Come in, come in! Even you, Donald. 

           INT. JERRY AND JUNE’S RANCH HOUSE - ENTRYWAY - EVENING

           The house is filled with typical ranch decor. Colorful 
           paintings, native designs, cowboy regalia. June leads Mary 
           upstairs. Mary clutches an overnight bag. 

           June opens a door to a spare bedroom. Mary fixates on the 
           size of the single bed.

                                 MARY
                        I suppose that’s big enough.

                                 JUNE
                        The kids can have the bedrooms 
                        downstairs. Where do you want me to 
                        put Don? Out in the barn?

           Mary clutches her forehead.

                                 MARY
                        No, he might actually enjoy that. 
                        Give him the couch by the kitchen.  

                                 JUNE
                        Jerry’s up at dawn. It’ll be noisy.

                                 MARY
                        That’s perfect. 

           They exchange smiles. June pulls her into a long hug. 

                                 JUNE
                        Now, how about the two of us go sit 
                        on the balcony. Wine?

                                 MARY
                        There isn’t a big enough glass. 

           INT. JERRY AND JUNE’S RANCH HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Donald, Eric, Amy, Tessa, Kevin, and Jerry are crowded around 
           a circular dining table covered with plates of food and beer. 
                                 JERRY
                        Eric, how’s work? Foxfield Forest 
                        is my grandson’s favorite TV show! 

           Eric glances at Donald, considering continuing the lie. 

                                 ERIC
                        Actually Uncle Jerry, I was fired. 

                                 DONALD
                        What? From your job?

           Donald looks dumbfounded. As if getting fired from a cannon 
           would make more sense than his son not having a job.

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        Why didn’t you tell me?

                                 ERIC
                        I wonder where I got the idea to 
                        lie about something?

           Eric stares at Donald. Their first moment of confrontation. 

                                 JERRY
                        Jeez, I’m sorry. What happened?

                                 ERIC
                        I was the voice of Farley The Fox 
                        on social media... 

                                 JERRY
                        Yeah, yeah! The one with 
                        sunglasses, right? The cool one?

                                 ERIC
                        Yes. I was the cool one. 

           Eric rolls his eyes and takes a long pull of his beer.

                                 ERIC (CONT’D)
                        I posted ‘fox facts’ online about 
                        animals and forests for all the 
                        kids who watched the show. As we 
                        built up a big group of followers, 
                        our new sponsors wanted their 
                        brands incorporated more instead of 
                        actual facts. So I’d post statuses 
                        recommending shoes to little kids 
                        because their favorite fox wore 
                        them. Or an energy drink because a 
                        cartoon badger guzzled it. 
                                 AMY
                        Which is totally perverted. 

                                 JERRY
                        Even sounds illegal. Right, Don?

                                 DONALD
                        I don’t practice cartoon law. 

           Eric leers at Donald. Jerry notices. 

                                 ERIC
                        And after months of schilling crap 
                        to kids, and continually getting 
                        passed over for illustrator 
                        positions, I went a bit rogue. 

                                 TESSA
                        He did the online version of going 
                        postal.

           EXT. JERRY AND JUNE’S RANCH HOUSE - BALCONY - DUSK

           June and Mary sit on the balcony, admiring the dark desert. A 
           bottle of wine and two full glasses sit on the table. 

                                 JUNE
                        How are the kids dealing?

                                 MARY
                        They’re walking on eggshells. 
                        Except Tessa. Whatever instinct I 
                        inherited from Mom to sweep things 
                        under the rug, it skipped a 
                        generation over her. 

           Mary stands up and leans against the balcony’s railing.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        Remember twenty years ago when 
                        everyone was getting divorced, like 
                        it was the trend? I imagined my 
                        response so often. Grow my hair 
                        out. Quit teaching. An apartment by 
                        the beach. But it was all supposed 
                        to be some alternate reality.  

                                 JUNE
                        Were there signs? Aren’t there 
                        supposed to be signs?
                                 MARY
                        No... I don’t know... I know when I 
                        had friends who were cheated on-

           Mary sneaks a nervous glance at June that will be revisited. 

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        I wanted there to be signs. Signs 
                        my friends missed, so secretly I 
                        could look down on them, believing 
                        I was doing something better, being 
                        someone better, to prevent the 
                        signs from happening to me. 

           Mary paces the length of the balcony. Stars blanket the sky.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        But I’m the idiot. I’m an idiot for 
                        feeling surprised. Why would he 
                        have learned a lesson if there were 
                        no consequences the first time?

                                 JUNE
                        What do you mean?

                                 MARY
                        I caught him before. Cheating.

                                 JUNE
                        What? When?

                                 MARY
                        Right before his mom died. He was 
                        flying back and forth, spending all 
                        his time in the hospital. He was so 
                        stressed and alone. 

                                 JUNE
                        That’s no excuse, Mary. 

                                 MARY
                        But it gave me some power back. 
                        Convincing myself that he was 
                        cheating because we weren’t 
                        together enough, or having sex 
                        enough, it let me blame the 
                        circumstances. There was nothing 
                        wrong with me. 

                                 JUNE
                        You should’ve told me. 

                                 MARY
                        You and I weren’t talking. 
           Mary looks away, referencing a dark period between them.

                                 JUNE
                        I’m so sorry. Why didn’t you do 
                        something back then?

                                 MARY
                        The kids were in grade school. My 
                        allegiance was to them. I had a 
                        therapist suggest I try yoga. Yoga 
                        was brand new back then. It was 
                        supposed to do for our generation 
                        what Valium did for Mom. 

                                 JUNE
                        Yoga is like a thousand years old.

                                 MARY
                        New to white people counts as new.

                                 JUNE
                        Well, did it work?

                                 MARY
                        It’s fucking stretching. It did 
                        nothing. 

           June smirks and joins Mary at the balcony railing.

           INT. JERRY AND JUNE’S RANCH HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           At the table with the others, Eric continues explaining why 
           he was fired. Donald looks away, embarrassed by the story. 

                                 ERIC
                        So I posted some messages that I... 
                        shouldn’t have. 

                                 JERRY
                        What did they say?

                                 ERIC
                        They were idiotic. And they were 
                        quickly deleted. 

                                 TESSA
                        But I took screen shots!

           On her phone Tessa opens pictures of the destructive rants 
           Eric posted online. She reads some of the posts aloud. 
                                 TESSA (CONT’D)
                        “Fox Fax: Foxes eat Taterz Potato 
                        Chipz because they’re omnivores. 
                        They’ll eat anything. Trash. Flesh. 
                        Shit. A fox’s endorsement is 
                        meaningless.”

           She scrolls to another.

                                 TESSA (CONT’D)
                        “Fox Fax: In the UK, foxes were 
                        hunted to near extinction. What 
                        other species have humans hunted? 
                        Hint: Other humans count!”

                                 JERRY
                        Why is ‘facts’ spelled like that? 
                        Didn’t the kids think the fox was 
                        sending a fax?

                                 AMY
                        No one on the internet knows what a 
                        fax is anymore. 

                                 ERIC
                        ‘F-a-x’ is two characters shorter 
                        than ‘Facts’. It lets you write 
                        more on Twitter. I actually got a 
                        raise for suggesting ‘fax’. 

                                 TESSA
                        Oh, this one’s my favorite, “Fox 
                        Fax: Foxes can’t drink Blitz Energy 
                        drinks because they’ll die. If you 
                        drink Blitz Energy drinks, you’ll 
                        die. Everything dies.”

                                 JERRY
                        I guess you can’t argue the facts 
                        of that one. 

                                 ERIC
                        I was feeling very manipulated at 
                        the time. Unfortunately I decided 
                        to express these feelings to a 
                        couple hundred thousand preteens. 

           Eric buries his face in his hands. 

                                 TESSA
                        Oh, don’t worry. It’s been six 
                        weeks. There’s been a thousand 
                        dumber things done online since. 
                        It’s forgotten. 
           Donald attempts to be consoling, but it’s condescending.

                                 DONALD
                        And that job wasn’t really going 
                        anywhere, Eric. 

                                 ERIC
                        It was the highest rated kids show 
                        on TV. It wasn’t something I was 
                        doing with buddies in the garage. 

                                 DONALD
                        I’m just saying that it’s not too 
                        late for law school. Right, Amy?

           Amy grabs her beer, eager to avoid eye contact.

                                 ERIC
                        Stop telling me that! 

           Eric pushes away from the table. 

                                 ERIC (CONT’D)
                        Let me know when it’s finally too 
                        late to go to law school. Then I’ll 
                        know my future’s officially ruined. 

                                 DONALD
                        I just want something for you 
                        that’s stable.  

                                 JERRY
                        You know, I’ve actually heard that 
                        there are stable professions other 
                        than law. Hard to believe, huh?

           Jerry scans the table, looking at Tessa and Kevin, who nod in 
           agreement. He locks eyes with Amy. 

                                 AMY
                        Sorry. I’m an evil lawyer, too. 

                                 JERRY
                        You wear it a lot better.

           EXT. JERRY AND JUNE’S RANCH HOUSE - BALCONY - NIGHT

           Mary and June stare out from the balcony. 

                                 MARY
                        I’m left with these swirling 
                        emotions. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MARY (CONT'D)
                        The familiar impulses of intimacy 
                        and this new flood of bitterness. 
                        Like today, I almost reminded him 
                        to put on sunscreen. But I caught 
                        myself, remembering everything. And 
                        I fumed the whole time we were in 
                        the desert. Imagining him with that 
                        woman, wishing he’d get burned.   

                                 JUNE
                        I want to remind you that when 
                        Jerry and I got together, he was 
                        already separated. Nothing happened 
                        when they were actually married. 

                                 MARY
                        I know that now. I’m sorry I didn’t 
                        believe you back then. 

                                 JUNE
                        But as someone who’s been 
                        considered the other woman, I can 
                        assure you there’s suffering on all 
                        sides. There’s so much guilt, even 
                        when there isn’t cheating-

                                 MARY
                        But I want more than guilt. He gets 
                        a new life? A new house? A new 
                        wife? I don’t want to live this 
                        way, hoping for retribution through 
                        thousands of little sunburns.

                                 JUNE
                        I know it seems impossible, but 
                        you’ll move on. 

                                 MARY
                        Move on to what? Wife, mom, 
                        teacher. Everything that I’ve been 
                        for the last thirty years has 
                        vanished in a flash. 

                                 JUNE
                        You’re allowed to start over, too.  

                                 MARY
                        I’m sixty years old for Christ’s 
                        sake. 

                                 JUNE
                        So? There’s never been an easier 
                        time for a sixty year old woman to 
                        meet someone.

                                 JUNE (CONT'D)
                        Imagine Mom’s options after Dad 
                        died. Hang around outside the Elk’s 
                        Lodge? There’s websites full of 
                        people eager to meet a woman like 
                        you. 

                                 MARY
                        And then what?

                                 JUNE
                        You have fun. It works. It doesn’t 
                        work. You have sex. 

                                 MARY
                        Sex? What’s that?

                                 JUNE
                        Oh, please. Every man in this damn 
                        desert would jump at the chance to 
                        be with you. You like your men 
                        toothless and gun-toting, right?

           Mary smiles and stands up, yawning. 

                                 MARY
                        I’m flattered. And I’m exhausted. 

           June stands up with her and ushers Mary to bed.

           INT. JERRY AND JUNE’S RANCH HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Jerry, Tessa, Kevin, Eric, and Amy play poker. Donald sits at 
           the table, scanning a stack of maps of the Grand Canyon. 

                                 JERRY
                        I want to come visit you guys in 
                        Hollywood? D’you know Beyoncé?

                                 KEVIN
                        No, I think she lives in New York. 

                                 JERRY
                        So you know her a little bit, huh? 

           Everyone tosses their cards into the center of the table. 
           Jerry deals out a new hand. He fans out his cards and groans. 

                                 JERRY (CONT’D)
                        Does Guy Fieri live in Hollywood? I 
                        wanna meet him. 

                                 TESSA
                        Why?
                                 JERRY
                        I wanna punch him in the face. 

                                 KEVIN
                        You can definitely visit us in LA!

           June enters the kitchen after taking Mary to bed. She puts a 
           hand on Jerry’s shoulder. He smiles from the familiar touch.

                                 JUNE
                        How are we doing down here?

                                 JERRY
                        They won’t introduce me to Beyoncé! 

                                 JUNE
                        Come on. These guys are driving off 
                        to the Grand Canyon in the morning.

                                 JERRY
                        Right. Tomorrow is the “big hike”?

                                 DONALD
                        Driving there tomorrow to start at 
                        dawn the next day. We need the 
                        whole day. It’s twenty two miles. 

                                 JERRY
                        All in one day? Did y’all lose a 
                        bet or something?

                                 KEVIN
                        We’ve been training. It’s gonna be 
                        amazing!

                                 JERRY
                        You know they’ve got donkeys you 
                        could ride down into the Grand 
                        Canyon. And they don’t even make 
                        the donkeys do it in one day. 

                                 DONALD
                        It’s something we’ve been looking 
                        forward to for fifteen years. It’ll 
                        be a special experience. 

                                 JERRY
                        Special doesn’t mean good. When I 
                        passed a kidney stone last year, 
                        that was a special experience.

                                 JUNE
                        Come on. Bed! Everyone!
           INT. ERIC AND AMY’S BEDROOM - NIGHT 

           Eric and Amy lie next to each other in bed. They are kissing. 
           Eric reaches under her shirt, but Amy pushes his hand away. 

                                 AMY
                        Your dad!

                                 ERIC
                        I don’t get to have sex because my 
                        dad did?

                                 AMY
                        He’ll hear us!

           Eric concedes and mashes his pillow.

                                 ERIC
                        Your parents split up when you were 
                        in high school, right?

                                 AMY
                        Yeah, everyone’s did. 

                                 ERIC
                        I assumed the window for divorce 
                        had elapsed for my parents. No 
                        matter what happened, they’d just 
                        stick it out. 

                                 AMY
                        Welcome back to high school. 

                                 ERIC
                        Feels a lot like it. My parents are 
                        divorcing, family road trips, no 
                        job, and apparently I have no 
                        chance of getting laid. 

           Amy curls up against him and falls asleep. Eric stares up. 

           INT. JERRY AND JUNE’S RANCH HOUSE - KITCHEN - MORNING

           Jerry’s in a robe, putting away last night’s dishes. Donald 
           enters the kitchen, dressed, shaved, and ready to go. 

                                 JERRY
                        Coffee?

           Donald pours himself a cup. Everyone else is still asleep.
                                 JERRY (CONT’D)
                        Sorry if I was undermining you last 
                        night in front of the kids. 

                                 DONALD
                        No, I’m sorry. Been a tough trip. 

                                 JERRY
                        Some advice?

                                 DONALD
                        Sure. 

                                 JERRY
                        You’re gonna have every opportunity 
                        in the world to cut and run. But 
                        you’re not done being Dad. How you 
                        respond to all this is a big test.

           Donald nods and stares into his coffee. 

                                 JERRY (CONT’D)
                        My kids suffered way too much when 
                        my first wife and I split. Don’t 
                        miss out on them, just because it’s 
                        easier. 

           INT. RENTAL CAR - JERRY AND JUNE’S RANCH HOUSE - DRIVEWAY

           Donald loads up the back of the car, Eric and Amy are seated 
           in the back row. Donald talks to them through the open door.

                                 DONALD
                        Is your résumé up to date?

                                 ERIC
                        It’s fine.

                                 DONALD
                        Maybe Amy could talk to some folks? 
                        Bring you on as a paralegal? That’d 
                        be a good start to having you 
                        follow in my footsteps. 

                                 ERIC
                        That’s not such an admirable thing 
                        right now, Dad. 

           Donald looks destroyed from the comment. He stumbles back and 
           slams the tailgate. 
                                 AMY
                        He’s right, you know. Not about the 
                        paralegal thing. But finding a 
                        steady job wouldn’t be terrible. 

                                 ERIC
                        I just need some time to work 
                        through a creativity block. 

                                 AMY
                        That’s fine. But I don’t want to 
                        feel guilty spending the money I’m 
                        earning while you’re... drawing.

           Her comment stings Eric. 

                                 ERIC
                        I’ll check job postings right now. 

           Eric searches “RATTLESNAKE VENOM SYMPTOMS” on his phone. 

           EXT. JERRY AND JUNE’S RANCH HOUSE - DRIVEWAY - MORNING

           Mary stands with June. The others are all in the car.

                                 JUNE
                        Wish you could’ve stayed longer. 

                                 MARY
                        Me too. We’ll come back soon. 

           Mary catches the ‘we’. 

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        Or, I’ll come back soon? I don’t 
                        know how this is gonna work. 

                                 JUNE
                        I’ll come to you. I love you.

                                 MARY
                        Love you too. Thank you. 

           Mary gets in the car, and they back out of the driveway. 

           INT. RENTAL CAR - DESERT HIGHWAY - MORNING

           The minivan speeds along toward the Grand Canyon. They swoop 
           by Las Vegas and enter into Arizona. The stress of the trip 
           and the anxiety before the long hike has made everyone quiet. 
           The car hits a bump in the highway. A faint buzzing noise 
           starts. Kevin is the first to notice. 

                                 KEVIN
                        What’s that noise?

           The others keep staring out the windows. But the noise grows. 

                                 AMY
                        Yeah. I hear it, too. 

           They all freeze, listening for the sound. Once they’ve all 
           heard it, they rifle through their luggage and seats 
           searching for the source. The noise grows louder. They fling 
           clothes and hiking boots across the van. 

                                 TESSA
                        Where is that coming from?

           Kevin pulls the vibrating electric toothbrush from a bag. 

                                 KEVIN
                        I got it!

                                 MARY
                        Who charged the battery? 

                                 DONALD
                        I did. I plugged it in before I 
                        gave it to you. 

                                 MARY
                        Well, how thoughtful!

           The toothbrush continues to buzz in Kevin’s hand as Mary and 
           Donald scowl at each other. 

                                 KEVIN
                        Should I turn it off?

                                 ALL
                        Yes!!!

           Kevin turns it off, but now the tension is audible.  

           EXT. GRAND CANYON RIM - PARKING LOT - AFTERNOON

           Donald parks near the rim of the Grand Canyon and hurries 
           ahead. Eric taps at his phone, when he suddenly looks up. 

                                 ERIC
                        Shit. Our Family Plan is over. 
                                 AMY
                        Um, what family are you planning?

           Amy nervously eyes him. The word ‘family’ gets her on edge. 
           But Eric points to his phone. 

                                 ERIC
                        Our Family Plan. I’ll have to get 
                        my own phone plan now. 

           Amy looks relieved.  

                                 KEVIN
                        You’re still on your parents’ phone 
                        plan? Aren’t you, like, thirty?

                                 ERIC
                        Don’t say my age like it’s a such 
                        an adjective. We’re together on a 
                        Family Plan because it makes it 
                        cheaper for everyone individually. 

                                 AMY
                        Except for your parents, who pay 
                        the entire bill. 

                                 ERIC
                        And they’re not going to anymore! 

           A confused scowl spreads across Eric’s face. 

                                 AMY
                        Come on, cranky. Let’s see how 
                        grand this canyon really is.

           EXT. GRAND CANYON RIM - AFTERNOON

           The Grand Canyon unfurls before them. The massive Canyon is 
           overwhelmingly beautiful and expansive. Copper walls, 
           glistening blue river, and pockets of lush forest. But the 
           opposite rim looks unreachable. 

                                 ERIC
                        Was it always this big?

                                 DONALD
                        Isn’t it amazing!

           Donald takes an exaggerated, appreciative deep breath. 
                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        That’s millions of years of geology 
                        presented simultaneously for us. 
                        Can you see anyone hiking? 

           Donald scurries to a different vantage. The others wander 
           off, leaving Eric and Mary staring across the Canyon.

                                 MARY
                        And tomorrow night Amy and I will 
                        be standing right over there to 
                        meet you guys. What kind of beer 
                        should we have waiting?

                                 ERIC
                        Just have lots of it. 

           Eric’s fixates on the opposite rim of the canyon.

                                 ERIC (CONT’D)
                        It’s weird having time laid out 
                        this way. Like we could drop a 
                        bridge and walk straight to 
                        tomorrow. 

                                 MARY
                        It doesn’t always feel like that?

                                 ERIC
                        Not like crossing a bridge. Way 
                        less certain.

                                 MARY
                        Are you OK?

                                 ERIC
                        I’ve been in LA for eight years. I 
                        worked so hard to get to where I 
                        was, which wasn’t even that close 
                        to being an illustrator, and I 
                        totally blew it. No matter how hard 
                        I work, I can’t get to my goals. 

                                 MARY
                        That’s our fault. All that ‘Believe 
                        and Achieve’ crap we were supposed 
                        to preach to your generation, as if 
                        the only things that matter are 
                        wanting something and hard work. 

           Mary rolls her eyes, reciting the mantras.
                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        ‘Hard work’ opened every door. 
                        ‘Hard work’ made anything possible. 

                                 ERIC
                        I still believe anything’s 
                        possible, it’s just that the older 
                        I get, the easier it gets to 
                        envision myself ending up with an 
                        anything that I never wanted. 

           Mary’s saddened to hear her son so despondent.

                                 ERIC (CONT’D)
                        How will I ever catch up to where 
                        you and Dad were at my age? Your 
                        careers, your house, your marriage?

                                 MARY
                        We didn’t always have that house. 
                        Those jobs. We tried to hide our 
                        struggles from you kids, but now I 
                        worry that made you think that we 
                        never struggled. Did you know that 
                        the first place we had in DC, we 
                        had to share a shower with the 
                        neighbors? This was when your 
                        father was interviewing with firms.

           Mary picks her head off Eric’s shoulder. An epiphany. 

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        I suppose I’ll have to stop 
                        thinking of him that way. 

                                 ERIC
                        Mom, he’ll still be our father. 

                                 MARY
                        I mean stop thinking of my life 
                        only in terms of how it matches up 
                        with his.

           They swap unsure looks as the Canyon plummets before them. 

           INT. GROCERY STORE - AFTERNOON

           The group enters a small grocery store to get supplies for 
           the hike in the morning. Donald and Eric split off.

                                 DONALD
                        We need water, protein bars, trail 
                        mix, and... jackpot!
           A shelf of Five Hour Energy drinks. Donald examines two 
           flavors as if he’s comparing expensive bottles of wine. 

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        You ever tried this stuff? 

                                 ERIC
                        Yeah, Dad. I went to college. 

                                 DONALD
                        I’m getting some for all of us. It 
                        works wonders! I might even drink a 
                        whole bottle tomorrow. 

                                 ERIC
                        You’re a maniac.

           INT. GROCERY STORE - AFTERNOON

           Amy and Tessa stroll down a different aisle. Amy’s pensive, 
           taking measured steps down the center of the aisle.

                                 TESSA
                        I’m gonna feel great planning a 
                        wedding now. Dragging Mom to shop 
                        for a dress with all she’s going 
                        through. Rubbing our happiness in.  

                                 AMY
                        Does it make you question things?

                                 TESSA
                        Question what things?

                                 AMY
                        Like, what did you think when Kevin 
                        proposed? Did you worry at all 
                        about the things you’d never do by 
                        yourself again?

                                 TESSA
                        Not really. I’m excited for what we 
                        can do together.

                                 AMY
                        But isn’t there an independent part 
                        of you that you’re suppressing- 
                        with good intentions- but isn’t it 
                        still disloyal to yourself?

                                 TESSA
                        Is there something wrong between 
                        you and Eric? 
                                 AMY
                        No. We’re good. Living together is 
                        going good. We’re developing a good 
                        routine. 

           The rote repetition of ‘good’ alarms Tessa. 

                                 TESSA
                        You’ve been together almost two 
                        years. You love him, right?

                                 AMY
                        Yeah, we say ‘I love you’. But how 
                        do you know for sure that you found 
                        someone you love, or if you’ve just 
                        found someone who loves the same 
                        Thai restaurants and HBO shows?

                                 TESSA
                        You’re joking, right?

                                 AMY
                            (stammering)
                        Yeah! I mean, with your parents and 
                        everything that’s going on-

           Donald and Eric pop into sight at the end of the aisle. 
           Donald lifts a single Five Hour Energy. 

                                 DONALD
                        Tessa! I got you ‘Very Berry’. 
                        You’ll love it. 

                                 TESSA
                        Thanks...

                                 DONALD
                        Come on! We gotta check into the 
                        hotel. 

           Amy hurries ahead of Tessa to stand by Eric.

           INT. LODGE DINING ROOM - NIGHT

           A nice dining room in an old lodge. Animal heads and stately 
           paintings on the walls. The group’s finished dinner, and 
           Donald unfolds a trail map on the table. 

                                 DONALD
                        We need to be awake by 4:30 so your 
                        mom can drop us off at the 
                        trailhead at 5:30. She’ll drive 
                        around the Canyon with Amy-
                                 MARY
                        After going back to sleep...

                                 DONALD
                        We follow this trail. By noon we’ll 
                        have made it to Phantom Ranch, 
                        which is roughly the halfway point. 

                                 ERIC
                        The halfway point is called Phantom 
                        Ranch? Was the name You’re Never 
                        Gonna Make It Ranch already taken?

           Donald ignores him. 

                                 DONALD
                        After lunch, we follow this trail 
                        all the way to meet Amy and your 
                        Mom tomorrow around seven o’clock. 
                        Twenty two miles, and nine thousand 
                        feet in elevation change. Aren’t 
                        you guys excited!

           Everyone but Donald nervously eyes one another. 

           INT. ERIC AND AMY’S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT

           Eric and Amy are in bed together in their dark hotel room. 
           Eric waves his phone around, searching for a signal. 

                                 AMY
                        Do you think your parents still 
                        have sex?

                                 ERIC
                        Obviously. 

           He looks up from his phone after a beat. 

                                 ERIC (CONT’D)
                        Oh, you mean with each other?- I 
                        don’t want to think about it. 

                                 AMY
                        But if the whole issue is that your 
                        dad had sex with another woman. But 
                        your parents weren’t having sex to 
                        begin with, does it lessen the 
                        severity of what he did?

                                 ERIC
                        Don’t turn my parents into a logic 
                        game. It’s simple. He cheated.
                                 AMY
                        But if they’re weren’t married, 
                        they could still be your parents 
                        together. Sorry, I’m just trying to 
                        observe it from every perspective. 

                                 ERIC
                        You’re not researching a case. Stop 
                        preventing me from being angry. 

                                 AMY
                        Well it seems like you’re not angry 
                        because your dad cheated or because 
                        your mom’s hurt, but only because 
                        you have to deal with them.

                                 ERIC
                        What do you mean?

                                 AMY
                        You always dodge their phone calls. 
                        You hate it when they bother you! 

                                 ERIC
                        You don’t know what I’m going 
                        through. 

                                 AMY
                        I know exactly what you’re going 
                        through! Everyone knows. How you’ve 
                        managed to live this long in your 
                        bubble, that I don’t know. But this 
                        is what happens to relationships. 

                                 ERIC
                        Don’t be so jaded. 

                                 AMY
                        I’m not. I’m realistic. 

           Amy turns away from him in bed. She quickly spins back.

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        Oh and just FYI, you don’t order 
                        the second item on a restaurant 
                        menu because it’s always chicken. 
                        You order the second item because 
                        it’s always the second cheapest. 

                                 ERIC
                        That’s not true. 
                                 AMY
                        It is! Unless your parents or my 
                        firm is paying the bill. 

                                 ERIC
                        I need to get to sleep.

           Eric rolls over, facing away from her. Eventually his phone 
           screen glows. He shakes it, groaning. 

                                 AMY
                        It doesn’t work, remember?

           Eric flips and twists all night. The glowing time on the 
           bedside table’s clock jumps forward as he can’t sleep. 

           INT. ERIC AND AMY’S HOTEL ROOM - MORNING

           At exactly 4:30 AM, the hotel phone rings. 

                                 DONALD
                        Morning, morning!

           Eric moans incoherently into the phone and hangs up

           There’s loud knocking at the door. Eric staggers out of bed 
           in a T-shirt and boxer shorts, and peeks out the door. 

           Donald’s in the hallway resembling a mannequin for an outdoor 
           clothing company. He wears a vest, hiking boots, shorts, high 
           socks, and a floppy hat. More khaki than a Mormon’s closet. 

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        Leaving in five minutes!

                                 ERIC
                            (yawning)
                        Yeah, yeah. Hiking. Yay.

           EXT. GRAND CANYON NORTH RIM - TRAILHEAD - MORNING

           The sun creeps up as Mary parks at the trailhead for the Rim 
           to Rim hike. The North Rim is high in elevation, and pockets 
           of snow accumulated from an overnight storm. They see their 
           breath as they stretch by the minivan.

           Kevin points out another sign that specifically warns not to 
           attempt the hike in one day. 

                                 KEVIN
                        Still not concerned by this, huh?
                                 DONALD
                        You can’t chicken out now! That 
                        sign is only to deter people with 
                        heart conditions or the elderly.  

           Tessa, Eric, and Kevin eye him suspiciously. 

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        I’m not elderly. Let’s go!

           Mary watches them stride down the trail in a tight pack. 

           EXT. GRAND CANYON TRAIL - MORNING

           The marathon begins! Twenty-two grueling miles of twists, 
           boulders, switchbacks, and inclines stretch out before them. 

           The trail rapidly slopes down the wooded North Rim of the 
           Canyon. The hikers nervously eye the large trees and dewy 
           ground, stepping tenderly, as if they’re afraid to wake a 
           sleeping giant.

           Donald’s exuberance keeps them at a steady pace. Theirs are 
           the first footprints on the trail that morning. With every 
           step, there’s the labored crunch of the ground breaking 
           beneath their weight. 

           The trail twists into the sunlight and unveils the first 
           vista of the entire Canyon from within. Rock walls tower 
           above them, appearing to curl and enclose the hikers.

           EXT. GRAND CANYON TRAIL - MORNING

           Donald and Kevin trod ahead, poking their walking sticks into 
           the rocky ground for stability. Tessa opens her backpack and 
           pulls out a collapsible walking stick. She assembles it and 
           strides ahead. Eric tries to keep up. 

           They stop for water, leaning against the shady side of a 
           boulder. Everyone breathes heavy and switches out of their 
           long sleeve shirts. Eric’s cheeks are red. He scrapes sweat 
           from his face with grubby fingers.  

                                 ERIC
                        So was there ever a thought to say, 
                        “Hey Eric, we’re all getting 
                        walking sticks for the hike, maybe 
                        you should too?”

                                 KEVIN
                        Yeah, but then we all decided to 
                        collude against you. 
           Once they’ve caught their breath, they repack their bags and 
           limber up to continue the hike. Eric stays seated. 

                                 TESSA
                        Hey Eric, we’re all gonna keep 
                        hiking, maybe you should too!

           Kevin snaps a low-hanging limb off a nearby evergreen. 

                                 KEVIN
                        Here you go. 

           The “walking stick” is crooked and thin. When Eric stands up, 
           it barely comes up to his hip. Despite the tiny size, Eric 
           uses the stick as they scramble over the rocky path. 

           EXT. GRAND CANYON TRAIL - MORNING

           The trail grows rockier with occasional stretches where they 
           must tip-toe along the edge of a sharp drop-off. A fall would 
           be disastrous. 

           Donald leads the group. Kevin and Tessa stride side by side. 
           Eric lags in the back, poking along with his impromptu 
           walking stick. He’s beginning to struggle. 

           EXT. GRAND CANYON TRAIL - LATE MORNING 

           The Canyon walls dwarf the hikers. Their faces reflect the 
           miles they’ve already trekked. Pale and ragged, the group 
           wobbles forward like penguins. 

           Unaffectedly chipper, Kevin uses his walking stick to point 
           out rock formations and sights on the Canyon walls. 

                                 KEVIN
                        Look over there! See all the 
                        layers? How they’ve slid against 
                        each other and tumbled down? 

                                 ERIC
                        There’s a lot of fucking rocks. We 
                        get it. 

                                 KEVIN
                        You know, maybe if you’d trained a 
                        little more, you’d be able to enjoy 
                        the hike more. 

                                 ERIC
                        I’m not trying to enjoy the hike. 
                        I’m trying to finish it.  
           INT. RENTAL CAR - PARK HIGHWAY - MORNING - TRAVELING 

           Mary drives the minivan as she and Amy make the long route 
           around the Canyon to meet the hikers in the evening. Amy sips 
           coffee and asks questions to sidestep the awkwardness. 

                                 AMY
                        Not a hiker?

                                 MARY
                        I’d rather enjoy nature with air 
                        conditioning and a book in my lap 
                        than go stomping through it. 

                                 AMY
                        But Eric said all of your vacations 
                        were trips like this one. Parks and 
                        hiking and everything outdoors.

                                 MARY
                        Right. Donald and the kids love it. 
                        It’s good exercise without being 
                        too competitive. 

                                 AMY
                        Wasn’t it annoying always waiting 
                        on them out there on their hikes?

                                 MARY
                        I used to join them. But I worried 
                        I was holding them up. So I let 
                        them do their own thing.

                                 AMY
                        How do you make it even?

           Mary looks away from the road at Amy. 

                                 MARY
                        Part of parenting... marriage... is 
                        figuring out how to appreciate the 
                        things you don’t enjoy, when it 
                        helps the family. Getting even 
                        isn’t the best way to look at it.

                                 AMY
                        So are you supposed to capitulate? 
                        Give up everything you want?

                                 MARY
                        No, there’s a line. But maybe I’m 
                        not the best authority on that 
                        subject right now. 
           Amy tenses up. She’s been trying to avoid the family issues. 

           EXT. GRAND CANYON TRAIL - MORNING

           In the back of the group, Eric sweats and squints up ahead at 
           the others. As he steps over a log on the path, he braces 
           himself with the thin stick Kevin handed him earlier. 

           The stick snaps, and Eric tumbles to the ground. The others 
           hear the commotion and head back to him. 

                                 TESSA
                        Are you all right?

           Eric breathes heavy and fusses with the dirt in his hair. He 
           labors to his feet with Kevin’s help.

                                 ERIC
                        I’m fine. 

                                 DONALD
                        Well let’s go then. Pick up the 
                        pace. You’re lagging behind!

           EXT. GRAND CANYON TRAIL - MORNING

           The trail narrows as the Canyon walls loom above them. They 
           follow along a creek that will grow and eventually merge with 
           the Colorado River at the hike’s midway point. During a rest 
           near the creek, Eric collapses against a boulder, panting and 
           wincing. 

           Kevin happily sweats and exudes confidence about the rest of 
           the hike. He smiles at Tessa.

                                 KEVIN
                        You know, these packs aren’t much 
                        more weight than you’d put on in a 
                        pregnancy. 

           In no mood to do anything but guzzle water and rest, Tessa 
           stares daggers at him. 

                                 TESSA
                        Exactly how much weight do you 
                        envision me gaining for a baby? 

           Kevin looks back at her with a dumb, blank stare. 

                                 TESSA (CONT’D)
                        Which parts of my body will gain 
                        the most weight? Show me.
                                 KEVIN
                        I feel like maybe this is one of 
                        those questions that I’m not 
                        actually supposed to answer. 

                                 TESSA
                        It’s amazing how brilliant you’ve 
                        suddenly become. 

           Donald swigs water and ogles the Canyon walls. 

                                 DONALD
                        Isn’t this place magnificent?

           The others give him meager nods. Donald turns to Eric. 

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        All this beautiful scenery, and you 
                        can’t figure out what to draw? 

           Eric shakes his head, too tired to protest. 

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        Just take a look around. You’ve 
                        probably never been to a place 
                        where fewer people have stood. 

           Their faces are flushed and sweaty. It’s silent except for 
           the trickle of the creek and their heavy breathing.  

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        You can’t get to this point without 
                        going through everything we’ve been 
                        through. 

                                 ERIC
                        Everything?

           Eric stares at his dad. Donald ignores the comment and straps 
           on his back pack. 

           Eric’s the last to leave. He hoists on his pack, winces from 
           the weight, and waddles off. 

           EXT. PHANTOM RANCH CAMPGROUND - NOON 

           Donald, Tessa, and Kevin reach the wooded Phantom Ranch 
           campground. A series of small cabins and a large central 
           lodge, the campground is the first sign of other people in 
           hours. Campers, rafters, and a few other hikers attempting 
           the Rim to Rim hike. The other hikers are all in their early 
           twenties and seem far less weary. 
           Donald passes a team of penned up donkeys that are eating and 
           resting from their walk down the Canyon. The riders sit and 
           laugh at a large table. 

                                 DONALD
                        Grab a table in the shade. I’ll get 
                        the lunches we ordered. 

           Tessa and Kevin drop their packs on an old picnic table 
           underneath a crooked pine tree. Wide grins grow on their 
           faces as they sit on the benches, relishing the feeling of 
           resting their legs. 

           Donald emerges from the lodge with four plastic bags. The 
           ‘lunches’ are a collection of granola bars, beef jerky, and 
           other dry snacks. They savor the food like it’s five star 
           cuisine. 

           Eric staggers into the campground, and collapses on their 
           picnic table. 

                                 KEVIN
                        Isn’t this place great? 

           Eric groans and lies flat on the bench. Tessa places the 
           lunch on Eric’s heaving stomach. 

           EXT. NAVAJO BRIDGE - RIVER OVERLOOK - NOON 

           About halfway through the drive around the Grand Canyon, Mary 
           pulls over in front of a historic bridge that spans the 
           Colorado River, which the hikers are about to cross on foot 
           many miles downstream. 

           Red, craggy mesas line the horizon. Mary and Amy exit the 
           minivan and stroll to the middle of the Navajo Bridge, an 
           intricate steel pedestrian bridge with beautiful panoramas of 
           the river and the Canyon. 

                                 AMY
                        What are you gonna do after the 
                        trip?

                                 MARY
                        Is there a way to sleep and drink 
                        wine at the same time?

           Mary smiles as they pivot to the bridge’s other side. They 
           lean over the railing and stare down at the rushing water. 

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        I might spend some time away from 
                        home. At the coast. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        That’s what I’ve been telling 
                        myself over the last couple days. 
                        Having faith in time. Convincing 
                        myself that time holds every cure. 

                                 AMY
                        Are there things you’ve wanted to 
                        do? Now that you have the time?

                                 MARY
                        I’m not sure what my options are 
                        anymore. That’s how quickly time 
                        becomes your enemy. 

           Mary gazes out intently, watching the river flood forward, 
           curving and cutting through the Canyon walls before them. 

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        I’m glad you were here for Eric and 
                        Tessa. I know they’ve really 
                        appreciated having you around the 
                        last few days. 

           Amy looks back at her, surprised.

                                 AMY
                        Honestly I kind of felt like I was 
                        encroaching on your family. 

                                 MARY
                        Nonsense. All those years with 
                        Tessa and now with Eric? You’re a 
                        part of this family. 

                                 AMY
                        Really?

                                 MARY
                        Family’s the traditions, the jokes, 
                        the fights. You’re certainly a part 
                        of all that. Family is fluid. 

                                 AMY
                        In my experience, family is the 
                        most rigid thing that there is. 

           Amy bites her nails. 

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        When you got married, did you think 
                        you and Donald would always be 
                        together. 
                                 MARY
                        I thought so. I knew my parents 
                        didn’t really love each other, they 
                        were just married. So I thought 
                        moving away with Donald, moving 
                        away for love, was the best form of 
                        rebellion I could imagine. But once 
                        we got married and settled down, I 
                        feared I wasn’t really in love 
                        either. Or worse, that I was in 
                        love and that’s all it is. Tedious, 
                        repetitive, a nonstop negotiation. 
                        Making that transition is tough.

           Mary leans back from the railing. She stretches her arms and 
           turns to walk back to the car. 

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        Ready to get back on the road?

           Amy lingers in the center of the bridge. She seems uncertain 
           about where things are headed in her life, split between the 
           two banks of the river.  

           Eventually Amy turns and joins Mary on the slow walk back to 
           the minivan. When they reach the car, she looks across the 
           hood to Mary. A breeze rustles Amy’s hair out of place. 

                                 AMY
                        Before you found out. About the 
                        cheating. Were you and Donald in 
                        love, or were you just married?

                                 MARY
                        We were... together.

           Amy accepts the answer for a moment before pressing further. 

                                 AMY
                        And isn’t that the best case 
                        scenario? Together because of 
                        inertia?

                                 MARY
                        That’s very cynical.

                                 AMY
                        I know. Sorry. 

           Amy cracks open the passenger door.

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        But is it wrong?
           Mary looks across the hood of the car, unwilling to answer. 

           EXT. PHANTOM RANCH CAMPGROUND - LATER 

           Kevin sits on a bench at the campground at the bottom of the 
           Canyon, happily chomping through his lunch. He looks 
           refreshed and ready to continue the hike. 

                                 ERIC (O.S.)
                        Hiking is just soooo easy for you. 

           Eric sounds like a drunk ranting. Kevin keeps a happy gaze. 

                                 ERIC (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        You can do this all day, stepping 
                        along, no sweat. 

           Kevin crunches into an apple. 

                                 ERIC  (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Nothing to say, huh? Yeah, just 
                        keep chewing you smug bastard- 

                                 TESSA (O.S.)
                        Are you OK?

           Eric’s stirred from the rant. He wasn’t confronting Kevin. 
           He’s face to face with one of the donkeys grazing in the pen. 

                                 TESSA (CONT’D)
                        Come rest out of the sun. 

           Tessa leads Eric back to the bench. He looks dazed. Tessa 
           hands him a bottle of water and Eric takes a long drink, 
           pouring some on his head to cool down.

                                 DONALD
                        Mileage-wise we’re more than 
                        halfway. But now we’ve got the sun 
                        bearing down on us, and about five 
                        thousand feet to climb. The final 
                        leg of the hike is lots of 
                        switchbacks.  

                                 KEVIN
                        What’s the name for a group of 
                        switchbacks?

           Donald’s happy to return to the game they’d played earlier in 
           the trip, revisiting a time before the affair was public and 
           he was the bad guy.
                                 DONALD
                        A swath! A Swath of Switchbacks. 

           Donald throws his pack over his shoulder and chugs an entire 
           bottle of 5 Hour Energy, smacking his lips and wiping them 
           clean with his forearm.

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        Let’s get going! Now the hike gets 
                        tough!

           He pokes Eric with his walking stick. Eric flinches and 
           glares at his dad with a shriveled face. 

           EXT. GRAND CANYON TRAIL - BRIDGE - AFTERNOON

           They cross the Colorado River on a large metal footbridge. 
           The South side of the Canyon is subject to direct sunlight. 
           The trail carves into the arid, Mars-like Canyon walls.  

           Their pace slows, and their breaks are more frequent as they 
           wind their way around the bank of the river and up the trail. 

           The rock walls have the color, heat, and precariousness of 
           rusted-out steel. 

           EXT. GRAND CANYON TRAIL - AFTERNOON

           Tessa waits for Eric at a bend in the trail. As they rest, 
           Eric pulls out his phone from his backpack. No service. 

                                 TESSA
                        How are ya doing?

           Eric points to his sweaty, flushed cheeks as his answer. 

                                 TESSA (CONT’D)
                        OK. How are you and Amy doing?

                                 ERIC
                        Good. 

           Tessa treads through the conversation lightly. 

                                 TESSA
                        Do you guys talk about the future?

                                 ERIC
                        I want her to be my future. But 
                        she’s convinced marriage dooms a 
                        relationship. So it’s tough. 
                                 TESSA
                        And I’m sure Mom and Dad’s current 
                        situation doesn’t help. 

           Walking and talking, they get out of breath quickly. The 
           climb is becoming extremely difficult. The sun scorches down.

                                 TESSA (CONT’D)
                        But have you considered that maybe 
                        she’s resistant for other reasons?

                                 ERIC
                        What do you mean?

           They reach Kevin. He puts an arm around Tessa, inviting her 
           to lean against him for a rest.

                                 TESSA
                        Just be sure that relationships are 
                        the problem. Not your relationship. 

           The exhaustion, and the looming miles, make the hikers testy. 

                                 ERIC
                        Don’t act like you know Amy better 
                        than I do. 

                                 TESSA
                        I didn’t say better. But, yes, I 
                        have known her longer. And she and 
                        I have conversations that maybe she 
                        wouldn’t have with you. Getting 
                        everyone on the same page is always 
                        good. Kevin and I had a similar 
                        conversation before he proposed. 
                        Right, Kevin?

           She flicks her gaze at Kevin. He recognizes the look. 

                                 KEVIN
                        Yeah. Totally. 

                                 ERIC
                        So now that you’re engaged, you’re 
                        some relationship master?

                                 TESSA
                        No, I’m actually looking out for 
                        you. I’m sorry for helping. 

           They glare at each other aggressively. Exhausted from the 
           hike, their emotions are raw, and battling for Amy’s 
           attention is a familiarly tense issue between them. 
                                 KEVIN
                        Whoa, check out that rock!

           Kevin points his walking stick across the Canyon at a lone 
           boulder balancing on another. Eric knocks the stick down with 
           his hand and pushes them ahead of him. 

           INT. RENTAL CAR - PARK HIGHWAY - AFTERNOON - TRAVELING 

           Mary’s eyes flick from the rearview mirror to Amy. 

                                 MARY
                        I hope you don’t think that what 
                        Donald and I are going through, 
                        whatever your parents may have gone 
                        through, it’s no indication of what 
                        will happen to you and Eric or to 
                        Tessa and Kevin. 

                                 AMY
                        But isn’t it? Where are the 
                        examples to the contrary?

                                 MARY
                        They are out there. For sure. 

                                 AMY
                        Maybe things were different when 
                        you were growing up. But nowadays 
                        if you get married without 
                        expecting to get divorced, you’re a 
                        fool. And if you get married 
                        expecting to get divorced, you’re 
                        even more of a fool. 

                                 MARY
                        As you get older, you’ll be less 
                        concerned with being foolish. 

                                 AMY
                        Why?

                                 MARY
                        Because it’s an inevitability. 

           Mary loosens her grip on the steering wheel. 

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        That’s a shitty answer. I’m sorry. 

                                 AMY
                        You don’t have to be ‘Mom’ around 
                        me, you know. 
                                 MARY
                        It’s comforting for me right now. 

           EXT. GRAND CANYON TRAIL - AFTERNOON

           Donald, Tessa, and Kevin rest under the rare shade of a rock 
           jutting out from the Canyon wall. They’ve caught their breath 
           and are packing up as Eric approaches. 

           Eric unloads his gear with a groan and wipes his face with 
           his shirt. The smeared sweat and red trail dust make him 
           appear bloody. 

           Kevin and Tessa walk ahead, still tense from her earlier 
           argument with Eric about Amy. Donald hangs back and stares 
           out at the striking dynamics of the Canyon.  

                                 DONALD
                        Isn’t this spectacular? Looks like 
                        we hiked to another planet! 

                                 ERIC
                        Aren’t you enjoying this too much?

                                 DONALD
                        I fucked up, son. Doesn’t mean I 
                        can’t enjoy anything ever again. 

                                 ERIC
                        But tone it down. Show some 
                        remorse. 

           Donald stretches his arms across the panoramic landscape 
           around them.

                                 DONALD
                        Do you see your mother around here? 
                        I see a river so strong it dug down 
                        through miles of rock. Walls that 
                        appear too high to climb. A day 
                        that started with snow and is now 
                        nearing one hundred degrees. I’m 
                        appreciating this place’s 
                        singularity. 

                                 ERIC
                        But you didn’t just fuck over Mom. 
                        It’s all of us. The whole family.

                                 DONALD
                        You act like I’m the only one 
                        pulling this family apart. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 DONALD (CONT'D)
                        You and your sister move across the 
                        country. On your annual visit home, 
                        you spend all your time getting 
                        drunk with your high school 
                        buddies. You don’t even call unless 
                        you need money. Is that what you’re 
                        worried about? Now that I’m your 
                        sole source of income? I’ll still 
                        send the damn checks. 

           Eric sneers at his dad.  

                                 ERIC
                        I’m not worried about money. I’m 
                        worried about Mom. I’m about what 
                        this means for me if you’re 
                        supposed to be my role model? 

                                 DONALD
                        Role model? You’re thirty! You know 
                        what my dad was doing for me when I 
                        was thirty? He was dead! I had a 
                        wife, a kid, and a job. And I 
                        didn’t have a dad to fall back on. 

                                 ERIC
                        Is that your excuse? You thought 
                        you’d be dead? That entitles you to 
                        fuck around?

                                 DONALD
                        No, there’s no excuse. Look, I’m 
                        sorry things happened the way they 
                        did. When they did. Impacting all 
                        this... 

           Donald opens his arms to present the Canyon’s size as his 
           apology. His eye contact is intense, and Eric seems to 
           reluctantly accept the apology. Donald moves closer. 

           Donald looks up at Tessa and Kevin, who stand together on a 
           higher bend in the trail. 

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        I can only imagine how much money 
                        your sister is gonna squeeze out of 
                        me for her wedding now, huh?

           Donald smirks at Eric. But it’s too soon for a joke. Eric 
           looks away and hikes a few steps ahead.
                                 ERIC
                        Enjoy this place’s ‘singularity’ as 
                        long as you like, but when we 
                        finish this hike and meet up with 
                        Mom and Amy, don’t have that 
                        fucking smile on your face. 

           EXT. GRAND CANYON TRAIL - AFTERNOON

           During another rest on the hike, Donald, Tessa, and Kevin all 
           gulp water. Donald sweats heavily and looks red in the face. 
           Kevin and Tessa stand up. It’s the first time that Donald 
           isn’t eagerly ushering them back onto the trail. 

                                 KEVIN
                        Ready to move on?

           Donald wipes his brow and enthusiastically swigs more water. 

                                 DONALD
                        Yep, yep. Let’s go!

           They march forward. But Donald’s pace has slowed.

           EXT. GRAND CANYON TRAIL - AFTERNOON

           From a wide vista of the interior of the Canyon, the sound of 
           rapid, out-of-control breathing. It grows louder and louder, 
           finally its source turns out to be Eric.

           Staggering along by himself, Eric suffers from the worst the 
           Canyon has to offer. The sun bears down on him. There’s no 
           shade. The temperature nears one hundred degrees. 

           He enters the portion of the hike that is all switchbacks. 
           Like ceaseless staircases, the trail zigs and zags back and 
           forth with no end in sight. 

                                 ERIC
                        A Swath of Switchbacks?

           Eric reaches the bend of another switchback. He stares up. 
           There’s no progress. 

                                 ERIC (CONT’D)
                        A Shit-load of Switchbacks. 

           White sweat-stains are caked all over his face. He treks 
           forward. The Canyon walls appear to grow around him. 

                                 ERIC (CONT’D)
                        Shit-load of Shitbacks.
           He reaches the bend in a another switchback. The more ground 
           he covers, the more the Canyon reveals how much distance 
           remains. 

                                 ERIC (CONT’D)
                        Shit-shit of Shit-backs. 

           Eric’s exhausted. With every step, his brain functioning 
           seems to be leaking out with the sweat streaming down his 
           brow. 

           He wheezes and winces, finally reaching what he thinks is the 
           end of the section of switchbacks. As he continues down a 
           flat stretch of trail, the trail suddenly bends into another 
           endless regression of switchbacks.

                                 ERIC (CONT’D)
                        Shit...

           INT. HOTEL - GRAND CANYON - AFTERNOON

           Mary and Amy walk into a hotel at the South Rim of the Canyon 
           to check into their rooms. They walk side by side but do not 
           exchange any words. 

           EXT. GRAND CANYON TRAIL - AFTERNOON

           Drenched in sweat, Eric reaches a switchback where Donald, 
           Tessa, and Kevin rest. They all look ragged and drained. 

                                 DONALD
                        If the slow-poke caught up, it must 
                        be time to move on!

           Donald and Kevin labor through strapping on their gear and 
           hit the trail. Tessa waits behind. 

                                 TESSA
                        Want me to rest with you?

                                 ERIC
                            (panting)
                        No! I don’t need a rest.

           Annoyed with Tessa by their earlier conversation about Amy, 
           and frustrated with his dad’s relentless pressure, Eric 
           forces his throbbing knees to push ahead.
           EXT. GRAND CANYON TRAIL - SWITCHBACK TRAIL - LATER

           Eager to close the gap between him and the others, Eric 
           fixates on his dad’s footprints in the path as he marches 
           forward. Eric lengthens his strides to land his feet in his 
           dad’s footprints. He makes sure to muck up his dad’s tracks, 
           replacing them with his own. 

           Eric nears Donald. Donald notices Eric catching up and 
           accelerates his own strides to stay ahead. A chase develops.

           An escalating rhythm of their pained grunting, deep exhales, 
           and boots thumping on the trail. Grunts, exhales, thumps. 
           Grunts, exhales, thumps. Grunts, exhales, thumps until: 

           Donald turns a corner and slips over the edge of the trail! 

           He slides down over the rocky embankment to the path below. 
           His leg strikes a rock and awkwardly buckles.

                                 TESSA
                        Dad!

           Kevin and Tessa drop their packs and run down to check on 
           Donald. Eric remains still as they run by him. 

           Donald reaches for his ankle. Covered in trail dust, it’s 
           tough for the other to determine the severity of the injury, 
           but the ankle appears swollen and red. 

                                 KEVIN
                        Are you OK? What hurts?

                                 DONALD
                        My ankle!

                                 KEVIN
                        Let me take a look at it. 

           Donald swats away Kevin’s hand.

                                 DONALD
                        I’m fine. Only buckled a little. 
                        Get me up. 

           Kevin hoists Donald to his feet. Donald howls as he first 
           puts weight on his ankle. Donald gingerly takes a couple of 
           steps, trying to muffle his groans and winces. 

           Eric stands above, watching them tend to Donald. 

                                 ERIC
                        Are you OK?
                                 DONALD
                        I’m fine! Worry about yourself. 
                        You’ve been lagging behind all day.

           Frustrated by Donald’s constant nagging, Eric turns and walks 
           ahead.

                                 TESSA
                        Dad, you sure you’re all right?

                                 DONALD
                        Yes, damnit. Let’s go! The sun’s 
                        about to set. We’re behind 
                        schedule.

           Tessa and Kevin watch as Donald hobbles forward. They give 
           each other concerned looks and stagger ahead. 

           Eric disappears up the trail ahead of them.

           EXT. GRAND CANYON TRAIL - LATE AFTERNOON 

           Eric rests by himself, out of breath and sweating profusely. 
           When he sees Tessa approaching up the trail, Eric gathers his 
           gear and flings on his backpack. 

           The clouds have an orange glow from the lowering sun.

                                 TESSA
                        Wait a second! I’m worried about 
                        Dad. I think he’s really hurt.

                                 ERIC
                        He looked fine to me. 

                                 TESSA
                        How do you know?

                                 ERIC
                        I spend all day reading about 
                        injuries and illnesses. 

                                 TESSA
                        This isn’t a disease you think you 
                        caught from sitting on a public 
                        toilet. It’s bad. I think his ankle 
                        is broken.

           Donald staggers up a bend in the trail. He’s pale and 
           hobbling, dragging the hurt ankle. Donald leans against 
           Kevin, wiping sweat from his face. His voice is raspy and 
           shrill as he growls from a distance. 
                                 DONALD
                        Let’s go!

           Tessa pulls Eric aside. 

                                 TESSA
                        He needs us. 

                                 ERIC
                        He’ll be fine. 

                                 TESSA
                        No one is angrier at Dad than I am, 
                        but now isn’t the time for karma. 
                        We’re not gonna get out of here 
                        unless you help. Kevin and I can’t 
                        carry him the whole way up.

           Eric turns away and heads up the trail without answering.

                                 TESSA (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry if I put doubt in your 
                        head about Amy. 

                                 ERIC
                        There’s no doubt about Amy! 

           Eric marches ahead, creating much desired separation. 

           EXT. GRAND CANYON TRAIL - SWITCHBACK TRAIL - AFTERNOON

           The trail’s switchbacks are insatiable. Eric’s knees weaken. 
           He slants forward, staggering with no rhythm, no momentum, 
           against the steep path. 

           Eric pushes on without resting, constantly checking over his 
           shoulder to ensure he’s ahead of the others.

           He finally gets a glimpse of structures on the South Rim for 
           the first time. The Rim is only a couple of miles up the 
           trail, but it’s nearly sunset. 

           INT. SOUTH RIM HOTEL - HALLWAY - EVENING

           Mary knocks on the door for Amy and Eric’s hotel room. Amy 
           slowly pulls the door open.

                                 MARY
                        Ready to head over and meet the 
                        others at the Rim?
                                 AMY
                        I don’t feel so good. I think I 
                        might stay here.

           Mary looks askew at her.

                                 MARY
                        If something I said today-

                                 AMY
                        Look, Mary, I just don’t feel good. 

           Amy shuts the door. Mary slinks down the hallway, stung by 
           the cold encounter. 

           EXT. GRAND CANYON TRAIL - SWITCHBACKS - EVENING

           Eric rests at the same spot. The sun is rapidly setting. 
           Whether it’s exhaustion or the daunting couple of remaining 
           miles, something keeps Eric at that spot. 

           From his vantage point, he checks and re-checks the 
           switchbacks for activity. Nothing. The South Rim is 
           tantalizingly close. He’s about to trek up the next 
           switchback when...

           Eric turns around and ventures back down the trail in search 
           of the others.

           EXT. GRAND CANYON RIM - EVENING

           Mary strolls alone through South Rim parking lot. She finds a 
           bench near the trailhead. The overlook areas are packed with 
           photographers mounting cameras on large tripods.

           Mary watches groups of people walk down and out of the Canyon 
           Rim. They are not Rim to Rim hikers, just tourists on short 
           walks. Mary stares down at the people on the trail, expecting 
           to see Donald, Tessa, Eric, and Kevin emerge from the crowd 
           at any moment. 

           EXT. GRAND CANYON TRAIL - SWITCHBACK TRAIL - EVENING

           Eric hurries back down the trail, racing the setting sun. 
           Eric retraces his labored steps. His knees and back throb, 
           but he moves quickly down.

           The sun sinks deeper into the horizon. 
           He finally sees the others collapsed, desperate for a rest, 
           on a group of rocks. Pale and pouring sweat, Donald is 
           hunched over in obvious pain. 

                                 ERIC
                        How is he?

                                 KEVIN
                        It’s bad. 

           Donald’s eyes barely track Eric. Like he’s fading in and out 
           of consciousness. The others turn away from Donald to talk.

                                 TESSA
                        We’re not going to make it!

                                 KEVIN
                        We can’t spend the night in here. 
                        We don’t have supplies.

                                 ERIC
                        I saw the top. It’s not much 
                        further. Come on. 

           Eric and Kevin hoist Donald up. Donald braces his arms around 
           their shoulders. Donald’s injured ankle is on the side where 
           Eric stands. Eric exchanges appreciative glances with Tessa.

                                 ERIC (CONT’D)
                        Come on. Lean against us. Let’s get 
                        out of this fucking hole. 

           The first few steps are awkward, they stagger forward, with 
           Kevin, Eric, and Donald all wincing with every step up the 
           switchbacks. Exhausted and with Donald weighing them down, 
           they make a snail’s pace.  

                                 DONALD
                        Sorry. I’m sorry. I messed 
                        everything up. 

           EXT. GRAND CANYON RIM - SUNSET 

           The canyon walls glow from the sunset. A gorgeous spectrum of 
           pinks, purples, and oranges paint the sky’s pillowy clouds. 
           It’s picturesque. 

           Clusters of photographers rattle off pictures. Mary stands 
           alone, pacing the rim, and checking the time on her phone. 
           They should have already finished. She grows more nervous.
           EXT. GRAND CANYON TRAIL - SWITCHBACK TRAIL - SUNSET 

           With Donald’s arms propped on their shoulders, Eric and Kevin 
           climb up the switchbacks. They groan and stagger, barely 
           making progress. The sun sets quicker than they are moving. 

           Tessa hands them a nearly empty water bottle from her pack. 
           It’s the last of their water. This is it.  

           The sun dips below the horizon. Light quickly evaporates. 

           EXT. GRAND CANYON RIM - NIGHT

           The tourists and photographers have packed up. Mary wistfully 
           gazes across the Canyon, seeing the lights of the lodges 
           where they stood the night before. Mary calls Eric’s phone. 
           No signal. 

           She takes a few steps down the trail, but is wary of the 
           unlit ledge. Moonlight floods the clouded sky, but it barely 
           penetrates into Canyon. 

           EXT. GRAND CANYON TRAIL - NIGHT

           Eric and Kevin, with Donald wincing between them, lurch up 
           the trail’s twists. Tessa strides next to them. Their steps 
           are slow and choppy, but in unison. 

           They rest, collapsing the center of the trail, too wary to 
           lean near the uncertain edge. Eric looks at Tessa with 
           genuine fear in his eyes. 

                                 ERIC
                        I don’t know if we’re gonna make it 
                        out.

           The cloudy darkness prevents any sense of orientation. More 
           and more trail looms above them. 

           EXT. GRAND CANYON RIM - NIGHT

           Mary steps to a lower bend further down the trail. Alone, she 
           carefully leans over the edge. She stands with her hands over 
           her face, watching the dark trail through the cracks in her 
           fingers. She delves further in. 

           EXT. GRAND CANYON TRAIL - NIGHT

           Eric, Kevin, Donald, and Tessa have not moved. They sit on 
           the trail, exhausted. 
           Donald looks ghostly white from the pain. With the sunlight 
           extinguished, the chilliness returns. They shiver and shake, 
           trying to stay warm. 

           As they stare off in every direction, there’s an uncertain 
           noise of something approaching. The hikers anxiously glance 
           at one another. The way the day’s been going, a bear or a 
           mountain lion is more likely than anything positive.  

           But Mary emerges around the corner of the trail with water.

                                 MARY
                        Where have you been? What happened?

                                 ERIC
                        Dad fell. I think his ankle’s 
                        broken. 

                                 MARY
                        What?!

           She looks down at the badly swollen ankle and reaches a hand 
           out. Old instinct directs the hand toward Donald, but she 
           momentarily hovers and redirects the hand to Eric’s side. 

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        Come on. Come on. We’re almost 
                        there. 

           The hikers labor to their feet, and conjure the energy for 
           one more push to the top of the Canyon Rim. Kevin and Eric 
           lift Donald as delicately as possible, but his painful 
           shrieks continue as they reposition him on their shoulders.

                                 ERIC
                        Where’s Amy?

                                 MARY
                        At the hotel.

                                 ERIC
                        Everything OK?

                                 MARY
                        Yeah. I think so. 

           Eric and Tessa exchange wary glances.

           EXT. GRAND CANYON TRAIL - NIGHT

           Mary leads the group with the flashlight from her phone 
           shining on the path before them. The trail’s edge and the 
           precarious drop loom next to them. 
           Finally the lodge’s lights twinkle up ahead on the trail. 
           Eric squints, assuming the elusive end is just another mirage 
           in the trail. 

           But the trail widens. The lights grow brighter. Shapes of 
           buildings materialize from the shadows. A metal railing leads 
           to a concrete staircase. 

           After an entire, grueling day of being victimized by the 
           natural world, they are giddy to stand on the asphalt of the 
           parking lot and be done with the hike.

           EXT. GRAND CANYON RIM - PARKING LOT - NIGHT

           Without stopping their momentum, they continue to the 
           minivan. They load Donald into the middle seat and carefully 
           prop his leg on the armrest of the passenger seat. 

                                 TESSA
                        I guess you were totally right to 
                        disregard those warnings about not 
                        doing the hike all in one day. 

           Donald’s wince turns into a smirk. 

                                 DONALD
                        We made those signs look pretty 
                        stupid, huh?

                                 MARY
                        You guys look exhausted. There’s a 
                        shuttle bus over there that goes 
                        straight to our hotel. I’ll take 
                        him to the hospital.

           Eric, Tessa, and Kevin put up a faint resistance. 

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        Go. Go on. 

           Tessa takes the room keys from Mary. They hug each other 
           goodbye and head off to the shuttle stop. 

           EXT. GRAND CANYON RIM - SHUTTLE STOP 

           Eric, Tessa, and Kevin stumble up the final steps to the 
           bench at the shuttle stop. They fling off their packs and 
           lower themselves onto the bench. Trail dust puffs off them. 
           They are filthy and sweaty, groaning and guzzling the water 
           Mary gave them. 
           An older couple who have just come from a fancy, romantic 
           dinner at the lodge stare at Eric, Tessa, and Kevin as if 
           they’re animals. The old couple slide further down the bench. 

           A shuttle bus appears, and the older couple hurry on. It 
           takes Eric, Tessa, and Kevin a long time to get off the bench 
           and climb the steps up onto the bus. 

           INT. RENTAL CAR - CANYON ROAD - NIGHT - TRAVELING

           Mary speeds along a dark road, following the route on her 
           phone’s GPS. The minivan is the only car on the road. High 
           beams cut into the evergreen forest. 

           Mary turns around and looks at Donald. He grits his teeth, 
           squeezing the armrests. 

                                 DONALD
                        How did you know to come in looking 
                        for us?

                                 MARY
                        You were behind schedule. I knew 
                        something must be wrong. I kept 
                        going down bends in the trail until 
                        I found my family.

           Donald closes his bloodshot eyes. As he leans his head back, 
           tears form at the edges. 

                                 DONALD
                        How far down would you have gone?

                                 MARY
                        Back to the other rim. 

           Mary pulls into the Emergency Room entrance for the hospital. 

           INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT 

           Eric, Kevin, and Tessa stumble through the lobby of their 
           hotel to elevator. They look completely spent. Dirty, sweat-
           stained, sunburned, and pale.

           Other hotel guests stare in confusion at their dirty 
           procession. But Eric, Kevin, and Tessa have been part of more 
           embarrassing scenes in hotel lobbies. 

           INT. HOTEL - ELEVATOR - NIGHT

           Eric watches the numbers increase on the elevator’s display. 
                                 ERIC
                        They should get one of these things 
                        for that fucking Canyon. 

           Dumb smiles grow on their faces as they relish the elevator 
           doing the climbing for them. 

           INT. HOTEL - TESSA AND KEVIN’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Tessa fumbles with opening the door. It takes her several 
           attempts at inserting the key card into the lock. Her brain 
           and her body aren’t working together. 

           The door opens and Kevin sidesteps Tessa to the bathroom. 
           Behind the shut door, there are instantly the violent sounds 
           of him throwing up. 

           Tessa flops onto the bed. She rolls from pillow to pillow, 
           leaving dirty silhouettes on the clean white linen. 

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - ERIC AND AMY’S ROOM - NIGHT 

           Eric opens the door for his hotel room. He staggers into the 
           room and collapses on the bed next to Amy. 

                                 AMY
                        Hey. How was the hike?

           Eric fiddles with his hiking boots, scraping at his laces, 
           trying to get them off. One boot is off. Blood paints the 
           heel of his white sock.

                                 ERIC
                        Well, my dad’s in the hospital. 

                                 AMY
                        What? What happened?

                                 ERIC
                        He fell. Maybe broke his ankle. 

                                 AMY
                        Oh my god!

           Eric pulls off his other boot, groaning. The other sock is 
           also bloody. He tries to take it off but sweat and blood have 
           glued the sock to his skin. 

           His face melts into a smile that shows how heavenly he feels 
           to be off his feet. Amy looks back pensively. 
                                 ERIC
                        How was the drive with my mom?

           Amy stands up, and we follow her enter the bathroom. The 
           speed of her voice is very deliberate.

                                 AMY
                        Your Mom and I talked for a while. 
                        It made me think about some things. 
                        Once we got here I needed to do 
                        some more thinking and... 

           Amy returns from the bathroom with a glass of water, and we 
           see from her perspective that Eric is passed out asleep. 

           She places the water on the bedside table next to Eric, 
           sighs, and turns off the light. 

           INT. HOTEL - TESSA AND KEVIN’S ROOM - NIGHT

           Kevin waddles out of the bathroom after throwing up from 
           exhaustion. He groans with each step and falls onto the bed 
           next to Tessa.

                                 TESSA
                        Let us know how it goes... Love 
                        you, too. 

           Tessa hangs up her phone and curls up next to Kevin. 

                                 TESSA (CONT’D)
                        My dad has to have surgery. 

                                 KEVIN
                        Wow.

                                 TESSA
                        Mom’s staying at the hospital and 
                        waiting with him. 

                                 KEVIN
                        Isn’t that weird?

                                 TESSA
                        It is most definitely weird.

           Tessa shrugs, surrendering to the bizarre circumstances. 
           Kevin puts his arm around her. 

                                 KEVIN
                        Promise me something. No matter 
                        what happens, when we’re married 
                        and when we have kids...
                                 TESSA
                        If we have kids. 

                                 KEVIN
                        ...If we have kids. Let’s never 
                        hike the Grand Canyon again. 

                                 TESSA
                        Deal. 

           They fall asleep on top of the sheets with the lights on.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

           A curtained off hospital room. Donald sits in bed, his leg 
           propped up. Pain killers and exhaustion have knocked him out. 
           Mary sits in a chair near the bed. She watches the blips and 
           numbers on the equipment monitoring Donald. A book sits in 
           her lap, unopened. 

           A nurse enters to check on him. She smiles at Mary. 

                                 NURSE
                        Are you the wife?

           The words ‘the wife’ hang in Mary’s head. 

                                 MARY
                        Yes. Sort of...

                                 NURSE
                        What happened?

                                 MARY
                        He cheated. 

           The nurse cocks an eye at Mary.

                                 NURSE
                        Huh?

           The nurse points at Donald. 

                                 NURSE (CONT’D)
                        The ankle?

                                 MARY
                        Oh. He was hiking the Grand Canyon. 
                        He fell.

           The nurse swats in the air at a familiar reason for patients. 
                                 NURSE
                        Why would anyone want to hike a 
                        canyon?

           Mary smiles as the nurse moves on to continue her rounds. 

           INT. HOTEL - ERIC AND AMY’S ROOM - MORNING

           In a room flooded with sunlight, Eric wakes up, groggy and 
           alone. He sees his phone on the desk across the room. 

           He flings back the covers to get out of bed, but his legs 
           won’t bend. He massages, twists, and stretches his thighs. As 
           he finally folds his legs over the bedside, Amy enters. 

                                 ERIC
                        There you are! Can you hand me my 
                        phone? I think I’ve got lockjaw in 
                        my legs. Is that possible?

           She tosses the phone on the bed. He groans reaching for it. 

                                 ERIC (CONT’D)
                        How are you doing?

           Amy anxiously paces the room without eye contact. 

                                 AMY
                            (curtly)
                        I’m fine.

                                 ERIC
                        OK... 

           Eric looks up from his phone, knowing something’s up.

                                 ERIC (CONT’D)
                        Tessa asked me if everything was OK 
                        between us. She said you two had 
                        talked about relationships. 

                                 AMY
                        Christ!

                                 ERIC
                        What?

                                 AMY
                        Bitching about your boyfriend to 
                        your best friend is a fundamental 
                        part of having a best friend. But I 
                        can’t even do that with you two.
                                 ERIC
                        Sorry. I won’t listen to her. 

                                 AMY
                        It should be perfect, I know. 
                        Everyone loves each other. 
                        Everyone’s close. But I feel so 
                        trapped. 

                                 ERIC
                        We’ll get our own space! Believe 
                        me, I definitely need a break from 
                        my family.

                                 AMY
                        But it will always be the same. 
                        There’s too much on the line for 
                        me. I lose my boyfriend and my best 
                        friend if things don’t work out. 
                        It’ll be like my parents’ split all 
                        over again.

                                 ERIC
                        So what Tessa said is true? You are 
                        worried about us. 

                                 AMY
                        Of course! Aren’t you afraid we’ll 
                        end up like your parents? Like my 
                        parents? Like everybody’s fucking 
                        parents?

                                 ERIC
                        No. Because I love you. Don’t you?

                                 AMY
                        I’m not sure anymore. But even if I 
                        was positive, just loving you isn’t 
                        enough. Love isn’t some magical 
                        remedy that makes everything fine. 

           Eric stares at her, undeterred by anyone else’s failures.

                                 ERIC
                        Is it marriage or is it me?

                                 AMY
                        It’s both. There’s too much to lose 
                        and losing is much too easy. 

           Amy enters the bathroom, grabs her various toiletries and 
           stuffs them into her packed suitcase.

           She starts crying. 
                                 ERIC
                        Where are you going? 

                                 AMY
                        To LA. I rented a car yesterday. 

                                 ERIC
                        Already? You planned this while we 
                        were struggling with my dad? 

                                 AMY
                        Don’t say ‘planned’ like it’s some 
                        evil scheme. I’ve considered this 
                        for months. Forever. I was always 
                        up front about my reluctance. 

                                 ERIC
                        Yeah, that’s why I’m shocked to see 
                        you suddenly so certain. 

                                 AMY
                        I’m sorry. 

           She fights back more tears. She gives Eric a limp hug.

                                 AMY (CONT’D)
                        But I’m sure. 

           Her tears explode as she walks out the door and exits. Eric’s 
           stuck on the bed, frozen by the news and his locked up legs. 

           INT. HOSPITAL RECOVERY ROOM - NOON 

           Mary sits across the room from Donald. She’s been with him 
           the whole night and looks frazzled and worn down. His leg is 
           in a cast and propped on his bed, post-surgery. 

           The nurse exits. Mary and Donald catch each other in a stare. 

                                 DONALD
                        How are you?

           Mary takes a long breath. 

                                 MARY
                        Seeing you lying there, I have to 
                        keep reminding myself not to care 
                        about you. 

           Mary stands up, flings her hands to face, exasperated. 

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        Do you know how embarrassed I feel?
                                 DONALD
                        I’m sorry. 

                                 MARY
                        Stop. You keep saying that like 
                        apologizing will make any dent in 
                        the way I feel. 

                                 DONALD
                        But I mean it. I didn’t intend 
                        this. You know how the last few 
                        years have been. After you retired, 
                        it seemed like all you wanted was 
                        for me to slow down. I wasn’t ready 
                        for that. 

                                 MARY
                        Do not even try to put this on me. 

                                 DONALD
                        I’m not. I messed up. I own it. I 
                        wasn’t happy, and it felt like I’d 
                        never be happy again.

                                 MARY
                        Do you think you’re the first 
                        person to feel discontent? Do you 
                        think that makes you special?

                                 DONALD
                        It doesn’t. I’m sorry.

           The feeble “I’m sorry” makes her wince. Mary paces the room.

                                 MARY
                        What do I do from here?

                                 DONALD
                        I don’t know. 

                                 MARY
                        Do you love her?

                                 DONALD
                        I... don’t know. I’ve been happy 
                        with her. Happier. 

                                 MARY
                        I can’t be with you. Not again. 

                                 DONALD
                        I know. 
                                 MARY
                        But I’m not going to let our family 
                        be without you. You’re not allowed 
                        to escape this fuck up by ignoring 
                        it. You’ll do whatever it takes to 
                        keep the kids in your life. 

           Donald eyes her like a puppy getting scolded. He nods in 
           agreement as Mary sits down. 

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - ERIC AND AMY’S ROOM - AFTERNOON

           Tessa knocks on Eric’s door. After several knocks, Eric 
           cracks the door open. He looks pale and drained, reminiscent 
           of the way he looked during the hike. 

                                 TESSA
                        Hey, where’s Amy? She’s not 
                        answering my texts. 

                                 ERIC
                        She left. 

                                 TESSA
                        What do you mean?

                                 ERIC
                        Left me. Left us. Left for Los 
                        Angeles. 

           Tessa pushes Eric from the doorway and enters the room. She 
           checks the bed and corners and bathroom. No trace of Amy. 

                                 TESSA
                        What the hell? What happened?

                                 ERIC
                        She’s convinced marriage doesn’t 
                        work. So she dumped me. She’s gone.

                                 TESSA
                        Without saying anything to me? 

                                 ERIC
                        She said she’s afraid of getting 
                        too enmeshed in our family. And 
                        considering the state of our 
                        family, who can blame her?

           Tessa spins around and points a finger sharply at Kevin. 

                                 TESSA
                        Don’t get any ideas!
           Kevin throws up his hands in innocence. 

                                 TESSA (CONT’D)
                        What can we do?

                                 ERIC
                        I don’t know. 

           Tessa hugs Eric. He falls out of the hug onto the bed, 
           burying his face in his hands. Tessa and Kevin sit in the 
           stiff arm chairs next to the TV stand. 

           The emptiness is apparent on Eric’s face.   

           INT. HOTEL - ERIC AND AMY - LATER

           Eric is still on his bed, deflated. Eyes red from crying. 
           Tessa and Kevin sit in the corner. 

                                 ERIC
                        Guess you were right. You do know 
                        her better. 

                                 TESSA
                        I didn’t want to be right.

                                 ERIC
                        I think knew things would never 
                        work long term. I just didn’t want 
                        to hear it from you. 

                                 TESSA
                        But with everything Mom and Dad are 
                        going through, I shouldn’t have 
                        been antagonizing you, no matter 
                        what I suspected.

                                 ERIC
                        Are you kidding? If we can’t pick 
                        on each other now, how are we gonna 
                        survive this?

           Tessa smiles at him, wiping a tear from her eye. 

                                 ERIC (CONT’D)
                        I just feel like a fucking idiot. 
                        You know that I was considering 
                        asking her to marry me? I looked at 
                        engagement rings and everything. It 
                        never would’ve worked. 

                                 TESSA
                        Certainly seems that way now. 
                                 ERIC
                        No, because I’m broke. Amy’s right 
                        about that. I’d never be able to 
                        keep up with her lifestyle. Do you 
                        know how expensive rings are?

           Kevin gives an exaggerated nod. 

                                 ERIC (CONT’D)
                        Thirty, unemployed, and broke. 
                        Watch out ladies of Los Angeles.  

           Tessa leans in and consoles him with a shoulder rub. 

                                 TESSA
                        Don’t worry. No one in LA actually 
                        has a job. 

                                 KEVIN
                        I know losing Amy feels like a 
                        major kick in the dick right now, 
                        but you guys were on shaky ground. 
                        Splitting up is progress. 

           Kevin beams a goofy, confident smile. Eric nods at him, 
           reluctant to believe the advice, but appreciative. Eric wipes 
           a tear from his eye and looks up at Kevin. 

                                 ERIC
                        I knew your guys’ Netflix password. 
                        I’d log in and select soft core 
                        porn, hoping that Tessa would see 
                        the “Recently Watched” list and 
                        she’d get mad at you. 

                                 TESSA
                        What?

                                 KEVIN
                        I didn’t even know there was porn 
                        on Netflix. 

                                 ERIC
                        You really gotta dig deep. It’s 
                        mostly teen sex comedies. I’m 
                        sorry, man. I just used to think 
                        you were kind of an asshole. 

                                 TESSA
                        Eric!

                                 KEVIN
                        What changed?
                                 ERIC
                        Being kind-of-an-asshole is sort of 
                        this family’s thing.

           INT. HOTEL ROOM - ERIC AND AMY - LATER

           Tessa opens the door and Mary enters with Donald trailing 
           close behind on crutches and his ankle wrapped in a large 
           white cast. Mary pulls Eric into a hug. 

                                 MARY
                        I’m so sorry, sweetie. How are you?

                                 ERIC
                        Kinda in shock. Kinda saw it 
                        coming. 

                                 MARY
                        I know the feeling... 

           This time Eric pulls his Mom into a hug.

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        Hey, at least he ended up in the 
                        hospital.

           She gestures at Donald’s crutches. 

                                 KEVIN
                        This trip’s been really tough on 
                        relationships, huh?

           They eye Kevin. From someone else, it could have sounded like 
           bragging that he and Tessa were the only ones to survive. But 
           Kevin’s goofy grin makes it go over smoothly.

                                 ERIC
                        Not so bad. A career one out of 
                        three batting average in baseball 
                        will get you in the Hall of Fame. 

           Donald smiles at Eric and joins him on the bed. 

                                 DONALD
                        Sorry I pushed you so hard during 
                        the hike, during the whole trip. 
                        Things have been... 

           Donald struggles to express himself, embarrassed and unsure 
           how to finish his thought.

                                 ERIC
                        Sorry I almost left you down there. 
                                 DONALD
                        I would’ve understood it. But you 
                        came back. I wouldn’t have made it 
                        without you. Without any of you.

                                 ERIC
                        How’s the ankle?

           Donald grabs Eric’s arm and gives it an appreciative squeeze. 

                                 DONALD
                        Still attached. Think we’re all 
                        going to need some Bad News Scotch 
                        later. 

                                 ERIC
                        In the meantime...

           Eric wriggles out the bed, his legs and back still aching 
           from the hike. He grabs two clear cups from the bathroom. 

           From the dusty backpack he used the day before, Eric pulls 
           out a bottle of 5 Hour Energy. He splits it evenly between 
           the two cups. He gives one to Donald.  

                                 ERIC (CONT’D)
                        Cheers. 

           Donald smiles and nods. 

                                 DONALD
                        Cheers. 

           They each swig half of a bottle of 5 Hour Energy. 

           INT. GRAND CANYON RIM - DUSK 

           Eric, Tessa, Kevin, Mary, and Donald exit the lodge near the 
           Canyon Rim after having dinner. Donald struggles behind on 
           his crutches.

           Strolling away from the spot where they scrambled to a finish 
           the night before, Eric stares across the Canyon from a 
           secluded area away from any overlooks and tourists.

           Donald hobbles over to him.

                                 ERIC
                        I don’t know what awaits me when I 
                        get home, but I’m sure ready to get 
                        away from here. That Canyon kicked 
                        our ass. 
                                 DONALD
                        What do you mean? We beat it.

           Donald sweeps a crutch across the expanse of the Canyon. 

                                 ERIC
                        Look at us. Amy left. You’re on 
                        crutches. Kevin puked all night. 
                        And that Canyon is just taunting us 
                        like a crooked smile.

                                 DONALD
                        Are you kidding? Our sweat and 
                        blood’s scattered all over that 
                        trail. If you ask me, we got it as 
                        good as it got us. 

                                 ERIC
                        That river keeps cutting through, 
                        tearing away dirt. Every day it 
                        deepens and grows. That Canyon 
                        doesn’t care about us at all. 

           Donald pokes a rock away from the stone embankment with his 
           crutch. He bends down, swaying, and picks up the rock. 

                                 DONALD
                        Well let’s fill it up then. 

           Donald hands Eric the rock and gestures toward the Canyon. 

           Eric turns the rock over in his hand, contemplating 
           everything that’s happened in the last week. The family, the 
           fissures, the pain. He cocks his arm back and tosses the 
           small rock over the ledge. 

           The rock arcs through the air. Sunset intensifies the Canyon 
           and the sky, as the rock bounces to the ground below them. 

           Eric picks up another rock and flings it into the Canyon as 
           well. He’s desperate for retribution and the act is giving 
           him increasing satisfaction. 

           Kevin picks up a rock, cocks back, and rifles it into the 
           Canyon, hollering...

                                 KEVIN
                        I peed inside of you six times!

           Donald leans his crutches against the stone fence and hobbles 
           so that he can wind up and chuck the rock. 

           Mary walks to the edge and looks over into the Canyon. 
                                 MARY
                        Stop! What if there’s hikers down 
                        there. 

                                 TESSA
                        There’s no trails around here, Mom. 
                        And believe me, if you’re hiking 
                        across that Canyon, the best thing 
                        that could happen to you is getting 
                        hit in the head with a rock. 

           Tessa and Kevin stand near each other chucking rocks over the 
           ledge. Eric hands his dad rocks to throw. Mary watches. 

                                 MARY
                        Hold on. 

           Mary hurries away to the car. When she returns, she’s holding 
           the electric toothbrush Donald gave her. She turns it on and 
           off quickly before heaving it into the Canyon with cleansing 
           groan. 

                                 MARY (CONT’D)
                        That does feel good. 

           They continue to toss rocks over the edge as the sun sets. 
           It’s a cathartic and symbolic moment of unity, joining 
           together against something massive and ancient. The family 
           can still stand in the face of obstacles despite all that’s 
           transpired. 

           INT. HOTEL - HALLWAY - MORNING

           Donald stands by himself in the hallway. His suitcase leans 
           against the wall. He knocks on the door with a crutch. 

           No response. He keeps knocking, growing concerned about what 
           Eric might have done in response to his break up.

                                 DONALD
                        Eric!

           Finally the door swings open and Eric stands there. 

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        What’s the deal? I’ve been knocking 
                        for five minutes. 

                                 ERIC
                        Sorry. I was in a bit of a daze. 

           Eric holds the door open to allow for his dad to enter.
           INT. ERIC’S HOTEL ROOM - EVENING

           Donald walks in on crutches, expecting to see the contents of 
           the mini-bar littering the hotel room. But Eric’s had a more 
           productive response. 

           Spread across the bed, the dresser, and every other surface 
           are pages of notebook paper with intricate illustrations. 

                                 DONALD
                        What’s all this?

                                 ERIC
                        Had an idea for a while, but could 
                        never get it down on the page. 

                                 DONALD
                        Can I see?

           Eric walks his Dad through some of the sketches. We see the 
           drawings as Donald flips through the pages. 

           They are bold scenes of personified cells and amoebae 
           standing together in groups. Scenes of the cells fighting 
           infections, scenes of them watching TV. 

                                 ERIC
                        It all takes place inside a body. A 
                        group of cells that grow up 
                        together. They battle infections 
                        and boredom and family issues. 

           Donald examines more of the illustrations. 

                                 ERIC (CONT’D)
                        It would be like a superhero crime 
                        fighter type of thing mixed with... 
                        hypochondria. 

           Donald picks up a page that has the characters riding in a 
           minivan together. The words ‘THE FAMILY CELL’ are underlined.

                                 DONALD
                        This title kinda makes it seem like 
                        family is a jail. 

                                 ERIC
                        That’s not entirely accidental. 

           Donald examines the sketches with long contemplative gazes. 

                                 DONALD
                        Looks good. I wanna see more. 
           Donald gives his son a proud, hopeful look. 

                                 DONALD (CONT’D)
                        Come on. Time to hit the road.

           EXT. HOTEL PARKING LOT - MORNING 

           Donald points to luggage with one of his crutches, 
           instructing Eric on how he should load the bags into the back 
           of the minivan. 

           With help from Tessa and Kevin, Donald climbs into the back 
           row of seats. Eric’s in the passenger seat. Mary starts the 
           car and pulls out of the parking lot.

           INT. RENTAL CAR - CANYON ROAD - MORNING - TRAVELING 

           The drive home to LA begins along the Canyon. The road wraps 
           around the South Rim. Occasional breaks in the forest reveal 
           dynamic glimpses of the massive Canyon. 

           The family gazes down into the Canyon without the contempt 
           from the day before, replaced with the pride of conquering 
           the giant gorge.  

           The car putters by a National Park sign that reads ‘THANK YOU 
           FOR VISITING GRAND CANYON NATIONAL PARK’. We stay on the sign 
           as the red minivan bends along the road, blurring with the 
           lush evergreen forest in the distance. 

           THE END.
