           EXT. REDWOOD FOREST - SOUTH - DAY

           Mounds of white powder, as far as the eye can see.

           Winter consumes the land.

           Titan trees with trunks of red, break through the glittering 
           snow-scape and stretch into the sky.  Their needles, strong 
           and green against the elements.

                        In days of old, a great famine 
                        swept across the land.  Men and 
                        women turned to the wilds for 
                        survival, but few overcame that 
                        winter’s fury. 

           In the distance, a simple canvas tent.

           INT. TENT - CONTINUOUS

           A DESPERATE MAN and his STARVING WIFE lie huddled in their 
           insignificant canvas dwelling.

                                 BRAUN (V.O.)
                        In that time, there was a desperate 
                        man whose beloved wife was 
                        starving, so severely, that he 
                        feared she might too succumb to the 
                        frost. 

           Wrapped in thin blankets, atop the pelts of fallen animals, 
           they shudder in the frigid night’s cold.

           EXT. REDWOOD FOREST - SOUTH - DAY

           An icy breeze chills the stale air, whispering as it snakes 
           through the redwoods.  

           The Desperate Man battles through the frozen land.  His boots 
           sink deep into the snow as he walks.

           A bow is strapped across his chest.  A quiver at his back.

           An ethereal tone grows from the distance ahead.

           EXT. FORBIDDEN GARDEN - CONTINUOUS

           The Desperate Man stands at the edge of a clearing.  Behind 
           him stands the redwood forest, before him, a lush garden of 
           smooth grass and white flowered vines.  
                                 BRAUN (V.O.)
                        One day, while hunting for food, 
                        the man came upon a strange garden, 
                        untouched by winter.  

           At the center of the garden a remarkable tree grows.  It puts 
           forth a white light and emanates the etherial hum.

           Twisted branches of white explode outward from the trunk, 
           bearing leaves of ghostly flame and luscious white fruit.   

           Yellow fireflies twinkle throughout the breathtaking space.

                                 BRAUN (V.O.)
                        At the center was a magical tree of 
                        white flame.  It hummed an ethereal 
                        tone and put forth an otherworldly 
                        light. 

           The man approaches the tree, moving his fingers through the 
           unconsuming flames, in awe.

           He reaches for a white pear.

                                 BRAUN
                        The man had unwittingly come upon 
                        an enchanted garden.  The peculiar 
                        tree bore fruit, which granted 
                        eternal life in a single bite.

           EXT. TENT - LATER THAT NIGHT

           The Desperate Man treks through the snowscape, making his way 
           toward the tent in the distance.

                                 BRAUN (V.O.)
                        He returned to his wife and 
                        together, they ate of the fruit.  
                        Their youth returned and their 
                        hunger became eternally nourished. 

           INT. TENT - CONTINUOUS

           The Desperate Man and his wife share the Forbidden Tree’s 
           fruit.

           EXT. FORBIDDEN GARDEN - NIGHT

           A potato sack full of the tree’s stolen fruit, hangs from the 
           Desperate Man’s, newly-youthful, shoulders. 

                                 BRAUN (V.O.)
                        Greed consumed the man.  Hoping to 
                        profit from the forbidden tree’s 
                        gift, he returned to the enchanted 
                        garden. 

           A WITCH, 40 years old, clothed in a green dress, with hair as 
           dark as the night, slinks toward him. 

                                 BRAUN (V.O.)
                        But, when he returned, he was 
                        confronted by a witch, whose power 
                        overwhelmed him. 

           The witch turns, waves her hand and he’s on the ground, 
           writhing in pain.

           The white fruit scatters as his bag falls to the ground.  

           His veins visibly throb under his brow and neck.  He 
           struggles against an unseen force.

                                 BRAUN (V.O.)
                        Showing pity for his desperation, 
                        the woman spared the man’s life but 
                        demanded his first born child, in 
                        return for what he had stolen from 
                        the garden, which she claimed for 
                        her own. 

           His pain subsides.

                                 BRAUN (V.O.)
                        Knowing that his wife was barren, 
                        the penniless man agreed.

                        9 months later the man’s wife, 
                        miraculously delivered their first 
                        child.
           Beads of sweat dot the pale skin of the Desperate Man’s Wife 
           as she struggles through child birth.  Her eyes clenched 
           tight, she breaths heavily, crying out.

                        As the infant took her first 
                        breath, the witch arrived to 
                        collect her due. She reclaimed the 
                        eternal life that the man and his 
                        wife had stolen from her garden and 
                        left with their child, who she 
                        named, Rapunzel.

           EXT. STONE TOWER PRISON - 12 YEARS LATER

           The sun glows bright.  Birds of the forest chirp and flutter 
           in the trees that dot the rolling foothills.  

           A lone tower of stone stands amidst the wilderness.    

           No stairs, no door, a single window at the top of a 200 foot 
           prison.

           In the window, 12-YEAR-OLD RAPUNZEL, with hair the color of a 
           wheat field.

           Her eyes are crystal blue.  Simple brown freckles spot her 
           face.

           She hums a haunting melody.  

                                 BRAUN (V.O.)
                        The girl grew into a young woman 
                        whose beauty was beyond any the 
                        witch had known.  Understanding the 
                        corrupt heart of man and their 
                        deceitful way, the witch locked 
                        Rapunzel in a high tower and began 
                        to discipline the girl’s mind 
                        against the creatures of humanity.

           A dove lands on Rapunzel’s window seal.  She approaches it, 
           nearly touching it, before the bird flies away.
                                 BRAUN (V.O.)
                        But, with every day that passed 
                        Rapunzel grew more intrigued by the 
                        outside world.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. STONE TOWER PRISON - 5 YEARS LATER

           17-YEAR-OLD RAPUNZEL reaches for a pile of blankets under her 
           bed.  Wedged between them is a length of golden rope, woven 
           from her hair.

                                 BRAUN (V.O.)
                        The witch denied the girl’s wish to 
                        walk outside of her prison’s walls 
                        and so Rapunzel began weaving a 
                        rope of her own hair’s clippings in 
                        secret, with hope that she might 
                        escape.

           She takes her hair out of a tight bun and saws away a foot, 
           from her shoulder down. 

           She begins to braid the new length of hair into the rope.

           All the while, she sings the same haunting melody.

           A young man’s voice calls to her from below.

                                 YOUNG PRINCE EDWARD (O.S.)
                        Hello?

           Rapunzel freezes, uncertain.  Her eyes grow wide with 
           anticipation.

                                 YOUNG PRINCE EDWARD (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Hello?  Up there!

           She snaps into action, quickly hiding the length of rope 
           between the folded blankets and sliding them back under her 
           bed.

           Rapunzel apprehensively peers over her window’s ledge.  She 
           sees him now.  YOUNG PRINCE EDWARD.

           Edward dawns a fitted black jacket and riding pants.  The 
           Kingdom of Thessia’s golden lion on his chest.  His hair, 
           fire-red and his eyes, like the lion, gold.  20 years old.

           Startled, she drops out of the prince’s line of sight.
                                 YOUNG PRINCE EDWARD (CONT’D)
                        There’s no need to be frightened.  
                        I was drawn here by your song. 

           Moments pass as she reconsiders.  

           She peers over her ledge once more.

           She’s enthralled by the interesting figures.  The man and his 
           horse, neither a creature she’d ever seen. 

                                 YOUNG PRINCE EDWARD (CONT’D)
                        The most beautiful voice I’ve ever 
                        heard.

           As her face comes into the sun, he catches her beauty and his 
           heart becomes full with anticipation.

           The perfect fairytale begins.

                                 YOUNG PRINCE EDWARD (CONT’D)
                        And you are far more beautiful than 
                        any creature I’ve ever seen.  Might 
                        I come and introduce myself?

           Rapunzel inspects him curiously, through her cell window, 
           from high above.

                                 17 YEAR OLD RAPUNZEL
                        Only the witch knows the way.

                                 YOUNG PRINCE EDWARD
                        What witch?

           The prince hops from his horse, stepping toward the tower 
           wall.  Rapunzel is silent.

                                 YOUNG PRINCE EDWARD (CONT’D)
                        What is your name?

                                 17 YEAR OLD RAPUNZEL
                        I am Rapunzel.

                                 YOUNG PRINCE EDWARD
                        I am honored to meet you Rapunzel.  
                        I am Prince Edward of Thessia.

           Their eyes locked, even in the distance.

                                 YOUNG PRINCE EDWARD (CONT’D)
                        Are you a prisoner?

                                 17 YEAR OLD RAPUNZEL
                        What is that?
                                 YOUNG PRINCE EDWARD
                        Do you wish to leave your tower?

                                 17 YEAR OLD RAPUNZEL
                        My only wish is to see the world 
                        outside of these walls.  I’ve 
                        braided lengths of my hair into a 
                        rope that I might soon climb down.

                                 YOUNG PRINCE EDWARD
                        Rapunzel, let down your hair!

           Rapunzel vanishes from her window seal, appearing moments 
           later, fastening the rope of hair to an iron sconce. 

           She tosses it out her window.  It unravels, floating downward 
           until it whips its final stretch.

           Rapunzel’s heart races.

                                 YOUNG PRINCE EDWARD (CONT’D)
                        I’m afraid it’s not yet long enough 
                        to reach.

                                 17 YEAR OLD RAPUNZEL
                        Might I climb down and jump?

                                 YOUNG PRINCE EDWARD
                        Still too high, I am afraid.

           Rapunzel sinks.  

           Edward’s face twists with intrigue.

                                 YOUNG PRINCE EDWARD (CONT’D)
                        I will fashion a ladder high enough 
                        and will return with an army to 
                        free you!

                                 17 YEAR OLD RAPUNZEL
                        You will?  How I hope you will!  
                        Please!

           Excitement flitters in the innocent girl’s voice.  She melts. 

                                 YOUNG PRINCE EDWARD
                        My loyalty is yours.  I vow it, my 
                        princess.

                        Then, I shall be in waiting until 
                        you’ve returned, Prince Edward of

                        Rapunzel held young Prince Edward’s 
                        vow dear, locking it deep in her 
                        heart.  She fell, madly in love and 
                        waited for him to return, that they 
                        might live together in happiness 
                        forever after.

           The soldiers’ armor, a metallic clank, as they ride atop 
           their galloping steeds.

           The orange glow of their torches reflects from their silver 
           gear.  25 knights, lead by Young Prince Edward.

           The crest of Thessia’s golden lion, waves.

           Rapunzel’s rope of woven hair still hangs from the iron 
           sconce.  Floating high above the ground.

           Soldiers urgently move and assemble sections of a grand 
           ladder.  

           INT. STONE TOWER PRISON - CONTINUOUS

           Edward steps through the window of the bleak cell to find 
           that all of Rapunzel’s possessions have been cleared away. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. MOUNTAIN PASS - MORNING

           A single white tower rising over an ivory castle.

           A man-made fortress among nature’s magnificent beauty.  
           Nestled among the majestic redwoods, atop a southern 
           mountain.

           A grand staircase stretches to the entryway of the forgotten 
           structure of stone.   

                                 BRAUN (V.O.)
                        Having learned of Prince Edward’s 
                        plot to free Rapunzel, the witch 
                        took her to a secluded castle atop 
                        a mountain, so that she might never 
                        meet another living soul again.
           INT. IVORY FORTRESS - TOWER PRISON - CONTINUOUS

           Rapunzel lies sobbing on her new cell’s stone floor. 

                                 RAPUNZEL
                        Please!  I cannot stay here!  
                        Please help me.  Please don’t make 
                        me stay here.  

           Her entire life in solitary confinement.  She begs in prayer 
           through breathless tears.  

                                 RAPUNZEL (CONT’D)
                        I don’t want to be alone anymore.  
                        Help me.  Set me free.  Give me 
                        freedom!

           Her face is stained in tears.  Dark circles under her young 
           eyes.

           A white dove lands on Rapunzel’s window seal.  She notices it 
           and wipes her tears away.  Catching her breath, she reassures 
           herself.

                                 RAPUNZEL (CONT’D)
                        He will come.  He will come.  He 
                        will find me.

                                                               FADE TO:

           INT. IVORY FORTRESS - TOWER PRISON - DAY (20 YEARS LATER)

           Rapunzel’s finger nails are caked in dirt.  Bloody from 
           picking. 

                                 RAPUNZEL
                        He will come.  He will come.  He 
                        will find me.

           She’s lost count of the days.  Her movements have become 
           twitches of insanity.  Erratic.  

                                 BRAUN (V.O.)
                        For 30 years Rapunzel lived alone 
                        in the high tower cell.  Nourished 
                        only by the dark magic of her 
                        captor.

           She sits in the corner, masked in the dark shadow of her 
           prison.  She brushes her own hair.  Babels.  Trying to 
           remember-
                                 RAPUNZEL
                        He will come.  He will find me. 

           Her clothing is stained.  Age lines crease at the corners of 
           Rapunzel’s face.

           The white dove comes to her window.  She erupts in a bout of 
           insane anger.  With a scream of frustration, she rushes 
           toward the bird.  It flies away.

           Her screams echo through the redwood forest surrounding the 
           Ivory Fortress.

           Isolation.

                                 BRAUN (V.O.)
                        When Rapunzel had finally lost all 
                        hope, the darkness consumed her and 
                        her golden heart turned black as 
                        night. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. IVORY FORTRESS - TOWER PRISON

           Her prayer has changed.  Furious.  Malicious.  

                                 RAPUNZEL
                        Give me revenge.  Revenge against 
                        the one who kept me.  Revenge 
                        against the one who abandoned me.  
                        Revenge against the one who mocks 
                        me while I beg for freedom.

           Rapunzel; Ominous, backlit by the moon which glows through 
           her tower’s window. 

                                 BRAUN (V.O.)
                        Rapunzel surrendered her innocence 
                        for vengeance and her prayer was 
                        answered.  The forces of darkness 
                        filled her with a power so great, 
                        that she might have her revenge.

           A red cardinal lands on her window’s ledge.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. IVORY FORTRESS - TOWER PRISON - DAY

           Rapunzel sits on her bed, gazing out the window of her 
           prison. 
           Her captor, the witch, arrives.  Shuffles through a set of 
           iron keys, sliding one into Rapunzel’s cell door.

           As though she were a caged bird-

                                 WITCH
                        My pretty girl.

           Strange, considering Rapunzel’s aged face.

           The door creeks open.  The witch quickly locks it behind her.  
           Alone in the cell with her “daughter”, whose back is turned.

           Rapunzel grins, deviously.  At last.

           The witch begins to brush Rapunzel’s hair.

                                 WITCH (CONT’D)
                        I’ve missed you my child.

           A powerful rage swells.

                                 RAPUNZEL
                        Have you, Mother?

           INT. IVORY FORTRESS - GRAND THRONE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Glistening white-stone walls stretch high.  Pillars.  
           Grandeur.  

           The giant bolted doors at the entry of the grand throne room 
           creek against a persistent force.  They strain and begin to 
           twist until they shatter inward.

           Powerful, snake-like roots, forking as they grow, enter the 
           opulent space.  

           Leaves unfurl, creating a new archway of thick vines and 
           bramble. 

           Massive stained glass windows shatter as the castle’s new 
           skeleton of living-wood wraps inward.

           The throne room becomes wilderness with remnants of white-
           stone.  

           She brings the outside world she’s longed for, to her.

           INT. IVORY FORTRESS - TOWER PRISON - CONTINUOUS

           Rapunzel’s scalp begins to bleed black in the witch’s hands. 
           The witch sets the brush on the bed and stands, backing away 
           from Rapunzel.

           The blackness runs to the tips of Rapunzel’s hair until her 
           mane has lost all of its golden hue to the darkness. 

           Rapunzel eyes the witch over her shoulder, oozing contempt. 

                                 WITCH
                        What is this?

           The witch fumbles with the iron keys, scurrying toward the 
           door.

           Rapunzel stands.  The witch waives her hand, trying to 
           control Rapunzel with her magic, but Rapunzel is unaffected.

           Rapunzel twists her fingers aggressively inward.  The witch 
           hangs in the air.  Her eyes grow wide with fear.

           Her toes slide across the stone floor as Rapunzel’s black 
           hair begins to drift into the air, weightlessly.

           Rapunzel moves the witch effortlessly, toward the tower 
           window.

           The Tree of Life’s power drains from the witch’s body.  She 
           ages until she is decrepid.  In balance, Rapunzel becomes 
           young and beautiful once more.

           Strong vines grow into the space, overpowering the iron bars 
           of Rapunzel’s cell.  The metal buckles at her will.  The iron 
           door is ripped from its hinges.

           Her eyes reveal a black soul of hate.  A malevolent grin.

           Rapunzel sends the witch flying out of the tower window.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. REDWOOD FOREST - SOUTH - DAY

           A cardinal flies over the sprawling forest of redwoods and 
           lands in a tree near the Ivory Fortress.

           Rapunzel’s familiar serenade begins.  Her voice pure, long 
           and light.  Angelic.

           INT. IVORY FORTRESS - GRAND THRONE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           A HANDSOME PRINCE, 20 years old with dark hair and blue eyes, 
           steps through the leaved entryway.  
           He enters Rapunzel’s grand throne room, drawn by her siren 
           song.  It ends.  

           Rapunzel appears behind him.   

           Her hair is woven into a crown of wolves’ teeth.

           A smooth corset of bone is molded to her perfect body.  Her 
           long ribs wrap from her back, forward.  Her bare stomach, 
           tight. 

           She grins seductively, eyeing her prey.  

                                 RAPUNZEL
                        Welcome, prince.

           He stumbles over himself, enthralled by her otherworldly 
           beauty.

           She comes in for his kiss.  He hangs on her lips.  She 
           gracefully moves with him, against the wall.

           Vines of black ivy grow toward the unsuspecting prince, 
           writhing and unfurling at her command.  They move up his legs 
           and bind him where he stands.

           She holds him in her kiss.  His skin deteriorates until he is 
           bone.  He lands seated in a throne of ivy, as it grows 
           beneath him.

                                                          CUT TO BLACK:

           INT. CASTLE THESSIA - THRONE ROOM - 10 YEARS LATER

           A grey stone, throne room.  Banners of red, hang.  Thessia’s 
           golden lion crest.

           Castle Thessia’s throne room is particularly elaborate 
           tonight. 

           Illustrious decor.  A regal gala.  A gathering of royal 
           magnitude.  Boisterous chatter echoes between the high 
           archways and stained glass windows.   

           Sconces ablaze.  A band of musical men play for the party.

           The King’s Guard, soldiers and the social elite banter as 
           they tap endless wine.

           In the throne, KING EDWARD, 60 years old now, observes.  His 
           hair, still red.  He’s grown stern with age.  Dressed in 
           black, royal clothing.
           At his side, QUEEN MARIE, stunning in her early 60’s.  Her 
           chin high.  Natural.  A comfortable and kind smile.

           Their son, PRINCE CAVILL, is among the crowd, laughing with a 
           few of his male peers.  He bears a striking resemblance to 
           his father Edward.  

           His jaw is square.  His heavy brow is framed by his fire-red, 
           Irish hair.  Golden eyes.  21 years old.  

           King Edward turns to his queen.

                                 KING EDWARD
                        Join me?

           The queen nods, standing with him.  

           They step forward, landing front and center.  Edward 
           addresses the crowd.

                                 KING EDWARD (CONT’D)
                        Attention!  Attention, this way.

           A few final jokes ricochet.  Their accompanied laughs die 
           down as well. 

                                 KING EDWARD (CONT’D)
                        Though I, as most of you, need no 
                        reason to enjoy wine, tonight we 
                        gather to celebrate Cavill.  

           Edward extends his hand toward Cavill, beckoning him to the 
           front of the room.  

           Cavill smiles uncomfortably.  His friend’s toss his hair and 
           poke, shoving him forward.  Cavill gives in, moving for his 
           father and mother.

           Cheers.

           Cavill kisses his glowing mother’s cheek.

           The room falls quiet again as the prince lands beside his 
           father.

                                 KING EDWARD (CONT’D)
                        Another year closer to the throne.

           The comment reeks of strangely placed disdain.

           Marie’s smile grows wider through her side-eyed frustration.

           Edward puts his hand on Cavill’s shoulder.
                                 KING EDWARD (CONT’D)
                        My heir.  Sure to grow into a 
                        powerful king.  One day. 

           Cavill glances at the king, who gives him the floor.

           Cavill has more charisma in his pinky than his father has in 
           his entire body.

           Kind.  Grateful.  Genuine.

                                 PRINCE CAVILL
                        Thank you all, so much, for being 
                        here to celebrate with me.  Where 
                        would I be without any of you?

           He gestures to his friend, SAMUEL.

                                 PRINCE CAVILL (CONT’D)
                        Without you, Samuel, I would have 
                        never learned which end of a sword 
                        to swing.  

           Cavill rethinks it.

                                 PRINCE CAVILL (CONT’D)
                        Not that I learned well, but at 
                        least which end to swing.

           Cavill controls the crowd.  They hang in his charm.  He turns 
           to another friend, BRADLEY.

                                 PRINCE CAVILL (CONT’D)
                        Bradley, you have helped me wade 
                        through my endless bout with love.  
                        All my fickle heart’s desires.  My 
                        moral sounding board.

           He sets his sites on his friend, GABRIEL.

                                 PRINCE CAVILL (CONT’D)
                        Without you, Gabriel, well- I’d 
                        have fallen down that cliff as a 
                        child.  I would be dead.

           The on-lookers laugh at Cavill’s grand delivery.  He glances 
           to the king.

                                 PRINCE CAVILL (CONT’D)
                        My father might have had to work at 
                        a second son!

           The laughter grows.  
           Edward folds his hands behind his back, uncomfortably.

           Marie eyes her husband, calming him.

                                 PRINCE CAVILL (CONT’D)
                        But, really.  My life is something 
                        special because of all of you.  
                        What all of you bring to my days.  
                        It is, of course, a blessing and a 
                        burden to bear the weight of, one 
                        day, becoming king.  But you, my 
                        friends, make it seem manageable.  
                        You make it a crown worth wearing.  
                        A kingdom worth saving.  I love 
                        you.  Now, let us drink!

           The crowd explodes with applause.

                                 PARTY PATRON #1
                        To Cavill!

           The entire party joins in the toast.

                                 PARTY PATRONS
                        To Cavill!

           And they drink.  The room fills with the sounds of laughter 
           once more. 

           Cavill turns and embraces his mother, who holds him tightly.

           King Edward leans in, overwhelmed with frustration.

                                 KING EDWARD
                        A kingdom worth saving?

           He releases his mother and sarcastically glances at his 
           father.

                                 PRINCE CAVILL
                        I am terrible with speeches.

           As Cavill returns to his friends, they accept him with open 
           arms and shouts of approval.

           Samuel pushes a goblet of wine into Cavill’s hand.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CASTLE THESSIA - HALLWAY - HOURS LATER

           The royal gathering has subsided.  The castle is silent.
           Marie and Cavill walk a long hallway of stone.  A simple 
           comfort on Marie’s face.  

                                 QUEEN MARIE
                        There was a time when your father 
                        was not such a stern man.

           He jokes, light-hearted.

                                 PRINCE CAVILL
                        Before I was born.

           She laughs.

                                 QUEEN MARIE
                        He loves you Cavill.

                                 PRINCE CAVILL
                        In his way.

           They continue onward.

                                 PRINCE CAVILL (CONT’D)
                        I only hope to grow on what he has 
                        built.  What more could a father 
                        want from his son, than to honor 
                        his work and help it forward, into 
                        a new day? 

           They land at the door to Cavill’s bedroom.

                                 QUEEN MARIE
                        I am so proud of you.  I am so 
                        thankful for you.  Be you a king or 
                        pig farmer. 

           Cavill is her world.

                                 PRINCE CAVILL
                        I quite like pigs.

                                 QUEEN MARIE
                        I love you.

           She embraces him.

                                 PRINCE CAVILL
                        And I, you.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. CASTLE THESSIA - CAVILL’S CHAMBER - THAT NIGHT

           Cavill sleeps.  A warming fire burns in its place across the 
           room.

           Blue moonlight dances over the pine forest and moves across 
           the rolling hills of green just outside Cavill’s window.

           Rapunzel’s familiar melody grows from the south.  Faint.

           He’s woken.

           Her siren song draws him to the overlook.  He peers into the 
           great distance.

           The land is eerie in the twilight hour.  A vast, unexplored 
           ocean of earth, calling the sailor.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. PINE FOREST - DAY

           Beams of light bolt through the breaks in the needled forest 
           trees.  

           Stillness.

           Her blue eyes glow in the sunlight.  Strands of her golden 
           hair dance across her freckled nose.

           ELISE.  20.

           Her fingers blush against the harsh bowstring as she draws.

           The thunderous rumble of a sprinting stallion’s gallop breaks 
           the peaceful scene, sending a flock of birds scattering.

           Her target, a six point buck, spooks, taking flight.

           She exhales.  Retracts her bow and sheaths her arrow.

           Over her shoulder, she sees a man, dressed in fitted royal 
           regalia, atop his monstrous horse.

           A sudden realization comes over her.  

                                 ELISE
                        Stop!

           His horse gallops onward.  Elise gives chase, waving her arms 
           in the air.  
           In the path, ahead of the speeding traveler, is a thin line 
           of twine.  The mechanism for a net trap, which he’ll soon 
           trip.

           She races forward, trying to edge out his horse’s route.

                                 ELISE (CONT’D)
                        Watch out!  There’s a trap!

           He continues, unaware.  

                                 ELISE (CONT’D)
                        There’s a trap!  Stop!

           Finally, moments before the horse makes it to the line, Elise 
           draws an arrow and lets it fly.

           A true shot.

           The arrow cuts through the twine and the mechanism trips.  A 
           heavy boulder plummets to the forest floor.  Leafy camouflage 
           scatters as the hidden net is yanked into the air.

           The man pulls back.  His horse dances as it spins to a halt.

           She slings her bow over her shoulder, annoyed.

           The beast trots toward Elise.  On his mount, Prince Cavill. 

           He dismounts and approaches her, removing his riding gloves. 

           Cavill is aloof.  Separated from reality.  A shell of the 
           life-of-the-party prince from two nights prior.

                                 PRINCE CAVILL
                        I am sorry.  I did not see you.

                                 ELISE
                        Lucky I saw you.  These are hunting 
                        woods, you should be careful about 
                        riding like that through here.

                                 PRINCE CAVILL
                        I will be sure to.  Thank you for 
                        your help.

           Elise catches up with herself, cooling off.  

           She finally takes note of his royal wardrobe.

           Cavill begins to come out of his daze.  He extends his hand.
                                 PRINCE CAVILL (CONT’D)
                        I apologize, I should have 
                        introduced myself.  I am Prince 
                        Cavill of Thessia.

           Elise eyes him curiously.  Doesn’t take his hand.

                                 ELISE
                        What brings you to South Shire?

           He recoils his palm.

                                 PRINCE CAVILL
                        Passing through.

           Cavill is nearly himself again, realizing that he’s hungry.

                                 PRINCE CAVILL (CONT’D)
                        But, it has been a two day journey 
                        thus far and I am embarrassed to 
                        say that I have come, somewhat, ill-
                        prepared. 

           He notices the rabbit carcasses piled in a cart just behind 
           Elise. 

                                 PRINCE CAVILL (CONT’D)
                        If you wouldn’t mind cooking some 
                        of that meat, I’d be grateful.  

           She minds.

                                 ELISE
                        The king’s tax already starves all 
                        of South Shire.  I cannot imagine 
                        anything I would like less, than to 
                        give you the food off our table as 
                        well.

                                 PRINCE CAVILL
                        Miss.

                                 ELISE
                        Miss?

                                 PRINCE CAVILL
                        I still do not know your name.

                                 ELISE
                        Elise.  My name is Elise.

           She mocks a curtsey. 
                                 PRINCE CAVILL
                        Pleased to meet you, Elise.  Though 
                        I may dress in royal clothes, ride 
                        atop a royal horse and bear 
                        striking similarities to my father, 
                        I assure you, I am not him.  I am, 
                        however, very hungry and I would 
                        like very much, to eat.  I hope you 
                        might show a stranger kindness?

           He reaches into a pouch, removing 5 gold pieces.

           He smiles.  All charm.

                                 ELISE
                        Alright, but only as a kindness.

           She takes the offering.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. PINE FOREST - AN HOUR LATER

           The sun is beginning to set.  Dusk rolls across the land. 

           One of her rabbits has been skinned and strung across a spit.  
           The flames flitter across its browning skin.

           Cavill’s horse drinks from a nearby stream.

           Elise and Cavill are seated near a makeshift fire pit, mid-
           conversation.

                                 CAVILL
                        -and I, being 16 years old, was the 
                        only person he would let on his 
                        mount.  So, he chose me more than I 
                        him.  The big beast.

           Cavill looks over his shoulder at his beast.

                                 PRINCE CAVILL
                        Is that not right, Luke?

           She smiles.

                                 ELISE
                        Luke.  It fits him.

                                 PRINCE CAVILL
                        I think so.
           Elise pulls the rabbit from the fire and tears pieces of its 
           meat for Cavill, taking some for herself.

                                 ELISE
                        It is getting late.  Where will you 
                        set camp for the night?

                                 PRINCE CAVILL
                        Here, I guess.  I had not put much 
                        thought to it.

           He eats.

                                 ELISE
                        You are not going to tell me where 
                        you are going?

           He points south, toward the mountain.  

           She chuckles and mocks his gesture, pointing in the same 
           direction.

                                 ELISE (CONT’D)
                        That way?

                                 PRINCE CAVILL
                        You would not believe me if I told 
                        you.

                                 ELISE
                        I would like to try.

                                 PRINCE CAVILL
                        The mountains in the South.  I 
                        dream of an ivory tower.  A 
                        fortress of white.  She calls me 
                        from it.

           His eyes wonder into the distance as he recalls the angelic 
           sound he follows.  

           He’s lost there for a moment.

                                 PRINCE CAVILL (CONT’D)
                        It is haunting.  A damsel, she 
                        cries out for me.  I am compelled 
                        to rescue her.

           She laughs.  Examining him curiously.

                                 ELISE
                        Rescue her?

           He quickly changes the subject.
                                 PRINCE CAVILL
                        Would you find it forward if I were 
                        to ask you to camp with me tonight?  
                        I am not one to be without company 
                        and I quite like you.

           It’s posed as nothing more than a friendly request.

                                 ELISE
                        I have a day’s journey back home 
                        ahead of me anyway, I’d have to set 
                        up somewhere.  Besides, I think you 
                        are in need of some protecting-

           The two share a smile.

                                 PRINCE CAVILL
                        Then it is settled.

                                 ELISE
                        For a price.

                                 PRINCE CAVILL
                        5 more pieces?

                                 ELISE
                        It was a joke!

                                 PRINCE CAVILL
                        It is a shame that royal women 
                        don’t come with your demeanor.  

           He grins.

                                 PRINCE CAVILL (CONT’D)
                        Your beauty, for that matter.

           She blushes.  They connect.

                                 PRINCE CAVILL (CONT’D)
                        You would make a wonderful queen.

           Her eyes shift nervously.  A smirk as she chomps on a chunk 
           of the rabbit’s meat.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. PINE FOREST - THAT NIGHT

           Sounds of the forest night’s orchestra play.  Crickets and 
           frogs of the stream, chirp.  Owls chime in.

           Elise and Cavill are wrapped under separate blankets.  
           The last embers of the fire burn.

           Elise gazes at the prince, noting the gentle curve of his 
           nose and soft lips, intrigued by his shape and kindness.

           Her eyes fall heavy.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. PINE FOREST - MORNING

           Sunlight wakes Elise.

           Confusion floats across her face when she sees Cavill’s empty 
           space.  The tree which once bore Luke’s tether.  

           She cuts her gathered food from their hoisted safety. Folds 
           her blankets.  Packs her cart. 

           All the while a simple melancholy haunts her expression.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. SOUTH SHIRE - LATER THAT DAY

           A golden flatland of wheat meets the rolling blues of the 
           sky.   

           A small wall of rock, lines the boundaries of the town.

           Dilapidated wooden fences.  Modest cottage homes.  Muddy 
           corrals with bored pigs, chickens and dairy cows.

           A mutt wags its tail.

           Two hundred settlers.  Dirty clothes and poor in finance but 
           high in spirit and thick of heart. 

           Elise’s family home is quaint.  Stone and clay.

           INT. ELISE AND BRAUN’S HOME - CONTINUOUS

           Simple sconces with candles provide light.

           Everything is hand crafted.

           The kitchen, dining room and living space are all a single 
           common area.   

           Pots hang over a brick fire pit.  A bunk bed stacked on the 
           opposite side of the room.
           BRAUN, Elise’s elder brother, a wide-shouldered young man of 
           23 with dark eyes and hair, sits at a wooden dining table 
           near the wall. 

                                 ELISE
                        How was father while I was away?

           Silence.  Braun stabs at the scraps of meat on his plate.

                                 BRAUN
                        He is still distant. I cannot tell 
                        what is sickness and what is 
                        hopelessness. 

           Elise ladles stew into a bowl from their iron kettle.

           She crosses into the adjacent and only bedroom.

           INT. ELISE AND BRAUN’S HOME - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Their father, DOUGLAS, coughs.  Eyes closed.  Early 50’s, 
           weathered and tired.  He’s propped up in a bed at the center 
           of the space.  

           Elise enters with the bowl of stew and rests her free hand on 
           his.

                                 ELISE
                        You should try to eat.

           He tosses.  Slow and drawn.  Muffled.  

           He begins to cough again.  She sets the stew near the bed and 
           holds his hand for a moment.

           She kisses his forehead and moves back into the main living 
           space.

           INT. ELISE AND BRAUN’S HOME - CONTINUOUS

           An ominous, quiet energy in the home.  Waiting for the 
           inevitable. 

           Elise takes a seat next to her brother and removes an 
           unfinished wooden figurine from her pocket.

           She whittles.

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. SOUTH SHIRE - DAY

           Braun holds a staff diagonally, across his body.  Ready for 
           her attack.

           He’s at least a foot taller than Elise, who wields two 
           handles with a weight of cloth tied at the top.  Practice 
           maces.

           She brings her left arm down, then her right.  She spins from 
           under, brings her left arm through and follows powerfully 
           with her right.  

           Each hit lands at the center of Braun’s staff. 

           She spins the maces over the back of her hands effortlessly.  

           Repeats the same motion.

                                 BRAUN
                        Now from above.

           She brings her left arm across, then her right.  

           This time she jumps, spinning and bringing her left and right 
           maces down from above.  

           The practice mace vibrates as it connects with Braun’s staff.  
           It escapes her grip.

           Frustrated, she wipes the hair from her brow and sweeps the 
           weapon from the ground.

           Braun notices her distant demeanor.

                                 BRAUN (CONT’D)
                        What is on your mind?  

                                 ELISE
                        I cannot stop thinking about the 
                        prince.

           He swats her backside with his staff. 

                                 BRAUN
                        Smitten?

           She glares and sets her maces on a nearby barrel.  

           Hand-drawn carts roll along the gravel road nearby.

           Sore, she massages her own hands.
                                 ELISE
                        We have always dreamed of what we 
                        might do to one of the royals with 
                        a moment alone.  

           He smiles.

                                 BRAUN
                        Bash them outright.  I’d have.

                                 ELISE
                        But, he was charming.  Far more 
                        kind than anything I’d ever 
                        imagined.

                                 BRAUN
                        They teach them how to act that 
                        way.

                                 ELISE
                        They teach them how to be 
                        absolutely magnetizing?

                                 BRAUN
                        Goodness, listen to you swoon.

           She blushes.

                                 BRAUN (CONT’D)
                        Don’t you think your gypsy-boy will 
                        be upset? 

           He bats at her with his palms and she slaps them away.

           They laugh.

                                 ELISE
                        It has been months since I last saw 
                        him. 

           He scrutinizes her playfully.

                                 BRAUN
                        You are as fickle as a leaf in the 
                        wind, Elise.

                                 ELISE
                        Why do I tell you anything at all?

           He shrugs.  

           She ponders, Braun waits for her to finish.
                                 ELISE (CONT’D)
                        It was strange, though.  The 
                        prince.  It was like, he was caught 
                        between two worlds.  He said he was 
                        traveling toward a voice.  He was 
                        entirely helpless.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. REDWOOD FOREST - SOUTH - NIGHT

           The monstrous redwoods reach high into the heavens, blotting 
           out the night sky.  Serene and peaceful.

           Rapunzel’s melody grows from a distance ahead.  

           EXT. MOUNTAIN PASS - HOT SPRING - CONTINUOUS

           A large pool of spring water reflects the ghostly moon.

           Steam radiates from the still surface of the crystal water 
           and rises into the night sky.  

           Her pale, wet skin glistens as she continues to hum her 
           haunting tune. 

           RAPUNZEL.

           Every line, every curve and accent of her body is perfection.  

           Her eyes, ice blue.  Young.

           EXT. MOUNTAIN PASS - CONTINUOUS

           Cavill comes to a plateau in the terrain, a short distance 
           from the hot spring, which he does not see.  

           Dead doves hang from the trees, bound by their feet with 
           twine.  They sway in the breeze.

           Cavill’s leather boots sink into fallen needles and grass as 
           he dismounts.

           He leaves his horse behind, seeking out the source of the 
           hymn.

           He comes to the grand staircase of white marble, leading to 
           Rapunzel’s castle.

           Her song abruptly ends.
                                 RAPUNZEL
                        Hello traveler.

           Cavill turns to find her standing directly behind him. 

           She is dressed in thin, revealing cloth.

                                 PRINCE CAVILL
                        It was you, singing?

           She admires his shape and he, hers.

                                 RAPUNZEL
                        It was I, who called you here.  

           She reaches out her hand and Cavill moves toward it.

                                 PRINCE CAVILL
                        You are even more beautiful than I 
                        dreamed.

           She smiles, deceivingly pulling him in.

                                 RAPUNZEL
                        It has been many years since the 
                        warm heart of a traveler passed 
                        through this place.

           Her fingers begin at his neck and move to his waist as she 
           circles him.

           She lets the silence consume him.  He hangs in her grasp.

                                 PRINCE CAVILL
                        I am Cavill, Prince of Thessia.

           Thessia.  The word reaches into her soul.  Her mood grows 
           pensive.  

                                 RAPUNZEL
                        Thessia?

           She moves closer.  Peering into his eyes.  Running her hands 
           through his hair.

                                 RAPUNZEL (CONT’D)
                        Hair of fire.  Could it be that 
                        Edward’s son has finally come of an 
                        age to answer my call?

                                 PRINCE CAVILL
                        You know my father?

           Rapunzel grins.
                                 RAPUNZEL
                        I once stole your father’s 
                        admiration with the same song.

           Her feminine feet grace the first stair of the cold marble 
           fortress.

                                 RAPUNZEL (CONT’D)
                        How I’ve longed for this day.

           EXT. IVORY FORTRESS - STAIRCASE - MOMENTS LATER

           Rapunzel leads Cavill up the grand staircase of her high 
           tower.

           INT. IVORY FORTRESS - GRAND THRONE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Rapunzel’s fortress remains as she’d created it years before.  

           The glistening white-stone walls, reaching high, have been 
           overcome by wilderness.  

           The castle’s new skeleton of wood and vine reinforces the 
           magnificent creation of man.    

           A throne of bone, woven by ivy, rests at the center of the 
           room.

           8 rotting bodies.  Skeletons of men in their regalia, are 
           seated in thrones of bramble and leaf.  Backed to the walls 
           of the circular space.

                                 PRINCE CAVILL
                        What is this place?

                                 RAPUNZEL
                        A kingdom of those before.  

                                 PRINCE CAVILL
                        These men?

           He’s under her spell.  Black ivy begins to grow toward his 
           feet.

                                 RAPUNZEL
                        Others I’ve called, in search of 
                        you, my prince.

                                 PRINCE CAVILL
                        I have ridden through many a 
                        treacherous terrain to answer your 
                        call. 
           Rapunzel approaches Cavill.  Her eyes longingly gazing into 
           his.

           She grows closer, moving him backward, a familiar dance. 

                                 RAPUNZEL
                        You risked your life to find me.

           The ivy creeps up his leg.

                                 RAPUNZEL (CONT’D)
                        How I’ve waited to be rescued. 

           Rapunzel has grown so close to Cavill that their lips may 
           touch.

                                 RAPUNZEL (CONT’D)
                        Show me where your kingdom lies.

           Her smile turns sour as her eyes narrow.

                                 RAPUNZEL (CONT’D)
                        Show me the way to your father.

           She presses her lips to his.  His eyes fall closed.  

           This prince does not become bone.  Instead, he sleeps.

           The ivy takes him against the wall, holding him, arms 
           stretched out at his sides.  

           The ivy moves under his neck, frames his face, tethers around 
           his shoulders.  

           He is wrapped in a crucifix of black ivy.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CASTLE THESSIA - KING’S CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS

           Edward’s chamber is lavish.  Rich woods and rare fabrics.  

           Ornate rugs and furniture.  

           A wall of books.  A massive 4 post bed.

           Thick, red-velvet curtains that reach to the ceiling.

           Two massive black ravens sit atop their perch at the corner 
           of the room.

           King Edward is dwarfed by the window at which he stands, 
           observing.  
           A fire roars in the massive stone fireplace behind him.

           Candles flicker from silver sconces.  They quit.  Smoke 
           rolls.  

           Edward raises his nose, a change in the air.

           The fireplace is extinguished.  Darkness comes over the 
           place.

           Edward cautiously runs his fingers down the hilt of the sword 
           at his side.

           Rapunzel steps out of the shadows, into the moonlight behind 
           him.

                                 RAPUNZEL
                        I had nearly forgotten your hair of 
                        fire.

           He turns.

                                 KING EDWARD
                        What are you doing?  How did you 
                        get in here?

           She approaches the king, slowly. 

                                 RAPUNZEL
                        Lion of Thessia.  How I dreamed of 
                        that hair.  Your broad stance.  

           It’s been 30 years, but her face hasn’t changed.  He recalls.

           Her hips sway side to side as she moves to him.

           His hand falls away from his sword as her hand comes to his.

           She runs her fingers up his arm.  Around the back of his 
           neck.

                                 KING EDWARD
                        Rapunzel.  After all the years.

           She pulls her hips to his.  Slides her cheek against his.

           He longs for her touch.  She speaks with a child-like want.  
           Seducing him.

                                 RAPUNZEL
                        You were the first boy, I had ever 
                        seen.
                                 KING EDWARD
                        I remember it well.

           She wraps her hands around his collar.  

           She brings her lips so close to his that they graze as she 
           speaks.  

                                 RAPUNZEL
                        How I held to your vow year after 
                        year.  I had faith that you would 
                        come. 

                                 KING EDWARD
                        I came for you.  I returned and you 
                        had been taken.

                                 RAPUNZEL
                        And that is where it ended for you.

           He hopes that she may kiss him, still.

                                 KING EDWARD
                        No.  I had no way of finding you.

                                 RAPUNZEL
                        I sang out for you.  If only you 
                        had listened.  But, you had moved 
                        on. 

           She throws him backward.  Her seductive ploy gives birth to 
           her true motive.

                                 RAPUNZEL (CONT’D)
                        And you left me for dead!

           He’s still enthralled.  

                                 KING EDWARD
                        It has haunted me.

                                 RAPUNZEL
                        That is of no consequence now.  The 
                        power of your apology has long 
                        since withered in my captivity.  

           He’s catching on.

                                 KING EDWARD
                        What do you want?

           A twinkle in her eye, years in the making.
                                 RAPUNZEL
                        My revenge.

           Queen Marie enters from the hallway, through the massive 
           wooden door.

                                 KING EDWARD
                        Stay back!

           Marie, startled, stands in her place.

                                 QUEEN MARIE
                        What is going on?

           He stays on Rapunzel, sword now drawn.

                                 KING EDWARD
                        You forget, my wrath comes with an 
                        army, Rapunzel.  I am king.

           Her laugh, insane with power.  Her eyes water.

                                 RAPUNZEL
                        Bring them.  Arm them well.  King.  

           Dead serious.  Her impenetrable glare of hatred cuts him 
           down.

                                 RAPUNZEL (CONT’D)
                        Perhaps this time, you will come 
                        and find me.  Now that your son is 
                        of age.  He has answered my call. 

           She lets it sink in.

                                 RAPUNZEL (CONT’D)
                        At last.  I have taken your son.

           With that, she’s gone.

           Marie rushes down the hall.

                                 QUEEN MARIE
                        Guards!

           Edward stabs his sword through a massive sitting chair, 
           crying out in anger.

           Two guards appear at the entryway.

           King Edward shouts his demand.  The highest of stakes.
                                 KING EDWARD
                        Find Cavill!  

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. SOUTH SHIRE - DAY

           Elise and Braun throw axes at stacks of hay.

           She tosses, then Braun and they retrieve them.  Steady, and 
           again.

           A small group of mounted royal guards gallop along the dirt 
           road of South Shire.  

           A short, stone wall separates the siblings from the regal 
           entourage. 

                                 BRAUN
                        They’re a long way from home.

           Elise watches.  Knowing.

                                 BRAUN (CONT’D)
                        Think it has something to do with 
                        the prince?

           The guards halt near the entrance of the South Shire. 

           One of the men steps down from his mount and fastens a notice 
           to a high post.

                                 ELISE
                        It must be.

           As quickly as they came, the men are gone.

           Elise hooks her axe into a bail of hay and heads toward the 
           post.

           Braun is quickly behind her.  

           He’s illiterate. 

                                 ELISE (CONT’D)
                        It is about Cavill.  He is missing.  
                        They are offering a reward.

           Elise’s eyes grow wide.

                                 ELISE (CONT’D)
                        They are a long way behind him.
                                 BRAUN
                        Assuming he is not dead.

                                 ELISE
                        He is not.

                                 ELISE (CONT’D)
                        The reward is ten thousand pieces.

           Elise, full with anticipation, turns to her brother.

                                 ELISE (CONT’D)
                        Braun.

                                 BRAUN
                        No.  Elise.  You just got back.

                                 ELISE
                        I may be the only one who knows 
                        where he was going!  Surely I am 
                        the last person who saw him!  

                                 BRAUN
                        So, tell somebody.

                                 ELISE
                        Braun, that reward-

                                 BRAUN
                        It is not worth it Elise.  You said 
                        it yourself, he was helpless.  He 
                        is probably dead!  You will likely 
                        end up that way too.

           Her excitement for the journey, swells.  It’s coming to her 
           as she goes. 

                                 ELISE
                        I know the woods well beyond the 
                        hunting grounds.  I have travelled 
                        three times the distance of anyone 
                        in South Shire.  With this money, 
                        we could afford anything we need!  
                        Food, better shelter, blankets 
                        through winter!  I could do this, 
                        for us!

                                 BRAUN
                        It is not just that.  You are 
                        enamoured by him.

                                 ELISE
                        Do not use my confession against 
                        me.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 ELISE (CONT'D)
                        This has nothing to do with an 
                        infatuation.  If he is in danger, 
                        who would I be if I did not help?  
                        And Braun, this reward would change 
                        everything. 

                                 BRAUN
                        If it is not your infatuation with 
                        the prince, then it is yet another 
                        opportunity to seek out your gypsy-
                        boy, no doubt.

           She eyes him viciously.

                                 ELISE
                        This has nothing to do with him.  
                        Or any boy, for that matter.  

                                 BRAUN
                        It just so happens that his caravan 
                        travels in the South during these 
                        months.  I am not dense Elise.

                                 ELISE
                        I may be the only person who knows 
                        the prince’s destination.  If that 
                        gives me the upper hand in getting 
                        him home safely and collecting this 
                        prize, why should I not go?

                                 BRAUN
                        It is dangerous, for one.  Forget 
                        the animals, what about the wild 
                        folk?  The King’s Guard have horses 
                        and armor.  They can move in 
                        numbers.

                                 ELISE
                        Numbers are a hinderance in the 
                        wilderness, Braun.  I am small, I 
                        can travel light.  I can feed 
                        myself and protect myself.

                                 BRAUN
                        These are probably the last of 
                        father’s days with us.

           Her frustration boils over.

                                 ELISE
                        Have I not sacrificed enough for 
                        him?

           It hits Braun in the gut.
                                 BRAUN
                        Have I not?

           She reaches for her brother’s hand.  He pulls away.

                                 ELISE
                        I am sorry.  I did not mean it.  We 
                        have both sacrificed.

                                 BRAUN
                        This is just another way for you to 
                        escape, Elise.  

                                 ELISE
                        That is not true.

           Braun’s emotions have taken over.  

                                 BRAUN
                        I am left to take care of father.  
                        Who else to catch the slack in your 
                        absence?  You decide to leave and I 
                        am left without a choice.  If you 
                        were really doing it to help us, 
                        maybe.  But this, like everything 
                        else, is for you.

                                 ELISE
                        What does my motivation matter when 
                        the outcome is the same?

           It’s a dramatic moment between them, but Elise is stern 
           against Braun’s fit.

                                 ELISE (CONT’D)
                        I will set out in the morning.

           On that, Braun turns toward their cottage.  Slamming the door 
           behind him as he enters.

           Elise is lost.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CASTLE THESSIA - KING’S CHAMBER - DAY

           King Edward’s black ravens sit atop their perch at the corner 
           of the room.

           A FEMALE HANDLER, bearing sheers, unfolds their wings and 
           trims them. 
           Queen Marie stands at the massive window, overlooking the 
           rolling hills of green that meet the pine forest in the 
           distance.

                                 QUEEN MARIE
                        I hate that he keeps those birds.

           The queen turns, addressing the handler.

                                 QUEEN MARIE (CONT’D)
                        Does it hurt them?

                                 HANDLER
                        No, your highness.

                                 QUEEN MARIE
                        It is just so that they cannot fly.

           The queen’s face is sad as she turns back to the massive 
           window.

           The handler finishes her business and scoops a pile of 
           trimmed feathers from the floor.

           She shoves them into her pocket on the front of her apron and 
           addresses Marie, out of turn.

                                 HANDLER
                        Your highness, if I may-

           The queen turns, kindly.

                                 HANDLER (CONT’D)
                        I lost a son.  In birth.  It is not 
                        the same, I understand.  I never 
                        knew him as a man.

                                 QUEEN MARIE
                        I am sorry to hear.

                                 HANDLER
                        The people of Thessia love Cavill.  
                        We pray for his return.

           Marie sheds a soft smile in thanks.

                                 HANDLER (CONT’D)
                        I suffered desperately when I lost 
                        my son.  I was guided to a woman of 
                        the wilderness, by a friend.

           The nervous woman attempts to calculate the correct approach.
                                 HANDLER (CONT’D)
                        The woman revived me from anguish.

                                 QUEEN MARIE
                        How?

                                 HANDLER
                        At the time, “how” was of no 
                        consequence, you understand?  I 
                        believe the way was dark.  But, the 
                        pain subsided nonetheless.

           Marie considers.

                                 QUEEN MARIE
                        I do not wish to forget my son.

                                 HANDLER
                        Why forget him?  He is likely still 
                        alive.  

                                 QUEEN MARIE
                        You believe that she can help find 
                        my son.

                                 HANDLER
                        It seemed that her power was of 
                        such a magnitude.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. ELISE AND BRAUN’S HOME - BEDROOM - DAWN

           All is still.   

           Elise moves to her father’s bedside and says her silent 
           goodbye as he sleeps peacefully.  

           She sets the wooden figurine she’d whittled on his bedside 
           table.  An angel.

           It’s become hopeless to her, but she loves him the same.

           INT. ELISE AND BRAUN’S HOME - CONTINUOUS

           Braun’s eyes open when the front door rattles.  Elise exits.

           He tosses in the top-bunk.  Stares at the ceiling above him.  
           Abandoned.

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. PINE FOREST - DAY

           The forest is in full swing.  Birds chirp and flutter in the 
           pines.  The orange sun burns.

           Sweat beads across Elise’s brow.  

           She moves briskly through the pines.  

           Her bag and quiver are strapped to her body.  Her bow slung 
           over her shoulder.

           The free spirit is at home in the wild.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. SWAMP LAND - AFTERNOON

           The sky is a haze of grey.

           Twisted trees of black, darker than the night.  Their roots, 
           a maze of wood weaving through the muddy swamp land.

           Grim.

           Bull frogs moan.  Raven’s cackle.  A snake writhes into the 
           hole of a rotting log.

           A cloaked figure, travels atop a valiant steed.

           As the stranger moves further, the land becomes darker and 
           more unseemly.

           Bones, human skulls, goat heads mounted on spikes, filthy 
           animal pelts, loose entrails and feathers matted in blood.  

           Crude trinkets and jewelry hang on Pagan alters.

           The remanence of a fire pit.  A spit with animal remains 
           hanging from it.

           The traveler approaches a mossy slope of earth in the 
           darkness.

           A heavy wood and iron door stands at the entrance of a home 
           burrowed into the side of a hill.

           The cloaked figure dismounts and removes her hood.  

           Queen Marie ties her horse’s rein to the twisted limb of a 
           tree.

           She approaches the dense wooden door and knocks.
           A hunched woman of an indistinguishably elder age opens it.  
           A black ribbon, tied over her eyes.  

           She leans heavily on a wooden staff before returning inward, 
           leaving the door open for Marie to enter.

           INT. WITCH OF THE WILDERNESS’ HOME - CONTINUOUS

           The living space is framed by massive wooden beams, which 
           hold large boulders at bay.  

           Earth creeps between the cracks in the rock.  Moss hangs 
           downward into the dimly lit shelter.

           Shelves are built into the flatter walls.  

           Countless apothecary jars are full of various specimen both 
           living and dead.  Butterflies, feathers, newts, frogs, eyes, 
           toes, clumps of hair, mushrooms and so on.

           A massive wooden table.  A large iron scale.  An unmade bed 
           at the corner of the room.  Soiled sheets and blankets.

           Queen Marie covers her mouth as she enters.  The stench is 
           overwhelming.

           The Witch of the Wilderness rummages through her apothecary 
           collection, tossing various plants and feathers into a stone 
           bowl. 

                                 WITCH OF THE WILDERNESS
                        You have come to learn where she 
                        holds your son. 

           Marie keeps her space.  Sets a bag of gold near the large 
           iron scale atop the wooden table.

           The witch pauses when she hears the gold clink.

                                 WITCH OF THE WILDERNESS (CONT’D)
                        I can show you where your son is 
                        held.  Sit.

           The queen scans the room, finding a high stool against the 
           wall to her right.

           The Witch of the Wilderness moves to the bag of gold and 
           dumps it on the table.  She counts out 5 pieces and returns 
           the rest.  

           The witch moves back to her jars, rummaging.  She holds them 
           in front of her blindfolded face and then returns them to the 
           shelf.
           She finally finds a jar of twisted white twigs.  She opens 
           it, removes one and throws it into the stone bowl.

           She hobbles toward Marie and hands the queen the bowl of 
           ingredients.  

           Hawk feathers, black moss, mushrooms and the white twig.

           The witch removes a knife from the table. 

                                 WITCH OF THE WILDERNESS (CONT’D)
                        I’ll need blood.

           The queen shifts uneasily as the witch takes her hand.

                                 WITCH OF THE WILDERNESS (CONT’D)
                        You are connected in blood.

           Marie steadies the bowl under her other hand, cringing as the 
           witch runs a cut across her palm.

                                 WITCH OF THE WILDERNESS (CONT’D)
                        In the bowl.

           The red liquid drips from the laceration in Marie’s hand, 
           over the ingredients of the bowl.

           The mysterious woman returns the knife to the table and 
           removes her blindfold.

           Her eyes are scarred shut.  She turns the blindfold on Marie, 
           who lowers her head, allowing the vagrant to tie the cloth 
           around her face.

           The witch sparks a flint stone over the bowl and it begins to 
           burn.  Smoke rises.

           She wafts the smoke under Marie’s nose.

                                 WITCH OF THE WILDERNESS (CONT’D)
                        Calm.  Calm.  Silence.

           Moments pass.  A light hum pierces the air.  Marie raises her 
           chin, working to distinguish the images in her mind.

                                 WITCH OF THE WILDERNESS (CONT’D)
                        The soul.  The blood.  Connected.  
                        Eternal.

                                 QUEEN MARIE
                        I see Thessia.  The castle.
                                 WITCH OF THE WILDERNESS
                        Go beyond what you know.  Let your 
                        mind sleep.

           The ringing grows.  The witch continues to sway the burning 
           bowl under Marie’s nose.

                                 WITCH OF THE WILDERNESS (CONT’D)
                        Breath.

           Marie takes a deep breath.

                                 WITCH OF THE WILDERNESS (CONT’D)
                        Be the air.  Around you.  Grow.  
                        Around the trees.  In the distance.  
                        The sky.  Grow farther.

                                 QUEEN MARIE
                        I see a forest of titan trees.  
                        Red.  

                                 WITCH OF THE WILDERNESS
                        Think on your son.  Think on his 
                        face.  What do you see?

           Marie smiles.

                                 QUEEN MARIE
                        His smile.

                                 WITCH OF THE WILDERNESS
                        Beyond what you know.  What does he 
                        feel?  Now?

           Marie frowns at first, feeling silence from him.  Thinking it 
           could be death.

                                 QUEEN MARIE
                        Quiet.  Silence.  

                                 WITCH OF THE WILDERNESS
                        Now feel what he does.

           Marie goes silent.

                                 WITCH OF THE WILDERNESS (CONT’D)
                        What does he remember?

           The ringing grows in Marie’s ears.  It’s piercing.  A 
           culmination of sound until-
                                 QUEEN MARIE
                        I see a white fortress.  That is 
                        where she holds him!  The southern 
                        mountains.  

           The queen removes her blindfold.

                                 QUEEN MARIE (CONT’D)
                        He is alive!

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. SOUTHERN PINE FOREST - DAY

           Elise moves briskly through the descending terrain.

           A blood-red cardinal lands on a nearby branch.

           In the distance, Elise spots a buck.  Six points, like the 
           one she’d nearly downed when the prince interrupted her.

           She pauses in her place.  Draws an arrow.

           Steadies.

           A vicious snarl comes from her blind-side.

           She cautiously turns.  A dire wolf.  Black.  Twice her size.  

           Saliva trembles in the aggressive breath of the beast’s 
           exposed fangs.

           It lunges.  She spins, releasing the arrow into its throat, 
           moments before its teeth are on her.

           It falls.

           Knowing the dire wolf, a pack animal, she readies another 
           arrow.

           Scans the terrain.  

           Another stalks toward her from over a high rock.  A short 
           distance ahead.  Another flanks on her right.

           A final joins from the left.

           They notice when the buck scampers away, but their sites are 
           on Elise now.

           She aims at the center, closest, wolf.
           It snarls and snaps.  Leaping from the high rock, pursuing 
           her with all of its vicious might.

           She releases the arrow into the wolf.  It falls dead. 

           She draws and launches another arrow, barely having time to 
           finish the third attacking wolf.

           She draws another arrow, aiming it at the final dire wolf.

           The wolf is calm.  It makes human-like eye contact.  

           Elise lowers her bow, her arrow still cocked. 

           She allows the animal its choice.     

           The wolf watches her as it walks away.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. PINE FOREST - RIVER BANK - LATER THAT DAY

           A pale grey sky floats above.  The air is dry and frigid.

           Elise’s heavy breath turns to steam as she walks, briskly.

           She comes a still river.  Removes her pack.  Breaths into her 
           palms.  

           She eyes the water with dismay before removing her vest and 
           then her cotton shirt.  

           Her long, thin, back is bare.

           She puts the vest on without the shirt.  Rolls the shirt into 
           her bag.  Removes her boots.

           She ties her hair up with a length of twine.

           She hoists her bag and boots over her head and forges across 
           the cold river.  

           Her quiver and bow, still strapped across her body. 

           She’s up to her chest in water.

           Finally, at the other side, she drops her boots and bag.  
           Shivering.

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. PINE FOREST - RIVER BANK - THAT NIGHT

           Elise’s vest and pants are draped over a branch.  The fire 
           below dries them.  She’s wrapped in her blanket.

           A pack of coyotes laugh in the distance. 

           Elise’s eyes are full of sorrow.  Far from home.  Her fight 
           with Braun.  Her father.

           She allows herself to break.  Feeling alone, she remembers a 
           prayer.

                                 ELISE
                        What is far, will soon be near.  I 
                        will not fear what I am bound to 
                        face.  I will not want for what I 
                        soon, will have.  Though, I am 
                        blind in darkness and the paths are 
                        many, my guide is true.  Though the 
                        weight is heavy, I do not bear it 
                        alone.  Though my heart shys from 
                        the struggle, I will fight through 
                        the current.  Against the 
                        adversary, I will stand strong, for 
                        I do not stand alone. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CASTLE THESSIA - WAR ROOM - NIGHT

           A stone fortress, spare of furnishings.  A giant table at the 
           center.  A large map lies unfurled, orange in the flickering 
           torch light.

           Red tapestries with the king’s golden lion insignia hang.

           Edward stands a short distance from his wife, whose back is 
           turned. 

           He oozes contempt.  Eyes ablaze.

                                 KING EDWARD
                        Do you think you are not watched at 
                        every second of every hour?  
                        Especially now!

           He explodes, bringing his hand hard into the wooden table.
                                 KING EDWARD (CONT’D)
                        Do you think, I would send men at 
                        the suggestion of an insane, 
                        vagrant woman who makes her home in 
                        a swamp? 

           Marie lowers her eyes.  Edward encroaches.  Spins her by her 
           shoulder so that she faces him. 

           Edward takes hold of her bandaged hand.  Blooded by the 
           witch.

                                 KING EDWARD (CONT’D)
                        It is unbecoming of the queen to 
                        have dealings with a pagan.  You 
                        will be labelled a heretic, they 
                        will demand your head on a stake!

           He squeezes.  She cringes as her hand buckles in his grip.

                                 KING EDWARD (CONT’D)
                        Am I not doing everything I can, 
                        Marie?  How am I to control a 
                        kingdom, if I cannot control my 
                        wife?

           Marie pushes Edward, freeing herself.

                                 QUEEN MARIE
                        You have failed to find Cavill!  He 
                        waits in the southern mountains in 
                        a fortress of white.  Go and save 
                        my son, before it is too late!

           Edward is unbending.  Rigid.

                                 KING EDWARD
                        I have sent trained scouts.  Search 
                        parties.  I will find Cavill 
                        through honest means, from a 
                        trustworthy source and when that 
                        occurs.  I will send my legions to 
                        have my heir returned.

           The corners of Marie’s mouth twist with animosity.

                                 QUEEN MARIE
                        If my son dies because you do not 
                        listen to what I have said tonight, 
                        I will kill you myself.  

           Edward lets her threat sink in, waiting to hear Marie’s 
           regret.  It does not come.
           She leaves him there.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. SOUTHERN PINE FOREST - EVENING

           Elise has made good time.

           She’s reached the foothills descending toward the base of the 
           southern mountains.   

           The scenery has changed.  The pines have become more sparse.  
           The terrain is uneven.  New grasses and ferns fill the spaces 
           between the trees.  

           The sun begins to set.

           Her pace and breath are steady, but she grows weary after the 
           days journey.

           A blood-red cardinal lands on a low branch ahead.  It 
           observes Elise, intrigued.  She notices.

           A tribal bravado from a distance to her left.  Elise is 
           startled at first but anticipation consumes her.

           The rattle-clank of a tambourine joins yet another loud cry.

           Music.

           Elise changes direction and follows the sound, east.  Her 
           pace quickens as she grows near.

           EXT. GYPSY CAMP - CONTINUOUS

           A circle of 15 strange wagons and carts of various colors.  

           Each one more ornate than the last.  

           It’s a magical site to behold.

           The small pop-up town features an array of curiosities.  

           Spotted Shetland ponies trot among their full-sized friends.  

           Thick manes and full faces.  Horses from another land.  

           Pygmy goats.

           Colorful fabrics hang across ropes which stretch in every 
           direction between the carts.
           A drum joins their song.  A lute.  A violin.  A Setar.  A 
           masculine voice sings in a foreign tongue.  It’s a 
           mysterious, ancient music.

           Elise approaches the wagons.

           GILBERT, a broad shouldered boy in his early 20’s, chops 
           wood.  Black, curly hair, blue eyes, freckles, a gap in his 
           front teeth.  The “gypsy-boy” Braun referred to.   

           Elise sees him and breaks into an excited run.

           He spots her out of the corner of his eye and drops his axe.

           She leaps into his arms and he spins.  

                                 GILBERT
                        Elise!  

           They laugh.

                                 GILBERT (CONT’D)
                        I’ve missed you!

           They finish their embrace.

                                 ELISE
                        I hoped I might see you this way. 

                                 GILBERT
                        Will you stay?

           It’s what he’s always wanted.  An awkward moment passes. 

                                 ELISE
                        For the night.

           Disappointment hovers.  

           He smiles, making light of his wanting.

           She meets his smile, bears the awkward moment.

                                 GILBERT
                        For the night then.  Let’s get you 
                        something to eat?

                                 ELISE
                        I am starved. 

                                 GILBERT
                        Of course.
           He takes her by the hand and they wedge between two of the 
           carts, into the wagon circle. 

           INT. GYPSY CAMP - CONTINUOUS

           They orbit the musical gathering at the center of camp.

           An array of detailed rugs in every color, blanket the forest 
           floor.

           30 members in the wondrous tribe.  People of different shapes 
           and color.  Each one dressed in different rags and articles 
           of their own liking.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CASTLE THESSIA - HALLWAY - NIGHT

           The castle is silent.

           Marie dawns her cloak once more.  She looks over her shoulder 
           as she makes her way down a long hallway of stone.

           INT. CASTLE THESSIA - THRONE ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Colorful light is cast onto the floor of the massive throne 
           room.  Stretched projections of stained glass by the midnight 
           moon.

           The air is crisp and thin.  The quiet is eerie in the grand 
           space.  Especially compared to Cavill’s party, days earlier.

           The sound of a burning torch can be heard from a distance. 

           Marie comes to a large wood and iron door, cautiously 
           removing its key from a pocket in her cloak. 

           She twists the key in its socket and the door creeks open, 
           sending shrill echoes throughout the throne room.

           Marie peers over her shoulder before taking the torch from 
           its sconce and descending a long and dark staircase.

           INT. CASTLE THESSIA - PRISON - CONTINUOUS

           At the base of the stairs, a landing area.  A guard’s space.  
           To the right and left, rows of prison cells.  

           Torches protrude from the wall, lighting the bowels of the 
           castle by fire.
           Marie makes her way down the corridor of cells to the left.  
           Most of the prisoners sleep.  A few babble incoherently.  

           None recognize the queen or bother to notice that anyone is 
           passing by. 

           She lands in front of a particularly large prisoner’s cell.  
           VEL is a dangerous looking man.  35 years old.

           He stands ready behind his iron bars. 

                                 VEL
                        Timely.

                                 QUEEN MARIE
                        Vel.

           He nods.

                                 QUEEN MARIE (CONT’D)
                        You are called the Wolf of the 
                        South?  You know the white tower in 
                        the mountains?

                                 VEL
                        I know it.

                                 QUEEN MARIE
                        A reward has been set.  Many 
                        untrained men search for my son but 
                        none know the way.  I require a 
                        warrior of your skill and 
                        composition.  Be my champion and 
                        return him to me.  

                                 VEL
                        In exchange?

                                 QUEEN MARIE
                        Your freedom.

                                 VEL
                        Your husband won’t be getting in 
                        the way?

                                 QUEEN MARIE
                        He will not know.

           His eyes narrow.

                                 VEL
                        Who’s to say I’ll return with the 
                        prince? 
                                 QUEEN MARIE
                        I will double the reward.  20,000 
                        pieces when you return, with my 
                        son.  I can offer you any weaponry 
                        or armor you might need.  Horses.

                                 VEL
                        Armor is heavy.  Horses need 
                        caring.  I travel light.

                                 QUEEN MARIE
                        Whatever you want.

                                 VEL
                        I’ll need my men.

           The men stand behind the bars of a larger adjacent cell.  Vel 
           signals their way. 

                                 VEL (CONT’D)
                        Won’t want to be splitting that 
                        reward either.

           She unlocks his prison door. 

                                 QUEEN MARIE
                        20,000 each when you return with my 
                        son.  More, if that is not enough. 

           Vel stands free.  An ominous snarl grows across his face.

                                 VEL
                        You know of my crimes?  Why I am 
                        here?

                                 QUEEN MARIE
                        Bring me my son.

           He extends his hand, sealing the deal with Marie in a shake.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. IVORY FORTRESS - GRAND THRONE ROOM - NIGHT

           Rapunzel, seated in her throne of bone, senses something.  
           Her head lowers, her gaze moves elsewhere.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. GYPSY CAMP - HOURS LATER

           The music has subsided.  The camp fire dwindles to embers.  
           Groups of the traveling clan begin to turn in for the 
           evening, making their resting places together around the 
           campfire.

           The clearing gives way to the vast night sky.  

           Freed from the burden of her supplies, Elise sits on a 
           boulder, just outside the circle of wagons.   

           Gilbert, by her side. 

           Elise is lost in wonderment.  The stars glitter across a 
           blanket of black.

                                 ELISE
                        I dream of this freedom.

                                 GILBERT
                        I will never forget the look on 
                        your face when you first came upon 
                        our camp, those years ago.

           Elise flashes a nervous smile. 

                                 ELISE
                        What look was that?

                                 GILBERT
                        You were so taken by the idea of 
                        what we are.  You asked a million 
                        questions a minute.  I thought you 
                        might have stayed forever.

           She laughs.

                                 ELISE
                        The thought has crossed my mind.

           Her eyes lower.  She knows where this conversation is heading 
           and she’d rather it not.

                                 ELISE (CONT’D)
                        Braun is not ready to be alone.

           A moment passes.  Gilbert thinks on her reasoning.

                                 GILBERT
                        My brother was protective of me.  
                        Like you, with yours. 

           Gilbert fights to remember what he can.
                                 GILBERT (CONT’D)
                        He was a little older than I am 
                        now, when I lost him.  I remember a 
                        desert.  Being alone.  I remember 
                        walking for days in heavy sand.  I 
                        remember the headmistress and her 
                        wagons coming to me.  From that day 
                        on, I have travelled with them.

                                 ELISE
                        How old were you?

                                 GILBERT
                        I cannot know for certain.  I was a 
                        child.

           Elise turns her lips apologetically. 

                                 GILBERT (CONT’D)
                        I became strong when I lost my 
                        family.  Maybe you deciding to be 
                        free is the way that your brother 
                        will learn to be strong on his own.

                                 ELISE
                        You are not on your own Gilbert.  
                        There is a difference.

           Elise turns her attention back to the night sky.

                                 ELISE (CONT’D)
                        Braun is not like you.  Choosing 
                        your own path.  Being whoever you 
                        want to be.  Going wherever you 
                        want to go.  Home is all that 
                        matters to him.

           Gilbert puts his hand on hers.

                                 GILBERT
                        But, you are not him.

           Elise thinks on her options.

                                 ELISE
                        What I love about this freedom is 
                        equally, the freedom to leave.  
                        Coming here to stay would just be 
                        another sort of responsibility that 
                        I do not want right now.

                                 GILBERT
                        I thought that, with time, it would 
                        be easier for me to understand.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 GILBERT (CONT'D)
                        When you are not here, I think on 
                        you constantly.

           He tries to compose himself, knows that this conversation 
           never goes they way he’d like.

                                 GILBERT (CONT’D)
                        I wish that you needed me the same.  
                        I wish that you remembered the look 
                        on my face when we first met.

                                 ELISE
                        Who says that I do not?  There is a 
                        difference between what I want and 
                        what I can give right now.  I do 
                        not even know the difference 
                        between the two.

           They gaze at the stars.  The majestic purple galaxy above. 

                                 ELISE (CONT’D)
                        I wonder if my visits only make it 
                        harder for you.

           A sadness floats between them.  Gilbert tries to find a way 
           to smooth it over.  A kinder approach.

                                 GILBERT
                        No matter how far apart two people 
                        may be, they see the same moon, the 
                        same stars. 

           Gilbert turns his eyes to Elise.  Connecting. 

                                 GILBERT (CONT’D)
                        I think about that often now. 

           His gaze floats back to the sky.

           She steals another glance at him.  He catches her and smiles.  

           Gilbert decides to leave her on a good note.

                                 GILBERT (CONT’D)
                        I should turn in.

                                 ELISE
                        I am going to stay for a while. 

           He stands.

                                 GILBERT
                        Maybe one day, I will not have to 
                        look to the stars for comfort.
           A melancholy smile between them.

           Elise’s thoughts float to Prince Cavill.  

                                 ELISE
                        Maybe one day.

           Gilbert disappears back into the circle of wagons.

           Elise loses herself in the twilight.  The sounds of the 
           wilderness resonate.  

           Solitude.

                                 RAPUNZEL (O.S.)
                        You are beautiful.

           She turns to find Rapunzel, dressed her version of a gypsy’s 
           attire, approaching her from the direction of the circle.  

           Rapunzel’s hair, thick and long.  Angelic. 

           Their first encounter.

                                 RAPUNZEL (CONT’D)
                        I am sorry if I startled you.  I 
                        saw you out here and wanted to see 
                        if everything was alright.

                                 ELISE
                        Thank you.

           Silence binds them.

           Elise’s eyes wander across the sky.  Her worries get the best 
           of her, tears well.

                                 RAPUNZEL
                        Is... everything alright?

           Elise turns to Rapunzel, feeling strangely drawn to her.

           Rapunzel wraps her fingers around Elise’s wrist and gently 
           pulls her from her seat, bringing her into an embrace.

                                 ELISE
                        My heart and my head constantly 
                        tear at one another.  I never know 
                        which to follow. 

           Rapunzel holds her there, comforting the girl as her tears 
           finally spill over.
                                 RAPUNZEL
                        Dear child.

           Rapunzel speaks in an ominous whisper.

                                 RAPUNZEL (CONT’D)
                        Surely you know of the dangers to 
                        come.  The dangers you have not yet 
                        faced.  This journey you are on is 
                        nothing to be taken lightly.

           Elise immediately collects herself and moves away.

                                 ELISE
                        I do not take it lightly.

                                 RAPUNZEL
                        What is it that compels you to 
                        continue onward?  

           She recognizes Elise’s weakness.

                                 RAPUNZEL (CONT’D)
                        Leaving your father and brother.  A 
                        journey to save a man you cannot 
                        possibly love and for the king of a 
                        kingdom that forgets you.

                                 ELISE
                        I never said it had anything to do 
                        with the king.  Who are you?  How 
                        do you know what I am doing?

           Rapunzel reaches out for Elise, placing her hand on her 
           shoulder, calming her.

                                 RAPUNZEL
                        You remind me much of myself.

           Elise softens.

                                 RAPUNZEL (CONT’D)
                        We are connected, you and I.  

           Rapunzel presents a necklace.  Silver with a blood-red jewel. 

                                 ELISE
                        It is beautiful.  I couldn’t-

                                 RAPUNZEL
                        It is yours.

           Rapunzel gently turns Elise’s back toward her, hanging the 
           jewel from her neck.
                                 RAPUNZEL (CONT’D)
                        Return home.  Your brother and 
                        father miss you.  

           Elise takes hold of the jewel.  Considers.

                                 RAPUNZEL (CONT’D)
                        You need only grasp this pendant. 
                        Ask to return to South Shire and it 
                        will be so.

           The moment weighs on Elise.    

                                 RAPUNZEL (CONT’D)
                        This is not your fight.

           Elise has a hundred things that she wants to ask.  She waits 
           one second too long.  

           Elise’s lips part as she spins to face Rapunzel once more, 
           but she’s already gone.

           Elise hangs in the mysterious moment.  Her hand on the 
           necklace around her neck. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. SOUTHERN THESSIA WILDERNESS - DAWN

           Four men, the queen’s mercenaries, travel on a path through 
           the forest.

           Ruffians, dressed in weathered leather clothes.  Belts and 
           straps harness their weapons.

           Their hair, long and unkept.  Skin, worn and scarred.

           FISHEL, the smallest of the group, leads the way.

           A thin twine line runs across the path, it goes unnoticed at 
           first.

           Vel wears a heavy long sword.  He spots the trigger.

                                 VEL
                        Fishel.

           Fishel stops.

           Vel inspects the taunt line, which is attached to a steadfast 
           tree on one end.  
           On the other, it is attached to a tall, unstable stick, 
           supporting a heavy rock pendulum. 

           He signs for the crew to step back and sweeps the rope with 
           his sword.

           The stick falls and pendulum swings across the path, crushing 
           against a massive boulder on the other side.

           BEAR, even larger than Vel, but not as quick, carries a 
           heavy, one-handed hammer.

                                 BEAR
                        Could’ve done some damage.

                                 VEL
                        Someone wants to make sure they’re 
                        the first one to the prince, eh?

                                 BEAR
                        The things some folks will do for 
                        money.

           They grunt with humor.

                                 VEL
                        Best we travel off the path from 
                        here on out.

           Bear raises his nose.

                                 BEAR
                        I smell fire.

                                 FISHEL
                        It’s early.

                                 BEAR
                        A little breakfast before the day’s 
                        journey?

           RUNE, the final of the four, is of medium stature and bears a 
           bow and quiver.

                                 RUNE
                        What fool would set fire in the 
                        daylight at a time like this?

                                 BEAR
                        A fool that wants to be found.

           A dangerous crew.

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. GYPSY CAMP - DAWN

           Morning fog hovers over the land.

           The center of camp, where a fire once blazed, has become the 
           common sleeping grounds.  

           The gypsy folk lie atop blankets which cover the forest 
           floor.  They rest as a tribe. 

           The colors of the ornate campsite are even more interesting 
           in the morning light.

           Hens peck at the grass.   

           Elise is rolling her blanket into her bag, preparing to head 
           out.  Gilbert sleeps nearby.  She steals a glance as she 
           packs.

           She straps her quiver over her shoulder, followed by her bag 
           and finally, her bow.  

           She bends and kisses Gilbert’s forehead goodbye.  He doesn’t 
           stir.

           Elise begins to make her way out of the wagon circle when she 
           spots a familiar face tussling with hay, tending the horses 
           ahead.

           Headmistress ACANTHA, the most elaborately dressed of all the 
           gypsies.  A heavy-set woman in her late 60’s. 

           Elise smiles wide as she approaches. 

           The warm woman wraps Elise in a loving embrace.

                                 ACANTHA
                        My finch, flying away again?

                                 ELISE
                        I am afraid so.

                                 ACANTHA
                        Hopefully you will come to stay, 
                        one day.  

                                 ELISE
                        I would like that very much.

                                 ACANTHA
                        I know Gilbert prays for it.

           The headmistress laughs and strokes Elise’s face with a 
           maternal glow.
                                 ACANTHA (CONT’D)
                        Hearts break.  It is the way of 
                        fragile love.  You are young and 
                        your spirit is wild.  You might not 
                        guess it, but I know the feeling 
                        well.

           Elise smiles.

                                 ACANTHA (CONT’D)
                        You are always welcome among us.

                                 ELISE
                        Thank you, Acantha.

           Acantha notices the silver chain around the girl’s neck.  

           Her demeanor becomes utterly sincere.  A severe antithesis to 
           the motherly figure she was moments earlier.  

           Her eyes narrow with suspicion.

                                 ACANTHA
                        Where’d you come across something 
                        with such darkness?

           Elise shifts uncomfortably under Acantha’s ominous scrutiny.

                                 ELISE
                        What do you mean?

                                 ACANTHA
                        That jewel hanging on your neck has 
                        powerful darkness in it. 

           Elise reaches for the jewel around her neck.

                                 ACANTHA (CONT’D)
                        Place your hand in mine.

           She cautiously rests her hand in the gypsy queen’s coarse 
           palm.

           The headmistress is encumbered by the weight of Elise’s 
           emotion and self doubt.  

                                 ACANTHA (CONT’D)
                        By not telling anyone of your day 
                        with the prince, or of the 
                        destination he sought, you have 
                        brought the burden of saving him 
                        onto your shoulders alone.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 ACANTHA (CONT’D)
                        You fear that by turning your back 
                        on your life at home, you have 
                        tangled yourself into a fate that 
                        was not yours to conquer. 

           Acantha peers into Elise’s soul.  A word of encouragement.

                                 ACANTHA (CONT’D)
                        It was no accident.  All comes to 
                        pass, exactly as it is meant to.  
                        The burden has always been yours to 
                        bear, Elise.  It is why Cavill came 
                        upon you in the forest. 

           Acantha continues.

                                 ACANTHA (CONT’D)
                        When you accepted this task, you 
                        did not know your foe.  Perhaps you 
                        would have chosen differently if 
                        you had.  Perhaps that is why you 
                        were not meant to know.  But now 
                        fate has brought you to me, that I 
                        may help you understand the 
                        darkness you face.  Because, I know 
                        it well.  Fate guides you.  You are 
                        its champion.  For that reason, I 
                        believe that you stand a chance.

           A warning.

                                 ACANTHA (CONT’D)
                        There is one who controls the 
                        forces of the twilight world.  She 
                        rules the legions of dead.  She has 
                        taken princes of other lands before 
                        yours and she will not stop until 
                        the world of man is under her will.

                                 ELISE
                        She has Cavill?

                                 ACANTHA
                        Yes.

           Elise fills with hope, her eyes widen.

                                 ELISE
                        He is alive?

           The question hangs in the air.

                                 ACANTHA
                        For now.
                                 ELISE
                        What do I do?  How do I fight such 
                        an evil, if it truly is mine to 
                        face?  

                                 ACANTHA
                        Darkness has power where hope is 
                        lost.  The spirit dies in 
                        hopelessness.  And so, the doubt 
                        that we have in ourselves, that 
                        doubt that lives deep in our 
                        spirit, is the deadliest foe any of 
                        us will ever face.

           Acantha stares deeply into the weary girl’s eyes.

                                 ACANTHA (CONT’D)
                        I pray, for all of our sake, you 
                        are victorious.  If you do not 
                        prevail, many will suffer.  The 
                        world will see generations of chaos 
                        and violence.  None will escape her 
                        wrath.  Not your family in South 
                        Shire, not our tribe, none in our 
                        kingdom or beyond.

                                 ELISE
                        Can she be stopped?

                                 ACANTHA
                        It is not my way to know the things 
                        which alter time, only to know that 
                        they can be altered.  Stay steady.  
                        Keep your pace.  Do not sway in her 
                        manipulation.  Cling to hope, 
                        though it seems futile.  And listen 
                        to fate, it guides you.  

           Acantha brings Elise close, holding tight in her embrace.

                                 ACANTHA (CONT’D)
                        There is no darkness so black that 
                        even the faintest flame cannot 
                        overcome.

           Acantha releases her.

           EXT. SOUTHERN THESSIA WILDERNESS - THAT MORNING

           The queen’s mercenaries approach a camp of strangers. 
           Four, unsuspecting victims.  No more than 20 years old each.  
           They’re dressed in simple, but clean, cotton clothes.  Their 
           morning fire burns hot.  Rabbit on the spit.

           The group of young men stir uncomfortably when the ruffians 
           make it to their campsite.  The boys are dwarfed, even by 
           Fishel.

                                 VEL
                        Morning boys.

           A zestful, rotted tooth grin.

           Bear makes a point of throwing his nose in the air to 
           clarify.

                                 BEAR
                        Good smelling meat.

           The bravest of the group responds.  Still, weary.

                        Just out hunting for your families, 
                        huh?

           Rune examines their fine, clean clothing.

                                 RUNE
                        Clothes like that, seems like your 
                        family can afford to buy their 
                        food.

                        Certainly aren’t hunting-clothes.

           Vel lets the intimidation game hang stagnant in the air for a 
           moment.

                        You boys wouldn’t have happened to 
                        set a trap a way back?  

           He describes it sarcastically.

                                 VEL (CONT’D)
                        Big thing.  Tied to a tree.  Nice 
                        crushing blow sort-of swipe, across 
                        the path.
           They shake their heads.

                        No.  Wasn’t us.

                        the hurry?

           The bullies encroach.

                        We planned to have it anyway.

                        And yet, trouble has found you.

           Rune catches the prince’s reward poster in one of their bags.  
           Pulls it out.

                                 RUNE
                        Hunting, eh?

           What can they say?

                                 VEL
                        I am not fond of liars.

           Vel takes the reward poster from Rune and rips it in half.

                                 VEL (CONT’D)
                        Not much competition either.

                        You know, I think they may have set 
                        that trap.

                                 CAMPER #1
                        Honest, it wasn’t us.

                                 RUNE
                        Quiet.

           Vel signals Fishel with his eyes, gesturing toward the pack.  
           Fishel takes one of their bags up and begins to shake the 
           contents into the dirt.

                                 VEL
                        Won’t mind if we have a look?

           One of the campers stands.  Bear buries his fist in the 
           camper’s face.  Knocks him out cold.

           The remaining wearily scoot from their places, trying to 
           separate themselves from the clan.

           Vel sees Fishel pull a length of rope from the bag.

                                 VEL (CONT’D)
                        Bear, I think these hunters intend 
                        to run.  Why don’t you make sure 
                        they don’t.

           Fishel tosses the rope to Bear.

                                 CAMPER #2
                        Please.  Take whatever you want.  

           Fishel has finished digging through one of the bags.  Tosses 
           a pouch of coins to Vel.

                                 VEL
                        We will.

           Fishel moves to the next pack.

           One of the campers makes a run for it.  Bursts to his feet, 
           in the opposite direction.

           Rune draws an arrow.

                                 CAMPER #2
                        No!  Please!

           Bear kicks Camper #2 in the face and wrestles him to his 
           stomach.   

           Rune buries a well placed arrow in the center of the running 
           camper’s back.

           Camper #2 begins to cry as Bear roughs him up.  Tying his 
           hands behind him.

           Vel looks at Camper #1

                                 VEL
                        You going to stay put?
           The camper nods.

           Fishel continues to dig through their belongings.  He throws 
           more gold to Vel.

                                 VEL (CONT’D)
                        It’s not safe for boys like you to 
                        be traveling with this much gold.  
                        There’s not a soul out here who 
                        wouldn’t kill you for less.

           Bear moves to his first victim, the knocked out camper, and 
           begins tying his hands together as well.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. IVORY FORTRESS - GRAND THRONE ROOM - NIGHT

           Rapunzel sits, powerful in her throne.  She rolls her fingers 
           across one another.    

           A black vine grows toward her.  It crawls upward into the air 
           at her shoulder’s height.  

           Leaves unfurl as the vine rolls open, like ever-growing 
           parchment.

           She opens her palm to the sky.

           The final leaf at the end of the vine opens and a lethal 
           black spider emerges.  It drops from the edge of the plant by 
           a strand of web, landing in her palm.  

           Loneliness has driven her mad.  

           She rolls her fingers, toying with the spider as it dances 
           between them.

           Her eyes move to Cavill, whose head hangs as he sleeps.  Held 
           at bay by the queen’s black ivy.  

                                 RAPUNZEL
                        What a waste.

           She rises, floating from hip to hip until she lands in front 
           of him. 

           She runs her hand across his smooth cheek.  Her eyes dart to-
           and-fro.
                                 RAPUNZEL (CONT’D)
                        I would have made a wonderful 
                        bride.  A doting wife.  I could 
                        have been yours.

           Her chin jitters, manic.

                                 RAPUNZEL (CONT’D)
                        I would have been a queen of the 
                        people. 

           She spins her finger in a circle in the air, referring to the 
           dead princes surrounding the room.

                                 RAPUNZEL (CONT’D)
                        Any of theirs.

           She rests her head against Cavill’s chest.  Tears drip from 
           the corners of her desperate gaze.

           In her brokenness.

                                 RAPUNZEL (CONT’D)
                        Foolish wanting.

           She stands again.  Loses herself in thoughts of Edward.  Her 
           eyes drift into the past.

                                 RAPUNZEL (CONT’D)
                        I would have been loyal.  I could 
                        have loved you forever.

           She steadies her gaze back on Cavill.

           Her shoulders square, her posture rises, her chin comes high.

                                 RAPUNZEL (CONT’D)
                        What might have been is lost.  Now 
                        I am a queen by my own accord.

           EXT. SOUTHERN PINE FOREST - DAY

           Elise presses on, beside a small river.

           The land falls away ahead.  A waterfall.

           She cautiously climbs down the steep embankment. 
           EXT. SOUTHERN PINE FOREST - POOL - DUSK

           Winded, Elise pulls her bow from her shoulder and drops her 
           pack to the ground.  

           A serene pool collects at the base of the falls.  

           She scans the crystal water for fish.  A few scamper by.

           She removes her boots and vest.  Rolls up her pants.  Pulls 
           her hair back, tying it with a small piece of twine.

           She grabs her bow and a single arrow before cautiously 
           stepping into the shallow water.

           She moves quietly until she’s at a depth just above her 
           knees.

           She notches the arrow and draws back the bowstring.  

           Ready, she watches.  Patient.  Still.  The disturbance she 
           created subsides.

           Small fish hurry by.

           She lets the arrow fly.  It shoots into the water sending a 
           spout upward.

           She retrieves it by its shaft.  A flopping rainbow trout, her 
           prize.

           EXT. SOUTHERN PINE FOREST - POOL - MOMENTS LATER

           Elise uses her flint to start a fire in a pile of kindling 
           and dry brush.

           Her gutted fish is run along a spit.

           A sudden change in temperature.  Elise shivers and moves to 
           her boots, pulling them on while the fish cooks.

           Her leather vest comes next.

           She rubs her hands together, breathing into them.

           She moves to her pack and takes her blanket, throwing it over 
           her shoulders, she sits by the fire.

           An eerie whisper, an ancient language, nearly inaudible, 
           creeps across Elise’s neck.

                                 SPIRIT (O.S.)
                        Nior choir duit mall.
           Elise only notices a syllable or two, but it’s enough to 
           catch her ear.

           Thinking it her imagination, she turns her attention back to 
           the fire.

                                 SPIRIT (CONT’D)
                        Nior choir duit mall.

           Still a whisper, but audible.  It’s a breeze.

           Elise stands.

                                 ELISE
                        Hello?

           Nothing. 

           Scanning her surroundings.  The cliff and waterfall behind 
           her.  The pool to her right.  Rolling hills of pine to her 
           left and in front of her.

           She spins.  Nothing.

                                 ELISE (CONT’D)
                        Hello?

           Moments more before she tightens the blanket around her 
           shoulders and wearily takes her seat again.

           Braun sits on the bench outside of his family’s home.

           Staring into the glittering sky above. 

           He stands and enters through the front door.

           INT. ELISE AND BRAUN’S HOME - CONTINUOUS

           Douglas coughs from the adjacent bedroom.  

           Braun makes his way to the stove and ladles soup into a bowl.

                        Braun?

           He sets the bowl on the dining room table and makes his way 
           toward his father’s room.

                                 BRAUN
                        You ok?

           His father lies on his side, struggling to prop himself 
           upright. 

           Braun helps.

           Douglas has trouble catching his breath.

                                 DOUGLAS
                        Thank you.

                                 BRAUN
                        Of course.

           He gestures for his son to sit next to him in the bed.  Braun 
           obliges.

                                 DOUGLAS
                        I worry that I have been too big a 
                        burden on you and your sister in 
                        these last years.

           It cuts Braun.

                                 BRAUN
                        Do not think that way.  Father, I 
                        love you.  Elise loves you.

                                 DOUGLAS
                        I know.  I know, son.

           A moment passes.

                                 DOUGLAS (CONT’D)
                        Thank you.  For what you have been 
                        to me.  I pray hard that you might 
                        be a father to children as generous 
                        as you have been.

                        Father-

           Douglas needs to finish, but he’s weak.
                                 DOUGLAS
                        When you have children, you are 
                        born into a new world.  You see 
                        everything in a new light.  You 
                        helped me learn so much.

                                 BRAUN
                        And you, I.

           Douglas rests his head on the backboard.  Fragile.

                                 DOUGLAS
                        Do you remember the song I taught 
                        you, when you were a child?  Of the 
                        eternal lovers?

           The father holds tight to his son’s hand.

                                 DOUGLAS (CONT’D)
                        Will you sing it for me?

           Douglas’ breath grows shallow.  His eyes heavy.

           Braun tries to gather himself, tearing up.  He grips his 
           father’s hand tightly.

           He sings.  His throat is gravel, but beautiful.  

           The song is slow.  Old.

                                 BRAUN (SINGS)
                        Was long ago the tale began/ 
                        a devil and an angel.

           Braun stands atop a green hill.

           His father lies on a pile of dry grass.  He’s passed on.

           The song continues.

           The grass burns.  Braun’s head high and strong.  His face 
           red, overcome with tears.

                                 BRAUN (SINGS) (V.O) (CONT’D)

           EXT. SOUTHERN PINE FOREST - MORNING

           Elise walks briskly.  

           Sadness comes over her.  Knowing.  

                                 BRAUN (SINGS) (V.O.)
                        The angel waits to guide his soul/ 
                        across death’s foggy va-le.

                        love is an eternal ta-le.  

           She pauses.  Holds the dark necklace tightly, longing for 
           home.  Tempted to use Rapunzel’s gift.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. SOUTHERN PINE FOREST - POOL - MORNING

           The queen’s mercenaries; Vel, Bear, Fishel and Rune come to 
           Elise’s camp site at the base of the falls, near the pool, 
           where she’d camped the night before.

           Vel fondles the fire pit where Elise’s spit once stood.

                                 VEL
                        Still warm.  Can’t be too far 
                        ahead.

           Rune notices a path of Elise’s footprints in the mud near the 
           shore.

                                 RUNE
                        Only one set of tracks.  Small 
                        feet.  If I didn’t know better, I’d 
                        say it must be a girl.

           Bear grins deviously.
                                 BEAR
                        Just our luck, eh boys?  A lonely 
                        lil’ girl, ripe for the taking.

                                 RUNE
                        She’s moving south.

                                 VEL
                        Looks like we’ve got another hero 
                        on our hands.

           The dangerous men gain on Elise.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. SOUTHERN PINE FOREST - ELISE’S CAMP - NIGHT

           The music of the night thunders around her.  Frogs and 
           crickets chirp.  Owls sing.

           Elise has set up camp.  She’s unloaded her traveling supplies 
           and weapons.  

           She pulls her blanket around her and readies for sleep.

           Her small fire flickers in a pit nearby.

           Her heavy eyes fall closed.

           Suddenly, all of the animals are quiet.  At once.

           She notices a change in the air.  The strange empty twilight.

           INT. IVORY FORTRESS - TOWER PRISON

           Elise opens her eyes.  She’s in Rapunzel’s tower cell.  

           Startled, she rolls to her back and quickly gets to her feet.  
           Trying to understand.

           All of her belongings are gone.

           Rapunzel approaches the frightened girl.

                                 RAPUNZEL
                        I haven’t brought you here to harm 
                        you. 

           Rapunzel smiles.

                                 RAPUNZEL (CONT’D)
                        I wish for you to know me.
                                 ELISE
                        I know who you are.

                                 RAPUNZEL
                        Do you?

                                 ELISE
                        You have taken the prince.

                                 RAPUNZEL
                        I have.

           Elise scans Rapunzel.  There’s a kindness in the witch’s 
           eyes, though slight.

                                 ELISE
                        Why did you give me this necklace?

           Impenetrable eye contact between them.

                                 RAPUNZEL
                        I am fond of you. 

           Rapunzel narrows in.

                                 RAPUNZEL (CONT’D)
                        I heard your brother as he 
                        serenaded your father’s passing.  
                        How does it go?  The angel waits to 
                        guide his soul across death’s foggy 
                        vale?  You felt it.  You grasped 
                        the necklace in your hand and you 
                        thought of returning home.  You 
                        could have.  You should.

           Even more.

                        Braun is alone now.  In South 
                        Shire.  

           Elise is winded.  Emotional.  Punched in the gut.

                                 RAPUNZEL (CONT’D)
                        I’ve brought you to the very castle 
                        where I hold Cavill.  You will not 
                        be able to wake him from my spell.  

           Rapunzel reaches out, brushing Elise’s pale cheek with her 
           hand.

                                 RAPUNZEL (CONT’D)
                        Do you know what your king did to 
                        me, Elise?  Left me to rot.

                        In this very cell.  For 30 years.  
                        I had no way of knowing if I’d ever 
                        leave these walls.  Each day I 
                        would pray for nothing more than an 
                        escape from my prison.  Each day I 
                        prayed for freedom and instead, 
                        each day, a dove would come to 
                        visit that window.  

           She gestures to the window behind Elise.  The ghostly-white 
           moon breaking through.

                                 RAPUNZEL (CONT’D)
                        I spoke to it.  It became my only 
                        friend.

           She oozes insanity.  Wickedness.

                                 RAPUNZEL (CONT’D)
                        Then, one day, when my hope was no 
                        more, I thought, how cruel, the 
                        stars, to give me a friendly dove, 
                        rather than a life outside of the 
                        tower’s walls.  I stopped praying 
                        for freedom.  I began to pray for 
                        revenge against my captor and 
                        against the man who betrayed my 
                        trust.  Who broke his vow.

           The corners of her mouth quiver with anger as she recollects 
           the reason for it all.  

           Her eyes swell with hatred.

                                 RAPUNZEL (CONT’D)
                        And I prayed for revenge against 
                        the one who sent the dove when I 
                        asked for only freedom.  Darkness 
                        became my lullaby.  A blood-red 
                        cardinal visited my window and all 
                        at once I knew the power of a 
                        twilight so black that I might have 
                        my revenge.  

           Elise feels for the tormented woman.

                                 ELISE
                        The king deserves your revenge.

           Rapunzel’s eyes glow with elation.  A connection.  She’s 
           enthralled by the thought.

                                 ELISE (CONT’D)
                          But, Cavill is kind.  A good man.
           All at once her enthusiasm fades.  Her lips turn down, sour.

                                 RAPUNZEL
                        The world of man is corrupt.  
                        Fickle.

                                 ELISE
                        There are those who say that I am 
                        fickle.  My brother is a loyal man.  
                        My father a loving husband.  

           Rapunzel’s evil rears its head.  Her eyes grow black with 
           fury.

           Black vines grow from the ground at Elise’s feet.

           They writhe and twist like snakes, binding her to the stone 
           floor.

           Elise scrambles to stand, but she is held at bay by hundreds 
           of rope-like vines.

                                 RAPUNZEL
                        If you will not heed my warning 
                        then, know your foe. 

           A show of Rapunzel’s might.  

           Elise struggles.  The vines wrap around her throat and begin 
           to strangle her.

                                 RAPUNZEL (CONT’D)
                        Should I squeeze the light from 
                        your eyes?  Should I finish your 
                        journey for you?  With a thought, I 
                        could!

           Rapunzel calms.  With a wave of her hand, the vines are black 
           ash.  They float and vanish.

                                 RAPUNZEL (CONT’D)
                        You will drown in my fury if you do 
                        not head my warning.  Return to 
                        South Shire.  This journey was 
                        never yours to make! 

           Rapunzel is gone.

           EXT. SOUTHERN PINE FOREST - ELISE’S CAMP - CONTINUOUS

           Elise’s breath is vapor in the cold air.

           The music of the night returns.  Frogs and crickets chirp.  
           Wolves howl in the distance.

           Elise’s eyes, filled with fear.  She thinks on her father’s 
           death.  

           She thumbs the jewel around her neck and closes her eyes. 

                                 ELISE
                        What is far, will soon be near.  I 
                        will not fear what I am bound to 
                        face.  I will not want for what I 
                        soon, will have.  Though, I am 
                        blind in darkness and the paths are 
                        many, my guide is true.  Though the 
                        weight is heavy, I do not bear it 
                        alone.  Though my heart shys from 
                        the struggle, I will fight through 
                        the current.  Against the 
                        adversary, I will stand strong, for 
                        I do not stand alone. 

                                                          CUT TO BLACK:

           Moments pass before Vel’s taunting voice breaks through.

                                 VEL
                        What do we have here?

           EXT. SOUTHERN PINE FOREST - ELISE’S CAMP - MORNING

           Vel kicks at Elise.

                                 VEL
                        Pretty little thing. 

           Her eyes burst open.  She’s surrounded by the group of 
           ruthless men.  Vel, Bear, Rune and Fishel.

                                 VEL (CONT’D)
                        What in the world would possess a 
                        little girl like you to be out in 
                        the middle of the woods?

           Rune dumps her bag on the ground.

                                 RUNE
                        Ain’t nothin’ good in here.

           Vel turns his back to join Rune.  Kicks through her 
           belongings, now on the floor.

           Fishel approaches her and squats.
                                 FISHEL
                        What are we going to do with you?

                                 BEAR
                        I’ve got some ideas.

           The monsters snicker and toy with their prey.

           Fishel reaches to pet Elise’s face.

                                 ELISE
                        Don’t touch me.

           She slaps his hand away.  He’s red with frustration.

                                 RUNE
                        Feisty one!

                                 BEAR
                        No trouble.  We’ll smooth out the 
                        edges, eh?

           Fishel notices the dark jewel around Elise’s neck.

                                 FISHEL
                        Look at this boys.  Girl’s got a 
                        nice lookin’ stone on her neck.

           He reaches for it.  She grabs him by his wrist, pulls him in 
           and head-butts him in the face.

           He buckles and stumbles backward onto the floor.

           Fishel’s cohorts laugh.

                                 VEL
                        Well, well!  Aren’t you the little 
                        box of surprises.

                                 ELISE
                        Stay back!

           Fishel makes it to his feet, his nose cracked and bloody.

                                 FISHEL
                        Bitch, broke my nose!

           Vel draws his sword.

           Elise turns to run but Rune gets her by the wrist and yanks 
           her backward onto the floor.

           Vel puts a foot on her back.
                                 VEL
                        You out lookin’ for the prince too?  
                        Trying to secure yourself a piece 
                        of that reward?

           She cringes in pain.

                                 VEL (CONT’D)
                        Bear, get that necklace.

                                 BEAR
                        You best behave now, girl.

           Vel puts more weight on her, a crack.  She cries out.

           Bear reaches for the necklace.  She flails, grabbing for 
           anything she can.  Resisting.

           It’s no use.  Bear yanks the chain from her neck and dangles 
           it in the light before sliding the jewel into his pocket.

                                 FISHEL
                        Let me have her Vel.  She broke my 
                        damn nose.

                                 VEL
                        Sure thing.

           He lifts his weight and Elise rolls to her back, struggling 
           for breath.

           Fishel picks Elise up by her vest and slams her against a 
           tree, knocking the wind out of her.

           She buckles.

           Panting for breath, she slyly reaches to the knife-sheath in 
           her boot.

           When Fishel approaches again, she buries the knife deep in 
           his chest.

           Before Vel can catch buckling-Fishel, Elise is 30 paces away, 
           sprinting for her life.

                                 VEL (CONT’D)
                        Rune!

           Rune is already on it.  An arrow drawn, he lets it fly.  

           EXT. SOUTHERN PINE FOREST - CONTINUOUS

           The point buries deep into a tree over Elise’s shoulder.
           A second arrow comes for her, cuts over the top of her 
           shoulder and flies past.

           She winces in pain, but continues.  She’s fast.

           There’s a commotion at Elise’s camp, a distance behind her.  

           She doesn’t look back.

           EXT. SOUTHERN PINE FOREST - ELISE’S CAMP - CONTINUOUS

           Gilbert palms a rock and bashes Vel in the temple, knocking 
           him to the ground.

           Rune draws an arrow, aims it at Gilbert, 10 feet away.  

           Hard to miss.

           EXT. SOUTHERN PINE FOREST - STEEP HILL - CONTINUOUS

           Elise, still sprinting for life, tries to glance back but 
           loses her footing.

           All at once she’s rolling.  Buckling over herself, too fast 
           to catch an eye-line.

           EXT. SOUTHERN PINE FOREST - ELISE’S CAMP - CONTINUOUS

           Gilbert dives out of Rune’s aim and sweeps his legs out from 
           under him.

           Rune comes hard into the ground.  Gilbert picks up Vel’s 
           sword and buries it into the bowman’s chest.  

           EXT. SOUTHERN PINE FOREST - STEEP HILL - CONTINUOUS

           Elise is tumbling down the steep hill.  

           Her shoulder hits hard against the earth, then her ankle.  
           Her head, her foot, her back, then her knees.  

           One end over the other.

           Then, the earth falls out from under her.  She plummets over 
           a cliff.

           Elise experiences moments of weightlessness.  Disoriented.  
           Falling backward.  Unsure of what’s to come.

           She closes her eyes.  Accepts her end.
           With a splash she’s 8 feet under water.  A river with heavy 
           rapids.

           EXT. SOUTHERN PINE FOREST - ELISE’S CAMP - CONTINUOUS

           Gilbert squares off with his final foe.  Bear.  They circle 
           one another.

           Bear is 3 times Gilbert’s size, wielding a hammer.  Gilbert 
           white-knuckles Vel’s sword.

           EXT. RIVER - CONTINUOUS

           Elise explodes upward, gasping for air, struggling to stay 
           afloat in the heavy rapid water.

           EXT. SOUTHERN PINE FOREST - ELISE’S CAMP - CONTINUOUS

           Bear swings at Gilbert, who barely makes it out of the 
           hammer’s path, then comes at him again, catching Gilbert’s 
           cheek.  

           The bruised boy fumbles into a tree.  Blood streams down his 
           face.

                                 BEAR
                        Stupid boy, eh?

           Bear puts all of his weight into his next swing.

           EXT. RIVER - CONTINUOUS

           Elise is pushed under for longer than she can manage, then 
           she’s up for air.

           The cycle happens a few times before she experiences the 
           weightlessness again.

           A waterfall.  200 feet.  She plummets.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CASTLE THESSIA - KING’S CHAMBER - THAT NIGHT

           King Edward stands near his roaring fireplace.  He hasn’t 
           slept.

           The fire’s rage reflects in his eyes.  The orange glow dances 
           on his face.  
           Queen Marie hasn’t slept either.  She stands at a massive 
           chair, facing the fire as well.

                                 QUEEN MARIE
                        I don’t understand.  Why, Edward?  
                        Why is this cruel woman out for us?

           He hides his transgression from his wife.

                                 KING EDWARD
                        People don’t need a reason to hate 
                        the throne.  They do it on their 
                        own accord.

           Their backs to the bed, still made.  The king’s massive 
           window provides little light.

           Vines of black ivy grow from a stone at the corner of the 
           room.  The snake-like plant expands, unwinding until the wall 
           is consumed by it.  

           The ominous black garden casts a dark shadow within itself.  

           As a large gathering of the ivy opens, Rapunzel emerges, 
           rising.  

           The vines creep toward Queen Marie’s feet.  

           They slither up her leg.

           Startled, the queen turns.  

           Before she can breath a word, Rapunzel rolls her fingers and  
           Marie is silenced.

           The vines consume her, wrapping up her arms and around her 
           neck.  

           Edward turns to find Marie held at bay by Rapunzel’s ivy.

                                 KING EDWARD (CONT’D)
                        Marie!

           It tightens, like a snake on its prey.

           Rapunzel steps behind Marie.  

                                 RAPUNZEL
                        Once again, you keep me waiting 
                        Edward.  My patience has grown 
                        thin.

           10 feet separate the bitter enemies.
           Edward’s eyes shift toward Marie.

           Rapunzel catches Edward’s cowardly glance to his wife.  His 
           apology.

           Rapunzel sees through it.

                                 RAPUNZEL (CONT’D)
                        She doesn’t know?

           Rapunzel circles her, like a buzzard tracking wounded pray.

                                 RAPUNZEL (CONT’D)
                        Sweet Marie.  She doesn’t know.

           She holds the queen in her spell, coming close behind her.

                                 KING EDWARD
                        What do you want?  Name it and it 
                        will be yours.

           She mocks him.

                                 RAPUNZEL
                        Anything?  Oh, the power you 
                        posses!

                                 KING EDWARD
                        She isn’t part of this, Rapunzel.  
                        Leave her!

           A new vine of ivy unfurls.  Leaves bloom outward as it rolls 
           up Marie’s arm, toward her neck.

           She whispers, the reason for it all.

                                 RAPUNZEL
                        Your husband vowed his loyalty to 
                        me and married you instead.  Your 
                        love was built on a bed of lies and 
                        your king’s broken promises.  He 
                        left me to rot, for you.  And now, 
                        it will be your end.

           A final leaf blooms from the end of the vine, unveiling a 
           lethal black spider.  It walks down the unfurled leaf and 
           steps onto Marie’s neck.   

                                 RAPUNZEL (CONT’D)
                        She can hear you Edward.  Will you 
                        confess?

                                 KING EDWARD
                        I am so sorry Marie.
           Marie musters the strength.

                                 QUEEN MARIE
                        Please, let Cavill go, he is not 
                        his father.

                                 RAPUNZEL
                        But, with him, his father’s name 
                        will end.

           The spider buries its fangs into the queen’s neck.  Her veins 
           become black, pulsing under her skin. 

           Marie’s breath grows thin, her eyes become glossy.

           The vines vanish in black ash, allowing Marie to fall to her 
           knees.

           Edward rushes to his wife and holds her close, while she 
           dies.

                                 QUEEN MARIE
                        You are a villain in this, as much 
                        as she.

                                 KING EDWARD
                        I am sorry Marie.  I am so sorry.

           His lips quiver, his eyes well with rage.  Marie manages her 
           dying wish in her final breath. 

                                 QUEEN MARIE
                        Cavill is Thessia’s only hope.  The 
                        white fortress in the southern 
                        mountains.  Now, go and save our 
                        son.

           The Queen’s face becomes ghostly white.  Her veins entirely 
           black with poison.  She’s gone.

           Rapunzel’s eyes dart to-and-fro.  Manic.  Something deep 
           inside her regrets Marie’s murder.  It’s difficult for her to 
           watch the innocent woman die.

                                 RAPUNZEL
                        I have thought long on how I might 
                        have you understand what you have 
                        stolen from me.  It is important 
                        that I see your face while you 
                        watch everything you love whither 
                        and die.  It will happen for you 
                        again, with your son and with your 
                        kingdom.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 RAPUNZEL (CONT'D)
                        When you have lost it all, you will 
                        begin to understand loneliness.  I 
                        will leave you to rot in the very 
                        cell where you left me.  You will 
                        spend the rest of your years alone 
                        with your thoughts.  Your own 
                        faults will haunt you.  They will 
                        be your torture.  Only then will 
                        you begin to understand.   

           Rapunzel is gone.

           King Edward cries out a guttural cry of anguish. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. SOUTHERN PINE FOREST - NIGHT

           The knights in silver armor march.  The golden lion of 
           Thessia on their shields.

           A front-line of hundreds.  

           They make their path through the trees, toward the queen’s 
           Ivory Fortress in the south. 

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. REDWOOD FOREST - SOUTH - RIVER BANK - MORNING

           Elise is wrapped in a blanket.  Her boots sit near a blazing 
           fire.

           She’s out cold.  Still wet.

           She coughs, rolls to her side, struggles to open her eyes.

           Beaten.

           Gilbert is crouched next to her.  Mud covers the place where 
           his cheek was bashed. 

                                 GILBERT
                        Good morning.

           Elise sits up.  She cringes in pain and breaks free of the 
           tightly wrapped blanket.

           She holds her ribs. 

                                 GILBERT (CONT’D)
                        You fell over the waterfall.
                                 ELISE
                        You came and found me?

                                 GILBERT
                        Yes.

                                 ELISE
                        How long have you been following 
                        me?

                                 GILBERT
                        You left without saying goodbye.

                                 ELISE
                        I knew you’d demand to come.

           Elise notices her belongings sitting next to a nearby tree.

           No quiver.  No bow.  No necklace.

                                 ELISE (CONT’D)
                        What happened to your face?

                                 GILBERT
                        The big one with the hammer got me.

           Elise sorts through her bag.  Her hatchet, cloth, the flint, 
           the twine. 

           Elise finds the bloody knife that she used to take Fishel 
           down.

           Examines it.  Guilty.  Gilbert catches on.

                                 GILBERT (CONT’D)
                        They would have killed you.

                                 ELISE
                        I know.

                                 GILBERT
                        Or worse.

           The weight of murder clearly effects Elise more than Gilbert.

                                 GILBERT (CONT’D)
                        All I got was the bag.  I was 
                        terrified.  Worried that you had 
                        drowned.

           His face says it all.  Terrified is an understatement.

           She puts her hand on his.
                                 ELISE
                        You saved my life.

           Their eyes lock.

                                 ELISE (CONT’D)
                        Thank you.

           She inspects their surroundings.  The high waterfall, from a 
           cliff that separates the land, as far as she can see.  

           There’s no going back.

                                 ELISE (CONT’D)
                        Hand me my boots?

           He does.

           She slides the carving knife into the sheath and pulls them 
           on.  Struggles to stand.

           The ache gets her, she limps.

           Elise throws her bag over her shoulder.

                                 ELISE (CONT’D)
                        You are a long way from the camp.

           She turns her back on the river and makes her way south.  The 
           towering trees of the redwood forest.

           EXT. REDWOOD FOREST - SOUTH - CONTINUOUS

           Elise and Gilbert are dwarfed by the colossus trees.

                                 GILBERT
                        Elise, the reason I followed you-

           He tries to find the right words.

                                 GILBERT (CONT’D)
                        The way our conversation ended-

           A confession.

                                 GILBERT (CONT’D)
                        I remember more about my brother 
                        than I have told you.  

           Her pace slows.
                                 GILBERT (CONT’D)
                        He was a prince.  My father, the 
                        king of our land.

           Elise stops in her tracks.  Puzzled.

                                 GILBERT (CONT’D)
                        One day, my brother spoke of a 
                        strange voice calling him to a 
                        distant world.  

                                 ELISE
                        Rapunzel.

                                 GILBERT
                        She took him.  When my father 
                        finally found him, it was too late. 

           It’s hard for him to say.

                                 GILBERT (CONT’D)
                        She didn’t stop with my brother.  
                        She murdered my father and mother.  
                        She burned our kingdom to the 
                        ground with an army of darkness.  I 
                        escaped with my life.  But, she 
                        murdered thousands.  Everyone I 
                        knew.

           Elise comes to know the breadth of Rapunzel’s wrath.

                                 ELISE
                        So it is not just King Edward.  Not 
                        just Thessia.

           He takes her hand.  Elise feels an emotional spark in his 
           touch.  

                                 ELISE (CONT’D)
                        Who am I to stand against her 
                        darkness.  How can I face something 
                        so powerful?  

           They connect.  Electric.

                                 GILBERT
                        If something were to have happened 
                        to you and our last conversation to 
                        have been the one under the stars-

           The moment hangs too long, her feelings for Gilbert are 
           exposed.
                                 GILBERT (CONT’D)
                        I will not let you face it alone.

           She buries her head against his chest.

                                 ELISE
                        I am glad you are here.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. REDWOOD FOREST - SOUTH - NIGHT

           Night has fallen over the redwood forest.

           Elise and Gilbert hurry south, trying to make better time. 

           The wind gives way to the mysterious whisper.  

                                 SPIRIT (O.S.)

                                 ELISE
                        Do you hear that?

           He squints, intently.  Hears.  His eyes widen. 

                                 SPIRIT (O.S.)
                        go tapa. go tapa. go tapa.

                                 GILBERT
                        What is it?

           They change directions.  Following the voice.

                                 SPIRIT (O.S.)
                        an mbealach seo.

           It swirls around them, echoing, drawing them further into the 
           east.

           They make it a couple hundred yards before they hear a 
           strange ringing.  A familiar, ethereal tone.

           They continue.  Several moments pass before they see a faint 
           glow in the distance.

           The strange ghostly glow from the center of a clearing.
                                 SPIRIT (O.S.) (CONT’D)

                                 GILBERT
                        What is it?

           EXT. FORBIDDEN GARDEN - CONTINUOUS

           Elise and Gilbert stand at the edge of the clearing.  

           Behind them, the redwood forest, before them, the lush garden 
           of smooth grass and white flowered vines.  Yellow fireflies 
           dance.

           The remarkable tree, at the center of the garden.  It 
           emanates its etherial tone.  

           Its ghostly, unconsuming flame dances among the twisted 
           branches of white.

           They are in awe.  Taken aback.  

                                 ELISE
                        It cannot be.

           Elise leads the way into the garden.

                                 GILBERT
                        What is it?

           They look on the site’s glory.  Something few have ever seen.  

                                 ELISE
                        My grandfather used to tell me a 
                        story of a forbidden garden.

           She grows closer.  The story unfolds.

                                 ELISE (CONT’D)
                        The fruit was blessed with light.  
                        It offered eternal life.  A tree of 
                        tangled white wood, with leaves of 
                        flame.  It sang an angel’s tone.

           They grow closer still.

                                 ELISE (CONT’D)
                        He stole of its fruit and in 
                        return, a powerful witch forced him 
                        to surrender his first born child.  
                        My aunt.  Even my father thought it 
                        nothing more than a story.  
                                 (MORE)
                                 ELISE (CONT’D)
                        Something he made up about a child 
                        they had lost in birth, before my 
                        father.  Everyone thought it just 
                        another tale of my grandfather’s.

           They’re at the tree now.  

           She runs her fingers through the ghostly flame, unharmed.

           She moves her hand along its sturdy branches of white.

                                 ELISE (CONT’D)
                        Rapunzel said we are connected.  
                        Could it be?

           Rapunzel’s infatuation with Elise unfolds.  

           Fire dances between her fingers.  The air around her 
           sparkles.

           Elise is enveloped in its glow.

                                 ELISE (CONT’D)
                        The whispers.  It called me here.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. IVORY FORTRESS - CONTINUOUS

           Rapunzel stands at the top of the grand staircase of white 
           stone.

           She bows her head.  Begins to inhale and exhale, drawing 
           insurmountable power from within.

           She shouts a violent war cry, raising her arms high into the 
           air, summoning forth an epic undead army.

           EXT. REDWOOD FOREST - CONTINUOUS

           Roots and vines writhe, pulling the skeletons of fallen 
           soldiers from their unmarked graves.  

           The creatures hiss and snap as they form, struggling upward 
           from their earthly prison.  They bear the weapons they fell 
           with.

           Vicious horses of bone join, stumbling as they pull 
           themselves from the dirt.  The animals of darkness rear.

           Hundreds upon hundreds of undead warriors of vine and bone, 
           summoned forth by Rapunzel’s power.  
           EXT. REDWOOD FOREST - MORNING

           War looms.

           A thick fog floats over the land, wrapping around the trunks 
           of the giant redwoods.

           The king’s army marches.

           An eerie crackle, a harsh dry moan from something dark.

           A soldier in the frontline notices the sound.

           He nudges his neighbor.

                                 THESSIA SOLDIER #1
                        You hear that?

           His cohort nods.  Fear overcomes them.

                                 THESSIA SOLDIER #2
                        I hear it.

           Now a beat.  The rap of a thousand swords against a thousand 
           shields.

           The drum rolls.

           The fog parts, revealing the frontline of Rapunzel’s army.

                                 THESSIA SOLDIER #1
                        What devil is this?

                                 THESSIA SOLDIER #2
                        What are they?

           They halt.

           The eerie crackle grows.  The creatures cry out.  

           It’s an intimidating spectacle.  Even more ominous in the 
           forest’s fog.

                                 GENERAL
                        Do not fight on the order of your 
                        king, fight on behalf of your 
                        creator, for today we fight the 
                        devil’s men!  The Kingdom of 
                        Thessia is at war with darkness 
                        incarnate.  Let us return the 
                        rightful heir that we may prosper 
                        the good nation that hell fears! 

           The men cry out in support.  A rally cry.
                                 GENERAL (CONT’D)
                        Charge!

           The king’s frontline comes to meet Rapunzel’s.

           The skeletal creatures of bone and earth against the king’s 
           forces of iron.

           They crash into eachother.  Warriors on both sides fall.

           A soldier stabs through the ribs of his foe.  His sword 
           slides through its bones and out its back.

           Unaffected, the skeleton bashes the soldier with its shield.

           The soldier falls and the creature of darkness buries its 
           sword through him.

           It releases its eerie battle cry. 

           Another soldier severs the bone-arm of his opponent.  The 
           monster fights on.

           Rapunzel’s undead army overpower’s the king’s men.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. SOUTH SHIRE - MORNING

           Smoke clouds the morning sky.

           The wheat fields of South Shire burn.

           INT. ELISE AND BRAUN’S HOME - CONTINUOUS

           Braun watches through a small window at the front door of his 
           home.

           Rapunzel’s creatures overpower the small farm town.

           A family of four runs.  Father, mother and two daughters.  

           Braun looks on as the mother trips and falls.  

           He runs to a great sword at the corner of the room.

           EXT. ELISE AND BRAUN’S HOME - CONTINUOUS

           Braun explodes out the front door of his home, calling after 
           the fleeing family. 
                                 BRAUN
                        Over here!

           They come toward him.  He swings through several of 
           Rapunzel’s gaining soldiers.

           He cuts through arms and legs.  Severing their bone limbs.  

           It’s no use, until he lobs off their heads. 

           They crumble to a pile of bone and earth.

           He rushes the family of four into his home.

                                 BRAUN (CONT’D)
                        Barricade the door!  Open it for no 
                        one but myself!

           One of their daughters, gorgeous 17 YEAR OLD ANNABELLE, eyes 
           brawn with impenetrable gratitude.  He looks on her with love 
           at first site.

           He’s filled with newfound conviction as the door closes, 
           separating the family from the danger he now faces.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. REDWOOD FOREST - SOUTH - MORNING

           Elise and Gilbert sleep.  Wrapped together in a blanket.

           Fog slithers between their faces.

           In the distance, among the trees, a patch of vines swell, 
           pulling skeletal remains from the ground.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. REDWOOD FOREST - MORNING

           Most of the king’s soldiers lay beaten.  

           The general is surrounded by the monsters.  He lashes out, 
           severing limbs, dropping many foes.  He stands strong.

           More come for him.  He fells another and another until one 
           makes a stab at him that he cannot block.

           He falls.

           The monsters rap on their shields. 
           They move over the bodies of the fallen soldiers of Thessia.

           Toward Edward and his castle, the creatures of darkness 
           march.

           EXT. REDWOOD FOREST - SOUTH - CONTINUOUS

           An eerie crackle startles Gilbert.  

                                 GILBERT
                        Elise.

           He shakes her.

                                 GILBERT (CONT’D)
                        Elise, wake up.

           She’s disoriented.  Pulled from a deep sleep.

           He puts his finger to his lips, signaling for her silence.

           The creatures cry out.  The harsh moan.  Predatory and 
           ancient.

           Terrifying.

                                 GILBERT (CONT’D)
                        That sound.  I know it.

                                 ELISE
                        What is it?

           They stand.  Cautiously moving together.

           The crackle explodes to life from right behind them.

           They both catch a glimpse of ghastly creature before 
           sprinting away.

                                 GILBERT
                        Run!

           It brings its axe down exactly where Elise would have been.

           Elise doubles back for her supplies.

           The creature swings at her as she catches hold of her bag.

           Gilbert pulls her forward, out of the path of the monster’s 
           deadly swipe.  Together, they run.
           Ahead, several more of Rapunzel’s army.

           Gilbert and Elise stop in their tracks, backing in another 
           direction.

           Again, from directly behind them, the crackle.

           Elise cries out in fear.  They make a run for it, breaking 
           into an open space at the right.  

           One of the soldiers catches Elise with its shield.

           Elise falls hard.  Leaves and gravel fly.

           Gilbert grabs the creature’s shield and pushes it backward, 
           stumbling on top of it.

           The skeleton bites and snaps as Gilbert twists its skull from 
           its shoulders.  It falls limp.

           Gilbert grabs its sword just in time to catch another 
           creature behind them, readying a thorough stab at Elise.

           He flies at it, swinging against the creatures might.

           The thick metal swords compete.  Gilbert cuts the monster 
           down.

           Elise grabs the sword from the bone-hands of Gilbert’s second 
           felled foe. 

                                 GILBERT (CONT’D)
                        Go!

           He fumbles to a run, pushing her before him.  

           Elise swings through another of the dark enemies, splitting 
           its skull, saving Gilbert from its swing.

           Gilbert barely misses a stab from another nearby creature.

           They barrel through a gathering of the monsters, fighting 
           their way through.

           All at once, it seems they’ve made it to a clearing.

           Moments pass before Gilberts face is overcome by deathly 
           shock.

           He takes several weakened steps forward.  Elise notices his 
           slowed pace.

                                 ELISE
                        Gilbert?
           His eyes, confused.  He reaches for the shooting pain in his 
           back.

                                 ELISE (CONT’D)
                        What’s wrong?

           He turns, revealing an arrow, lodged deep between his 
           shoulder blades. 

           Shock comes over Elise.  Her eyes wide with fear.

           Another arrow cuts through the air near her face. 

           Gilbert stumbles.  She catches him on her shoulder, tries to 
           bear his weight, but can’t.  He falls to his knees.

           The monsters approach.  Her eyes grow teary.  His are full 
           with fear.  

           Gilbert’s breath grows thin.

                                 GILBERT
                        This is where you’ll leave me.

           Elise is overcome with sadness.  

                                 ELISE
                        I won’t.

           He falls to his shoulder, laying on the forest floor.  The 
           light grows dim.

                                 GILBERT
                        Avenge my brother.

                                 ELISE
                        I cannot leave you.

           She’s dizzy with uncertainty.  Another arrow, a near miss.

           He struggles through his dying breath to make her leave. 

                                 GILBERT
                        You have to.  You have to go.  Now!

                                 ELISE
                        I cannot leave you!  I cannot!

                                 GILBERT
                        It is me or both of us.

           He holds his hand on her face.
                                 GILBERT (CONT’D)
                        You must.  Elise, you must.

           The monsters quickly encroach.  Ten more.

                                 GILBERT (CONT’D)
                        I will wait for you.  Meet me on 
                        the other side.

           His eyes close.  The first time he’s ever said it, and the 
           last-

                                 GILBERT (CONT’D)
                        I love you.

           His breath ends.

                                 ELISE
                        Gilbert?  Gilbert, no!

           She holds him in her arms.  Her teary face on his.   

           The creatures are near.  She cries out a mournful roar and 
           stands, wielding the sword.

           She swings through several of the undead army.  Severing 
           limbs.

           The creature that bears the bow and arrow readies yet another 
           shot.  She spins out of its trajectory and races to confront 
           the monster, smashing through its shoulder with her blunt 
           weapon.  Slashing at it until it lays lifeless.

           Elise finds herself alone among many foes.  

           Ahead, she finds a way through.  A steep hill.

                                                                CUT TO:

           Clouds of smoke billow from all around.  In the distance, 
           South Shire burns.
           Civilians fight, only to fall victim to the swords of their 
           foes.

           EXT. MOUNTAIN PASS - LATER

           Elise comes to a plateau in the terrain.  

           She continues onward, fighting tears, looking over her 
           shoulder for the dark creatures that may follow her.

           A blood-red cardinal watches her.

           She hears a horse’s bellow.  From 40 feet, Luke, the prince’s 
           horse, trots toward her.

           A friendly face.  Elise recognizes the animal.  

                                 ELISE
                        Luke!

           It’s a sign.  Cavill is near.

           She mounts the steed and races onward.

           Dead doves hang from the trees, bound by their feet with 
           twine.  They sway.

           The horse huffs nervously, his breath becomes vapor in the 
           chill air. 

           Ahead, the grand staircase of white marble, leading to 
           Rapunzel’s castle.

           Elise dismounts and cautiously approaches the grand 
           staircase.  

                                                                CUT TO:

           The magnificent entryway to Rapunzel’s fortress of white 
           stone.
           She begins, up the grand staircase.  Afraid, she repeats her 
           prayer. 

                                 ELISE
                        What is far, will soon be near.  I 
                        will not fear what I am bound to 
                        face.  

           She shivers.  Weary.

                                 ELISE (CONT’D)
                        I will not want for what I soon, 
                        will have.  Though, I am blind in 
                        darkness and the paths are many, my 
                        guide is true.  

           Each step, another beat in her growing resolution.

                                 ELISE (CONT’D)
                        Though the weight is heavy, I do 
                        not bear it alone.  

           Elise wipes tears from her eyes, mourning Gilbert’s death, 
           she presses on. 

           Her determination grows.

                                 ELISE (CONT’D)
                        Though my heart shys from the 
                        struggle, I will fight through the 
                        current.  

           Elise comes to the final step of the marble staircase and 
           finds herself at the entrance of Rapunzel’s throne room.

                                 ELISE (CONT’D)
                        Against the adversary, I will stand 
                        strong, for I do not stand alone. 

           INT. IVORY FORTRESS - THRONE ROOM

           Elise enters the large circular space of white stone and ivy.   

           Silence but for the wind that whispers through the vast 
           throne room of forest and stone.

           Her eyes come straight to Cavill, who rests under Rapunzel’s 
           spell. 

           His arms, stretched outward, held in the vines.  His body, 
           tight against the stone wall.
           He looks peaceful.  Unaware of the war that has fallen over 
           his land.  

           He is the very same as she last saw him, when they shared a 
           night in the wilderness.  

           Elise gazes at the prince, again, noting the gentle curve of 
           his nose and soft lips, intrigued by his shape and remembers 
           his kindness.

           Even after everything she’s gone through to get here, this is 
           too easy and she knows it.  

           Then it comes. 

           Backed to the walls surrounding the room, the 8 rotting 
           skeletons of men in royal gear.  Elise shifts, knowing.

           The familiar sound.  The eerie crackle. 

           THE ROYAL DEAD, awake.

           She drops her bag, near Cavill.  Scans her opponents.  

           Each dark prince is dressed in clothing of their prospective 
           lands.  Different colors and fashions.  Some have heavy 
           metallic helmets, others simple cloth.

           Four of them carry one-handed swords and shields.  

           One wields a bow and quiver of arrows.  One, a great, two-
           handed axe.  One, a two-handed sword.  

           The final, wields two maces.

           They rise.

           Elise moves away from Cavill.  The undead prince with a bow, 
           draws an arrow.

           Elise slides behind Rapunzel’s throne.  The arrow ricochets.

           As soon as Elise hears the clink of the miss-placed shot, 
           she’s up and over the throne, running at the undead archer.

           It pulls another arrow from its quiver and slides the arrow 
           into the nocking point.

           The creature isn’t able to get a full draw before Elise has a 
           grip, one hand on the upper and lower limbs of the bow.

           She spins around its side, pulling the bow forward.

           The string snaps forward and the arrow fumbles.
           Elise spins the bow counter clockwise.  The undead prince’s 
           wrist shatters, its hand falls to the floor.

           She bashes its skull with the bow’s grip.  It fumbles 
           backward into its throne of bramble, slides to the floor, but 
           persists.

           It grabs at Elise’s feet.  She punts the creature’s skull, 
           which promptly dislocates from its spine of ivy.  

           The skull spins and crashes into the curved adjacent wall.

           The bow prince lies beaten.

           Elise kneels and draws an arrow from its quiver.  

           The remaining 7 princes gain on her.

           She releases an arrow, it flies toward the undead prince who 
           wields two maces.

           It explodes through the creature’s skull, sending fragments 
           of bone and dust into the air.

           The nearest soldier bears a shield and sword.  15 feet.

           She draws and fires.  The arrow ricochets from its block. 

           It rushes at her, shield first.

           From three feet, it takes a mighty stab.  She rolls out of 
           the way.

           She eyes the maces, 40 feet across the room.  Abandoning the 
           bow, Elise makes a run for it.

           She makes it to the maces, in the hands of the second fallen 
           undead prince.  

           The prince with a mighty two-handed sword is near.  It swipes 
           at her.  She leaps backward, knocking its strike with one of 
           the maces.

           She spins the weapons around her palms confidently.

           This just became a fair fight.

           The prince with the great sword is clumsy, but its weapon 
           deadly.  It takes several mighty swings at her.

           She’s able to dodge, but has been backed toward another 
           shielded soldier, who stabs at her.

           She swings at the shielded prince, who bashes her strike.
           She falls backwards.  The great sword comes down hard.  She 
           rolls, barely dodging.

           She’s on her feet and behind the great-sworded monster before 
           it can ready.

           She smashes the back of its skull with her right mace.  It 
           cracks and falls to the floor.  She finishes it with another 
           great bash to its skull.

           The shielded monster is back on her, readying another stab.  

           Spinning, she knocks its attack.  The monster fumbles.  She 
           bashes it across the face.  Its skull shattered.

           Four remain.  The prince with the two handed axe is on the 
           opposite side of the room but it gains.

           Three shielded princes remain.  One particularly large one.

           The nearest comes at her swinging.  She parries.

           Another is at her.  Two at once.

           She swings at them but can’t get by their shields.

           The large, shielded prince is nearly on her.  She will be out-
           matched.

           Another heavy swing comes down on her.  She parries but the 
           force sends her backward.

           Another swing, then another.  

           A shield bash crushes against the heavy swing of her left 
           mace.  The vibration is too much, the hilt slips her grip. 

           The mace goes flying backward, out of her left hand.

           She’s on her knees.

           She uses her free hand to grab the opposite edge of the 
           creature’s shield, throwing it to her right.

           The undead prince stumbles.  She spins around it and brings 
           her right mace backward into its head.  It stumbles to the 
           floor.

           She gathers herself quickly and crushes the floored princes 
           skull, finishing it.

           She pulls the shield out from under her most recent fallen 
           foe, using it to block a swing from the other shielded 
           attacker.
           The largest shielded prince and the prince with the great axe 
           are on her.

           Three of them now.

           She can’t manage.  She hunkers behind the shield and charges 
           through them with a cry of adrenaline.

           They stumble but get their footing quickly.

           They’re heading toward her again.  The monster with the great 
           axe is closest.

           She calculates.

           The massive steel axe comes across her.  Deadly.  She bends 
           back, barely dodging.

           The undead prince spins with the weight of his swing and 
           brings it down on her, like a guillotine. 

           Elise propels a mighty, counterclockwise spin, to the side of 
           the axe.

           All at once, she brings the edge of her shield parallel with 
           the ground.

           The prince with the two-handed axe’s skull bursts under the 
           power of the shield’s edge.  

           Dust flies.

           The plan of her bold move continues as she uses the momentum 
           of her spin.

           She ducks into her shield, blocking the next monster’s stab 
           and bringing the mace, in her right hand, into its skull.

           She continues the counterclockwise spin.  

           She throws all of her weight into her shield, anticipating 
           the largest of the shielded prince’s, swing.  

           But the swing does not come.

           Her miscalculation causes her to stumble forward under the 
           force of her own momentum.

           The monster bashes her with its shield, sending her tumbling 
           over herself.  Her own shield breaks free of her grip and 
           slides a distance, out of her reach.
           The undead prince follows with a deadly swipe.  She rolls, 
           inches from its strike.  The sword bounces from the stone 
           floor.

           Elise stumbles to her feet.  Unarmed, she squares off against 
           her foe.

           It comes at her, swinging and slashing.  Several near-misses 
           as she spins and dodges its barrage.

           Finally, she sees an opportunity.  Moves out of the way of a 
           particularly heavy swing and maneuvers behind the creature.

           She grabs hold of its jaw, wrestles it to the floor and 
           pulls, with all her might, until the bone and vine separate 
           from its shoulders.

           Breathless and somewhat surprised by her accomplishment, she 
           drops its skull to the ground.

           The ivory throne room is quiet.  Alone at last, Elise 
           approaches Prince Cavill.   

           She brings her hand to his cheek.

                                 ELISE
                        How might I wake you?

           A fairytale kiss?

           Elise jolts forward from a painful force coming from behind 
           her.  Shock blankets her face.

           A cold metal sword slides into her flesh.  It pierces through 
           her back and protrudes from her abdomen.

                                 VEL
                        This is for Fishel.

           Vel wrenches his sword from the mortal wound.  She whimpers 
           as it dislodges.

           She drops to her knees.

                                 VEL (CONT’D)
                        And I’ll be taking that reward. 
                        Close though.

           Her wound bleeds.  She grows light-headed.  Falls to her 
           knees.

           Rapunzel saunters down the marble staircase that leads into 
           the throne room, from above.
           Vel steps backward, weary of the powerful woman.

           She continues downward.

           Blood streams from the Elise’s wound.  Her hand is soaked as 
           she tries to stop its flow.

                                 RAPUNZEL
                        Dear Elise, don’t struggle.  

           Rapunzel twists her hand toward Vel.  He’s held at bay.  His 
           neck locks as vines writhe up his body.

           His arms are pulled forcefully behind his back.  Vines twist 
           through his palms and wrists until his hands are bound to one 
           another.

                                 RAPUNZEL (CONT’D)
                        This coward struck to kill.

           His face swells red as the vines begin to tighten, strangling 
           him.  He struggles to breath.

           Elise tries to stand, whimpering in pain.

                                 RAPUNZEL (CONT’D)
                        This vermin.

           The vines pull Vel’s face to the side by his chin.  His eyes 
           grow wide with fear.  His end draws near.

           Rapunzel steps to the floor of the throne room and Vel’s neck 
           snaps.  

           She lets his bound body fall to the floor.  

           Her walk is a slow dance.  An art of malevolence.

                                 RAPUNZEL (CONT’D)
                        I can save you.  I can end your 
                        pain. 

           Rapunzel nears Elise.  Ominously towering over the dying 
           girl.

                                 RAPUNZEL (CONT’D)
                        My legions swallow Thessia.  South 
                        Shire.  Your home burns.  Soon 
                        Braun.

           Rapunzel’s eyes soften.
                                 RAPUNZEL (CONT’D)
                        You’re everything Edward was not.  
                        I admire your bravery.  Your 
                        resilience.  Your innocent 
                        chivalry.  Your childish faith has 
                        carried you far.

           Elise’s cotton under shirt has become soaked in blood from 
           her wound.  She whimpers.

                                 RAPUNZEL (CONT’D)
                        We’re connected Elise.  We share 
                        the same blood.

           Elise realizes, under her breath.

                                 ELISE
                        It is true?

                                 RAPUNZEL
                        You no longer have a father.

           Then, everything Rapunzel has wanted from Elise, is revealed.

                                 RAPUNZEL (CONT’D)
                        No mother.

           Rapunzel would very much like to fill that void.  

                                 ELISE
                        You have slaughtered frivolously.  
                        You are driven insane with revenge.  
                        But, I look on you now and I do not 
                        see a monster, I see only an 
                        injured woman, betrayed.  I see 
                        humanity in you.  And I feel deep 
                        sorrow for you.

           Rapunzel cannot overcome her loneliness.  Understood, at 
           last.

           Her face is wet with tears.  She overpowers them, chin high, 
           she extends her hand.

                                 RAPUNZEL
                        Join me.

           Rapunzel’s hand floats, outstretched.  Elise is close enough 
           to reach. 

           She pleads.
                                 RAPUNZEL (CONT’D)
                        Rule at my side and together we 
                        will build a new world.  We’ll 
                        teach the corrupt hearts of man the 
                        way of loyalty that you understand 
                        so well.  We’ll grow from nothing, 
                        a new day.  

           Elise takes Rapunzel’s hand.

           Sly.  Undetectable.  Elise draws a white dagger, crafted from 
           the Tree of Life and buries it deep into Rapunzel’s heart.

           Rapunzel wraps her arms around Elise, holding her close.  An 
           emotional embrace, not between foes, but family.

                                 RAPUNZEL (CONT’D)
                        Well struck.

           The words of Acantha ring true.

                                 ELISE
                        There is no darkness so black that 
                        even the faintest light cannot 
                        overcome.

           Their cheeks are side by side.  Rapunzel whispers.

                                 RAPUNZEL
                        How?

                                 ELISE
                        Carved from the Tree of Life.  The 
                        living flame that overcomes death.

           Rapunzel smiles.  Her eyes shed tears of joy as the darkness 
           leaves her body.  She whispers her powerful truth.

                                 RAPUNZEL
                        I was always rooting for you.

           Elise’s eyes, wide with sadness.

           Rapunzel releases Elise from their embrace and the wounded 
           girl falls to the floor, fragile.

           Rapunzel pulls the dagger from the wound in her chest.

           Tiny golden orbs of light begin to dance around her.

           The Tree of Life’s light encompasses Rapunzel’s body.

           Rapunzel’s true age is revealed as the dark magic dissipates.
           Her flesh begins to burn in ghostly fire until she becomes a 
           magical flurry of spirit and flame. 

           She drifts into the air.  Gone.

           Elise, exhausted, on the verge of death, reaches for her bag.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. THESSIA WILDERNESS - CONTINOUS

           The army of dead that transport King Edward fall into 
           lifelessness around him.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. SOUTH SHIRE - CONTINUOUS

           Braun, exhausted, battles a gathering of Rapunzel’s militia.

           He swings a hatchet, shattering one’s skull.

                                 BRAUN (V.O.)
                        Rapunzel’s army of darkness fell 
                        away from the land.  

           One by one, the remaining creatures of darkness fall into 
           lifelessness around him.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. IVORY FORTRESS - THRONE ROOM

           Elise manages to pull her pack open, taking hold of a piece 
           of the Tree of Life’s fruit.

           She takes a thorough bite before falling unconscious.  Her 
           bloodless body, deathly pale.

           The vines, which suspend Cavill, crumble to ash.

           He drops to the floor near Elise.

           Cavill’s eyes flutter to life. 
           EXT. IVORY FORTRESS - CONTINUOUS

           Cavill cradles Elise in his arms as he races down the grand 
           staircase.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. MOUNTAIN PASS - MOMENTS LATER

           Cavill, atop Luke, races toward Thessia.  

           Elise lies slumped across Cavill’s lap.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CASTLE THESSIA - THRONE ROOM - DAY

           A crowd of people gather on either side of the long aisle, 
           leading to the throne.

                                 BRAUN (V.O.)
                        King Edward passed his crown to his 
                        heir. 

           The golden lion tapestries hang.

           Cavill makes his way toward the throne.  He takes his 
           rightful place.  Chin high.  Strong.

           A crown of gold is placed on his head.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. SOUTH SHIRE - DAY

           Beautiful blue skies meet the rolling golden fields of South 
           Shire.

           The town is bustling.  

           New buildings.  Better fences.  Happier faces.

                                 BRAUN (V.O.)
                        Under Cavill’s rule, the land of 
                        Thessia flourished.  

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. ELISE AND BRAUN’S HOME - AFTERNOON

           Braun chops wood.  Wipes sweat from his brow.

           3 men in regal attire arrive on horseback.

                                 BRAUN (V.O.)
                        Elise’s reward was delivered on her 
                        behalf to her brother in South 
                        Shire, that he might build on what 
                        their father left and grow their 
                        lineage for generations to come. 

           Cavill steps from his mount.  Bows to Braun.  Shakes his 
           hand.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BRAUN’S HOME - YEARS LATER

           Thick stone walls.  Plenty of room.  New furniture.

           Braun has aged slightly.  He’s grown a full beard.

           He sits in the family room of a new home.

           3 children.  2 boys and a girl. They are small versions of 
           him. 

           His children listen intently.

                                 BRAUN
                        And he did!

           He delivers with boisterous inflection, referring to himself. 

           Trying to catch the attention of his wife, who is in an 
           adjacent room.

                                 BRAUN (CONT’D)
                        He married a beautiful young woman 
                        named Annabelle.

           The children laugh as their mother, ANNABELLE appears from 
           around the corner.  The daughter of the family Braun saved 
           from Rapunzel’s army as South Shire burned.

           She’s heard this story plenty of times before.

                                 BRAUN (CONT’D)
                        And had three ornery children. 

           He points at each of them.
                                 BRAUN (CONT’D)
                        Bryce, Darryn and a stubborn, 
                        little girl- 

           He tussles her hair.

                                 BRAUN (CONT’D)
                        Named Elise. 

           Annabelle rests her chin on Braun’s shoulder.

                                 ANNABELLE
                        Bedtime.

           The kids moan.

           Braun turns to his wife.  Puckers his lips.  Receives a kiss.

                                 BRAUN
                        I love you.

                                 ANNABELLE
                        I love you!

           The children run out of the room.  Braun chases them.

                                                         FADE TO BLACK:

           Moments pass.

           The thunderous clap of a galloping horses hooves.

                                                                CUT TO:

           EXT. REDWOOD FOREST - SOUTH - CURRENT DAY

           Elise, beautiful and full of life, races through the thick of 
           massive redwoods atop a white horse

                                                          FLASHBACK TO:

           EXT. FORBIDDEN GARDEN 

           Gilbert and Elise have just followed the spirit’s voice and 
           have come to the Tree of Life.  

           Elise removes her bag from her shoulder.  Takes her axe and 
           begins to hack at a limb of the tree.

           A piece of its white fruit shakes loose.  Gilbert swoops it 
           up.
           Elise places her hand on his.  “No.”

           He shoots her a glare of quirk and sarcasm before taking a 
           thorough bite.

                                                           CUT BACK TO:

           EXT. REDWOOD FOREST - SOUTH - CURRENT DAY

           Elise comes to the edge of the Forbidden Garden and 
           dismounts.

           EXT. FORBIDDEN GARDEN - CONTINUOUS

           Her bare foot steps across the line between the redwood 
           forest and the garden, full of ethereal magic.

           Gilbert stands waiting for her at the tree.

           They come together in a passionate embrace.  They kiss.

                                                               FADE TO:

           EXT. PINE FOREST - ELISE’S CAMP - DAY

           An old, feminine voice hums the familiar dark melody.

           The high pitched squeal of an ungreased wagon wheel.

           The Witch of the Wilderness pulls her cart.  Humming 
           Rapunzel’s dark melody.

           She comes across Elise’s abandoned camp and supplies. 

           Three of the queen’s mercenaries lay dead, having been 
           finished by Gilbert, following their attack on Elise.

           She begins to search them.

           She ignores the coins the men had stolen from their first 
           victims in the woods of Thessia.  

           She works hard to roll Bear over.  She reaches into his 
           pocket.  Rapunzel’s gift to Elise lies buried there.

           The witch picks up the dark necklace, brushes it off and 
           dangles it in the sunlight.

                                                                   END:
