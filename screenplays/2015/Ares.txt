           OVER BLACK:

           “Let us build a tower that reaches to the heavens. So that we 
           may make a name for ourselves.” 
                                                   - Genesis 11:4

           The following is based on a true story. To protect the 
           survivors, names have been changed.

                                                       CUT TO:

           A CELL PHONE SCREEN. Badly cracked. On it, a video plays: 

           EVAN LANGE is shown in close-up against a white background. 
           He’s 46. The kind of hollow face you see in a mental hospital. 
           He looks at an OFF-CAMERA INTERVIEWER with unnerving 
           intensity. 

                                 INTERVIEWER (O.S.)
                        Please state your name.

                                 EVAN
                        Evan Lange. 

                                 INTERVIEWER (O.S.)
                        Are you currently of sound mind and 
                        body?

                                 EVAN
                        Yes.

                                 INTERVIEWER (O.S.)
                        Can you please explain the problems 
                        you’ve been suffering from?

           Evan pauses. It pains him to admit it. 

                                 EVAN
                        Whenever I try to stop drinking, I 
                        have delusions. Hallucinations. 
                        Doctors told me it’s delirium 
                        tremens.

                                 INTERVIEWER (O.S.)
                        Have these delusions ever made you a 
                        danger to others?

                                 EVAN
                        Yes. 
                                 INTERVIEWER (O.S.)
                        Do you agree that if people hear you 
                        making strange claims, they should 
                        call the police?

                                 EVAN
                         (with difficulty)
                        Yes. For their safety. And mine.

                                                       CUT TO:

           The vast black reaches of space. A fireball blazes towards us. 
           A SOYUZ CAPSULE ENGULFED IN FLAMES. 

                                 EVAN (O.S.)
                         (trying to remain calm)
                        Eight fifty-five. Everything will be 
                        fine in an hour.

           INT. ARES 1 CAPSULE

           Everything is blurred. Frantic. The capsule shakes violently 
           as EVAN struggles to reprogram its LANDING COORDINATES. 

           He’s red. Panting. Overheating in his pressure suit.

           He’s talking to another ASTRONAUT, whom we only see from 
           behind his fishbowl helmet. Evan’s barely audible over the 
           DEAFENING ROAR. Emergency alarms BLARE.

                                 EVAN
                        Don’t worry -- by 10am, the whole 
                        world will know. 

           He looks at the other astronaut -- as if for confirmation.

           REVEAL: The other astronaut is DEAD. He’s strapped in next to 
           a SECOND DEAD ASTRONAUT. 

           Their eyes and mouths are black and sunken into nothingness. 
           Both have been rotting for months. 

           A burst of static from a SPEAKER in the wall and a VOICE with 
           a RUSSIAN ACCENT. Concerned.

                                 VOICE VIA SPEAKER
                        ARES 1, we’ve activated emergency 
                        LLCD communication.

           Evan STARTLES. As if he hasn’t heard a voice in months. 
                                 VOICE VIA SPEAKER 
                         (anxious)
                        We’ve lost sight of you. Last we saw, 
                        your trajectory was zero-two-seven. 
                        You must reset to four-oh-one 
                        immediately --

           Evan, in direct violation of the command, types completely 
           different coordinates into the navigation system: “9-9-7...” 

                                 VOICE VIA SPEAKER 
                        If you don’t correct your trajectory, 
                        the capsule will overheat. It’ll 
                        explode. Tell us where you are and we 
                        can help --

           The voice turns to STATIC. Smoke pours from the speaker as the 
           system’s insides melt. A shower of sparks rains down on Evan. 

           He buckles himself in NEXT TO THE TWO DEAD ASTRONAUTS.

           The image cuts in and out as he goes in and out of 
           consciousness.

           He eyes the temperature gauges. EXTERIOR: 3706 F°. INTERIOR 
           197 F°. Both numbers RACE UP. He can’t survive much longer...

           Evan unzips his pocket. Pulls out an origami crane. He unfolds 
           it. The “paper” is a PHOTO: his wife CHLOE (33) and son DANNY 
           (8) beam out at him. The photo warps from the intense heat. 

           Evan takes the gloved hand of the DEAD ASTRONAUT next to him. 
           Eyes fill with guilt. 

                                 EVAN
                        We’re not gonna make it. I’m sorry...

           He looks back at the WARPING PHOTO of his wife and son.

                                 EVAN 
                        I’m sorry... I’m sorry...

           As the capsule jolts sideways, his head SLAMS so hard against 
           the wall that his FISHBOWL HELMET CRACKS.

           The world goes silent. Then --

           Cryptic images. Cutting in and out. The SUNRISE flaring as 

           WHOOSH! The capsule’s parachute opens. ARES 1 lands softly 

           IN THE OUTSKIRTS OF AN AFRICAN CITY

           Shocked locals run to the capsule. 
           They stare as the hatch opens. Through smoke, EVAN crawls out.

           It’s slo-mo. Silent. Triumphant. Momentous. 

           Their black hands touch the white suit with awe, as if he were 
           a god crashing-landing from the great beyond.

           INTERCUT NEWS FOOTAGE of the landing: EVAN is carried through 
           the streets on the shoulders of strangers. A hero’s welcome.

           CHLOE pushes through the crowd with her son DANNY. We 
           recognize them from the warping photo in the capsule.

           Chloe, crying with joy, takes Evan’s face in her hands. Danny 
           hugs his chest. 

           NEWS FOOTAGE: The American flag flies over the US Embassy as 
           Evan and his family pass through its imposing gates...

                                                       CUT TO:

           WHOOSH! THE ARES 1 PARACHUTE OPENS OVER RED DESERT

           Floating over stark sand... 

           Until it crashes against a cliff face. 

           Plummets to the ground. 

           Finally the HATCH OPENS. Smoke pours out. EVAN crawls forward.

           Evan’s POV: The world appears bleached. He’s blinded by the 
           daylight. He can barely see his own hands. As he screams in 
           shock, the world goes 

           TOTALLY WHITE. 

                                                       CUT TO:

           Evan’s eyes SNAP OPEN. Crumbs of starlight above. The world 
           around him all blues and violets. Aghast, he realizes he’s 

           IN THE MIDDLE OF THE FUCKING DESERT - NIGHT

           No sign of humanity. The capsule lies behind him. The name 
           “ARES 1” barely legible on its blistered exterior. 

           He clearly didn’t land where he expected. 

                                 EVAN 
                        Fuck. Fuck... FUCK!

           As he talks, he feels like dice are rolling around in his 
           mouth. He reaches in and pulls out A DISLODGED MOLAR. 
           Grimacing, he zips his molar into his pocket.

           His eyes lock on a distant star. He mutters to himself as he 
           pieces things together.

                                 EVAN 
                        M81. That's a mag 7. M81 is a mag 7.  
                        That means... That means I'm at least 
                        200 miles from the nearest city.

           It sinks in. He’s hopelessly far from civilization. 

           LAUGHTER from inside ARES 1. 

           ADRENALINE jolts through Evan. He stares at the capsule. 
           Shocked.

           Silence. Then RUSTLING. Someone’s INSIDE THE CAPSULE.

           Evan, panicking, looks around -- sees nothing but the rocky 
           hillside and parched honeycomb of the mud flat below. 

           He tries to stand, but is too weak. He picks up a rock to use 
           as a weapon. CRAWLS toward the capsule. He’s about to enter --

           When AN ANIMAL with gaping jaws -- TEETH COVERED IN BLOOD -- 
           steps into the doorway. 

           Evan GASPS. It’s a HYENA. Behind it, he can see the inside of 
           the capsule. A CHEWED, DECAYING LEG pokes out of a torn 
           pressure suit. The hyena has been eating the dead astronauts.

           Evan, yelling ferociously, HURLS his rock. Hitting the hyena. 
           It SNARLS. Baring its teeth. It’s about to attack, when --

           Evan completely loses it. Throwing every rock in reach at it.

           The hyena dodges the rocks and retreats. Then continues 
           circling Evan. For the hyena, it’s a waiting game.

           Keeping an eye on his predator, Evan crawls 

           INSIDE THE CAPSULE

           He tenderly tucks the chewed astronaut leg back in its 
           pressure suit. Tries to collect himself --

                                 EVAN
                        OK... OK. It’ll take them 24 hours to 
                        create an algorithm. Estimate where 
                        we landed. 

           He punches buttons on the navigation system. Nothing turns on. 
                                 EVAN 
                        Given wind and pressure, that 
                        estimate could be off by... a 200 
                        mile radius? Pi times 200 squared... 
                        they’ll have to search over 125,600 
                        square miles. They’ll never find me.

           Evan smiles. Feels safer. 

                                 EVAN 
                        But they’ll figure out where I’m 
                        going.
                         (his smile disappears)
                        I gotta get there first...

           The realization kicks him into gear. He rips the medical kit 
           out of the capsule wall. Finds SUPER GLUE.

           EXT. ARES 1 - MOMENTS LATER

           Using his reflective FISHBOWL HELMET as a mirror, he super 
           glues his molar back in. But the glue seeps everywhere. A 
           mess. He tries to hold the tooth in place as it sets.

                                 EVAN
                        Fuck, okay, keep twalking so youh 
                        mouth doesn’t gwue shut. Keep 
                        tawlking. Keep tawlking...

           The glue’s probably set by now. He pulls his finger out.

           Instead of being glued into his gums, the tooth is now super-
           glued to his fingertip.

           He tries to dislodge the tooth. Can’t. For a moment, his face 
           crumbles. He’s utterly defeated. It's all too much.

           Finally the tooth peels off his finger. Relieved by the tiny 
           victory, Evan pulls himself together.

           He struggles out of his pressure suit to just his undershirt 
           and sweatpants. He’s muscle and bone.

           He piles the collapsed parachute over the capsule. Starts 
           heaping SAND on top. Hoping to obscure ARES 1 completely. 

           SEARING NOONDAY SUN - HOURS LATER

           Evan's skin fries as he continues burying the capsule. Hunger 
           gnaws at him. He’s mad with thirst. 
           He digs in the ground. Moving sand aside reveals BLACK SKY AND 
           STARS beneath, as if the ground is paper thin and there is 
           nothing underneath but deep space. It’s the view one might 
           have out a spaceship window. 

           Disturbed, Evan covers the vision up again with sand.

           INT. ARES 1 - MOMENTS LATER

           He rips out wall panels, uncovering the cooling system. Clear 
           pipes of FLUORESCENT LIQUID web like veins through the walls.

           He empties a bottle of rubbing alcohol from the medical kit 
           onto the sand. 

                                 EVAN
                        Coolant is 80% water, 20%... 
                        liquefied neon? Or it is just dibutyl 
                        phthalate? It glows so it can be 
                        repaired in the dark...
                         (pouring coolant into the 
                         empty bottle)
                        Can... I... drink you... 

           As he stares at the bottle, his gaze changes. His eyes lost. 
           He says quietly: 

                                 EVAN 
                        I never vote in Presidential 
                        elections. 

           He stops speaking, his mind now somewhere else completely. As 
           he sets the bottle of neon green coolant down on top of the 
           drawers built into the capsule wall, we hear:

                                 EVAN (O.S.) 
                        Anyone who thinks they’re special 
                        enough to be President is obviously 
                        insane --

                                                  MATCH CUT TO:

           CHLOE putting a neon green margarita down on the bar inside

           A HOUSTON DIVE BAR

           Evan sits beside her. He looks radically different. 15 years 
           younger. Clean-cut. The only recognizable thing is the drive 
           in his eyes. 

           Chloe’s 24. Playful. Bold. Easy to fall for. 
           They obviously don’t really know each other from the way 
           they’re sitting; occasionally she shoots a look over at her 
           girlfriends in the corner. As they talk, she sips the 
           margarita.

                                 CHLOE
                        Didn’t you tell me two seconds ago 
                        that you’re trying to be an 
                        astronaut?

                                 EVAN
                         (nods)
                        I find out in two weeks.

                                 CHLOE
                        There’s probably only been about as 
                        many astronauts as presidents. What 
                        makes you think you’re qualified? 

           INTERCUT: EVAN IN THE CAPSULE IN THE DESERT

           Leaning against a storage container as if over a bar. His eyes 
           focused on thin air, totally detached from the present -- as 
           if he were in the bar right now. He half says the words, half-
           mouths them. Unclear if this is memory or fantasy...

                                 EVAN
                        I spent my life preparing for it. 
                        Every decision I’ve ever made.

           BACK TO THE BAR:

                                 CHLOE
                        Wow. It is like running for 
                        President.

                                 EVAN
                        It’s much easier to be President. 
                        Bush did coke. Clinton and Obama 
                        smoked weed. I don’t get to do 
                        anything.

                                 CHLOE 
                        You’re telling me you’ve never smoked 
                        weed?

                                 EVAN
                        Impressed?

                                 CHLOE
                        No.
                                 EVAN
                        I haven’t had sugar since I was 
                        eight.

                                 CHLOE
                        What does that have to do with being 
                        an astronaut? 

                                 EVAN
                        Sugar causes all kinds of chronic 
                        problems. You can’t have any if you 
                        want to go to space. Not even 
                        sinusitis. 

                                 CHLOE
                        You didn’t even have birthday cake 
                        when you were like ten? That’s sad.

                                 EVAN
                        Only if you’re thinking small. 
                        Immediate gratification. Think big 
                        picture. What do you want?

                                 CHLOE
                        I’ll take another margarita, I guess. 

                                 EVAN
                        No. What do you really want? What do 
                        you want to die having done?

                                 CHLOE
                        Maybe had a family. Kids.

                                 EVAN
                        That’s it? That’s your big 
                        accomplishment? 

                                 CHLOE
                        Having a family is an accomplishment 
                        if it sticks together.

                                 EVAN
                         (shaking his head)
                        People act like the kids are the only 
                        thing that matters. Why are we still 
                        so focused on spreading our genes? 
                        It’s primitive. Tribal. 

                                 CHLOE
                        You have to have children. Otherwise 
                        who will remember you?

                                 EVAN
                        The whole world.
           He smiles. She smiles despite herself. His confidence -- his 
           conviction -- is magnetic. 

                                 CHLOE
                        If every decision you’ve ever made 
                        has been about getting to space, why 
                        did you decide to come over here and 
                        talk to me? 

                                 EVAN
                        If I’m going to be confined in a ship 
                        with other astronauts, I need to 
                        prove to my superiors that someone 
                        can stand me. 

                                 CHLOE
                        So you need a girlfriend?

                                 EVAN
                        Or a wife.

                                 CHLOE
                         (laughs)
                        I haven’t even finished the drink you 
                        bought me. Now you’re asking me to 
                        marry you?

                                 EVAN
                        Now you’re talking big picture. I 
                        thought we could start with dinner 
                        and go from there.

           She looks at him. Can’t tell if she thinks he’s brilliant or 
           bananas. He can tell she’s unsure and smiles. Enjoying her 
           uncertainty.

                                 CHLOE
                        If you finish this.

           She holds out her margarita to him.

                                 EVAN
                        I can’t drink margaritas. Sugar.

                                 CHLOE
                        Exactly. 

           A test. He looks at her, uncertain. She stares back at him. 

           Finally he takes her glass and downs her drink. He splutters. 
           Hasn’t had anything that sweet in 16 years. Chloe cracks up. 

                                                  MATCH CUT TO:
           INT. ARES 1 CAPSULE

           Evan spluttering as he drinks the disgusting GLOWING COOLANT. 
           He puts the bottle of it outside by the door.

           He opens the DRAWERS built into the walls. Inside are HUNDREDS 
           of tiny lead boxes. Each is numbered and sealed shut with a 
           strange complex lock. 

           He picks up a BOX labelled Lana Tube #97. Carefully zips it 
           into his pocket.

           EXT. ARES 1 CRASH SITE - TWILIGHT

           Evan finishes heaping sand over the capsule. Gasps for breath. 

           The sound of blood coursing through his head grows LOUDER. Its 
           rhythm changes. Like his heart’s beating in double-time. 

           Evan swallows -- what’s happening to him?

           He looks up. Sees TWO TINY MOONS in the sky, as if he were on 
           an alien planet. He squints. The MOON reverts to normal. Then 

           A HELICOPTER sweeps over the brim of the mesa above him. 

           Evan’s eyes widen in horror a second. He DUCKS BEHIND A ROCK. 

           Peeks out. Terrified. He realizes he left the bottle of 
           FLUORESCENT COOLANT out. It’s half-obscured by vegetation, but 
           glows faintly in the dusk. Perhaps visible to the chopper. 

                                 EVAN
                        Fuck. Fuck fuck fuck.

           The helicopter swoops lower. Beams a giant SPOTLIGHT down. 

           Evan holds his breath. An eternity.

           Finally the chopper moves on. Combs the hillside. Disappears.

           Evan -- a long, deep breath. 

           He scans the sky. His voice is now just a dry rasp:

                                 EVAN 
                        No stars to the south yet. Sky must 
                        be brighter that way...
                         (grasping for hope)
                        Somewhere -- that way -- is a city. 

           He gazes at the now-buried capsule. Eyes filling with guilt.
                                 EVAN 
                        I’ll come back. And the whole fucking 
                        world is coming with me.

           An oath. 

           He picks up the coolant and treks into the desert. Every step 
           a struggle. The HYENA, sitting on the rocks, watches him go.

           EXT. DAWN IN THE DESERT

           Evan's LIPS and TONGUE GLOW in the dark from the dibutyl 
           phthalate in the coolant. 

           His eyes are horrifically dilated. He mutters to himself. As 
           if trying to prove he’s alive.

                                 EVAN
                        A day has 24 hours and 39 minutes. A 
                        year... has twenty-four months. 687 
                        days.... Today is 547 Mina, year 32. 

           His breathing becomes so labored he can’t speak. 

           INTERCUT: Evan having sex with Chloe. 15 years earlier. Their 
           labored breathing mixing with

           His gasps for air as he stumbles in the desert. 

           Near death. A distant look in his eye. 

           The distant look in Chloe's eye before orgasm --

           Evan passes out. Collapsing onto the sand. AND SUDDENLY --

           He’s in his bed in Houston. Chloe’s on top of him. She slips a 
           finger in his open mouth. She keeps pulling it out just before 
           he can bite down on it. That’s the game. Both are giggling.

                                 CHLOE
                        What’d I tell you? I’m fast, huh? 
                        Here. Try me.

           She opens her mouth. He sticks a finger in it. An intense look 
           between them -- each trying to read the other’s speed -- then--

           She snaps down on his finger before he can fully pull it out. 

                                 CHLOE
                         (laughing)
                        I thought astronauts had great 
                        reflexes. 
           He grins. Pulls her closer.

                                 EVAN
                        Do it again but harder.

           BACK TO EVAN -- PASSED OUT IN THE DESERT

           His eyes are open but frozen in place. He becomes part of the 
           great stillness of the desert.

           FLASH TO: DUSK. The HYENA eating Evan’s body. Crunching and 
           chewing and tearing flesh from bone.

                                                       CUT TO:

           THE FACE OF A DEAD ANTELOPE. A fly walks across the surface of 
           its eye. 

           REVEAL: We’re seeing the world through Evan’s POV. His 
           bloodshot eyes are swollen to mere slits. Lips cracking. 

           Evan realizes he’s TIED UP. Lashed to TWO ANTELOPE CORPSES. 
           All bound back-to-back. A MASSIVE COW is dragging them across 
           the desert, guided by --

           AFRICAN TRIBESMEN. Each nearly-naked body is covered with mud 
           paint. Patterns abstracting the bodies so they look alien.

           They wear bullet-casings in their hair. Bottle caps in holes 
           in their lips. All of them are armed with KALASHNIKOVS.

                                 EVAN
                        Where are you taking me?

           He attempts to get up. Can barely move with 200 lbs of 
           antelope strapped to him. The TRIBESMEN see him straining 
           against his ropes and push him back down with the barrels of 
           their guns... Fingers tense on their triggers.

           Evan, terrified, stops trying to break free. As the tribesmen 
           pull him onward, he looks around. Mutters to himself:

                                 EVAN
                        Shit. Where is it?

           A wave of relief as he spots the MESA in the distance where he 
           buried the capsule.

           EXT. TRIBE’S CAMP - DESERT - TWILIGHT

           Dust fills the air -- kicked up by hundreds of 1500-pound 
           Ankole cattle -- as Evan is pulled into the camp.
           Through the dust, he glimpses more PAINTED TRIBESMEN. They’re 
           ghostly. Alien. 

           Among the crowd, Evan catches a glimpse of a WHITE BOY whose 
           body is SMOLDERING and covered with ash. It’s DANNY. Smoke 
           pouring out of his hair. 

           Evan stares at him. Whispers, barely audible --

                                 EVAN
                        I’m sorry.

           But the ash-covered boy disintegrates in the clouds of dust.

           The tribe’s CATTLE, with 5-foot horns twisting into the air, 
           are monumental. Unearthly. Menacing. 

           As TRIBESMEN cut the ropes around Evan and the antelopes, the 
           tribe’s children begin stealing from Evan’s pockets. 

           HOLD ON: A GIRL pulling what looks like seashells from them. 
           She stares as she realizes they're human fingernails. Why does 
           this man have someone’s fingernails in his pockets?

           BAULU, a 12-year-old BOY with a staff, snatches Evan’s LEAD 
           BOX from another pocket and takes off. 

                                 EVAN
                         (voice cracking with 
                         thirst)
                        STOP! STOP! 

           Evan TACKLES Baulu. Tries desperately to grab the BOX back. 

           BANG! 

           A bullet hits the ground near Evan. He turns. Sees all the 
           TRIBESMEN are training their guns on him. 

                                 EVAN 
                        No -- no -- don’t shoot me! 

           They GRAB EVAN. Drag him violently toward a BONFIRE in the 
           camp’s center. The dead antelope are being skinned. Evan’s 
           terrified it’s his turn next.

                                 EVAN
                        Let go! Give me the box back! It 
                        could be dangerous --

           EVAN’S POV: His vision is cutting in and out from exhaustion 
           and thirst. Blood thumps in his ears like drums or chopper 
           rotors.
           FLASH IMAGE: Chloe breast-feeding their infant son. Evan puts 
           his head on the baby’s side and hears its heart POUNDING. 

           The tribesmen force Evan to his knees in front of THREE 
           SILENT, STONE-FACED FIGURES. Painted head to toe with white 
           cheetah-spots.

           They are so tall and thin that it takes Evan a while to 
           realize they are WOMEN. One around eighteen, another in her 
           thirties, the oldest in her late fifties. Three generations.

                                 EVAN 
                        Please -- let me go! I just need to 
                        get to Addis -- Addis Ababa --

           Evan fights to break free but the tribesmen are too strong. 
           The THREE WOMEN unwrap a long gleaming SABER from a blanket.

                                 EVAN 
                        WAIT! PLEASE.

           The YOUNGEST WOMAN picks up the SABER. Turns toward Evan. 

                                 EVAN 
                        Someone’s looking for me -- they 
                        might hurt my family -- I need to get 
                        to Addis to see my family --

           The women look at him with a cement gaze. Evan realizes they 
           don’t understand his pleas.

           The Youngest Woman pricks a COW’S BACK with the knife. BLOOD 
           squirts out. The OLDEST WOMAN collects it in a gourd. 

                                 EVAN 
                         (still struggling)
                        I need to see my family. They need to 
                        know what I've done --

           The women force the gourd to Evan's parched lips, spilling 
           BLOOD into his mouth. Evan gasps. Spits it out in disgust. 

           FLASH TO INSIDE A SPACE SHUTTLE: Another ASTRONAUT vomits 
           BLOOD. In zero gravity, it floats as globules. 

           As the women push the blood to his lips again, Evan swallows 
           it down. He’s so thirsty that he can’t help himself. 

           Evan blinks his eyes and -- 
           IT’S DAY. NOT NIGHT.

           He wakes to find himself lying on the sand in the tribe’s 
           camp. Dried blood on his lips.

           He takes in the tribesmen. Some wear sneakers and ragged T-
           shirts. But they have few possessions other than Kalashnikovs.

           The THREE STONE-FACED WOMEN sit nearby. They blast the latest 
           Katy Perry hit from a cell phone. The Youngest clutches an 
           RPG, which she thumps to the beat of the music.

           Evan is surprised to see his lead box sitting next to him. He 
           picks it up. The lock is still intact. He shakes it. Something 
           RATTLES inside. Still there.

                                 EVAN
                         (dazed)
                        How long was I out?

           The Youngest Woman points to the horizon with her RPG.

                                 YOUNGEST WOMAN
                        Addis Ababa. 

           She mimes driving. Then points to the sun. Makes a rotation 
           motion with her hands. 

                                 EVAN
                        Tomorrow? A car tomorrow?
                         (he frowns; forcing 
                         himself to his feet)
                        Tomorrow’s too late. I walk. 

           He’s staggering off in the direction the woman pointed, when -- 

           BULLETS EXPLODE all around him. Hitting the sand at his feet.

           Evan turns. Sees the Oldest Woman aiming her gun toward him. 

                                 EVAN
                        The fuck you doing?!

           But she only fired it to get his attention: She mimes walking. 
           Points at the sun. Holds up 6 fingers.

                                 EVAN 
                        Six days walk? Six days to Addis?

           She nods. He frowns. Doesn’t want to wait. Doesn’t have a 
           choice.

           QUICK CUTS: Moments play abruptly, like hallucinations. 
           - Evan is surprised to find a TV in the camp, hooked up to a 
           broken generator. He gets to work on the generator -- opening 
           it up, reconnecting wires. The Three Women, who by now Evan 
           has realized are the leaders of the tribe, are delighted as 
           the TV flickers on. Hopeful, Evan searches through channels.

                                 EVAN
                        News? Do you guys get the news? I 
                        need to see if I’m on it...

           Instead all the TV picks up is a static-y station airing 
           STARGATE. The tribesmen gather around to watch it.

           - He wanders up a nearby a canyon, looking for privacy. He 
           unzips his fly to take a leak. He mutters to himself, trying 
           to psyche himself up: 

                                 EVAN 
                        Tomorrow I’ll arrive in Addis. Get 
                        Chloe and Danny. Take them to the 
                        Embassy. By tomorrow night, 
                        everybody’s gonna know. Everything’s 
                        gonna be fucking great...

           Horrified GASPS from behind him. He looks back:

           Realizes that half the tribe has followed him. They stare at 
           his GLOWING NEON PISS. Even the THREE WOMEN look perturbed.

           Turning around, Evan gets a half-second glimpse of --

           THE SHAPE OF A CAR, obscured by rocks, higher up the canyon. 

           The word “POLICE” on the car’s side. Just as his heart is 
           freezing -- he sees 

           THE CAR IS WEATHER-BEATEN. Clearly been there for ages. Evan 
           clambers over rocks to get closer.

           The CORPSES of two police officers are still strapped in their 
           seats. Leathery skin stretched over their bones. 

           FLASH IMAGE: Evan floating on a spaceship. Watching in time-
           lapse as the TWO DEAD ASTRONAUTS decay inside their pressure 
           suits. Months are compressed into seconds as -- before Evan’s 
           eyes -- bacteria inside the suits eat at the astronauts bodies 
           -- causing the corpses to move inside the suits, shift in 
           their seats. 

           Evan -- aghast -- looks back at the tribe. The Youngest of the 
           Three Women proudly nods toward the cops and taps her RPG, to 
           make it clear this was her accomplishment. 
                                 EVAN 
                         (not sure what to say)
                        Yes. Very impressive.

           A low THUMPING. Evan turns. Pales.

                                 EVAN 
                        Shit!

           A HELICOPTER approaching fast. Evan rushes to the Three Women:

                                 EVAN
                        Don’t tell them I’m here. Please -- 
                        they’ll kill me!

           But the Women ignore him as PANIC ripples through the tribe. 
           Men run to stop their terrified cattle from fleeing. 
           Frightened women stash their kids and chickens in their tents. 

           EVAN SPRINTS INTO A RANDOM TENT

           Crouches down to hide. A WOMAN INSIDE screams at him. 

                                 EVAN 
                        Shh! Be quiet! 

           But the Woman is making a racket. Gesticulating for him to 
           leave, holding her frightened children close to her. He darts 

           OUT OF THE TENT

           Tribesmen aim their GUNS on the chopper as it touches ground. 
           Eight MERCENARIES descend. Weapons drawn. Full body armor. 

           Evan -- scanning for a hiding place -- everything fast -- 
           using the cattle as cover as he dashes into --

           ANOTHER TENT 

           A bunch of kids hiding inside. Evan gets down. PEERS beneath 
           the tent's side. Sees:

           NOVAK (40s, white-blond hair) emerge from the chopper. He 
           looks like someone from middle-management. He’s unfazed by all 
           the Kalashnikovs pointing at him. 

           An ETHIOPIAN COP, trailing behind him, is terrified.

           Novak smiles warmly and sets down the MASSIVE CASE in his 
           arms. The Three Women see it’s full of VODKA BOTTLES. A gift.

           Novak addresses the Three Women in Amharic. The COP translates 
           everything into the tribe’s language. 
           The Women approach. Novak shakes their hands, chattering 
           niceties. Then he shows them a photo on a CLIPBOARD.

           Evan stiffens. Knows he’s in the photo. Novak watches the 
           Three Women’s reactions closely. But they betray no emotion.

           A long beat. Hell for Evan. He can’t hear what’s said next, 
           but he’s alarmed to see Novak take out his wallet. 

                                 EVAN
                         (whispers)
                        No -- no -- no --

           As Novak counts out money, MERCENARIES fan out through the 
           camp -- digging through supplies -- searching tents -- Evan 
           can hear the women and children inside screaming. 

                                 EVAN
                        Shit!

           He sees COMBAT BOOTS approaching his tent. Dives backward, 
           crushing a REED CAGE full of CHICKENS. Now the chickens are 
           loose, screeching and flapping in his face.

           He throws a blanket over himself and the chickens just as -- 

           A MERCENARY enters, aiming his machine gun around, including 
           at the kids, who WAIL in fear. 

           The Mercenary sees the blanket with the suspicious amount of 
           motion underneath. He snatches it up. A BLUR OF MOTION flies 
           toward him --

           BANG! BANG! He FIRES his automatic.

           REVEAL: Evan had already rolled out of the tent. He’s now on 
           the ground outside. Desperately looking for a place to hide... 

           YELLING from all directions. The Tribesmen raise their guns. 

           The Mercenary lifts the blanket. Sees two dying chickens 
           underneath. Novak, furious, yells at him in Amharic.

           Evan spots the ANCIENT STONE WELL nearby. He scans for 
           Mercenaries looking his way -- then 

           LURCHES OVER THE WALL INTO THE WELL

           He hangs on the edge. Looks down -- the well goes down at 
           least thirty feet before plunging into total darkness.

           He peeks over the lip of the well. Sees the Mercenaries 
           heading toward their chopper. A wave of relief sweeps over him 
           Until one glances his way. Did he see Evan peeking out?

                                 MERCENARY
                        Novak!

           Evan, panicking, tries to climb down the well. LOSES his hold.

           He GASPS as he plummets into darkness. The screech and WHOOSH 
           of disturbed BATS rushing past him as he falls --

           SPLASH! He hits the water. Then resurfaces, gasping for air. 

           HIS POV: Everything is black, but for the tiny circle of 
           bright sky 60 feet above. 

           The faces of mercenaries line the top of the well. They peer 
           straight down at him. Evan’s blood freezes.

           As they yell in Amharic above him, Evan realizes they can’t 
           see him in the darkness. He quietly dunks back under. It’s 
           like being submerged in black oil. 

           FLASHLIGHTS cut through the water. Evan forces himself to swim 
           deeper, closing his eyes and -- 

           He’s submerged in a swimming pool in Houston. He can see DANNY 
           (7) above him, sitting in an innertube. Danny’s voice is 
           muffled by the water as he counts out the seconds that Evan 
           holds his breath.

                                 DANNY
                        That’s two hundred! Keep going! 10 
                        more seconds and you’ll break your 
                        record! 10, 9, 8, 7...

           But the memory of Danny blurs as Evan runs out of oxygen in 
           the well. He pushes to the 

           WATER’S SURFACE

           Gasps in breaths. The faces of TRIBESMEN appear around the top 
           of the well. They drop down the end of a ROPE. 

           Evan’s hesitates. Doesn’t know whether this is a trick meant 
           to lure him out. But he’s out of options.

           Wheezing, he ties the rope around himself. Tribesmen HAUL HIM 
           UP.

           EXT. THE TRIBE’S WELL - MOMENTS LATER

           Evan peeks out the top. Not quite believing that the 
           mercenaries left. He hears the distant thump of the chopper. 
           The Tribe exclaim excitedly as he emerges from the well.

                                 EVAN
                         (looking at the Three 
                         Women)
                        Why didn’t you give me up?

           The Oldest Woman holds out a FLYER to Evan. He looks at it.

           It reads “REWARD FOR STOLEN MINING EQUIPMENT AND MINERALS.” 
           There’s images of the EQUIPMENT that was built into ARES 1, 
           but no sign that they were in a space capsule. 

           The other page has a PHOTO OF EVAN: handsome and polished in a 
           suit. 20 lbs heavier. It says “REWARD” in English and Amharic.

           “EVAN LANGE. WANTED FOR MURDER AND THEFT. Last seen in Siberia 
           in February. Believed to be near Dallol, Ethiopia.” 

           FLASH TO: KEIJU, one of the other astronauts, floating in the 
           space shuttle as Evan slits his throat. BLOOD explodes from 
           Keiju’s neck. In zero-gravity, the blood beads and rises into 
           the air in globules -- like red confetti. 

           All around Evan -- giant FOOTPRINTS litter the red sand, left 
           by the mercenaries’ combat boots. Tribal children, giggling, 
           put their tiny feet inside the footprints. 

                                                    MATCH TO: 

           DANNY (7) steps inside giant footprints in red dirt. Walking 
           within the footprints, he traces his father into 

           THEIR BARN. We’re at EVAN’S MODEST RANCH HOUSE. OUTSIDE 
           HOUSTON.

           Evan looks up from repairing the engine of his 2-SEAT PROP 
           PLANE and listening to an audio recording on his iPhone.

                                 EVAN 
                        Danny, c’mere. Listen to this...

           He backs up the audio as Danny crawls under the plane and lies 
           down next to his father. 

                                 EVAN 
                        This might be my favorite thing in 
                        the entire world. It’s from 50 years 
                        ago. The real recording from inside 
                        Apollo 10...

           He hits play. Mid-Atlantic accents cut through the static --
                                 CERNAN (ON RECORDING)
                        Once you get out of lunar orbit, you 
                        can... Oh -- who did it?

                                 YOUNG (ON RECORDING)
                        Who did what?

           Evan is already giggling.

                                 STAFFORD (ON RECORDING)
                        Give me a napkin quick. There’s a 
                        turd floating through the air.

                                 YOUNG (ON RECORDING)
                        I didn’t do it. It ain’t one of mine.

           Now Danny erupts in laughter. They both love it.

                                 STAFFORD (ON RECORDING)
                        Mine was a little more sticky than 
                        that. Throw that away.

                                 YOUNG (ON RECORDING)
                        God almighty.

           Evan laughs so hard there are tears in his eyes. 

                                 EVAN
                        And you know what? All those turds 
                        they’re talking about are in freezers 
                        in the building where Daddy works. We 
                        kept them all in little bags.

                                 DANNY
                        Will they keep your number twos from 
                        when you go to space?

                                 EVAN
                        Yup. They’ll be scientific artifacts.

           Danny’s very impressed. Evan goes back to repairing the radio.

                                 DANNY
                        How soon do you have to go away 
                        again?

                                 EVAN
                        Sunday.

                                 DANNY
                        How long this time?

                                 EVAN
                        Six weeks.
           Danny’s heart sinks. Evan doesn’t see it. 

                                 DANNY
                        Will you call me?

                                 EVAN
                         (shakes his head)
                        I won’t be allowed to. NASA needs to 
                        know that I can be away from you guys 
                        and still be just fine. 

           Danny’s hurt by this, but Evan doesn’t notice. 

           Danny nuzzles his dad. Doesn’t want the moment to end. 

                                                       CUT TO:

           EXT. THE TRIBE’S CAMP - MORNING

           Evan startles awake as he hears SHOUTING. A DUST CLOUD -- 
           kicked up by a vehicle in the distance -- moves toward them. 

           Evan, nervous, slides behind a tent in the back of the camp. 

           Meantime, the tribe hide their cell phones, TV, T-shirts, and 
           sneakers so they’re naked, except for their guns and paint. 
           They now resemble something from the “sad Africa” photo books 
           that litter coffee tables the world over.

           A BUS, emblazoned with the name “HEART OF DARKNESS TOURS”, 
           bumps over the desert into the tribe’s camp. 

           A TOUR GUIDE with a megaphone descends first, followed by 30 
           WHITE UMBRELLAS in the hands of TOURISTS, shading themselves. 
           They’re a smorgasbord of Chinese, Saudis, and whites. They 
           carry cameras in their free hands. Snap, snap, snap--

           Their TOUR GUIDE is a burned-out and sun-burned Australian. 

                                 TOUR GUIDE
                         (into megaphone)
                        So the Saba tribe have been ‘ere for 
                        40,000 years. Can you believe that? 
                        That’s since Jesus times 20. This is 
                        a snapshot of your ancestors, ladies 
                        and gentlemen. You’re now standing in 
                        the past.

           The tribe stares warily at their visitors. The tourists gape 
           back, mostly through the lenses of their cameras. 

           Evan -- using this moment of distraction -- ducks 

           INSIDE THE NEAREST TENT
           He digs through bundles. Outside, the Guide drones loudly:

                                 TOUR GUIDE (O.S.) 
                        But the government wants to mine 
                        copper ‘ere. So they’re trying to 
                        push the Saba off their land. 
                        Apparently just because you’ve had 
                        something for 40,000 years doesn’t 
                        make it yours.

           Finally Evan finds a stash of knives and handguns. He’s 
           tucking a pistol into his waistband when --

           BAULU, the boy with the staff, comes in. Sees him stealing the 
           gun. He yells at Evan, who quickly puts the gun back--

                                 EVAN
                        Sorry, sorry --

           He darts out. 

           The Guide is marching the tourists through the camp. Evan eyes 
           them from a distance. Not sure he can trust them. 

                                 TOUR GUIDE
                        So the Saba are warring with the 
                        police. Hence, you might notice they 
                        have some weapons. 

           The tourists laugh nervously, eyeing the Saba’s guns. 

                                 TOUR GUIDE
                        These women in cheetah-print...

           He motions to the three HEAD WOMEN.

                                 TOUR GUIDE
                        ...Are the wives of the chief, who’s 
                        in prison for killing several police 
                        officers. 

           Knowing the Saba can’t understand, the Guide adds flippantly: 

                                 TOUR GUIDE 
                        Eventually the police will just force 
                        the Saba to re-locate to the city or 
                        lose patience and kill them all. 
                        Aaaaanyway, you have ten minutes 
                        here. Get some photos. But remember: 
                        they’re not zoo animals. So they 
                        expect you to pay for them. 

           The tourists use selfie sticks to pose for photos with the 
           tribe. They cradle the Saba’s Kalashnikovs and grin widely. 
           Evan crosses the camp toward the Tour Guide. The tourists 
           stare. Wondering what a white man in filthy rags could be 
           doing here. Even the Guide looks scared of him.

                                 TOUR GUIDE 
                        Fuckin’ A. What happened to you?

                                 EVAN
                        I was sightseeing up north. My Jeep 
                        broke down. I was trying to walk back 
                        to Addis when these people found me.

                                 TOUR GUIDE
                        Bloody ‘ell. Didn’t anyone at your 
                        hotel tell you it’s only safe to come 
                        out ‘ere on a guided safari?

                                 EVAN
                        I need to get back to Addis. Can I 
                        hitch a ride with you guys?

                                 TOUR GUIDE
                        It’s two thousand Birr per person. 

                                 EVAN
                        I lost my wallet in the desert. I’ll 
                        pay you when we get to Addis. My wife 
                        is there... 

                                 TOUR GUIDE
                        Sorry. Can’t let people on the safari 
                        carriage who haven’t paid. But I’ll 
                        call the police and I’m sure someone 
                        can come and -- 

                                 EVAN
                         (quickly)
                        But I’ve already been out here three 
                        days. My wife must be worried sick 
                        about me.
                         (the Tour Guide shakes his 
                         head “no” --)
                        She’ll pay you extra for helping me. 
                        Please. A thousand dollars. Maybe 
                        more.

           That gets the Guide’s attention. He relents.

                                 TOUR GUIDE
                        I’m really not supposed to do this... 
                         (taking out his roster)
                        What’s your name?
                                 EVAN
                        Chris. Chris Padrick.

           The Tour Guide scribbles it on his roster. 

                                 TOUR GUIDE
                        We’ll leave as soon as the women have 
                        finished their craft activity.

           Evan realizes the female tourists are now doing some sort of 
           basket-weaving with the Saba women. 

           INSIDE THE BUS - MOMENTS LATER

           Evan takes a seat in the back. The Youngest of the Three Women 
           taps on his window with the barrel of her RPG. Evan tenses.  
           Next to her is BAULU, who caught him trying to steal the gun. 

                                 EVAN 
                        Fuck...

           The Woman, scowling, raps on the window again. Evan opens it. 

                                 EVAN 
                        I’m sorry, I wasn’t going to take --

           The Woman thrusts a BUNDLE through the window and leans in.

                                 YOUNGEST WOMAN
                         (heavily accented)
                        Go kill police.

           Evan startles -- she speaks English? -- but before he can 
           reply, the TOURISTS begin filling the bus.

           He peeks into the bundle. Inside is a RUSTING HANDGUN. 

           He surreptitiously checks the chamber. Six bullets inside. 

                                            SUDDEN CUT TO BLACK.

                                 MAN’S VOICE 
                        Chris. Chris?

           Evan’s EYES OPENING -- heart pounding -- springing up -- where 
           is he? He sees he’s IN THE BACK OF THE SAFARI BUS bumping 
           through the desert. But he’s unsure how he got there. 

                                 MAN’S VOICE 
                        Chris. Want some?

           The voice belongs to a SUNBURNED BRITISH TOURIST, who holds 
           out a BAG OF CHIPS. Sun blisters cover his bald red head.
           FLASH IMAGE: The surface of a red planet, covered in craters.

                                 SUNBURNED TOURIST
                        You know where y’ are?

           Evan looks at him blankly. 

                                 SUNBURNED TOURIST 
                        You got lost in the desert. Y’ Jeep 
                        broke down... Don’t remember?

                                 EVAN
                        No, I do... I do.

           He stuffs some chips in his mouth. The Tourist sees Evan is 
           jittery. Like he’s afraid. Or in withdrawal.

                                 SUNBURNED TOURIST
                        Your hands are shakin’.

           Evan thrusts his hands in his bundle. Keeping his hands 
           hidden, he starts folding the WANTED AD into an origami crane. 
           As if by keeping his hands busy, he can calm his nerves. 

                                 SUNBURNED TOURIST 
                        I had the shakes once. When I first 
                        got clean. Couldn’t fill my coffee 
                        cup too full or I’d spill it carryin’ 
                        it to my desk.

           Evan yanks down the window and VOMITS outside.

                                 SUNBURNED TOURIST 
                        That too. 

           Beat.

                                 EVAN
                        One time, when I was getting sober, I 
                        told people I'd gone to space. I was 
                        in a bar, saying I was an astronaut. 
                        My wife had to come haul me out of 
                        there.

           The Tourist smiles and starts blabbering about his AA 
           experiences. But the sound of his voice cuts out as --

           Evan’s focus shifts to the strange world out the window: 
           Beehive-shaped huts. Termite obelisks. Children playing on the 
           road. Vultures, flapping ragged wings, tear at dead animals. 

           He startles as he sees TWO ASTRONAUTS in pressure suits 
           setting up equipment in the desert. He STARES at them. 
           The Tourist follows his gaze, but sees nothing. 

           The bus bumps into a DUSTY VILLAGE. Evan turns to the Tourist.

                                 EVAN 
                        Why’re we stopping? 

           He sees they are pulling up next to some ETHIOPIAN POLICEMEN.

                                 EVAN 
                         (panicking)
                        Are we scheduled to stop here?

           The Sunburned Tourist shrugs. Evan looks like he might jump 
           out the window until the Guide announces:

                                 TOUR GUIDE
                        This is Harar market, ladies and 
                        gents. They sell the finest khat in 
                        Ethiopia. A mild stimulant. Let’s go 
                        sample something that would be 
                        illegal where you come from...

           The tourists follow the Guide into the NIGHT MARKET outside. 
           Evan turns to the Sunburned Tourist, who’s about to get off:

                                 EVAN
                        Hey. Could I borrow some money? Just 
                        ‘til Addis...

                                 SUNBURNED TOURIST
                         (over his shoulder)
                        Sorry mate, I only have forty Birr 
                        left and there’s no ATMs out here...

           Evan’s now alone on the bus, but for the DRIVER, who yaps on 
           his phone. 

           He sees many of the tourists left their BAGS onboard. 

           Keeping an eye on the Driver, Evan checks the bags. He’s 
           disappointed -- most people took their wallets out with them. 

           Finally he finds a purse with A CELL PHONE and WALLET inside. 

                                 EVAN
                         (mutters to himself)
                        Big picture. 

           A TOURIST comes back on the bus. Evan quickly drops the ENTIRE 
           PURSE into his bundle from the tribeswomen. He hurries out

           INTO THE CHAOTIC NIGHT MARKET 
           The Guide and tourists furiously chew khat leaves at various 
           stalls. Bits of green spittle flying out of their mouths.

                                 TOUR GUIDE
                        Don’t go overboard. It takes a few 
                        minutes for the narcotic to kick in --

           Evan sees a NEON SIGN that says “INTERNET.” An internet cafe. 
           He heads toward it, past vendors hawking from cars and booths. 

           Villagers STARE at Evan and the tourists. Beggars grab at him, 
           gesturing that they want food. Children chant “Faranji!” 

           Evan realizes that, as a white person, he’s too conspicuous. 

           His eye falls on a VEILED WOMAN selling BURKAS. Modesty for 
           Muslim women. He picks out a burka with netting over the eye 
           hole. Buys it with cash from the stolen wallet.

           INT. INTERNET CAFE - MOMENTS LATER

           Evan sits in front of a decade-old computer with recording 
           software and an “Upload to Youtube” window open. 

           He sees himself projected on the screen, recorded by the 
           computer’s camera. He looks like shit. 

           He spits on his hands and rubs his face clean. Rifles through 
           his stolen purse. Tidies his hair with the woman’s brush. 

                                                       CUT TO:

           CHLOE (33 now) fixes Evan’s hair. They’re backstage at

           A NASA PRESS CONFERENCE - HOUSTON 

           Evan’s 40. Wearing a sleek suit. He can’t stop beaming. 

           She holds his face in her hand a moment. Overwhelmed with 
           pride. A look that says I love you no matter what. 

           An ANNOUNCER ONSTAGE introduces “EVAN LANGE” and...

           He strides onstage. Facing a cheering auditorium. A row of 
           press in front with DOZENS of CAMERAS.

           BACK IN HARAR’S INTERNET CAFE: 

           Evan stares into computer’s single lens. Lost in the dream. 
                                 EVAN (O.S.; PRE-LAP)
                        If you wanted to tell the history of 
                        mankind over the last million years, 
                        you’d say...

           BACK TO THE NASA PRESS CONFERENCE 

           Evan soaks up the crowd’s feverish excitement as he speaks.

                                 EVAN 
                        Man learned to make fire. Man walked 
                        on the moon... And two years from 
                        today, we’ll add a third milestone to 
                        human history: Man walks on Mars.

           On cue, the curtains behind him PULL BACK, revealing: A 30-
           FOOT IMAGE OF MARS with the NASA logo on it.

                                 EVAN 
                        America will lead the world there!

           BACK TO THE DUMPY INTERNET CAFE

           The sound of the NASA crowd cheering continues in Evan’s mind 
           as he sits facing the crowd of dumpy computers and people 
           glumly surfing the web. Completely ignoring him.

           He clicks the RECORD button. He speaks with quiet intensity:

                                 EVAN (INTO THE VIDEO CAMERA)
                        My name is Evan Lange, retired 
                        Colonel, U.S. Air Force. I’m posting 
                        this statement in case something 
                        happens to me before I can go to the 
                        press with proof of what I’ve done. 

           BACK TO THE NASA AUDITORIUM:

           The crowd continues to applaud. Evan’s elated. A man whose 
           dreams are coming true.

           Evan’s eyes meet Chloe’s as she holds up their son DANNY (8) 
           in the eaves of the stage. 

           Danny watches in awe. Can’t believe this legend in the 
           spotlight is his father. 

                                 EVAN (O.S.) 
                        I was part of a team of three 
                        astronauts that went to Mars. 

           BACK TO THE INTERNET CAFE IN HARAR
           Evan continues speaking quietly into the camera:

                                 EVAN (INTO THE VIDEO CAMERA) 
                        The other two, Yuri Gershkovich and 
                        Keiju Sasaki, are now dead. They were 
                        murdered to preserve the mission’s 
                        secrecy. Now my life is in danger. My 
                        family’s might be as well. I meant to 
                        land near Addis, so I could get my 
                        family to safety... But the capsule 
                        went off course. I landed at --

           A jolt of fear as he glimpses OUT THE WINDOW --

           POLICE walking toward the internet cafe with the Tour Guide, 
           who clutches a WANTED flyer, like the one Novak gave the Saba.

           Evan’s fucked. Has to stop recording now. He hits UPLOAD and --

           Runs out the back door as POLICE come in the main entrance.

           EXT. EMPTY ALLEY

           Evan pulls on his BURKA. Sprints round the corner and back 

           INTO THE CHAOTIC MARKET. 

           Changing pace so no one will suspect him. He tries to burrow 
           through the human traffic -- trying to look small -- 

           INTERCUT THE NASA CELEBRATION AT THE SPACE CENTER

           The blood thumping through Evan’s ears in Harar giving way to 
           the thumping, celebratory music.

           Evan weaves through the NASA party. Standing tall. Lapping up 
           attention from every direction.

           Evan has Danny on his shoulders and Chloe on his arm. Her hair 
           has fallen out of place. He tenderly tucks it back behind her 
           ear.

                                 EVAN
                        Ground Control to Shoulders 1, please 
                        state your destination.

           Danny spots a buffet table, laden with desserts. 

                                 DANNY
                        Shoulders 1 to Ground Control. 
                        Steering to cookies, over.
                                 EVAN
                         (following his son’s gaze)
                        Roger that.

           He heads toward the desserts, but Congressmen and journalists 
           stop him for autographs and photos. Everyone wants a piece of 
           the man who will make history. One man lowers his bald head 
           for Evan to sign. The FLASH FLASH FLASH of cameras --

                                                      BACK TO:

           A BRIGHT LIGHT BEAMED OVER THE HARAR NIGHT MARKET

           Evan looks back. Shit, there’s a COP following him -- beaming 
           a SUPER HIGH POWER FLASHLIGHT over the crowd -- saying 
           something into his radio --

           Evan, increasingly panicked, quickens his pace -- 

           He checks again. The POLICE OFFICER ducks down another street.

           Evan turns onto an alley. Lined with cars. No one in sight. 

           Using the HANDGUN from the Saba, he smashes the window of a 
           beat-to-shit SEDAN. This sets off a nearby DOG barking. 

           Evan unlocks the door. Gets in. 

           Through the SIDE-MIRROR -- he sees POLICE searching further 
           down the street near the barking DOG.

           EVAN traces the battery and starter WIRES. Strips the rubber 
           off them with his teeth. Twists the bare wires together.

           SPARKS cascade over his hands. The CAR’S LIGHTS GO ON.

           -- illuminating A HUGE MAN screaming and wielding a crow bar, 
           who rushes toward Evan from down the alley. The SEDAN’S OWNER.

           Evan, trying to stay focused, darts out. Tears open the hood.

           It is a strange sight: A “woman” in a burka, shouldering a 
           purse, frantically hotwiring a car. Pumping the throttle...

           The SEDAN’S OWNER is only ten feet away as --

           The ENGINE finally roars to life. Evan leaps inside as the 
           SEDAN’S OWNER raises the crow bar --

           Evan slams the door shut behind him and --

           The crowbar HITS THE DOOR. Blowing a huge dent in it.
           It gets worse -- other NEIGHBORS rush out in front of the car. 
           Evan can’t drive forward -- they’re blocking his way. 

           The OWNER opens the door. Grabs Evan. About to pull him from 
           the car when --

           Evan THROWS the car in reverse. The Owner is left just holding 
           a RIPPED PIECE OF BURKA as Evan guns the car back. The CROWD 
           and COPS rush after him. TOO LATE. He tears round a corner --

           INSIDE THE CAR

           Going flat out. Pedal to the floor.

           Evan’s beaming. Ecstatic to have gotten away. 

           But then he notices TOYS on the dash. Clearly belonging to the 
           OWNER’S KIDS. A flash of guilt in his eyes. 

                                 EVAN 
                        Big picture.

           Evan tosses the toys into the back. Out of sight.

           MATCH CUT from the night sky out the windows to --

           THE STARS OUT THE WINDOW OF A SPACE SHUTTLE - FLASHBACK

           Evan (40), naked, sings as he takes a space shower. It seems 
           as if he’s in deep space until we cut outside to:

           INT. MASSIVE NASA HANGAR - HOUSTON - SIMULTANEOUS

           The NASA Mars Czar JOE DERRINGER (54, obese) and CHLOE (33) 
           stride toward the docked SPACE SHUTTLE. Visibly upset. 

           Video screens simulate stars outside the shuttle’s windows. 

           Derringer tears past the obstructions blocking the shuttle’s 
           entrance. A huge sign reads: “ISOLATION TEST. DO NOT ENTER. 
           Days remaining: 43.” 

           He opens the shuttle door and they enter

           INT. SPACE SHUTTLE - CONTINUOUS

           Evan gasps and tries to hide his naked ass from his boss.

                                 EVAN
                        You guys -- get out! I’ve got a month 
                        left in here!
           Chloe looks raw. Like something horrible has happened and 
           she’s afraid to tell him. She steps toward him.

                                 CHLOE
                        The budget vote was today. They 
                        wanted you to hear it from me.

           It doesn’t sink in for Evan. Denial hits first.

                                 EVAN
                        Am I gonna have to start isolation 
                        all over again? I’ve already done 97 
                        days --

           Then he sees tears in Derringer's eyes. 

                                 DERRINGER
                        Evan. No one’s going to Mars. It’s 
                        over.

           Evan’s body sags under the weight of disappointment. His eyes 
           screwing shut, his knees caving. Chloe goes to hold him. 

           Derringer FLICKS a switch outside the door and THE SIMULATION 
           OF OUTER SPACE -- its endless sparkling stars -- GOES DARK.

           INT. STOLEN SEDAN -- STREETS OF ADDIS ABABA - EARLY MORNING

           Evan careens past goats, motorbikes, people in suits. He takes 
           in the chaos from behind the anonymity of his burka. 

           He Googles “Bechtel Addis” on the phone from the STOLEN PURSE.

                                                       CUT TO:

           EXT. SLEEK BECHTEL OFFICES - ADDIS - MINUTES LATER

           Evan, still in his burka, waits outside in the stolen sedan. 
           He watches the building intently. 

           He notices a MAN (mid-40s) crossing the street, speaking on a 
           phone in Russian. He looks very ordinary, but his face is 
           taught with worry. 

           Evan’s eyes lock on the man. A sense of time slowing down.

                                 EVAN
                         (murmurs)
                        You fucker. You knew I’d come here...

           Keeping his gun hidden inside the purse, he cocks it. Steps 
           out of the car. Follows the man. 
           Evan glances around -- the street is crowded -- Can he shoot a 
           man in broad daylight? -- suddenly he sees --

           CHLOE (39 now). Exiting the Bechtel offices. 

           No longer the harried mother from Houston, she’s the image of 
           success. A suit and pearls. Her face is turned away as she 
           laughs about something with her TWO ASSISTANTS. 

           Through the burka’s eyehole, we see in Evan’s eyes -- longing. 
           Regret. And fear.

           Chloe enters a CHAUFFEURED TOWN CAR, which quickly drives off. 

           Evan turns back to the RUSSIAN. He’s already getting in a 
           JEEP. It peels off to tail CHLOE’S CAR.

           Evan darts back to the stolen sedan. He nearly mows down a 
           WOMAN in his desperation not to lose sight of CHLOE’S CAR.

                                                       CUT TO:

           EVAN trailing Chloe’s car and the Russian’s Jeep. They stop 

           OUTSIDE A MASSIVE SKY-SCRAPER CONSTRUCTION SITE

           Chloe emerges from her car in a hard hat. Evan can only 
           recognize her by the BLOND BRAID poking out. 

           FLASH IMAGE: Evan’s hands braiding Chloe’s hair -- just the 
           top part, then Chloe takes over. Their morning routine.

           Chloe speaks through a megaphone in Amharic, organizing the 
           army of construction workers. Big smile. She loves this.

           Evan looks around. Unsure how to reach her without the Russian 
           seeing from his JEEP parked outside the construction site. 

           Finally he sees a nearby MOSQUE marked by a minaret. WOMEN 
           file into one entrance. Men into another. Now he has an idea.

           MOMENTS LATER ON THE STREET OUTSIDE THE CONSTRUCTION SITE

           Evan approaches an old man in a tattered suit. He raises his 
           pitch a little, trying to sound feminine:

                                 EVAN 
                        English? Speak English?

           The man clearly doesn’t understand. 

           Evan spots CHILDREN heading toward their PREP SCHOOL. They 
           wear little ties and oxford shoes. He approaches. 
                                 EVAN 
                        You speak English?

                                 SCHOOLBOY 1
                        I speak English!

                                 SCHOOLGIRL
                        I speak better English!

                                 SCHOOLBOY 2 
                        I’m FBI! I’m Spiderman!

                                 SCHOOLBOY 3
                         (looking at Evan, who 
                         towers over them in his 
                         black burka)
                        Are you Batman?

           He holds up a finger of his gloved hand. “Wait.” 

           He types a message on the cell phone: I pay you to help me. 

                                 SCHOOLGIRL
                         (reading the message)
                        What help?

           Evan types: Go in the new building. Ask for Chloe Lange. Tell 
           her a woman needs to talk to her in the mosque. About Danny.

           The Schoolgirl reads the message. Looks perplexed. 

                                 SCHOOLGIRL 
                        I don’t think I should --

           Before she says more, Evan holds out several bills from the 
           STOLEN WALLET. He has no clue how much they’re worth, but the 
           girl looks as if she just won the lottery. 

           SOUND SEGUE:

                                 EVAN (O.S.)
                        Many economists argue that the first 
                        trillionaires will make their 
                        fortunes from mining Mars.

                                                       CUT TO:

           INT. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE - PENTAGON - FLASHBACK

           Evan (42) delivers a formal PowerPoint presentation to NEIL 
           MCMURTRY, a drowsy D.O.D. official. 

           Evan is out of shape. Red-eyed. On edge. Something is off. We 
           don’t know what yet.
                                 EVAN 
                        The US can't afford to let foreign 
                        companies or governments get there 
                        first and reap the rewards. 

           Evan flips to slides of cerium, lanthanum, iridium, etc.

                                 EVAN 
                        The 21st century runs on rare earth 
                        minerals. The only problem: the 
                        Chinese have bought up the world’s 
                        supply. If China has a total monopoly 
                        on the raw materials necessary to 
                        build electronics -- is that a safe 
                        position for our country? 

           McMurtry’s deep and gravely voice contrasts comically with his 
           boyish looks. 

                                 MCMURTRY
                        If the American people didn’t believe 
                        in financing the manned NASA mission, 
                        it’s not the D.O.D.’s job to over-
                        ride them. 

                                 EVAN
                        That’s because no one presented it to 
                        them as a matter of national 
                        security. 

           He rambles, getting closer to McMurtry --

                                 EVAN 
                        You don’t have to get Congress to 
                        approve every project. I know the 
                        D.O.D. has never balanced its budget. 
                        Has never explained to Congress or 
                        anyone else where defense spending 
                        actually goes. Financing NASA’s 
                        manned Mars mission is the only truly 
                        important thing we could be doing 
                        right now. As a nation. As a species.

           As Evan gets close, McMurtry’s expression changes as he gets a 
           whiff of Evan’s breath. 

                                 MCMURTRY
                        If it’s so important, why did you 
                        show up drunk? 
           A look between them. McMurtry feels like Evan is pissing away 
           his time. He gets up and leaves Evan standing in the empty 
           conference room. Humiliated.

                                                      BACK TO:

           INT./EXT - THE MOSQUE NEAR CHLOE’S CONSTRUCTION SITE

           Evan tries to pass through the WOMEN’S ENTRANCE, but a 
           SHROUDED WOMAN stops him. She says something sharply in 
           Amharic. He’s starting to panic--

           Until he follows the woman’s gaze down to HIS FEET: He’s not 
           supposed to wear shoes here. He tucks his shoes in his purse.

           Tall panels divide men from the women inside. Evan walks 

           INTO THE WOMEN’S COURTYARD behind the mosque.

           Waits anxiously. Two WOMEN stare at his clearly Caucasian and 
           man-ish feet. He tries to rearrange the burka to hide them. 
           Finally he sees 

           CHLOE. Framed by the mosque’s entrance. Her Assistants are a 
           step behind her. The Schoolgirl squints in. Points to Evan. 

           His pulse starts to race as Chloe comes into the courtyard, 
           still trailed by her two female assistants. 

           Evan looks at her like she’s one of the wonders of the world.

           She addresses him in Amharic. 

                                 CHLOE
                        (Ma'am? The little girl said you 
                        wanted to talk to me...?)

           Only Evan’s eyes are visible. In them -- a cascade of 
           emotions. He’s imagined this moment for so long. 

           Chloe misinterprets his silence. She laughs, embarrassed.

                                 CHLOE 
                        (I guess the girl was wrong. Sorry--)

           She turns to walk away. Evan grabs her arm.

                                 EVAN
                        It’s me. It’s me, Chloe.

           As her eyes meet his -- she freezes. How could this be him?

           The world goes silent for them as he reaches out, his fingers 
           tracing her cheekbone. She’s overwhelmed. Barely reacts. 
           In the heat of the moment, neither of them notices:

           The WOMEN who stared at Evan’s feet approach with a MOSQUE 
           ADMINISTRATOR. Chattering in Amharic. The Administrator lifts 
           the bottom of Evan’s burka. Sees his masculine feet. 

           Before Evan has time to react, the Administrator, yelling, 
           angrily tears the burka off Evan’s head.

           And now Chloe sees him for the first time. He's a disaster. 
           Gaunt. Scraped. Filthy. She gapes. 

                                 CHLOE
                        You son of a bitch. 

           The Administrator angrily shoves Evan toward the exit, but he 
           resists. Starts talking. Fast. Intense. 

                                 EVAN 
                        Chloe. You’re being watched. That’s 
                        why I brought you here. Somewhere you 
                        couldn’t be followed... 

           Then he sees TWO WHITE MEN step into the WOMEN’S ENTRANCE. 
           Shouting in Amharic. The IMAM and mosque visitors frantically 
           try to stop the TWO MEN from entering the women’s space. 

                                 EVAN
                        Shit!

           He breaks free of the Administrator. Forces Chloe toward the 
           courtyard’s back wall -- out of sight of the TWO WHITE MEN.

                                 EVAN 
                        Chloe. We have to go!

                                 CHLOE
                        Evan, stop!

           Evan starts to push her over the wall, but she fights him. Her 
           Assistants try to stop him, but he shoves them back.

                                 EVAN
                        Get over!

                                 CHLOE 
                        Stop! Evan! Whatever you think is 
                        happening is not real -- 

           INSIDE THE MOSQUE -- SIMULTANEOUS

           The TWO WHITE MEN barrel past the Imam. Scan the mosque’s dark 
           interior -- don’t catch sight of EVAN and CHLOE yet --
           BACK AT THE COURTYARD WALL:

           Evan pulls the GUN from his bundle. Points it at Chloe. 

                                 EVAN
                        This is real. Please. We have to go 
                        now!

           The TWO WHITE MEN hear Chloe SCREAM. They rush forward as --

           Evan forces Chloe over the wall. They drop down into 

           A NARROW PASSAGE

                                 CHLOE
                        Evan -- please -- don’t hurt me -- 

           He pulls her down the alley, still aiming the gun at her.

                                 EVAN
                        We’re too exposed!

           Doors along the passage. Evan tries one. Locked. He lets go of 
           Chloe so he can 

           HURL himself at the wood door. It BREAKS DOWN. 

           Chloe is rushing off, yelling for help. He lurches after her. 

                                 EVAN 
                        Chloe! No --

           She sees the TWO MEN dropping over the mosque's wall. They’re 
           drawing HAND GUNS. She gasps. Scared. 

                                 CHLOE
                        This is real.

           He grabs her and SHOVES her through the KICKED-DOWN DOOR.

           The TWO MEN see EVAN in the empty alley. They shoot -- 

           Just as EVAN bursts through the doorway

           AND INTO SOMEONE’S KITCHEN

           A family inside. Screaming. Chaos. The HUSBAND grabs a lamp 
           and SWINGS it at them. Evan brandishes his gun. The Husband 
           throws up his hands, dropping the lamp -- it SHATTERS as Evan 
           pulls Chloe through the front door onto 
           THE STREET

           Evan’s STOLEN SEDAN is there, idling next to the mosque. 

           A ROAR behind them. Evan turns -- 

           In the distance, a POLICE HUMMER turns onto the street. A MAN 
           with an AUTOMATIC pops through its sunroof. 

                                 EVAN 
                        Get in! 

           He pushes her into the car. Jumps in behind her and floors the 
           accelerator. The car stalls. 

                                 EVAN 
                        Fuck!

           He leaps out. Throws open the car’s hood. Pumps the throttle. 
           The ENGINE ROARS to life as --

           The POLICE HUMMER barrels toward them over ridiculously pot-
           holed ground. The COP standing through the sunroof aims his 
           automatic at Evan. But he can’t get a clear shot with all the 
           bumps -- and there’s too many people on the street.

           Evan jumps back in the car and careens around the corner. Guns 
           down the maze of medieval streets. The Hummer’s on their tail.

                                 CHLOE
                         (terrified)
                        Evan! What have you done?!

           Improvising, he makes a SUDDEN TURN between two buildings. 
           Blasts his horn. Pedestrians scatter. They plow through 
           garbage. Laundry lines catch on the windshield. 

           They turn onto an EMPTY STREET. No pedestrians. No other cars.

           BANG! BANG! The Cops OPEN FIRE. The back window explodes 
           behind them. Glass everywhere. Chloe screams as Evan SWERVES 

           DOWN A MEDIEVAL ALLEY. SUPER NARROW.

           His SIDE MIRRORS HIT THE WALLS. They CRACK and SNAP OFF.

           The sides of his car SCRAPES LOUDLY against the ancient stone 
           walls. It’s like a funnel -- getting narrower and narrower. 
           The doors warping inward. Crumbling toward Chloe. She screams. 

           The Cops SWERVE onto the ALLEY to follow them. CRASH! Their 
           HUMMER hits the stone walls. Can’t come after them...

           Evan’s sedan SLAMS against the alley’s walls. They’re stuck!
           AT THE MOUTH OF THE ALLEY: the POLICE climb through their 
           sunroof. Running on foot to catch up with Evan’s crashed car. 

           Evan throws the car in reverse. Pulls back from the wall 
           they’re stuck on. Accidentally hits the wall behind them. 
           Shifts to DRIVE -- and his BATTERED SEDAN lurches forward.

           Before the Cops catch up, the sedan slips out of the alley. It 
           looks like a crumpled soda can. A miracle it still drives.

           EXT. ADDIS ROAD - MOMENTS LATER

           Chloe -- still unsure whether she should be more afraid of 
           Evan or his pursuers -- snatches her phone from her bag.

                                 CHLOE
                        I’m calling the police!

                                 EVAN
                        You can’t! They’ve been bought off. 
                        Call Danny. We need to get to him 
                        before those men do.

           Chloe, horrified, is about to reply when her phone RINGS with 
           a call from “Nobles Academy.” She gasps. 

                                 CHLOE
                        It’s his school!
                         (picking up, frazzled)
                        Danny? Hello?

                                 MRS. WEBER (ON PHONE)
                         (scared)
                        Mrs. Lange, it’s Mrs. Weber from 
                        Nobles. The police are here looking 
                        for Danny -- 

                                 CHLOE
                        Oh my God. Why?

                                 MRS. WEBER (ON PHONE)
                        Your husband is having a psychotic 
                        episode and they’re scared he might 
                        hurt your son. 

           For a moment Chloe is paralyzed. Frightened. Confused.

                                 MRS. WEBER (ON PHONE)
                        But Danny didn’t show up at class 
                        this morning and we can’t find him. 
                        Do you know where he is?
                                 CHLOE
                        No, I thought he was at school!

                                 MRS. WEBER (ON PHONE)
                        Hold on. The man with the officers 
                        wants to speak to you --

           A tiny pause as the phone is handed off. MISHA SURKOV, Russian 
           accent, comes onto the line. 

                                 SURKOV (ON PHONE)
                        Mrs. Lange, this is Misha Surkov. 
                        Your husband’s employer. If you’re 
                        with him now, say yes.

           Chloe glances at the gun, still sitting on Evan’s lap, 
           pointing at her as he drives.

                                 CHLOE
                        Yes.

                                 SURKOV (ON PHONE)
                        I’m sorry he dragged you into this. I 
                        had a security team watching you in 
                        case he tried to get to you. Tell us 
                        where you are and we’ll send help --

                                 CHLOE
                        Why are you looking for him?

                                 EVAN
                         (listening to Chloe’s side 
                         of the conversation)
                        What’s wrong? Is Danny OK?

                                 SURKOV (ON PHONE)
                        He’s been working for my mining 
                        company. At a deep-sea platform. Very 
                        isolated. We believe he killed his 
                        two co-workers and stole samples from 
                        the mine.

           Chloe looks at Evan. Stricken. Speechless. 

                                 SURKOV (ON PHONE)
                        Has he shown you any samples or 
                        boxes?

                                 CHLOE
                        No. 

                                 SURKOV (ON PHONE)
                        I want to protect you and your son. 
                        Do you know where he is?
                                 CHLOE
                        Why would he go to Danny?

                                 SURKOV (ON PHONE)
                        Evan needs you two to help him hide --

                                 EVAN
                        Chloe, who is that?!

                                 SURKOV (ON PHONE)
                        If you care about your son -- and if 
                        you care about Evan -- you’ll bring 
                        him here. To the school. I’ll see 
                        that he’s taken care of...

           Evan tries to snatch the phone from her, they struggle for it. 
           The car careens toward the side of the road.

                                 CHLOE
                        STOP!

           But Evan now has the phone. 

                                 EVAN (INTO PHONE)
                        Who is this?

                                 SURKOV
                        Evan. Thank God. Don’t hang up. Just 
                        listen to me. You don’t understand 
                        what’s really happening--

           Evan blanches and throws the phone out the window. Meantime 
           Chloe opens her door and is about to jump out --

                                 EVAN
                        Chloe, no!

           He slams the brakes and grabs her. Cars swerve to avoid 
           hitting them.

           She goes for the gun. He stops her from getting a full grip -- 
           BANG! -- wild shot -- into the roof.

                                 EVAN
                        Chloe! Stop!

           They wrestle -- four hands, one gun and -- BANG! Another shot 
           tears through Evan’s door. Suddenly he has the tighter grip.

           He throws himself on top of her. Pinning her to her seat. 
           Pressing the gun to her chest. 
                                 EVAN
                        That man you spoke to -- he might 
                        hurt Danny. Or take him hostage and 
                        use him as bait to lure me out --

                                 CHLOE
                         (overlapping)
                        You’re crazy -- you need help --

                                 EVAN
                        We have to get to Danny before 
                        Surkov. Where is he? 

                                 CHLOE
                        Leave my son alone, you crazy fuck! 

                                 EVAN
                        You have to trust me. It could mean 
                        Danny’s life. 

                                 CHLOE
                        Evan. You see things that aren’t 
                        real.

           Beat.

                                 EVAN
                        Just tell me where Danny is and I 
                        won’t hurt you.

                                 CHLOE
                        How can I trust you? You killed two 
                        people.

                                 EVAN
                         (cut deep)
                        You believe a stranger over me?

                                 CHLOE
                        You are a stranger. 

           He sees he’s not getting anywhere. He leans in. Flat out now.

                                 EVAN
                        Fine. You’re gonna drive us to Danny. 
                        Then take us to the Embassy. Once 
                        we’re safe there, I’ll prove that 
                        Surkov planned the murders of two 
                        people -- and wants me dead as well. 
                        Danny’s safety is now in your hands. 
                        OK? 

           He offers her the gun.
                                 EVAN
                        This is to protect us from them. Not 
                        from each other. Take it.

           She looks at him. Incredulous. She takes it. 

                                 EVAN
                        Get in the driver’s seat. 

           The tension in the car is still sky high as they awkwardly 
           switch seats. She keeps the gun on him.

                                 CHLOE
                        How do I know you’re not going to 
                        attack me again while I drive?

           Evan spots a JUMP ROPE among the TOYS he threw onto the 
           backseat. He grabs it. Knots his wrists together so his hands 
           are tied in front of him. 

                                 EVAN
                        Tighten it.

           Chloe’s surprised again. As she leans over him to tighten it, 
           he smells her hair. She notices. A intense look between them. 

           She starts driving.

                                 CHLOE 
                        If something's happened to him, I 
                        swear I'll fucking kill you.

                                 EVAN
                        I’m scared too, Chloe.

                                 CHLOE
                        You don’t get to be scared. You 
                        haven’t called your son in three 
                        years. He hates you. He won’t want to 
                        see you, much less talk to you.

           Evan swallows. This was his greatest fear. 

                                 CHLOE
                        We’re finding him and then you’re on 
                        your own. 

           They sit in furious silence. His eyes grow distant. 

           Suddenly -- he floats into the air. Losing gravity. He flies 
           toward the backseat, which merges seamlessly into:

           INT. SPACE SHUTTLE’S “KITCHEN” - FLASHBACK
           Evan floating up to the shuttle’s oven, which looks like a 
           high-tech briefcase. Evan tears open his meal -- a little tray 
           of chicken wings covered with plastic wrap. He starts eating.

                                 DANNY (O.S.)
                        Dad, why are you eating out of a 
                        suitcase?

           Evan looks over at DANNY (10), standing on the “floor” of the 
           shuttle, pointing to the briefcase-like oven. What the hell is 
           he doing there?

                                 DANNY
                         (touching a chicken wing)
                        This is still frozen. Dad... You’re 
                        eating raw frozen chicken.

           Danny gapes at Evan a moment. Then he runs off, yelling. 

                                 DANNY
                        MOM! C’mere quick!

           He exits Evan’s POV. Evan continues to eat on the shuttle.

           Suddenly -- a loud BEEP -- BEEP -- BEEP. 

           The shuttle’s MASTER ALARM goes off. As Evan floats toward the 
           navigation console to investigate the problem --

                                                       CUT TO:

           EVAN’S EYES SNAP OPEN - FLASHBACK

           He sees a HEART MONITOR. BEEP -- BEEP -- BEEP.

           Danny leans in close.

                                 DANNY
                        Mom! Look! He’s awake.

           Chloe (35 now) darts forward. Evan realizes he’s in a HOSPITAL 
           BED. Chloe brushes her hand through his hair.

                                 CHLOE
                        How you feeling, sweetie?

                                 EVAN
                        What’s happening?

                                 CHLOE
                        The doctor said it’s delirium 
                        tremens. When did you last have a 
                        drink?
                                 EVAN
                        Delirium what?

                                 CHLOE
                        You were seeing things, Ev. They said 
                        it’s a symptom of withdrawal. 

                                 DANNY
                         (pushing forward)
                        You were standing naked in your 
                        bedroom eating raw frozen chicken out 
                        of a piece of carry-on luggage. 

           Evan takes in their worried faces. Sees his wife and son’s 
           image of him is in jeopardy. He tries to preserve his dignity.

                                 EVAN
                        I must’ve been sleepwalking or 
                        something. 

           Chloe squeezes Evan’s hand. Her face taut with emotion. 

                                                      BACK TO:

           Chloe’s expression is similarly tense as she guns

           THE STOLEN SEDAN 

           Through countryside. Evan peers suspiciously out the window.

                                 CHLOE
                        I think I know where Danny is. I 
                        overheard his friend talking about a 
                        place they go when they ditch class.

                                 EVAN
                        How come his school is way out here?

                                 CHLOE
                        It’s a boarding school.

                                 EVAN
                        Boarding school? You sent him to 
                        boarding school? How often do you see 
                        him?

                                 CHLOE
                         (hard and fast)
                        How often do you see him? 

           Evan squirms.
                                 EVAN
                        Chloe, I have something important. 
                        Something the American government 
                        will pay a lot to get their hands 
                        on...

                                 CHLOE
                        What? Stolen minerals? 

                                 EVAN
                        There’ll be enough money to go back 
                        to the States. Get our lives back.

           Chloe looks at him a moment. Surprised this is what he wants. 
           She laughs.

                                 CHLOE
                        You think I've just been waiting for 
                        you to come back? I’ve spent three 
                        years building a life here. I’m not 
                        going to throw it away. Especially 
                        not for you.

                                 EVAN
                         (taken aback)
                        You said all you wanted was a family. 

                                 CHLOE
                        When would I have said that? 

           Evan’s surprised. She’s changed so much, she doesn’t even 
           remember who she used to be.

                                 EVAN
                        At the bar that first night. That’s 
                        all you wanted. This time, we can do 
                        it right. 

           For a second she looks like she wishes she could believe him. 

                                 CHLOE
                        I have two hundred people working on 
                        my projects. Building homes for 
                        almost a hundred thousand. Finally 
                        I’m my own Goddamn hero. I need to 
                        stay here. Big picture. 

           Sweating, she punches the air conditioner. It’s broken. 

           She unbuttons several buttons of her formal shirt.

           Evan glances sidelong. Catches a glimpse of her breast and 
           bra... Then, on her fingers, an ENGAGEMENT AND WEDDING BAND.
                                 EVAN
                         (dumb-founded)
                        You’ve re-married?

                                 CHLOE
                         (nods)
                        I finally found someone who puts me 
                        and Danny first. 

                                 EVAN
                        But we’re still married!

           She looks at him. Years of anger and pain coming out.

                                 CHLOE
                        On paper, maybe. But when I think 
                        about you, I feel like there's a sock 
                        in my throat.

           This crushes him. He stares out the window. 

           The barren landscape on the outskirts of Addis becomes... 

           THE BARREN LANDSCAPE OUTSIDE HOUSTON.

           We’re at EVAN’S LITTLE RANCH HOUSE 

           Evan fixes the radio of his PROP PLANE. The wires inside the 
           cockpit’s dashboard look like a bowl of spaghetti.

           CHLOE pulls her car into the drive. Seeing Evan, she hops out 
           and hurries toward him, carrying papers. Big smile. 

                                 CHLOE 
                        They offered me the Addis project.

           She thrusts the contract toward him. He flips through it. 

                                 CHLOE
                        Eight years. Transforming a quarter 
                        of the city.

           Evan looks at the contract, clearly not into it.

                                 EVAN
                        What am I gonna do in Africa? 

                                 CHLOE
                         (annoyed)
                        I don’t know, Ev. What are you doing 
                        here? 

                                 EVAN
                        Getting the mission reinstated.
           It drives her crazy that he won’t recognize reality. 

                                 EVAN
                        You want me to give up.

                                 CHLOE
                        I want you to grow up. 

                                 EVAN
                        It’s sad you think they’re the same 
                        thing.

           She starts walking back toward the house.

                                 CHLOE
                        I’m gonna go make some calls. You 
                        have fun with Danny.

                                 EVAN
                        That’s it for me now, huh? You go to 
                        work, I have fun with Danny? You 
                        build a city, I baby-sit? 

           She stops. Looks back. Sees how lost he is.

                                 EVAN
                        I was supposed to be someone, Chloe. 
                        Not just a husband. Not just a dad. 

           She steps toward him. Puts an arm around him. He resists 
           momentarily. Then lets her get closer. 

                                 CHLOE 
                        Come to Addis. Let’s start over.

           He looks at her. A chunk of hair from her messy blond braid 
           has fallen over her face. He tucks it back behind her ear. 

           She leans in. About to kiss him...

           Then, just as fast, she pulls away. Emotion floods her face.

                                 EVAN
                        What?

                                 CHLOE
                        You promised you’d quit. 

           Evan turns away, caught.

                                 CHLOE
                        Do you seriously need to get fucked 
                        up to spend time with your son?
                                 EVAN
                        I don’t know. Maybe I need it for 
                        when you get home.

           Chloe stares Evan down. He stares back, not giving a shit. 
           She’s about to say something when--

           DANNY (11) arrives carrying a toolbox from the house. Chloe 
           angrily marches past him toward her car. Evan takes the tools 
           from Danny and goes back to repairing the radio.

                                 DANNY
                        Can we go flying?

                                 EVAN
                        Mom says no.

                                 DANNY
                        Yeah but... she’s leaving.

           Evan notices Chloe’s driving off. She guns her car down the 
           highway. A hint of remorse in Evan’s eyes.

           INT. TINY PROP PLANE IN EVAN’S BARN - MOMENTS LATER 

           Evan steers onto the driveway. Danny buckled in beside him.  
           They wear headsets so they can talk over the roaring engine.

                                 EVAN
                        OK, so last time you were having 
                        trouble lining up with the runway...

           Evan slurs his words a little. It’s unnerving, but Danny 
           doesn’t pick up on it. 

                                 DANNY
                         (excited)
                        Can we fly all the way to Africa?

           Evan stops the plane. Turns to Danny. 

                                 EVAN
                        Why Africa?

                                 DANNY
                        Mom said we’re gonna move there.

                                 EVAN
                        When did she say that?

           Danny flushes. Knows he said something he wasn’t supposed to.
                                 DANNY
                        Like...two weeks ago? I dunno.

                                 EVAN
                        So Mom said not to tell me?

           Danny’s scared of his Dad’s anger. Evan kills the engine.

                                 DANNY
                        What are you doing?!

           Evan huffs out of the plane. Danny screams as Evan walks away. 

                                 DANNY
                        You said we’d go flying!

                                 EVAN
                        Well the mission got cancelled. Let’s 
                        go!

           He tears off his headset and continues toward the house. 
           BEHIND HIM -- Danny switches into the pilot’s seat. 

           Evan hears the ENGINE ROAR back on. He spins around. 

                                 EVAN 
                        Danny! Turn the engine off! DANNY!

           His eyes widen as Danny accelerates onto the empty road. Their 
           make-shift runway. Evan bolts after it. 

                                 EVAN 
                         (screaming)
                        Wait! Danny, stop! Please, Danny!

           He watches in horror as the plane TAKES FLIGHT. 

           The worst moment of Evan’s life.

                                 EVAN 
                        DANNY! No, no, NO --

           He shoves his headset back on. Yells into it. Wild-eyed.

                                 EVAN 
                        Danny? Can you hear me? I can help 
                        guide you down. 

           Evan runs after the plane. Desperate to keep it in sight.

                                 EVAN 
                        I’m so sorry. Just talk to me, OK? 

           The prop plane turns back. DESCENDS toward the road. 
                                 EVAN 
                        You’re coming in too steep. Danny! 

           The plane -- a blur of motion -- about to crash -- becomes --

                                                  SMASH CUT TO:

           The STOLEN SEDAN. SCREECHING to a sudden stop outside

           A SOCCER FIELD - DIRE DAWA

           Chloe jumps out, leaving Evan in the car with his hands still 
           bound in front of him.

                                 EVAN
                        Wait! Where’re you going!

           Chloe spots eight 14-year-old boys sprawled out across the 
           grass fifty feet away. She sprints toward them.  

                                 CHLOE
                        Danny! 

           They sit up, bleary-eyed. Some hold joints and cans of beer. 

                                 BOY’S VOICE
                        Aw fuck. It’s my mom! 

           The boys race toward their bikes, shouting “RUN! GO!”

           BACK AT THE CAR: Evan struggles to unlock the door with his 
           bound hands. He falls from the car as he awkwardly shoves open 
           the door.

           Meantime: DANNY (14, disaffected, scarred face) reaches for 
           his bike when one of his FRIENDS overtakes him and rides off.

                                 DANNY
                        Solomon! You dick!

           But his friend is gone. Danny keeps running from Chloe.

                                 CHLOE
                        Danny! You stop right now!

           Desperate to stop him, she pulls out the gun and fires into 
           the ground beneath her.

           BANG!

           Danny stops and spins around. He gapes at the gun.

                                 DANNY
                        Oh my God.
           And now, brandishing it, she gets to ask the question all 
           mothers wish they could ask:

                                 CHLOE
                        Why do you never pick up my fucking 
                        calls?! 

                                 DANNY
                        Mom! What the fuck?!

           Chloe softens, lowers the gun, and approaches her son.

                                 CHLOE 
                        I’m sorry. You had me so worried. 
                        C’mere...

           She tries to hug him, but he backs away. Scared.

                                 DANNY
                        Why do you have a gun?

                                 CHLOE
                        Something terrible has happened.

                                 DANNY
                        What?

                                 CHLOE
                        Your father came back.

           Danny finally looks past her and sees EVAN approaching. 

           Evan stops short as he sees his son. So much older now. White 
           splotches of hair grow from burn scars on his scalp. 

           Danny, in turn, realizes that he’s looking at his own father, 
           who looks like a shipwreck survivor. Danny looks a little 
           disoriented... is it the weed? 

                                 DANNY
                        What happened to you? 

           He takes a step toward Evan. His voice sounds dazed.

                                 CHLOE
                        Don’t get too close, Danny --

                                 DANNY 
                        You’re all messed up... 

           He reaches down and ties Evan’s untied shoe. He dusts off 
           Evan’s shirt. Trying to clean him up. Trying to make him look 
           more like the father he remembers.
                                 DANNY
                         (his voice breaking)
                        What happened to you? 

           Danny seizes Evan’s shoulders and hugs tight. Nearly squeezes 
           the breath out of him. 

           FLASH TO: Evan pulls Danny (11) out of the crashed prop 
           plane’s burning wreckage. Danny is unconscious. Blackened.

           Evan wants to hug Danny back but can’t with his hands tied. He 
           buries his face in his son’s hair.

           Chloe -- affected by it. Says nothing. Just watches. 

                                 EVAN 
                        You smell a little more like pot than 
                        I remember.

           Danny’s crying. Tears of joy. 

                                 DANNY
                        I’m sorry. Dad. I’m so sorry.

                                 EVAN
                        For what?

                                 DANNY
                        That we left you behind.

           As Danny hugs him, Evan awkwardly glances at Chloe. She looks 
           hurt and conflicted.

           INT. HOSPITAL - HOUSTON

           Evan, clothes blackened from the burning plane, approaches a 
           room. Through a glass wall he can see DANNY, lying in a 
           hospital bed with an oxygen mask. Chloe's hunched over him.

           He knocks on the door. Chloe looks back. Her face is swollen 
           and red from crying. She comes to the door. Opens it a crack.

           Evan is about to apologize, but Chloe doesn't give him time. 
           Her eyes are as sharp as broken glass.

                                 CHLOE
                        Stay away from us. If you don't, I'll 
                        press charges of endangerment and 
                        neglect and get you in jail, where 
                        you probably belong. 

           She starts to shut the door. Evan stops it.
                                 EVAN
                        Wait, Chloe, I --

                                 CHLOE
                        -- I don’t want to hear another word 
                        from you. Ever. Do you understand, 
                        you selfish piece of shit? ...Do you?

           A beat. Then finally he nods -- barely breathing.

           She shuts the door hard. He slowly walks away. His expression 
           blank. Whatever fire was driving him has completely gone out. 

                                                      BACK TO:

           Danny starts untying Evan’s hands. Chloe springs forward.

                                 CHLOE
                        Stop! Danny, he’s committed some kind 
                        of crime. The police are after him --

                                 DANNY
                        You said he was never coming back. 
                        You’re such a fucking liar!

           Evan is startled by his harshness toward his mother. 

                                 EVAN
                        She’s trying to look out for you. 

                                 DANNY
                         (finishes untying him)
                        She’s crazy. I haven’t seen her in 
                        months.

           Evan shepherds Danny to the car. Chloe clutches the gun. Not 
           sure what to do.

                                 EVAN
                        Your Mom’s telling the truth -- the 
                        police are looking for us. We have to 
                        get to the Embassy and then 
                        everything will be fine --

           Evan and Danny get in back as Chloe gets in the driver’s seat.  
           Chloe tries to turn the engine on, but the car stalls. 

                                 CHLOE
                        Shit!

           They look around... stuck in the middle of nowhere.
                                 EVAN
                        Okay. We’re gonna be fine. Can you 
                        call your husband?

                                 DANNY
                        Husband? She’s not married. She 
                        doesn’t even have a boyfriend.

           Chloe looks embarrassed. 

                                 EVAN
                        Then what are the rings --

                                 DANNY
                        She just wears those to stop guys 
                        from hitting on her.

           Evan looks relieved despite himself.

                                 DANNY
                         (to Chloe)
                        Did you tell him you were married? 
                        Why are you so fucking crazy?

                                 CHLOE
                        Everybody shut up! We need to find 
                        someone to take us to the Embassy.

           Danny sees an ONCOMING CAR driving toward them. He leaps out,  
           practically jumping right in front of the car.

                                 CHLOE AND EVAN
                         (horrified)
                        DANNY!

           The oncoming car stops just inches before hitting him. Danny 
           yells at the WOMAN behind the wheel in Amharic. The WOMAN 
           shakes her head and keeps driving. 

                                 CHLOE
                        What are you doing?!

                                 DANNY
                        Getting us a ride. 

           Danny waves down a PICK-UP TRUCK. Exchanges Amharic with the 
           sharp-eyed DRIVER. 

                                 DANNY
                        He says he’ll take us to the Embassy.

                                 EVAN
                        What if he knows the police are 
                        looking for us? He’ll turn us in.
           Chloe pulls out her wallet and thrusts money into the Driver’s 
           hands. Evan hesitantly climbs into the bed of the pick up.

                                 EVAN
                        Lie down. We can’t let anyone see us.

           As the family lies in the truck bed -- with Danny between 
           Chloe and Evan -- the Driver guns the TRUCK back toward Addis.

                                 DANNY
                        Why are the police looking for us? 

           Evan hesitates. Scared they won’t believe him. Then:

                                                       CUT TO:

           INT. NONDESCRIPT OFFICE BUILDING - MOSCOW - FLASHBACK

           Evan walks in wearing a rumpled suit. He straightens his hair 
           as he approaches the RECEPTIONIST.

                                 EVAN 
                        I’m Evan Lange. I was hired to do 
                        some consulting for Mr. Surkov.

           INT. SMALL OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER

           An ASSISTANT (early 30s) shows Evan in. Inside is just a desk, 
           with a large sealed package on it.

                                 ASSISTANT
                        First -- you must sign a non-
                        disclosure agreement.

           She hands him an NDA. Evan skims it. Signs.

                                 ASSISTANT 
                        You may open the package now.

           Evan, confused, tears it open. Finds several packs of origami 
           paper and instructions for how to fold a paper crane.

                                 ASSISTANT 
                        Mr. Surkov would like to you try to 
                        fold one thousand paper cranes in 
                        ninety minutes. After you make each 
                        one, you will drop it in here.

           She shows him a CHUTE built into the wall.
                                 ASSISTANT 
                        For this, Mr. Surkov is willing to 
                        pay you two thousand dollars, in 
                        addition to reimbursing all travel 
                        expenses, of course.

                                 EVAN
                        So I signed a non-disclosure 
                        agreement. And now I make swans.

                                 ASSISTANT
                        This is what Mr. Surkov flew you to 
                        Moscow to do. Do you accept or not?

           Evan relents. Sits down at the desk. 

                                 EVAN
                        Kooky billionaires, huh? Must be fun 
                        being his assistant. 

           The assistant looks at the clock on the wall.

                                 ASSISTANT
                        Your ninety minutes starts now.

           She exits. Evan reads the origami instructions. Starts folding 
           with his obsessive precision. He drops each crane into the 
           chute as he goes.

           90 MINUTES LATER

           A timer buzzes. Evan drops his last crane into the chute.

           A BEAT. Evan wipes the sweat off his face. 

           The door opens. A MAN (mid-40s) enters in an understated suit. 
           The same man Evan almost shot outside Chloe’s office in Addis.

           In his hands are TWO of Evan’s ORIGAMI CRANES. He’s excited 
           and warm -- a fan meeting a rock star.

                                 SURKOV
                        Colonel Lange! I’m Misha. Misha 
                        Surkov. Thank you for coming all this 
                        way.

           He gives Evan a hug. A long hug. One Mississippi -- two 
           Mississippi -- Evan’s wondering what the fuck is going on -- 
           three --

           Surkov finally releases him.
                                 SURKOV 
                        Unfortunately you only made 433 
                        little birds. I asked for a thousand.

                                 EVAN
                        The astronaut's union only allows me 
                        to make 433 origami swans a day. Take 
                        it up with them.

           Surkov unfolds the two cranes, flattening the papers onto the 
           table. He examines them admiringly.

                                 SURKOV
                        This is your first bird, and this is 
                        your last. The folds are just as 
                        precise on the last one as on the 
                        first. Most people get sloppy as they 
                        run out of time.
                         (smiles)
                        But you do well under pressure. And 
                        imagine if you were sober!

           Evan ignores the remark.

                                 EVAN
                        So you’re some kind of origami 
                        forensic? 

                                 SURKOV
                        I am the owner of this museum. 

           He opens another door. Through it Evan can see: A PRIVATE 
           MUSEUM filled with artifacts from the Soviet space program.

           INT. SURKOV’S PRIVATE COLLECTION - MINUTES LATER

           Evan and Surkov, each holding a glass of vodka, meander past 
           glass display cases, old Soyuz capsules, rocket parts...

                                 SURKOV
                        -- So the police raid my party in 
                        Paris... full of whores. None of them 
                        were even for me! 

           Evan laughs. Surkov’s energy is infectious.

                                 SURKOV
                        So the Siberian Minerals board forced 
                        me to cash out. Now I focus on my own 
                        company. Quartus. Have you heard of 
                        it?
                                 EVAN
                         (trying to be polite)
                        No, but that doesn’t mean -- 

                                 SURKOV
                         (cutting him off)
                        Good. I don’t want anyone knowing 
                        about us. The best way to come in 
                        first is for no one to know there’s a 
                        race...

           Evan isn’t sure what he’s talking about. Before he can ask, 
           Surkov points to a strange contraption:

                                 SURKOV 
                        You know what this is?
                         (Evan shakes his head, no)
                        In the ‘60s, the Soviet Space Program 
                        wondered what cosmonauts should eat 
                        on the journey to Mars. Just one more 
                        pound of food or water adds tens of 
                        thousands of dollars to the mission 
                        cost. So the scientists hoped to have 
                        cosmonauts raise their own meat on 
                        the journey. This is the mouse farm.

           Evan smiles.

                                 EVAN
                        I’ve read the reports. They also 
                        recommended the astronauts eat all 
                        the paper onboard after they were 
                        done with it.

           They’re like history buffs -- men who bond over facts not 
           feelings. Comparing notes on a mutual obsession.

                                 SURKOV
                        I want to do something with my money, 
                        Colonel. Jeff Bezos spent 42 million 
                        dollars building a clock in the 
                        desert that will run forever. Fucking 
                        stupid, right? We’re going to one-up 
                        him. Him and Neil Armstrong and 
                        Leonardo da Vinci and...
                         (smiles)
                        Everybody else who’s ever lived, 
                        basically. 

                                 EVAN
                         (beginning to have an 
                         inkling, stares)
                        How?
                                 SURKOV
                        By sending you to a place only God 
                        has seen.

           Surkov’s been looking forward to this moment and watches 
           Evan’s eyes widen. Surkov smiles. 

                                 EVAN
                        Why?

                                 SURKOV
                        The greatest fortunes the world has 
                        ever know will be made mining space. 

                                 EVAN
                        No. I mean -- why me?

                                 SURKOV
                        I bribed someone at NASA to get their 
                        records. I found out about your 
                        special skill.
                         (off Evan’s confusion)
                        Most people show signs of mental 
                        deterioration after just a few weeks 
                        of isolation. But that doesn’t happen 
                        to you, does it? You like being 
                        alone. This mission will be two years 
                        with Zero contact with Earth. 
                        Otherwise we run the risk of people 
                        finding out what we’re doing.

                                 EVAN
                         (surprised)
                        You want to go there in secret?

                                 SURKOV 
                         (nods)
                        If other companies hear of our 
                        mission, they might try to beat us 
                        there. 
                         (quiet, almost seductive)
                        Can you keep your mouth shut until 
                        you get home? Then -- once you’ve 
                        gone and come back safe -- we tell 
                        the entire world.

           Evan can’t help but smile. Stars in his eyes.

                                 SURKOV
                        But before that... not even your 
                        family.

           Surkov looks meaningfully at Evan’s wedding ring. Evan takes 
           it off and tucks it in his coat pocket. 
                                 SURKOV 
                         (smiles)
                        I’m not a family man myself. Family 
                        is small business. I don’t do small 
                        business. 

           Evan takes another sip of his vodka. 

                                 SURKOV 
                        Another promise. That drink in your 
                        hand will be your last --

           Evan whirls the liquid around in his glass, still half-full. 
           Resolved, Evan puts the glass down on top of a display case. 

           Surkov smiles. Picks up Evan's glass. Raises it to Evan in a 
           "cheers." Then downs the remaining vodka. 

                                                      BACK TO:

           INT. PICK UP TRUCK EN ROUTE BACK TO ADDIS 

           Danny (still stoned) and Chloe stare at Evan.

                                 EVAN
                        Right now, I’m the only one who knows 
                        where the capsule is. But Surkov is 
                        searching the desert for it. If he 
                        gets it before we do with all the 
                        samples inside, I have nothing, 
                        except for this...

           He pulls the LEAD BOX from his purse.

                                 EVAN 
                        Inside here... is something that 
                        doesn’t exist on Earth. 

                                 DANNY
                         (rapt)
                        What is it?

                                 EVAN
                        I don’t know. I never tested any of 
                        the samples we collected myself. And 
                        we left all the testing equipment 
                        behind to lighten the load for 
                        departure. But after the other 
                        astronauts died --

           FLASH TO: Evan cutting the throat of the other astronaut. 
           Blood exploding from his throat into zero gravity.
                                 EVAN
                        -- I went through their notes. Yuri, 
                        the exo-geologist on board, wrote 
                        about this one again and again. He 
                        called it nezemnoy. 

                                 DANNY
                        What’s that mean?

                                 EVAN
                        Unearthly. Alien.

           Danny gazes at Evan with awe-inspired reverence. 

                                 DANNY
                        Holy shit. Dad... that’s awesome.

           Evan gasps as he realizes Chloe is using the stolen phone.

                                 EVAN
                        Wait -- don’t call the police!

           But she’s only Googling “Misha Surkov.”

                                 CHLOE
                        Surkov is only worth three billion. 
                        NASA always projected the mission 
                        would cost at least ten.

                                 EVAN
                        There’s a lot of billionaires in 
                        Russia. I’m sure other mining 
                        interests invested with him.

                                 CHLOE 
                        Then prove it. Prove what you have in 
                        that box is really from Mars.

                                 EVAN
                        I can’t. It’s locked.
                         (he shows them the complex 
                         lock on the box --)
                        And I wouldn’t open it anyway. It has 
                        to be analyzed and quarantined to 
                        make sure it doesn’t contain deadly 
                        pathogens. That’s why we’re going to 
                        the embassy. Then you’ll have more 
                        proof than you can handle.

           Chloe obviously doesn’t believe a word of it.

                                 CHLOE
                        Why would Surkov hire an alcoholic? 
                                 EVAN
                        He wanted astronauts with no 
                        families. 

                                 DANNY
                        But you had us.

                                 EVAN
                         (awkward)
                        But we weren’t talking. He wanted 
                        people who wouldn’t be missed... I 
                        stopped drinking two and a half years 
                        ago.

                                 DANNY
                        For the mission?

           Evan nods.

                                 CHLOE
                         (hurt, disgusted)
                        You stopped for that, but you 
                        wouldn’t stop for us? 

           A pained look between Evan and Chloe. 

                                 EVAN
                        Remember how NASA worried about the 
                        effects of spending two years in zero-
                        G?

           He crawls closer to her in the truck bed. Chloe backs into the 
           corner --

                                 CHLOE
                        Stay away. Don’t try to touch us.

                                 EVAN
                         (still coming closer)
                        -- and how the spine might expand 
                        with water? How do you explain the 
                        fact I’m two inches taller than when 
                        you last saw me? Lie down next to me 
                        and you’ll see I’m telling the truth.

           He lies down straight in the truck bed. Skeptical, she 
           straightens out beside him. Trying to measure him.

           Chloe stares at Evan... amazed. It’s clear from her reaction 
           that he DOES seem taller.

                                 DANNY
                        See? He’s not lying. 
                         (to Evan)
                        Holy shit. You’re gonna be the most 
                        famous person ever. 

           Evan can’t help it... He smiles a little. A glimmer of his old 
           cockiness from Houston.

                                 EVAN
                         (to Chloe)
                        Impressed?

                                 CHLOE
                        What if you had just landed this 
                        “capsule” where Surkov told you to?

                                 EVAN
                        He would have killed me.

                                 CHLOE
                        So now he can kill all three of us? 
                        Is that what you wanted?

           Evan gathers himself.

                                 EVAN
                        It was never my plan to put you in 
                        danger. I thought I’d land in Addis, 
                        get you and Danny, be at the Embassy 
                        in an hour. I wanted to keep you 
                        safe. But things went wrong--

           The PICK UP truck peels off the highway in front of a couple 
           of ramshackle buildings.

                                 EVAN
                         (anxious)
                        Why’re we stopping?

           Chloe and Danny stiffen. They don’t know either. Evan snatches 
           the gun from Chloe. Before Chloe can protest --

                                 EVAN
                        Stay down!

           Chloe isn’t sure what to do as Evan peers over the side of the 
           truck bed. Readying himself for the worst.

           But they’re pulled up in front of a gas pump. The DRIVER 
           begins pumping gas.

           Evan’s still tense...
           EXT. PICK UP TRUCK - STREETS OF ADDIS - AFTERNOON

           Weaving through traffic. Chloe, Danny, and Evan still lie in 
           the truck bed. Evan tries to appear calm for Danny’s sake. 

                                 DANNY
                        Now that you’re back, can we move 
                        back to Houston?

                                 EVAN
                         (smiles)
                        If your mother agrees to it.

                                 DANNY
                        I’ve asked her a million times. She 
                        only cares about her job. She can 
                        stay here and I'll go back with you.

           Evan glances at Chloe, who’s lying behind Danny. He can see 
           how hurt she is by what Danny’s saying.

                                 CHLOE
                        Danny, give me a moment to speak to 
                        your dad.

           But they’re crammed into the pick-up truck’s bed. 

                                 DANNY
                        ...Where am I supposed to go?

           Chloe climbs over between Evan and Danny. She whispers to 
           Evan. His face right up to hers. Lying next to each other like 
           lovers. 

                                 CHLOE
                        I told you I’m not leaving Addis. And 
                        certainly not with you. Please don’t 
                        turn him against me.

                                 EVAN
                        Seems like it’s a little late for 
                        that. 

                                 CHLOE
                        He blames me for leaving you, Evan. 

           It’s obviously painful for her. He swallows, surprised how 
           broken his family is. 

                                 CHLOE
                        I don't know how to win him back.

           Her lips brushing his ear as she whispers --
                                 CHLOE
                        I lost you, then I lost him.

           He swallows. He wants to apologize. Isn’t sure how.

                                 EVAN
                         (awkward)
                        I came back to try to these fix 
                        things.

                                 CHLOE
                        You’re too late.

           A chunk of her hair has fallen in front of her face. He 
           reaches out to tuck it back in her ear, but she rolls the 
           other way. Tucks the hair back herself.

           Evan turns to Danny.

                                 EVAN
                        I’m not taking you from your mom, D.

                                 DANNY
                        Why not? She took me away from you --

                                 EVAN
                        I left.

                                 DANNY
                        What?

                                 EVAN
                        I left, Danny. I left.

           It hits Danny like salt in a wound. Evan sees it. 

           Chloe looks at him. Stunned by the lie.

                                 EVAN 
                        I put your mom through hell.

                                 DANNY
                        But then you looked for us...

                                 EVAN
                        ...I was never looking for you. 

           Danny freezes. Turns pale. Devastated.

                                 EVAN
                        Don’t blame her for anything. 

           He reaches for Danny to hug him, but Danny pulls away. His 
           image of his father shattered.
           Brutal silence between them. 

           They feel the truck slowing. Chloe and Evan peer over the edge 
           of the truck bed. They’re approaching --

           THE U.S. EMBASSY COMPOUND

           Imposing marble edifice. Giant gates. Huge American flag 
           waving briskly in the breeze.

                                 EVAN
                        We’re safe, guys. We’re safe.

           He takes Chloe’s hand -- and for a moment she lets him. Caught 
           up in how elated he is.

           But Chloe stiffens as she sees between them and the embassy: 

           A perimeter of POLICE CHECKPOINTS. 

                                 CHLOE
                        I’ve never seen these checkpoints 
                        before..

           Cops are checking all cars and IDs. No way to bypass them. 

                                 CHLOE
                        Looks like they’re searching anyone 
                        going to the Embassy. 

                                 EVAN
                         (panicking)
                        They’ll arrest us before we can get 
                        inside.

           Among the checkpoints, he sees A WHITE JEEP. Like the ones 
           that pursued them earlier. Then he spots --

           NOVAK. The man with the white blond hair from the Saba camp. 

           Evan’s horrified. This was his whole plan. Now what?

                                 EVAN
                        Tell the driver to turn around!

           Chloe quietly says a few words to the driver, who tries to 
           make a U-Turn. But they’re stuck in the traffic. 

           Worse -- A PASSERBY spots them lying in the truck bed. 

                                 EVAN
                        Shit.
           The PASSERBY runs toward the nearest POLICE OFFICER, yelling.

                                 EVAN
                        Get out of the truck!

           The family leaps out. Sprint away down --

           A CONGESTED STREET

           Chloe YELLS in Amharic. We don’t know what she’s saying, but 
           the pedestrians make way for them to sprint through.

           Danny’s TERRIFIED. On the verge of tears.

           HALF A BLOCK BEHIND THEM: the COP fights his way through the 
           crowd. BEGGAR CHILDREN accost him, slowing him down.

           The COP FIRES into the air. The crowd panics and scatters.

           AHEAD: The family realize they’re running down a DEAD END. 
           They try to turn back -- too late --

           The COP is coming straight toward them. Gun raised.

           Evan pulls his gun from the stolen purse --

                                 CHLOE
                        DROP IT, EVAN! OR HE’LL SHOOT US NOW!

           Evan realizes she’s right. It’s hopeless. He drops the gun.

           Puts his hands up. Chloe follows suit. 

           The COP throws FLEXCUFFS around Evan. Danny, yelling in 
           Amharic, tries to stop him. Grabbing the Cop from the back. 
           The COP PISTOL WHIPS him in the face. Chloe SCREAMS. 

                                 EVAN
                        STOP! 

           An ETHIOPIAN POLICE CAR pulls up. COP #2 jumps out from behind 
           the wheel, gun drawn. They put flexcuffs on Chloe and Danny --

                                 EVAN
                        LET THEM GO! You don’t need them!

           Chloe never stops yelling in Amharic as the Police violently 
           shove them into the car. 

                                 EVAN
                        I have valuable information! Please -- 
                        just take us go to the Embassy! The 
                        American government will reward -- 
           The Cops root through Evan’s bundle, talking among themselves. 

                                 DANNY
                         (listening; translating)
                        They’re looking for something, Dad. 
                        They’re saying you stole something... 

           Evan blanches as they pull his LEAD BOX from the stolen purse.

                                 EVAN
                        Don’t touch that! We don’t know what 
                        it is --

           The First Cop removes a FLYER from his pocket. Identical to 
           the one Novak gave the Saba tribe, it reads “WANTED: STOLEN 
           MINING EQUIPMENT”. They see the locked box in their hands 
           matches the ones on the flyer. 

           The Cops share an excited look as Evan continues yelling --

                                                  SMASH CUT TO:

           EXT. “NEW COLONY” SLUM - MINUTES LATER

           The COP CAR speeds past lepers, donkeys, and shacks. It pulls 
           up to a DILAPIDATED BUILDING with pineapples painted on the 
           side and the words “TAFARA PRODUCE.”

           The Cops drag the family, now gagged, still in flexcuffs, into

           INT. TAFARA PRODUCE STORE - CONTINUOUS

           It’s dank. Lamp-lit. The air is thick with flies, sucking on 
           the overripe pineapples that fill the store. 

           The TAFARA TWINS (28), one a MAN, one a WOMAN with a shaved 
           head, sit behind an old cash register. Both are shitfaced. But 
           in a really creepy, numb kind of way.

           There’s instant trouble --

           Seeing the Cops, the Tafaras raise GUNS from behind the 
           counter. The Cops throw up their hands. Screaming at them.

           The Cops offer the Tafaras the LEAD BOX. The TAFARA SISTER 
           takes it. Opens it. She stares at it quietly.

           Evan tries to shout from behind his gag, but is too muffled.

           The Tafara Brother opens a door behind the register. Inside, a 
           staircase seems to lead down into total darkness. 
           As the Tafaras and Cops force the family down the stairs --

                                                     MATCH TO:

           Evan, in a pressure suit, descending the ladder onto 

           THE HELLAS PLANITIA CRATER ON MARS - FLASHBACK

           The two other astronauts, YURI GERSHKOVICH (late-40s, Russian) 
           and KEIJU SASAKI (early-50s), follow him onto the Martian 
           surface in their pressure suits. 

           A tiny, misshapen moon, Deimos, casts the scene in pale light. 
           The astronauts appear ghostly as they take their first buoyant 
           steps. Dancing as much as walking. A magic moment. 

           The first human shoe-prints in the red dust. 

           They look around in awe. 

                                 YURI
                        By eighteen, I was already 194 
                        centimeters. Too big to fit in the 
                        Soyuz. I went to the surgeon. He 
                        sawed through my shin. Cut two inches 
                        of bone out. Otherwise I would have 
                        had no hope of becoming an astronaut. 
                         (taking it in, looking 
                         around)
                        This was all I ever wanted. 

           From Evan’s face, we know it’s all he ever wanted too. 

                                                      BACK TO:

           DARKNESS. The Tafaras turn on a generator and lights flicker 
           on. Evan sees they’re in 

           A STRANGE BASEMENT LAB. Full of rusting equipment. 

           The Sister says a word to the Cops, who pull the family behind 
           piles of equipment and rotting fruit.

           The Tafaras don lead-lined smocks plus breathing masks. They 
           examine the LEAD BOX. See the strange, complicated lock on it. 
           They remove WELDING EQUIPMENT from their cabinets.

           Evan screams at them -- but is unintelligibly from behind his 
           gag. 

           He signals for his family to get down... Chloe and Danny 
           huddle with their heads down as Evan peers out --

           The Tafaras are WELDING OFF the lock from the box.
           They carefully open it. From it, they pour onto a sample plate 

           A strange DUST. It seems to absorb all light. 

           Touching the warm air, the DUST starts to move.

           The Tafaras gasp.

                                 TAFARA BROTHER
                        Yihe mindin new? 

           Evan’s face -- holy shit, is it alive? 

           The dust is melting as it touches the warm air. It now looks 
           like a LIQUID MIRROR. Highly reflective though it’s still 
           pitch black.

           The Tafaras quickly pour the element onto a spectrometer. They 
           set the dials. And the numbers on the device’s gauges RACE UP. 

           The oozing element SPARKS as it reacts to the air. Bubbling. 
           There’s loud POPPING noises -- as if it’s about to combust.

           Evan is screaming from behind the gag. The frightened Cops 
           yell at the Tafaras to put the material away -- but the 
           Tafaras eyes are glued on the spectrometer’s readings: its 
           dials are still RACING UP. 

           Even Chloe and Danny are staring with horror now as --

           The spectrometer itself begins rattling. Louder and louder --

                                 TAFARA SISTER
                        Temelket!

           Just when it seems like the whole place is about to explode -- 

           The Tafaras hurriedly pull the MELTED DUST out of the device. 
           They pour it into another LEAD SAMPLE BOX and seal it shut...

           The Tafaras can’t believe what they’ve just seen. 

           But Evan’s awe is turning to panic. The Sister approaches him 
           and pulls down his gag. Stunned, he blurts out.

                                 EVAN
                        What is it? 

           The Tafaras are taken aback by his question. They have the 
           British inflected-accents of African university graduates.

                                 TAFARA SISTER
                        You tell us.
                                 EVAN
                        What did your readings show?

                                 TAFARA BROTHER
                        That it’s denser than osmium, heavier 
                        than francium... and more radioactive 
                        than uranium... 
                         (this catches Evan totally 
                         off guard --)
                        Even though it’s unrefined. It could 
                        be the most dangerous thing on Earth.

                                 TAFARA SISTER
                        How did you make it?

           Evan is reeling. What the hell have I brought back?

                                 EVAN
                        Please -- just take us to the 
                        American Embassy. I can help you sell 
                        it to our government --

                                 TAFARA BROTHER
                        How’d you make the dust?

                                 EVAN
                        I didn’t. I found it.

                                 TAFARA SISTER
                        You’re lying.

                                 TAFARA BROTHER 
                         (hard and fast)
                        What is it?

           Evan gathers himself. 

                                 EVAN
                        It doesn’t have a name yet.

                                                       CUT TO:

           EXT. HELLAS PLANITIA - CAVE’S MOUTH

           Evan, Keiju, an Yuri descend in pressure suits into

           A VERTICAL CAVE SHAFT

           They collecting samples and carefully store them in lead 
           boxes. It’s frightening work. When Evan beams his powerful 
           light down, the cave appears bottomless. 

           As he climbs further down, he suddenly hits --
           SOLID GROUND. So pitch black that it looked like vacant space. 
           The white “shoes” of his pressure suit are now covered in the 
           black DUST.

           He pushes a button on his fishbowl’s touchscreen. It picks up 
           wavelengths that can’t be seen by the naked eye. 

           In his helmet’s display, the DUST now appears freckled with 
           green fluorescence.

                                 EVAN 
                         (amazed)
                        Yuri! What is this?

           Yuri struggles down to where Evan is. Sees the strange dust 
           below them that seems to absorb all light.

           Yuri scoops up a bit of the DUST and places it onto a tiny 
           scale. It measures the element’s mass and weight. 

           Because they’re suspended on ropes, only Yuri can see the 
           readings. He looks at them for a long moment. 

                                 EVAN 
                        What is it? Something new? 

                                 YURI
                        It’s nothing. Just concentrated ore. 
                        Still, Surkov might be interested. If 
                        you see more deposits of it, tell me.

           Evan’s disappointed. Yuri carefully pours the dust into a 
           sample box and labels it LANA TUBE #97.

                                                      BACK TO:

           INT. TAFARAS “PRODUCE STORE”

           The Tafaras squint skeptically at Evan, so he babbles -- 
           desperate to explain --

                                 EVAN
                        We brought it back here for a 
                        company. 

                                 TAFARA SISTER
                        And why would anyone go to Mars in 
                        secret?

                                 EVAN
                        In twenty, thirty years, Mars will be 
                        what Africa is today. The world’s 
                        minefield. 
                        I think the company that sent us 
                        wanted to know where to stake their 
                        claim when the gold rush starts... 
                         (nodding to the lead box)
                        The Americans will give you millions 
                        for that. More than you’d ever make 
                        selling it on the blackmarket. You’ll 
                        be heroes for saving us. And famous --

           His bravado builds. Really selling it --

                                 EVAN 
                        They’ll want it for energy. You could 
                        power a city with just what you’re 
                        holding in --

                                 TAFARA BROTHER
                         (cutting him off)
                        Or blow up a city.

           Evan’s stopped cold by this. The Brother, holding the box, 
           squats in front of Evan. Looks into his eyes. Measuring him. 

                                 TAFARA BROTHER
                        Where does the dust really come from?

                                 EVAN
                        I’m telling you the truth --

           But the Tafaras still think he’s lying. The Sister suddenly 
           yanks down Danny’s gag and says to him.

                                 TAFARA SISTER
                        Maybe your father needs to hear you 
                        scream.

           She picks up a KNIFE and grabs DANNY by the collar. 

                                 DANNY
                        Dad! HELP! 

           A change in EVAN as his eyes meet Danny’s. A moment of truth. 

                                 EVAN
                        Stop! There’s more dust! I can give 
                        you more! 

           The Tafaras freeze. 

                                 EVAN
                        It’s in the desert. I’ll take you if 
                        you let my family go. Right now.
                                 TAFARA BROTHER
                        You give us more of the dust, then we 
                        take you to the Embassy. 

                                 EVAN
                         (emphatic; explodes)
                        No! You take my wife and son there 
                        now.

                                 TAFARA BROTHER
                        Show us where the minerals are, or...

           He nods to Danny. Evan registers the threat.

                                 TAFARA BROTHER 
                        We are reasonable people. After we go 
                        to desert, we sell you and the 
                        minerals to the Americans. Everyone 
                        wins. OK?

           He motions to the stolen purse, which the Cops are still 
           holding. Finally, Evan nods.

           Off his nod, the Sister pulls a gun and SHOOTS BOTH COPS. 
           Danny SCREAMS. The Brother picks up Evan’s stolen purse.

                                 TAFARA BROTHER
                        OK? We go now.

           As the dying Cops bleed out --

                                                       CUT TO:

           YURI. Covered in blood. Delusional. His back arching in agony. 
           Screaming. It’s horrific. He’s inside 

           THE SPACE SHUTTLE 

           Mars is still large out the window as the shuttle floats back 
           toward earth. Evan and Keiju inject morphine into YURI. 

                                 EVAN
                         (quietly, to Keiju)
                        What do you think it is? An allergic 
                        reaction? Maybe we were exposed to 
                        something down there...

           Yuri vomits. Gooey strings of bile -- red with blood -- wind 
           through the air like a spider web. 

           Evan sucks it up from the air with a vacuum. 
                                 KEIJU
                        We need to talk to a doctor. We need 
                        to make contact with home. 

                                 EVAN
                         (shaking his head)
                        The laser communication system only 
                        works if Surkov activates it from the 
                        ground. He won’t do that until 
                        landing procedures are underway. 

           Yuri is in so much pain that his voice is barely audible.

                                 YURI 
                        He said I would be the one who lived.

                                 EVAN
                         (not sure he heard right)
                        What?

           But Yuri’s eyes are freezing in place. Out from the morphine.

                                 EVAN
                        Shit! Keiju, how do we revive him?

           But Keiju has a hand on Yuri’s pulse. It’s too late.

                                                       CUT TO:

           I/E. TAFARA’S VAN - ETHIOPIAN DESERT - NIGHT

           Speeding through the night. The exterior reads “TAFARAS!” It 
           has badly-painted pineapples all over it plus a portrait of a 
           Tafara twin on each door. 

           Evan, Danny, and Chloe are in back. They’re still flexcuffed.

           The Sister, sitting shotgun, shows Evan a map on her phone. 
           Evan glances out the window, partly navigating by starlight.

                                 EVAN
                        Keep heading north.

                                 TAFARA BROTHER
                        How much more dust is out here?

                                 EVAN
                        At least three kilograms. I can help 
                        you sell to Americans.

                                 TAFARA BROTHER
                         (shaking his head)
                        We know how Americans work. 
                                 TAFARA SISTER
                        Leave Africans with nothing. 

                                 EVAN
                         (trying to sound 
                         confident)
                        No. The Americans want to beat the 
                        Russians to Mars. They’ll pay 
                        anything to do it. 

           The Tafaras confer in Amharic. Their voices increasingly 
           excited. They seem to believe him.

                                 CHLOE
                         (quietly)
                        We can’t trust them. We need a plan. 

                                 EVAN
                        Getting them to cooperate is the 
                        plan.

           But Chloe eyes the KNIFE strapped to the Sister’s belt. She 
           quietly reaches toward it. Closer and closer...

                                 EVAN
                         (whispering)
                        No... don’t...

           Chloe SPRINGS forward. The Sister whips around.

                                 TAFARA SISTER
                        Aydelem!

           She pulls the knife before Chloe can get to it. GOES FOR 
           CHLOE’S FACE. Chloe throws up her hands. The Sister slashes 
           her FOREARM and HAND. Blood spurts out. Chloe SCREAMS. 

                                 EVAN
                        CHLOE!

           Danny, enraged, throws himself toward the Tafaras.

                                 DANNY
                        You fucking --

           Danny BITES the Brother’s arm. The Brother shrieks. Slams the 
           brakes. Throws Danny in a chokehold.

           Meantime the Sister pulls out a PIECE OF FOIL full of a WHITE 
           POWDER from the glove compartment. 

                                 EVAN
                        Don’t touch my son! PLEASE!
           There’s chaos in the car as Evan tries to pull Danny away.

           The Sister holds a flame under the foil, producing smoke... 
           then abruptly COVERS DANNY’S MOUTH with her hand. Holding the 
           smoke under his nose. Danny struggles... but inhales.

                                 EVAN
                        NO! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

           Evan swings -- two-hands -- still cuffed -- at the smoking 
           foil. Instead the Sister thrusts the foil into Evan’s face. 

                                 CHLOE
                        DANNY!

           Chloe looks into Danny’s vacant pupils as he passes out. Then 
           she realizes Evan’s inhaled some too. His eyes glazing over.

                                 CHLOE
                        EVAN? EVAN!

           He’s too drugged to process the worry in her face. That she 
           really cares about him.

           She checks her wound. Sees the knife made a tear in the 
           plastic flexcuffs around her wrists. Not all the way. But it’s 
           a start. 

           As the Tafaras free-base in the front, Chloe furtively rubs 
           the cuffs against the door. Hoping to tear them further...

           MEANTIME -- Evan’s eyes fall shut.

                                                  CUT TO BLACK:

                                 KEIJU (O.S.)
                         (weakly)
                        Evan? Help me...

           INT. SPACE SHUTTLE - A FEW DAYS LATER

           Evan awakens in his sleep sack, which is tethered to the wall 
           like a chrysalis. He gasps when he sees Keiju vomiting red 
           globules of BLOOD, which fill the air. 

                                 KEIJU
                        Same thing Yuri had... 

           Evan springs into action. Scrambles out of his sack. Flies to 
           Keiju, who can barely speak. The pain unbearable.

                                 KEIJU
                        What did Yuri mean -- “I thought you 
                        would be the ones to die”?
           He puts a hand on Evan’s arm. Even this slight movement knocks 
           off one of Keiju’s fingernails. It floats into the air. Pearly 
           and delicate, like a seashell. Evan gapes at it.

                                 KEIJU
                        What if... he’s killing us?

           Evan tears the medical kit from the wall. Fumbles through it 
           as they talk --

                                 EVAN
                        Who?

                                 KEIJU 
                        Getting an astronaut home costs 
                        millions. Surkov saved a fortune by 
                        getting rid of us.

                                 EVAN 
                        Surkov wouldn’t kill us. Bad PR.

           Keiju is having trouble getting the breath to speak.

                                 KEIJU
                        He’s decades ahead of his 
                        competition. And he can stay that way 
                        -- if he keeps it all secret. 

           A chill runs through Evan as he pieces it together.

                                 EVAN
                        Yuri tested all the samples. We don’t 
                        even know for sure what we really 
                        brought back with us... 

           Keiju coughs more blood.

                                 KEIJU
                        Maybe he’ll keep you alive to 
                        navigate back. But then you’ll have 
                        served your purpose. 

           Evan stares. Could this be true? Keiju wheezes.

                                 KEIJU
                        You must get back. The world has to 
                        know. 

           He struggles to search through the medical kit.

                                 KEIJU
                        We used all our opiates on Yuri. 
                         (loaded)
                        I don’t want to suffer like he did. 
           Keiju finds a SCALPEL in the medical kit. Their eyes meet and 
           Evan realizes what Keiju is asking. 

                                 KEIJU
                        Cut the carotid artery. That’ll be 
                        fastest.

           Evan is sickened by the idea. He turns away from him. 

                                 EVAN
                        Maybe we’re going nuts from 
                        isolation. Maybe you’re sick from 
                        natural causes...

           He kicks off the wall and floats further down the main galley. 

                                 KEIJU
                         (faint, desperate)
                        Evan, help me --

           Evan opens a cupboard containing their RATION PACKS, which are 
           labelled with their NAMES and the date they are to be eaten. 
           He tears open KEIJU’S next ration packs. Food flies into the 
           air. Then he tears open the pack for three days later...

           It’s EMPTY. He tears open Keiju’s next one. It’s EMPTY too.

           There are hundreds more ration packs for Keiju. But they’re 
           just props to hide the truth. Surkov knew the other astronauts 
           would die.

                                 EVAN
                        Oh my God.

           A HORRIFIC SOUND.

           Evan whips around and sees -- 

           Blood exploding into the air from Keiju’s neck. He slit his 
           own throat. But he missed the main artery. He moans in agony.

           Evan kicks off the wall to rush back toward Keiju. 

           He grabs the scalpel. Digs it into Keiju's carotid artery. 
           Finishing the job as fast as he can. He closes his eyes until 
           Keiju goes limp. 

           Evan finally opens his eyes. And can't believe what he's done.

                                                       CUT TO:

           DAWN. Undulating sand horizon to horizon. It looks like Mars. 
           As the Tafara truck crosses it, we realize it’s
           THE VAST ETHIOPIAN DESERT - HOURS LATER

           The Tafaras pull up under the MESA. The family gets out. Evan 
           recognizes the parched honeycomb of the mud flat below.

                                 EVAN
                        It’s just over this hill.

           He strides off with unexpected energy. Adrenalized by the 
           chance to prove himself to the Tafaras and his family.

           Everyone’s hurrying to follow him. The Tafaras take their 
           phones out and begin FILMING, excitedly talking amongst 
           themselves.

           Finally, they reach the crest... and look out.

           REVEAL: THERE IS NO CAPSULE.

           No tracks. Nothing. Evan’s stunned. His eyes everywhere.

                                 TAFARA SISTER
                        Where is it?

           An awful silence. 

                                 CHLOE
                         (anxious)
                        What’s going on, Evan? Where is it?

                                 EVAN
                        I buried it right here... There was a 
                        mound...

           He starts swiping away sand with his cuffed hands. He looks 
           like a madman.

                                 CHLOE
                        Oh my god. There’s nothing here. 
                        We’re alone in the desert with these 
                        crazy people and there’s nothing!

           The TAFARAS talk angrily amongst themselves as Danny stares at 
           Evan. As if seeing Evan for the first time. No faith left. 

                                 DANNY
                        Did you know there was no capsule 
                        this whole time?

           The Brother is raising his gun toward Evan -- eyes gone dead -- 
                                 EVAN
                        WAIT! This must be the wrong place -- 
                        I was disoriented -- it must be 
                        farther down!

           He rushes down the steep hill. Looking for any sign of it. 

           The Brother chases Evan, YELLING in Amharic. Meantime --

           The Sister pulls her gun on Chloe and Danny. Danny’s starting 
           to cry -- hands over his face -- bracing for the bullet he 
           knows is coming. Chloe steps between Danny and the gun --

                                 CHLOE
                        EVAN! Stop! They’re telling you to 
                        stop or they’ll shoot!

           But Evan races desperately down the hill.

                                 EVAN
                         (anguished, freaking out)
                        I swear it’s here! I’m telling the 
                        truth!

           Suddenly --

           A GUNSHOT rings out from where Evan left Chloe and Danny with 
           the Sister. Followed by SCREAMING and YELLING.

           Evan, horrified, turns.

                       EVAN
                                             TAFARA BROTHER
           Chloe!?
                                       Wend-em?!

           Evan starts running back up the slope as the Brother raises 
           his automatic toward Evan --

           In that split second, Evan doesn’t know what to do -- has to 
           do something --

           He lunges at the Brother. The Brother fires --

           BANG! 

           The bullet hits the sand as Evan knocks him to the ground.

           They roll down the hill. Coming to a stop against a BOULDER. 

           CRACK! The Brother hits his head. Evan hits his KNEE. Hard.  

           With the Brother momentarily dazed, Evan throws himself on top 
           of him. Suffocating him face-down in the sand. The Brother 
           flails like a fish out of water. Until he finally goes still. 
           Evan -- panting -- barely able to believe what just happened --

                                 EVAN
                        CHLOE?!

           He manages to pick it up the Tafara Brother’s gun with his 
           cuffed hands. His knee is bleeding. It’s excruciating to walk. 
           He forces himself up the steep slope. 

                                 EVAN
                        CHLOE! DANNY!

           As he crests the hill, he takes in:

           The Tafara Sister is dead on the ground. A bullet to the head. 

           Meantime CHLOE is in the TAFARA’S VAN. Danny sits beside her. 
           Evan rushes toward them, overwhelmed with relief --

                                 EVAN
                        I thought...

           Danny looks back at Evan through the open window.

                                 DANNY
                        Hurry! He’s coming! Go! Go!

           Chloe FLOORS it. The Van careens down the hill.

                                 EVAN
                         (shocked)
                        CHLOE!

           Evan tries to run after them but his knee buckles. He falls.  
           Watches, stunned and horrified, as they abandon him. 

           The Van becomes a dust cloud in the distance. 

           He struggles to get up.  Look a wreck. Covered in dirt. Blood. 
           His clothes ripped to shreds.   

           Then suddenly, in the distance -- the HYENA -- the same hyena 
           who stalked Evan when he landed -- darts in front of the VAN.

           Evan gasps as he watches the van SWERVE. The vehicle TIPS 
           SIDEWAYS as it slides down 

           A SHALLOW DRY CREEK BED.

           CRASH!

                                 EVAN
                        NO!
           He stumbles after them, clutching his knee.

           MOMENTS LATER

           Evan catches up to the tipped-over van. He sees Chloe, sitting 
           on the ground behind it. She holds Danny in her arms. He’s not 
           moving. Is he dead?

           Evan’s face -- panic.

           He moves forward. Realizes -- Danny isn’t seriously injured at 
           all. Just totally overwhelmed. Terrified. He lets his mother 
           hold him as he breaks down, sobbing.

           Seeing Evan, Chloe shields Danny and raises the Tafara 
           Sister’s gun. Danny peeks out from behind her.

                                 CHLOE
                        Stay back!

           Evan drops the Tafara Brother’s gun. 

                                 EVAN
                        OK... OK. Let’s just get out of here. 
                        Have you tried the Tafara’s phone? 
                        Maybe we can call for help.

           Beat. Chloe and Danny seem to be deciding whether to cooperate 
           with him. 

                                 DANNY
                        We tried. It doesn’t get reception 
                        out here.

           Evan goes to the car. He finds his LEAD BOX that had been 
           sitting on the dash. He checks that it’s properly shut, then 
           tucks it in his pocket. Chloe watches.

                                 CHLOE
                        Why would you bring something so 
                        dangerous around our son?

                                 EVAN
                        If I’d known what it was, I wouldn’t 
                        have brought it here. 
                         (then)
                        There’s a tribe to the south. I can 
                        guide us to their camp. 

                                 CHLOE
                         (fighting back tears)
                        How are we supposed to believe you?
                                 EVAN
                        You don’t understand. Surkov must’ve 
                        gotten the capsule -- 

                                 DANNY
                        Stop it! STOP SAYING THAT. You’re 
                        fucking crazy, OK? I should have 
                        listened to mom... 
                         (eyes wet)
                        I wish you hadn’t come back.

           Evan swallows this hard. When he finally speaks, he keeps his 
           eyes on the horizon. 

                                 EVAN
                        Maybe I’m crazy. I don’t know... But 
                        I know I’ve been stuck in this desert 
                        before. I know there’s no water here. 
                        And it’ll be 120 degrees soon. And if 
                        we don’t move, we’ll die.

           Danny looks at Chloe. Unsure what they should do. 

                                 CHLOE
                         (to Danny)
                        Walk on the other side of me. Stay as 
                        far from him as you can.

           Evan starts limping toward the south. Chloe and Danny trudge 
           behind him. Eyeing him with suspicion. 

                                 EVAN
                        Well, at least you two are getting 
                        along. 

                                                       CUT TO:

           INT. SPACESHIP 

           It’s months after Keiju and Yuri died: Evan has stopped taking 
           care of himself. His fingernails are so long they’re curling.

           His long-johns are filthy from months without washing. He 
           notices mold growing on the fabric under his armpits.

           Disgusted, he uses a baby wipe to try to clean them. Loses 
           patience. He tears his clothes off --

           Flies naked through the spaceship.

           Mad with boredom, he absently folds every piece of paper on 
           board into origami cranes. The birds swirl through the air 
           around him.
           He folds up equipment manuals, food packaging, photos Keiju 
           brought with him, Yuri’s photos, then he comes across

           The photo of CHLOE (33) and DANNY (8) hugging him in front of 
           the Christmas tree. Buried deep in his Personal Cubby. He 
           stares at it.

           Then he folds the photo into an origami crane.

                                                  SMASH CUT TO:

           EXT. DESERT - BLISTERINGLY HOT - LATER

           Bleak horizon under a glazed sky, red desert scarred by the 
           occasional butte and hill. Evan crosses the desert as before, 
           but this time with his family beside him.

           Evan lags behind Chloe and Danny with his wounded leg. Every 
           step is a battle.

           He looks at them with remorse. Chloe’s suit is now torn, 
           dirty, blood-stained. Danny’s school uniform is ripped. 
           They’re utterly transformed from when he first saw them.

           But the greatest transformation is that she and Danny are now 
           walking close together. Chloe protecting Danny. Danny wanting 
           to be protected.

                                 CHLOE
                        If we get through this... Let’s go 
                        back to Houston.

           Evan turns -- thinking she’s talking to her. But she’s 
           addressing Danny.

           Danny looks at her. Surprised. 

           She takes his hand and they stumble onward.

           As they crest a dune, Evan sees --

           An astronaut in a white pressure suit walking across a far 
           sand dune. 

           He says nothing. Keeps walking. Telling himself it’s a 
           hallucination.

           But Chloe and Danny stop short.

                                 CHLOE
                        Oh my God.

           They see
           THE CAPSULE DRAGGED BY DOZENS OF MASSIVE CATTLE. 

           SABA WARRIORS, armed with machine guns, guide the cattle team. 

           The world’s most advanced spacecraft slides slowly across the 
           sand. The ropes that connected it to its parachute are now 
           connecting it to the Ankole cattle. 

           A couple tribesmen follow behind, sweeping up the tracks 
           they’re leaving with palm fronds. 

           One tribesman is WEARING THE PRESSURE SUIT.

           Danny and Chloe stare at the scene in stunned silence. 

                                 DANNY
                        It’s real...

           Only now does Evan let himself believe what he’s seeing. He’s 
           overwhelmed with relief. 

           Chloe starts to sob. Grabs Evan. Holds him.

           After a moment, Evan’s head clears. And he becomes aware of 
           her embrace. Something he hasn’t felt in a long time. He hugs 
           her back tighter.

                                 CHLOE
                        I’m sorry. I’m sorry...

                                 EVAN
                        It’s OK. We’re going to be OK now...

                                 CHLOE
                         (still holding him, 
                         distraught)
                        They told me to stay with you. 

                                 EVAN
                        Who?

                                 CHLOE
                        They said we should do whatever you 
                        told us to. Just to stay with you and 
                        they would find us.

           This sinks in. Evan pulls away. Looks at her.

                                 EVAN
                        Who?

           Chloe looks like death.

           Danny too. 
                                 DANNY
                        We called them from the car.

           From the stolen purse, he pulls out the Tafaras’ PHONE and the 
           folded-up WANTED AD that Evan got from the Saba women.

           For a moment Evan can’t process the betrayal. Then he snatches 
           the phone from Danny and breaks it in half.

                                 DANNY
                         (tearing up)
                        It’s too late. They said they started 
                        tracking it as soon as we called.

           Evan staggers away for a moment. Enraged. Helpless.

           He turns toward the capsule.

                                 EVAN
                        We have to hurry. Come on!

           He bolts toward it. Chloe and Danny rush after him.

           Meantime -- the Saba see the figures approaching and raise 
           their weapons. Evan waves his arms, yelling --

                                 EVAN
                        IT’S ME! IT’S ME!

           The Saba slowly lower their guns. Chloe and Danny gape as they 
           get closer -- shocked by the capsule, the tribesmen, their 
           enormous cattle... The whole surreal scene.

           Through the fishbowl helmet, Evan sees it’s the YOUNGEST of 
           the THREE HEAD WOMEN in the pressure suit. She has a 
           Kalashnikov slung over her back.

                                 EVAN
                        What are you doing?

                                 YOUNGEST
                        Sell.

           She holds out the “WANTED: STOLEN MINING EQUIPMENT” flyer that 
           Novak gave her back in the Saba camp. 

           He peers inside the capsule -- Yuri and Keiju’s two pressure 
           suits lie empty on the floor.

                                 EVAN 
                        What happened to bodies? The two men--

                                 DANNY
                        DAD!
           Danny points at SUVs in the distance. Rapidly approaching.

           Evan turns to the Youngest and the tribesmen.

                                 EVAN
                        Those men will kill you all. Unless 
                        you listen to me -- 

           Chloe, panicking, grabs his hand.

                                 CHLOE
                        Evan -- we should run.

                                 EVAN
                        I have a plan. We’re going to live. 
                        Trust me.

           She stares at the Jeeps moving toward them, and grips his hand 
           harder.

                                                       CUT TO:

           MOMENTS LATER

           FIVE WHITE SUVS approach the CAPSULE. The family is nowhere in 
           sight.

           Doors POP open. Novak and Mercenaries emerge with weapons 
           drawn.

           SURKOV excitedly slides out like it's Christmas morning. He’s 
           dressed in white as if he’s summering in Sochi. 

           He flashes a mega-watt smile as he takes in the capsule. 

           In the distance, he sees TRIBE FLEEING with their cattle. 
           They’ve seemingly abandoned the capsule. Until --

           The WHITE GLOVE of a space suit is waved in the capsule 
           doorway. The Youngest peers out, still in her pressure suit. A 
           Kalashnikov in her other hand.

                                 YOUNGEST
                        Agree deal.

                                 SURKOV
                        What do you want?

                                 YOUNGEST
                        I give you boat. You give me money.

                                 SURKOV
                         (grins)
                        How much you want for the “boat”?
                                 YOUNGEST
                        Four million. 

                                 SURKOV
                        Excuse me?

                                 YOUNGEST
                        Four million dollar. Buy Saba land 
                        from cops.

           Beat.

                                 SURKOV
                        First I need to make sure you didn’t 
                        steal anything from in there.

                                 YOUNGEST
                        You come now.

                                 NOVAK
                         (to Surkov, American 
                         accent)
                        Don’t go in there. She’ll kill you.

                                 SURKOV
                        No she won’t. She probably thinks I’m 
                        some sort of god.

           Surkov slowly starts crossing the sand. Still smiling.

           He steps inside the dim windowless capsule. Gasps as he sees 

           EVAN, CHLOE, and DANNY inside, hiding against the wall. Evan 
           has a Kalashnikov aimed at him. 

                                 EVAN
                        Don’t call for help. Take one more 
                        step so they can’t see you.

                                 NOVAK
                         (alarmed)
                        Surkov! Gimme your status!

           Evan keeps the gun on Surkov as Chloe ties him up. Surkov 
           looks sadly at her and Danny.

                                 SURKOV
                        Why’d you drag your family into this? 

                                 EVAN
                        Tell them you’re checking the 
                        samples.
                                 SURKOV
                         (quietly)
                        You wanted to show them what you did, 
                        didn't you? You cared more about them 
                        knowing than about them.

           Evan looks at Chloe and Danny. Wishes he hadn’t.

                                 SURKOV
                         (shouting to Novak)
                        I’m just making sure everything is 
                        here!
                         (then, to Evan)
                        Why didn’t you let me help you 
                        sooner? I wanted to protect you. 

                                 EVAN
                        Don’t lie to me. I know you killed 
                        Yuri and Keiju.

                                 SURKOV
                        Big picture. We had to protect the 
                        secret. The funders wouldn’t let me 
                        go public. 

                                 EVAN
                        ...What funders? 

           Surkov is surprised Evan hasn’t guessed.

                                 SURKOV
                        You don’t know? They said it was your 
                        idea. 
                         (Evan is just staring--)
                        When your Congress voted against the 
                        mission, you said you wanted to go 
                        around them. That’s why you were 
                        chosen.

           Evan lowers the gun -- head swimming --

                                 EVAN
                        ...The D.O.D. was involved in this?

                                 SURKOV
                        I’m just the handsome face of it all.

           It hits Evan like a body blow. He turns to Chloe and Danny. 
           Too stunned to hide the fact he has no fucking idea who they 
           can turn to now. 
                                 SURKOV
                        The only reason they haven’t gotten 
                        you so far is I convinced them to let 
                        me find you. Outside are my men. But 
                        the D.O.D. will be here any minute. 
                        With soldiers. Helicopters. An army. 
                        Give yourself up now -- and my men 
                        can try to hide you. 

                                 EVAN
                        What about my family?

                                 SURKOV
                        You’ll have to leave them. 
                         (as Evan reacts --)
                        As long as you’re with them, they’re 
                        targets. They’ll be safer without 
                        you... Like they were yesterday.

           That hits him. He looks at his wife and son. Considering it.

                                 CHLOE
                        Evan, no! He’s trying to trick you!

                                 EVAN
                         (to Surkov)
                        If I let you go... how do I know you 
                        won’t kill them? Why should I trust 
                        you?

                                 SURKOV
                        You don’t have a choice. For you, 
                        this is the only way out.

                                 EVAN
                         (turns on him, furious)
                        I’m asking about them. Not me.

           Surkov looks at him. Like this is an act he can see through.

                                 SURKOV
                        Most people wouldn’t have survived 
                        alone up there. You did. 
                         (warming to this)
                        I chose you because you’re selfish. 
                        And selfish people make the best 
                        survivors. 
                         (then)
                        Let me go. I’m the only one who can 
                        save you.

           Evan studies Surkov. 

           Then looks at his family. 
           Forging something within. 

           He presses the Kalashnikov against Surkov’s chest.

                                 EVAN
                         (resolved)
                        Tell your men to drive up one of the 
                        Jeeps. Leave it outside.

                                 SURKOV
                         (thrown, hesitates)
                        What are you going to do?

           Evan drives the gun harder into Surkov’s ribs. He’s so ready 
           to kill him. Surkov shouts --

                                 SURKOV
                        NOVAK! Leave a Jeep outside the door. 
                        Then retreat!

           The Youngest, still guarding the hatch, watches the 
           Mercenaries exchange looks in the distance. Finally Novak gets 
           in one of the Jeeps. 

           Evan turns to Chloe and Danny.

                                 EVAN 
                        You’re gonna go with her. 
                         (he nods to the Youngest)
                        She’ll help you get to Addis.

                                 DANNY
                        What are you gonna do?

                                 EVAN
                        I need to get rid of this. 
                         (he pulls the lead box out 
                         of his pocket)
                        All of it. I should never have 
                        brought it back.

                                 SURKOV
                         (realizing his plan)
                        No. No -- Evan -- you can’t blow up 
                        the capsule or you’re throwing away 
                        everything you --

           Evan throws a rope around Surkov’s mouth. Gagging him. Surkov 
           struggles. He tries to scream for help, but it’s too late.

           MEANTIME -- Novak pulls the Jeep up to the capsule.

           He has a gun in one hand. Keeping it below what the Youngest 
           can see through the window.
           But she has him in her Kalashnikov sights.

                                 YOUNGEST
                        Stay far or we kill him.

           Beat. Novak debates what to do. Slowly, tensely, he gets out 
           of the car. Retreats back toward the other Mercenaries.

           INSIDE THE CAPSULE: 

           Evan’s ripping panels from the walls. 

                                 DANNY
                        Dad, wait! If you blow up the 
                        samples, how will anyone know what 
                        you did? 

                                 EVAN
                        You know. That’s enough.

           Evan’s assembling WIRES from the wall into a makeshift 
           explosive. Attaching them to the battery and fuel tank.

                                 DANNY
                        Everyone needs to know! You did 
                        something important.

           Evan shakes his head. Danny looks at Evan like he’s lost his 
           mind.

                                 DANNY
                        But what you’ve done changes 
                        everything. Dad -- big picture!

                                 EVAN
                        You’re the big picture. Get in the 
                        car. I’ll wait until you’re far 
                        enough. The mineral’s unrefined -- 
                        the blast shouldn’t go more than a 
                        mile. 

           He nods to the two empty PRESSURE SUITS on the capsule floor.

                                 EVAN
                        Put those on. That’ll protect you 
                        from any radiation.

                                 DANNY
                        Wait, we’re going without you? How 
                        will you get out? 

           Evan’s eyes meet Chloe’s. Finally she understands his plan. 
                                 EVAN
                        No one else can pay for what I’ve 
                        done.

                                 DANNY
                        What are you saying?

           Beat. 

                                 EVAN
                        You’re gonna leave me this time. 

           Chloe is fighting back tears. 

                                 DANNY
                         (aghast)
                        What?

                                 EVAN
                        This is the only way I can be sure 
                        you’ll be safe...

                                 DANNY
                         (empathic)
                        No, no -- you have to come with us!

           He grabs Evan. Evan sweeps his son into his arms. Both wishing 
           this moment could last forever.

                                 EVAN
                        If I come with you, they’ll just hunt 
                        us down.

           Finally Evan forces himself to push Danny away.

                                 CHLOE
                        Is this really happening? 

                                 EVAN
                        I should never be the one to answer 
                        that.

           She tries to smile. Can’t. She reaches out to him. Puts a hand 
           on his cheek. 

           He leans in close. His lips touching her ear -- words pouring 
           out -- no time for thought --

                                 EVAN
                        I know I don’t deserve to ask for 
                        promises, but don’t make the mistake 
                        I made... Be there for him.
           He reaches out and tucks the hair in her eyes back behind her 
           ear. This time, she lets him. 

                                 CHLOE
                         (the tears finally coming)
                        We just got you back. Today.

                                 EVAN
                        Best day of my life.

           She’s struggling to keep it together.

                                 EVAN 
                        You got by without me before.

                                 CHLOE
                        That was easy. I was mad at you. 
                        This... I can’t do this...

           Surkov is desperately trying to scream through the gag. Evan 
           takes Surkov’s phone from his pocket. Holds it out to Danny.

                                 EVAN
                        D, I need you to help me do something 
                        that will keep you and your mother 
                        safe.

                                                       CUT TO:

           MOMENTS LATER

           Evan shoves a TIED-UP SURKOV into the capsule’s doorway, so 
           the Mercenaries can see him bound and gagged.

                                 EVAN
                         (shouting)
                        You’re gonna let my wife and son 
                        drive away. Then I’ll release Surkov 
                        and you can take me prisoner. 
                         (then)
                        If one of you fires at my family, I’m 
                        gonna kill him.

           INSIDE THE CAPSULE: Evan’s makeshift bomb is spread across the 
           floor. 

           Evan turns to Chloe, Danny, and the Youngest. All three are in 
           pressure suits.

           The moment. The big deep breath.

                                 EVAN
                        Go! Go now!
           But Chloe and Danny don’t move. Tears stream down their faces 
           inside their helmets.

                                 DANNY
                         (raw)
                        Dad, you're giving up.

           Evan shakes his head.

                                 EVAN
                        Maybe I’m about to do is the only 
                        really good thing I’ve ever done. 

           Even Surkov, helpless behind his gag, can feel their anguish 
           as he watches them.

           Danny grabs Evan and tries to yank him out the door with them. 

                                 DANNY
                        COME WITH US!

           Chloe pulls Danny away. She looks at Evan -- grateful. Scared. 
           And desperately in love with him.

           Evan’s fighting back emotions. Can barely get the word out.

                                 EVAN
                        Go!

           The Youngest shoves Chloe and Danny out. 

           They SPRINT TOWARD THE IDLING CAR in their space suits. The 
           Youngest cradles her Kalashnikov in her gloves. Their fishbowl 
           helmets gleam in the sun. 

           For a split second -- with the red desert behind them -- it 
           looks like they’re on Mars.

           They leap into the car. Chloe FLOORS IT. The Jeep roars off.

                                 EVAN
                        LET THEM GO!

           Through the capsule door, the Mercenaries can see the 
           Kalashnikov pressed against Surkov’s head.

           Surkov is distraught. Hyperventilating behind his gag as he 
           takes in the make-shift bomb that’s about to destroy 
           everything he’s worked for.

           Evan zips the cell phone back into Surkov’s pocket.
                                 EVAN
                        Make sure that gets into the right 
                        hands.

           NOVAK, armed with an automatic, approaches the capsule. 

                                 NOVAK
                        Lange! Come out with your hands up!

           Evan looks out -- Chloe and Danny’s Jeep is already just a 
           tiny dust-cloud in the distance.

           Evan’s face -- they’ve gotten away! In spite of what’s about 
           to happen to himself -- he’s elated.

                                 EVAN
                         (shouting at Novak and the 
                         Mercs)
                        The capsule’s about to explode. Get 
                        back! ALL OF YOU! GET AWAY!

           Novak stops. Unsure if Evan’s bluffing. So Evan pulls the gag 
           from Surkov’s mouth.

                                 SURKOV
                         (screaming to Novak)
                        HE’S GOING TO BLOW IT UP! STOP HIM!

                                 EVAN
                        THE BLAST WILL BE RADIOACTIVE! IF YOU 
                        WANT TO LIVE, DRIVE AWAY! 

           Momentary confusion on the Mercenaries’ faces. 

           Either way -- they're hearing it's going to blow. 

           Novak SPRINTS BACK toward the other Mercenaries. Abandoning 
           Surkov and the capsule.

                                 NOVAK
                        Retreat! PULL OUT! PULL OUT!

           The Mercenaries dash into their cars. 

                                 SURKOV
                        STOP! STOP!

           As the Mercenaries drive AWAY, Evan yanks the binding off 
           Surkov’s legs and kicks him onto the ground outside. 

                                 EVAN
                        Run. Or you’ll go to a place only God 
                        has seen.
           Evan slams the hatch shut again.

           LOCKS HIMSELF IN.

           Surkov -- beyond desperate to stop him -- claws at the capsule 
           hatch with his still-bound hands. But it’s impossible.

                                 SURKOV
                        EVAN! STOP! This is madness!

           INSIDE THE CAPSULE:

           Evan hurriedly opens the sample boxes, dumping box after box 
           of the Martian element onto the capsule floor.

           FLASH TO: Evan submerged in a swimming pool in Houston. He can 
           see DANNY (7) above him, sitting in an innertube. Danny’s 
           voice is muffled by the water as he counts out the seconds 
           that Evan holds his breath.

                                 DANNY
                        10 more seconds and you’ll break your 
                        record! 10 -- 9 --

           INTERCUT Evan finishing the bomb with Evan crash-landing in 
           the desert.

                                 DANNY (O.S.)
                        8 -- 7 -- 

           INTERCUT Evan lighting the fuse with the Saba forcing Evan to 
           his knees next to their bonfire. 

                                 DANNY (O.S.)
                        6 -- 5 -- 

           BACK IN THE CAPSULE

           INTERCUT Surkov running for his life away from the capsule 
           with Evan, Chloe, and Danny running from the police in Addis.

                                 DANNY (O.S.)
                        4 -- 3-- 

           INTERCUT The bomb’s fuse catching with Chloe taking Danny’s 
           hand as they cross the desert.

                                 DANNY (O.S.)
                        2 -- 1 --

           INTERCUT Evan preparing to die -- accepting it -- with Evan 
           tucking Chloe’s hair behind her ear in the capsule. The final 
           goodbye.
           A BURST OF UNBELIEVABLY BRIGHT LIGHT.

           As the capsule IMPLODES.

           Surkov -- running -- is knocked to the ground as the implosion 
           sucks everything toward it. 

           He gapes at a WALL OF SAND -- 30 feet high -- approaching.

           The DUST CLOUD momentarily swallows up the MERCENARIES’ JEEPS 
           as they try to flee. The men inside choking on sand as it 
           coats their bodies, their faces, their tongues -- everything.

           INT. CHLOE AND DANNY’S JEEP - DRIVING AWAY

           A loud HISS all around them as sand is sucked into the 
           implosion. Erasing the tracks of their Jeep’s wheels.

                                 CHLOE
                        Don’t look back, Danny. Don’t look 
                        back.

           Their eyes are wet inside their helmets. Danny grips Chloe 
           tightly as she drives.

           But the Youngest is staring back in awed wonder at --

           The eerie and beautiful BUBBLY SAND surrounding the MOLTEN 
           SHAPE that was, a second ago, the capsule.

           The glowing blob slowly cools... 

           Sinking into the sand around it... 

           The sand around it turns to glass. Solidifying into unearthly, 
           sculptural shapes...

                                                 MINUTES LATER:

           D.O.D. HELICOPTERS land on the blackened sand around what was 
           the capsule. Soldiers pour out, searching for survivors.

           MCMURTRY, the D.O.D. Official, emerges. He still looks 
           ridiculously boyish. 

           The soldiers quickly find SURKOV and untie him. He’s barely 
           alive. Hacking up sand and blood. 

                                 SURKOV
                         (weakly)
                        It’s over.
           He holds out his cell phone to McMurtry. McMurtry sees there’s 
           a video file on it. His face is impassive.

                                 MCMURTRY
                        You let the family get away. They’re 
                        witnesses.

                                 SURKOV
                        They won’t say anything. The woman 
                        wants to keep her son alive. And no 
                        one will believe them anyway. 
                         (nodding to the video)
                        You can release that if you have to.

           McMurtry frowns and hits play. On the cell phone’s horribly 
           cracked screen, he can just make out:

           The CLOSE UP of EVAN. Against the white background of the 
           capsule wall. Danny’s voice comes from behind the camera.

                                 DANNY 
                        Please state your name.

                                 EVAN 
                        Evan Lange. 

                                 DANNY 
                        Are you currently of sound mind and 
                        body?

                                 EVAN
                        Yes.

           The video that opened the movie. As the audio continues, we 
           cut ahead to images:

           - The D.O.D. gathers up all the debris from the implosion. 
           Erasing all hint that anything happened.

           - McMurtry shoots Surkov in the head. Surkov falls. As the 
           sand around him turns RED with his blood --

                                 DANNY (O.S.)
                        Can you please explain the problems 
                        you’ve been suffering from?

                                 EVAN
                        Whenever I try to stop drinking, I 
                        have delusions. Hallucinations. 
                        Doctors told me it’s delirium 
                        tremens.

           - Another OFFICIAL approaches McMurtry.
                                 OFFICIAL
                        What about the natives?

           McMurtry eyes the THREE WOMEN, BAULU, and SABA WARRIORS 
           lingering on the nearest hill. All armed with Kalashnikovs.

                                 MCMURTRY
                        Pay them.

           - Surkov’s body is put in a bag and loaded onto a helicopter.

                                 DANNY (O.S.)
                        Do you agree that if people hear you 
                        making strange claims, they should 
                        call the police?

                                 EVAN (O.S.)
                         (with difficulty)
                        Yes. For their safety. And mine.

           Chloe and Danny get on a “HEART OF DARKNESS TOURS” BUS from 
           the Saba camp. 

           Chloe scans the evening sky. Sees a red star glittering. 

           Stares at it quietly. Refusing to cry. But --

           She pulls her son closer.

           FADE TO BLACK.
