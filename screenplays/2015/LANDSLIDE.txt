                                      LANDSLIDE

                             Will Staples & Tony Camerino

                      Based on the book How to Break a Terrorist
                    By Tony Camerino (a.k.a. 'Matthew Alexander')
          A note to the reader...  

          The operation chronicled in this screenplay is still highly 
          classified and the Pentagon has declined to comment. The target 
          was Black List #1, the most dangerous and most wanted man in the 
          world.  

          This screenplay was developed based on conversations with five 
          Delta Force operators who were members of "The Task Force" in 
          2006. Additionally, it was co-written by Major Tony Camerino, who 
          features as one of the primary characters in the story and 
          personally conducted the interrogations contained herein.

          While the public may never know all of the facts about the hunt 
          for the man who created ISIS, this screenplay represents the 
          closest thing to a true account that exists.
           FADE IN:

           A still image. The Canal Hotel - UN Headquarters in Iraq. A 
           voice breaks the silence. A man we’ll come to know as TONY. 
           He sounds educated, but emotionally detached - a drizzly 
           November of the soul.

                        2003. Iraq. I leave behind a 
                        country at peace. Mission 
                        accomplished. Now it’s up to the 
                        international community to rebuild. 

           BOOM! The UN building explodes. HEADLINES: "22 Dead, 100 
           wounded", "UN to withdraw all personnel from Iraq".

                        Without warning, Al Qaeda launches 
                        an unprecedented wave of suicide 
                        bombings targeting civilians. Their 
                        stated goal is to plunge the 
                        country into civil war.

           The demolished GOLDEN DOME MOSQUE. HEADLINES: "Iraq's Holiest 
           Shrine in Ruins," "Retaliatory Attacks Claim over 1,000".

                        The architect of the attacks is a 
                        Jordanian ex-convict named Abu 
                        Musab al Zarqawi a.k.a. The Sheikh. 
                        Like Adolf Hitler, he rises rapidly 
                        from obscurity to power through 
                        spectacular acts of violence.

           A suicide bombing at a crowded Baghdad marketplace. The 
           charred BODIES OF WOMEN AND CHILDREN litter the street. 
           HEADLINE: "Suicide Bomber Strikes Baghdad Market; 52 Dead".

                        By spring of 2006, Zarqawi becomes 
                        only the second man in history to 
                        have a $25 million bounty on his 
                        head. He is the most wanted 
                        terrorist on the planet - a higher 
                        priority than Osama bin Laden.  
                        With Iraq on the brink, a highly 
                        classified Task Force is assembled 
                        with a single mission...

           INT. DELTA SAFEHOUSE - DAY

           POV LOW-RES VIDCAM FOOTAGE: Standing in front of us in the 
           Spartan safehouse is “WORM”. He is tan and lean, his all-
           American looks and shaggy hair at odds with the TATTOOS OF 
           SKULLS AND FIRE smothering his arms.

           A low-budget graphic spins on screen: ‘CRIBZ BAGHDAD’

                                 WORM
                        Yo, yo, yo, welcome to Cribs, 
                        Baghdad. We got all the homies here 
                        today.

           As Worm moves through the house, we glimpse his bros lifting 
           weights, powering down energy drinks, skyping with their 
           families...One of the men, STORMY, shaves a big mustache.

                                 WORM (CONT’D)
                        Hey Stormy - nice ‘stache.

                                 STORMY
                        Anything worth doing is worth 
                        looking good doing.

           Worm approaches CRAPSHOOT, who plays X-Box on a ratty couch.

                                 WORM
                        Right here we got our Christian 
                        Dior couch.

                                 CRAPSHOOT
                        Bro, we’re in Arabia. This shit 
                        ain’t Christian Dior. It’s Muslim 
                        Dior.

           Worm moves on to a man standing before a giant link analysis 
           chart featuring the players in AL QAEDA IN IRAQ. At the top, 
           above a row of lieutenants, is Zarqawi a.k.a. The Sheik.

           Worm points to Zarqawi’s black-and-white headshot.

                                 WORM
                        Oh, and if you see this guy, tell 
                        him we’re looking for him.

           As Worm and the camera move on, we stick with the man 
           standing before the wall of photos. He is muscular, built 
           like a pro athlete. With his long beard and grown-out hair he 
           looks somewhere in between Tyler Durden and a modern day 
           Maximus, with Ahab’s unsurrenderable will. Meet RIP, the 
           alpha of the wolf-pack.
           Rip studies the photos, something not right. He pins a blank 
           sheet of paper in between the lieutenants and Zarqawi - some 
           second-in-command they have not yet identified. Rip draws a 
           large question mark on it, then steps back, staring at the 
           sum of all that maddens and torments.

           Another Operator, POPE, approaches. Something urgent.

                                 POPE
                        Boss, this just came in from 
                        higher.  

           Rip examines the report, concerned.

                                 RIP
                        The Sheik?

                                 POPE
                        NSA picked up SIGINT chatter, so 
                        take that for what it’s worth. 
                        Looks like Zarqawi’s sending out 
                        three virgin winners.  

                                 RIP
                        Get me execute authority.

           EXT. DELTA SAFEHOUSE - MOMENTS LATER

           Worm stands before the camera in front of a parking lot 
           filled with...

                                 WORM
                        And no pimp’s crib would be 
                        complete without his riiidez.

           Behind Worm is a row of the sickest luxury sports cars in all 
           of Mesopotamia. Saddam’s old fleet, now Delta Force’s 
           undercover interdiction vehicles.

           Rip approaches, geared up for war. Unlike the big green 
           machine soldiers we are used to, everything about Rip’s team 
           is customized for speed, surprise and violence of action in a 
           scorching theater of war where no op lasts longer then a few 
           minutes. Sleeves cut off shirts, fingers cut off gloves, 
           battle-worn weapons with tricked-out rail systems. No 
           backpacks or canteens. Fresh rifle mags stuffed in every 
           available pocket. 

                                 RIP
                             (to Worm)
                        Kit up. We’re wheels up in one.
           Rip and his team pile into TWO AH-6 LITTLE BIRD HELOS. Worm 
           arrives with his gear as he chugs a Red Bull. He sits beside 
           Rip, strapped onto the bench hanging out the chopper. He 
           hands Rip the drink. Rip finishes it.

                                 WORM
                        Happy Easter.

           Rip raps on the wall of the Little Bird twice and the helo 
           takes to the sky.

           EXT. AH-6 LITTLE BIRD - BAGHDAD - IRAQ - DAY

           The Little Birds skim across the rooftops and leave the city 
           behind, a vast red desert laid out before them.

           Crapshoot studies a ruggedized laptop with a live UAV feed.

           ON SCREEN: Three cars pull out of the target house 
           simultaneously.

                                 CRAPSHOOT
                        Looks like we’ve got three vehicles 
                        on the move. 

                                 RIP
                        Is the Sheik still on the target?

                                 CRAPSHOOT
                        We don’t know if he was there in 
                        the first place.

                                 RIP
                        How long until those suicide 
                        bombers reach civilians?

                                 CRAPSHOOT
                        Ten mikes.

           Rip considers, time to make a game-time decision. Weighing 
           the lives of hundreds of innocents against a kill that could 
           win the war.

                                 RIP
                        We hit the house first. Speed over 
                        security. Touchdown to jackpot no 
                        more than thirty seconds. Then roll 
                        up the virgin winners. 

                                 WORM
                        Hope you got a slow watch.
                                 RIP
                        Set a timer.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY

           AN IRAQI FARMER and his SON work the fields near the house as 
           the two helos approach with the Operators hanging out.

                                 FATHER
                        Run!

           The boy flees into the palm grove.

           FIFTY METERS FROM THE HOUSE: The helos touch down in the 
           dirt, causing a total brownout from the rotor wash.

           Before the skids settle in the dirt, Rip and his team are 
           sprinting hell bent for leather toward the house. We follow 
           them, breath labored as they brave the 130-degree heat.

           Worm places a breaching charge on the door. Rip lines up a 
           mere three feet from the charge and nods. Worm hits the 
           clacker. The door blows and...

           ...Rip races through with his men in tow, clearing every 
           room. Finding the house empty save for...

           ...a large clay ball with three cell phones wired into it.  
           Rip’s eyes go wide. He keys his radio.

                                 RIP (ON RADIO)
                        Landslide! Landslide! Landslide!

           Hearing the command, Rip’s teammates race like hell to unass 
           the target. Diving out windows. Clambering for safety.

           Rip dives into the dirt outside as...

           THE FARMHOUSE EXPLODES. As debris rains down on Rip, he turns 
           to see Worm lying beside him. Shit, that was close.

                                 RIP (CONT’D)
                        Time check.

           Worm checks his watch.

                                 WORM
                        Five minutes.

                        Chalk One - we’re going after the 
                        suicide bombers.

                                 WORM
                        Which bomber?

                                 RIP
                        All three.

           Worm casts Rip a look, concerned Rip is overplaying his hand.

                                                          SMASH CUT TO:

           INT. WHITE BONGO TRUCK - OUTSIDE RAMADI - DAY

           SUICIDE BOMBER #1 rides shotgun, sweat rolling down his brow. 
           His TERRORIST colleague drives.

           Suddenly, the Little Bird drops from the heavens and flares 
           90 degrees directly in front of them, stopping perpendicular 
           to the truck and placing Rip and Worm eye-level with the 
           terrorists.

           As the Suicide Bomber fumbles for the plunger --

           The DRIVER checks his side mirror to see the Little Bird.

                        You boys hang on.

           The Terrorists fire indiscriminately as the Little Bird 
           performs evasive maneuvers, bullets ZIPPING past.

           A lucky round pierces the cockpit, just missing the Pilot.

           BACK ON THE LITTLE BIRD...

           RIP'S RIFLE SCOPE POV: Rip tries to steady his laser dot, 
           which bounces like a jumping bean.

                                 RIP
                             (to Pilot)
                        Need some clean air.

           CLOSE ON a FLYER'S BOOT as it kicks a little rudder and the 
           nose of the Little Bird deflects the airstream.

           Rip lets a little slack out of his D-belt, braces one foot 
           against the skid and wedges the other between the bench and 
           the ribs of the Little Bird - balancing over the side.

           He waits for the red dot to settle. Then...

           INT. RED SEDAN - CONTINUOUS

           The Driver's brains paint the inside of the windshield.

           INT. AH-6 LITTLE BIRD - CONTINUOUS

           Rip looks down to see the Suicide Bomber raising his clacker 
           defiantly, hoping to take the Americans with him...

                                 RIP
                        Pull up!

           BOOM! THE CAR EXPLODES, sending up a fireball that engulfs 
           the Little Bird...which comes out the other side unscathed.

           Rip and Worm cough black smoke.

                                 WORM
                        Fuckin’ A!

           Rip barely process the explosion, tunnel vision setting in.

                                 RIP
                        Where’s the third bomber?

                                 CRAPSHOOT
                        We’re not gonna make it, boss. 

           INT. TAN PICKUP - DAY

           SUICIDE BOMBER #3 plays with the radio as he drives. Tunes in 
           a little Rolling Stones courtesy of the Armed Forces Network.  
           Ahead, he sees the city of Ramadi beyond the wheat fields.
           Suddenly, he spots the shaky reflection of the helo in his 
           rear view.

           CLOSE ON the fender of the truck as it’s sprayed with 
           bullets. The wheels blow out.

           The suicide bomber jams the brakes...

           I/E. AH-6 LITTLE BIRD - CONTINUOUS

           Rip watches as the bomber leaps out of the sedan and 
           disappears into the wheat field on foot with his bomb vest.

                                 RIP
                             (to pilot)
                        Put us down.

           As Rip racks the slide on a fresh mag, Worm tries to be the 
           voice of reason.

                                 WORM
                        Bro, this is a big old ball of 
                        fuck. How about we keep eyes on the 
                        field and see where he comes out?

                                 RIP
                        If we don’t go in, next time we see 
                        him will be when he blows up some 
                        town square.

           Worm hides his disapproval at placing Iraqi lives ahead of 
           the team’s.

           The Little Bird sets down on the road, Rip leaps out before 
           the skids even touch. His men follow.

           EXT. WHEAT FIELD - DAY - INTERCUTTING

           Suicide Bomber #3 low-crawls through the field, the dense 
           stalks making it impossible to see a foot in any direction.  
           A slight breeze sways the stalks. He stops, eyes darting.

           Rip moves through the head-high wheat, gently pressing the 
           stalks out of the way as he advances blindly toward almost-
           certain death. He hears something behind him and spins to 
           see...a sparrow take flight.

           Rip pushes forward, one step at a time. Adrenaline coursing.

           Suicide Bomber #3 stops. Slowly stands, the detonator in his 
           hand, and whispers a prayer...waiting for his chance.
           Rip pauses. Did he hear something? Or is it just the wind? He 
           turns and sprints, the wheat clawing at him.

           Then he abruptly stops again, listening. Rip delicately 
           lowers his M4 into his sling and pulls his GLOCK. He takes a 
           small step forward and pushes a single stalk of wheat aside 
           with the barrel of his pistol, revealing...

           ...the back of the Suicide Bomber's head. BAM.

           The bomber drops to the ground, the detonator falling 
           harmlessly from his hand.

           Suddenly an ELECTRONIC BEEPING. Rip looks up to see...  

           ...Worms fiddling with his stopwatch.  

                                 WORM
                        Guess I can turn that off. 

           Rip relaxes. Fuck.

                                 WORM (CONT'D)
                        Ambien?

           Rip nods and Worm tosses him a bottle of meds from his 
           pocket. As Rip dry swallows some pills, he keys his radio.

                                 RIP (ON RADIO)
                        This is Zulu 1-1. All suicide 
                        bombers neutralized. No joy on the 
                        Sheikh.

           Off Rip, frustrated. His white whale still out there...

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. CARGO HOLD, C-130 - DAY

           Turbulence rattles the plane. Then the violent THUNDER of an 
           IED somewhere far below. Casually propped against the 
           bulkhead, we find MAJOR TONY CAMERINO (mid-30s, dark tan), 
           his head buried in a vintage copy of the Qur’an. Tony is 
           equal parts T.E. Lawrence and Holden Caulfield. Though he is 
           a stubborn intellectual elitist, beneath it all is a lost 
           quality - as if he is human flotsam adrift at sea.

           Opposite Tony on a bench of mesh netting are TWO AIR FORCE 
           OFFICERS. With their tight grooming standards and clean 
           uniforms, the airmen are a photo negative of Rip’s team.

           MIKE (late 20s, Texan), gnaws a bag of beef jerky. He glances 
           at a surfboard tucked between the cargo boxes next to Tony.
                                 MIKE
                        Hope you enjoyed your R&R in Bali, 
                        sir. Won’t see much surf here.  

           ANN (20s, Air Force by way of Georgetown) addresses Tony.

                                 ANN
                        When’s the last time you were here, 
                        Major?

           Tony doesn't look up from the Qur'an.

                                 TONY
                        Been three years.  
                             (beat, sarcastically)
                        After we won the war.

           Tony lowers the Qur'an, using a weather PHOTO of a young girl 
           as a bookmark. He looks out the porthole, reminiscing, but 
           obviously unsure about his decision.

                                 TONY (CONT’D)
                        Spent a day in Baghdad right after 
                        we took it. People gave us ice 
                        cream.

                                 ANN
                        And now?

                                 TONY
                        All seven gates of hell have been 
                        ripped wide open.

                        Say what you will about Saddam. He 
                        was the only motherfucker here who 
                        knew what time it was.

           Ann spots an ancient RED FORT passing underneath.

                                 ANN
                        How old do you think that thing is?

                        Babylon. Cradle of civilization. 
                        People been crossing this desert to 
                        kill each other since the beginning 
                        of time. Only thing that changes is 
                        the direction.

                        Heard we'll only be interrogating 
                        big fish. 

           Tony’s head is back in the Qur’an.

                                 TONY
                        Horse, then cart.

                        Won't know if they're big fish 
                        until after we interrogate them.

                                 MIKE
                        Thing I don't get...how do you 
                        scare a guy into talking who's 
                        willing to blow himself up in the 
                        name of religion?

                                 TONY
                        You don’t. You interrogate 
                        terrorists the same way you 
                        interrogate criminals. 

                                 MIKE
                        Which is?

                                 TONY
                        Find out what they care about, and 
                        then give it to them.

                                 MIKE
                        These are hardcore jihadists. True 
                        believers. Only thing they care 
                        about is killing.

                                 TONY
                        There are no true believers. 
                        Everyone cares about something.

           Ann considers.

                                 ANN
                        What do you care about?

                                 TONY
                        You’re an interrogator - figure it 
                        out.

           As Tony returns to his Qur’an, Ann smiles in spite of 
           herself.
           EXT. BALAD AIR BASE - DAY

           The C-130 touches down.

           INT. GATOR PIT - DAY

           SUPER: TASK FORCE INTERROGATION UNIT, UNDISCLOSED LOCATION, 
           CENTRAL IRAQ 

           Tony and the other ‘GATORS’ get the welcome briefing from 
           RANDY, the Interrogation Unit's Ops Officer (30s, short, and 
           as serious as the Operators he supports).

           There is a claustrophobic quality to the facility. Narrow 
           walls, low ceilings. Rooms packed with broken office 
           furniture and computers with tangles of wires. Everything 
           coated in a fine layer of red dust --

                                 RANDY
                        Pentagon likes to call us ‘The New 
                        Manhattan Project’, but we prefer 
                        ‘Superbowl of the Human Race’.

           All around us, INTERROGATORS and ANALYSTS connive and 
           conspire.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        Interrogators and Analysts work 
                        side-by-side here in the Gator Pit.  
                        We are in the target procurement 
                        business. Detainees give us 
                        targets. Ops Team hits the targets. 
                        If the targets are brought in 
                        alive, they become detainees...

                                 MIKE
                        ...and they feed more targets.

                                 RANDY
                        Rinse and repeat.

           A deep RUMBLE. The building rattles, but no one bats an eye.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        Mortars. You’ll get used to them.

           They continue...

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        Interrogations run 24/7. Two teams-- 
                        day shift and night shift. You'll 
                        spend 90% of your waking hours in 
                        the booths.
           INT. HALLWAY - GATOR PIT - DAY

           Lining the hallway are the booths - 6’ x 6' squares framed by 
           four plywood walls with two plastic lawn chairs. 

           GUARDS, INTERROGATORS, and DETAINEES (orange jump suits, 
           black hoods, shackles) rub shoulders as they squeeze past 
           each other in the narrow corridor.

                                 RANDY
                        You’ll conduct the interrogations 
                        here.

           They pass a booth where a GUARD short-shackles a DETAINEE to 
           a bolt in the floor, turns off the light, and locks the door.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        Vegas Rules. What happens in the 
                        unit, stays in the unit. Only thing 
                        that matters is finding Zarqawi.

           Ann and Mike look to Tony for guidance. He's concerned, but 
           says nothing. Continuing...

           BOOM.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        You'll do three interrogations a 
                        day, three hours each. An hour 
                        after each to knock out a report, 
                        thirty minutes for chow, mandatory 
                        briefings at noon and midnight... 
                        if you're lucky you'll get five 
                        hours for shut-eye. No days off.

           The wall rattles. But this time it's not a mortar. They turn 
           and look through a slot hole to see...

           INT. INTERROGATION BOOTH - DAY 

           SLOT HOLE POV: MACK (late 40s, prematurely gray beard), a 
           former Marine and weathered post-9/11 contractor. Meet the 
           Task Force’s ranking gator, a man who takes pleasure in 
           forcing square pegs through round holes. 

           Mack holds the collar of his latest peg, who is pinned 
           against the wall.

           walks to the open slot hole, and eyes the Airmen.

                        Yup. Two active, one reservist. 

           Mack’s eyes fall on Tony...the reservist.

                        you'll excuse me...

           He slams shut the slot hole. Through the door...

                                 MACK (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Where were we..?

           BOOM. The wall rattles.

           Ann and Mike look to Tony - what the fuck did we get 
           ourselves into?

                                 TONY
                             (to Randy)
                        You guys ever heard of Abu Ghraib?

                                 RANDY
                        That shit isn’t tolerated here.  
                        But neither is failure. How gators 
                        get results is on them. This is big 
                        boy rules. We don’t tell you how to 
                        tie your shoes. 

                                 TONY
                        I think I speak for my team when I 
                        say we don’t exactly feel like 
                        getting dragged in front of 
                        Congress with our dicks in our 
                        hands.

                                 RANDY
                        Like I said, what happens in the 
                        Task Force stays in the Task Force.

           Ann looks behind Randy into--

           A disheveled CLOSET, shelves filled with ‘site litter’- 
           laptops, CD's, papers, photos. A terrorist garage sale.

                                 ANN
                        What’s all that?

           Randy turns and looks inside, then calmly shuts the door.
                                 RANDY
                        We're a little behind on evidence 
                        exploitation. Most of this stuff is 
                        worthless junk.

           Tony inspects the closet, wondering what treasures have been 
           overlooked.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)
                        Time to rub nuts with the other 
                        gators.

           As Randy points the way...

           INT. GATOR PIT - DAY

           Tony approaches BOBBY (20s, Army 3-striper, and hyperactive 
           cornhusker). He's been up an hour and is already on his third 
           coke.

                                 TONY
                        You Bobby?

                                 BOBBY
                        Yeah. You the new guy I'm supposed 
                        to train?

           Tony extends a hand.

                                 TONY
                        Tony.

                                 BOBBY
                        Where you from? DIA?

                                 TONY
                        Air Force.

                                 BOBBY
                        I thought you guys fly shit.

                                 TONY
                        That’s what my recruiter told me.

                                 BOBBY
                        Today’s your lucky day.

           Bobby hands Tony a file and Tony opens it.

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        We got a goddamn dirt digger.

           Bobby looks across the room at a snot-nosed analyst, PAUL 
           (20s, John Lennon glasses).
                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        Hey Paul. Come here, motherfucker.  
                        Got a question for you. 

           Paul rushes across the room.

                                 PAUL
                        What’s up?

                                 BOBBY
                        Maverick here is new. Give him the 
                        what’s what on the booger eater we 
                        rolled up this morning.

                                 PAUL
                        Abu Ali owns the farmhouse where 
                        this morning's suicide bombers 
                        staged. Nothing in the database. 
                        Could just be an Al Qaeda hired-
                        hand.

                                 BOBBY
                        Yeah, right. Motherfucker would 
                        probably strap a bomb to his chest 
                        given the first opportunity. Allah 
                        Akboom.

                                 TONY
                        Assuming he’s religious.

                                 BOBBY
                        Uh, yeah. Why else would he be 
                        helping Al fucking Qaeda?  

           Bobby throws Paul a look (duh!). He downs his coke and tosses 
           the can in the trash before popping a new one.

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        C'mon let's break this skinny 
                        little shit.

           Heading for the door... Off Tony, wondering what the hell he 
           has gotten himself into.

           INT. INTERROGATION BOOTH - DAY

           ABU ALI (40, skinny as a date palm) sits in front of the 
           interrogators in an orange jumpsuit. We recognize him as the 
           FARMER who ran from the Little Bird in the opening.

           SUPER: Detainee #0811 - ‘ABU ALI’

           Bobby taps the screening report.
                                 BOBBY
                        Let’s start with what we know.  
                        Says here you speak English. I’d 
                        say that’s a win for everyone here.

           Abu Ali looks at Tony, sizing him up.

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        Also says here you own the house 
                        where the suicide bombers prepared 
                        for their mission. In case you’re 
                        wondering, your buddies are all 
                        dead.

                                 ABU ALI
                        I do not own the house. I only work 
                        the field.

                                 BOBBY
                        Who do you work for in Al Qaeda?

                                 ABU ALI
                        I told you - I am just a farmer.

           Bobby stands, towering over Abu Ali.

                                 BOBBY
                        That’s how you want to play it, 
                        huh?

           He walks over to the A/C unit on the wall, turns it on full 
           blast, and aims it at Abu Ali, who recoils in discomfort.

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        What's wrong? Too chilly for your 
                        desert ass? Back in Nebraska, this 
                        is fuckin’ springtime.

           CLOSE ON Tony, like he's watching a fifth grader fuck up 
           basic arithmetic.

                                 TONY
                        Why don’t we back up and--

                                 BOBBY
                        I got this.

           He half-covers his mouth, whispering to Tony-

                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        Fuckers only understand strength.

           Then he turns and stands in front of Abu Ali again, this time 
           poking at his forehead.
                                 BOBBY (CONT’D)
                        Listen up, motherfucker. You know 
                        what's going to happen when we turn 
                        your ass over to the Ministry of 
                        Interior?  

           Bobby imitates pulling on a rope around his neck.

                                 BOBBY (CONT'D)
                        Those Shi’a boys can’t wait to have 
                        another Sunni to test their ropes. 
                        You're fucked without us. So you 
                        can either talk to us, or you can 
                        roll the dice with them.  

                                 ABU ALI
                        I know nothing.

           Bobby leans in close to Abu Ali.

                                 BOBBY
                        FUCK. YOU. HAJI. Fuuuuuck you.
                             (to Tony)
                        Let's go. This bastard can sit in 
                        his cell and think about rope day.

                                 TONY
                        I'm just gonna follow up on a few 
                        things. I'll catch up to you.

                                 BOBBY
                        We got two more interrogations to 
                        do. No use wasting time.

                                 TONY
                        I’m good.

                                 BOBBY
                        I said--

                                 TONY
                        Thanks, Specialist.  

           Bobby’s jaw drops - can’t believe this asshole just pulled 
           rank on day one.

           Bobby departs, slamming the door upon his exit, leaving Tony 
           and Abu Ali sitting in uncomfortable silence.

           Tony turns off the A/C, then sits back down.

                                 TONY (CONT’D)
                        Kids these days. No respect for 
                        their elders. 
           Abu Ali studies Tony, uncertain what to make of him.

                                 TONY (CONT’D)
                        You lost anyone since this war 
                        started?

           Hesitant, but intrigued by the change of tone...

                                 ABU ALI
                        My brother was killed by the Shi’a 
                        militia that your government 
                        allowed to run free.

                                 TONY
                        We've made a lot of mistakes in 
                        Iraq, but that one is up there.

           Abu Ali relaxes a little, surprised by Tony's criticism of 
           his own government. Tony picks up on it. Presses...

                                 TONY (CONT’D)
                        Way I figure, if someone murdered 
                        my brother, I'd be strapping on a 
                        vest for Al Qaeda tomorrow.

                                 ABU ALI
                        How can you understand what Sunnis 
                        have been through?

                                 TONY
                        I can't. But I'm guessing it 
                        explains why you joined Al Qaeda. 
                        For protection.

                                 ABU ALI
                        You know nothing about me.

                                 TONY
                        I know you are hiding a son.

           Abu Ali freezes in his seat, and Tony realizes he's found the 
           detainee’s pressure point.

                                 ABU ALI
                        I don't know what you are talking 
                        about.

                                 TONY
                        Really? Because Abu Ali means 
                        "Father of Ali." And you didn't 
                        list a son on your screening report 
                        but this...
           Tony pulls out IMAGERY from the morning's mission. CLOSE ON 
           two shadows standing in a field. He shows it to Abu Ali.

                                 TONY (CONT’D)
                        ...looks like a father and son to 
                        me. I don't know, what do you 
                        think? Shadow’s a little shorter 
                        than yours. Maybe about this tall.

           Tony holds his hand up to demonstrate the height. Abu Ali 
           looks at the space as if seeing his son standing before him.

                                 TONY (CONT’D)
                        Hey, I get it. You're hiding your 
                        son because you want him to grow up 
                        in a different Iraq. An Iraq like 
                        it used to be.

                                 ABU ALI
                        Before you Americans, Sunnis and 
                        Shi'a lived in peace. We had water 
                        and electricity.

                                 TONY
                        Can't blame you. But let me ask you 
                        something, my friend...if I may.

           Tony scoots his chair up real close. Puts his hand on Abu 
           Ali’s knee...a reassuring gesture, masking the fact he is 
           about to go in for the kill.

                                 TONY (CONT’D)
                        How long until your son Ali becomes 
                        a victim of the violence? How long 
                        until he's standing in the market 
                        when the suicide bomber strikes? 
                        How long until he's praying in the 
                        mosque that gets blown up by the 
                        car bomb? Or until the Shi'a 
                        militias come for him because 
                        you're helping Al Qaeda?

           Abu Ali averts his eyes, unable to face the words.

                                 ABU ALI
                        You don’t understand Iraq.

                                 TONY
                        "They only invent falsehood who do 
                        not believe in the verses of Allah, 
                        and it is those who are the liars."
                                 ABU ALI
                             (surprised)
                        You've read the Qur'an?

                                 TONY
                        Way I see it, this dark spiral of 
                        revenge that's taking over your 
                        country - the retaliation killings - 
                        it's going to swallow everyone up. 
                        Including your son, Ali.

           The truth hitting home, Abu Ali reacts with anger.

                                 ABU ALI
                        What other choice is there?!

                                 TONY
                        Work with me, my friend. Let's find 
                        a way. It won't be easy, but the 
                        other choice, to keep doing what 
                        you're doing...you might as well 
                        sign your son's death warrant.

           As the guilt overcomes Abu Ali...

                                 TONY (CONT’D)
                        Think of your son. What type of 
                        Iraq do you want him to grow up in? 

           ...and his eyes start to soften. Tony places his hand on Abu 
           Ali's shoulder, having made his first convert.

           INT. JOINT OPERATIONS CENTER - DAY

           SUPER: JOINT OPERATIONS CENTER, CENTRAL IRAQ 

           Also known as “The Death Star”, the JOC is the Spec Ops 
           version of the captain’s bridge. Dozens of monitors stream 
           live ISR (intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance).  
           The minimal decor and advanced tech are all designed to 
           leverage one crucial element of warfare: decisiveness.  

           Randy approaches COLONEL MARK DANNER (mid-40s, MMA fighter's 
           physique; he's a career Spec Ops soldier and man of few 
           words) as Danner is being briefed by his J2, MAJOR SUSAN 
           GIVENS (30s).

                                 RANDY
                        Sorry sir, we have a hot one.

                                 DANNER
                        Whatcha got?
           Randy holds up a map.

                                 RANDY
                        That farmer we rolled up this 
                        morning. He just gave us a location 
                        for Zarqawi’s top general - Ali 
                        Wali. It’s a house in Baghdad.

           Givens angles for a view, the name carrying weight for her.

                                 GIVENS
                        Bullshit. No one’s seen or heard 
                        from Ali Wali in two months. Rumor 
                        is a Shi’a militia got to him.

                                 DANNER
                        Let me see that.

           Randy hands Danner the map.

                                 DANNER (CONT’D)
                        Ops team is gonna have a field day 
                        with this. He killed one of their 
                        men.

                                 GIVENS
                        Could be a trap...

                                 DANNER
                        Why’s the detainee giving this up?

                                 RANDY
                        To be honest, I’m not sure. New guy 
                        over there got it. Some reservist.

           Randy nods over his shoulder towards the door, where Tony 
           stands, waiting.

                                 DANNER
                             (to Tony)
                        You - front and center.

           Tony approaches Danner.

                                 TONY
                        Sir.

                                 DANNER
                        You willing to bet the lives of my 
                        men on this?  

                                 TONY
                        Sir, yes, sir.  
                                 DANNER
                        Cut the ‘sir sandwich’. I’m asking, 
                        is this intel solid? 

           Under the spotlight, Tony masks his uncertainty.  

                                 TONY
                        I’d bet my own life on it.

           Randy can’t believe the balls on the new guy.

           EXT. DELTA SAFEHOUSE - DAY

           The Operators file out of the house, dressed like Iraqis, 
           carrying compact AK-74u assault rifles with collapsible 
           stocks. They walk in silence toward the fleet of luxury cars, 
           ready to get it on.

           One by one, the men load into the Porsches and BMWs.  

           Worm tosses Rip a set of keys as they approach a Ferrari.  

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Can I have a word?

           Rip turns to see Tony approaching.

                                 RIP
                        Who the fuck are you?

                                 TONY
                        The guy who delivered the intel on 
                        Ali Wali. Do me a favor and bring 
                        him back in one piece.

           Rip studies Tony. Knows his rank just by his stature.

                                 RIP
                        Whatever you want, Major.

           Rip gets in the driver seat and ties a keffiyeh around his 
           face, concealing his Caucasian features. He throws the car in 
           gear and fishtails out.

           Off Tony, concerned-

           ALI WALI (30s, Iraqi), hair slicked back and glossy suit, 
           approaches a shiny Silver Mercedes with his colleague JAMAL.

                                 JAMAL
                             (in Arabic)

           The Ferrari and Porsche haul ass down a crowded street,

                        Look out!

           Ali Wali slams the brakes, stopping just short of an OLD MAN 
           pushing a shwarma cart. As the man struggles to get his cart 
           out of the street...

                                 ALI WALI
                        This neighborhood used to be Sunni. 
                        Once the Americans leave, it will 
                        be ours again.

           Ali Wali lays on the HORN and the old man throws his hands in 
           the air.

           Suddenly, from a balcony above, an IRAQI MAN on a cell phone 
           yells down to Ali Wali.

                                 IRAQI MAN
                        Ameri-cahns!

           Ali Wali and Jamal turn to see the Ferrari closing. Ali Wali 
           slams on the gas and SMASHES through the food cart, sending 
           it tumbling and knocking the old man to the ground.

           sidewalk, crashing through tables, and leaving chaos and 
           destruction in his wake.

           Jamal opens it to find GRENADES. He grabs one, rolls down his

           EXPLODES, pelting the rear of the Ferrari with shrapnel.

                                 RIP (ON RADIO)
                        This is Zulu 1-1. Target is KIA.  
                        All eagles accounted for. RTB, 
                        over.

           Danner smiles - mission success. He turns to Givens.

                                 DANNER
                        That’s how it’s done.

           Givens walks over to an Al Qaeda organizational chart and 
           draws a BIG RED X over the mugshot of Ali Wali.

           EXT. TASK FORCE COMPOUND - DAY

           Tony leans against a jersey barrier, quietly observing as the 
           wounded Ferrari limps inside the Compound, kicking up a cloud 
           of red dust in its wake. 

           As the Operators disembark, Tony locks eyes with Rip, none 
           too happy about the loss of his next detainee.

           INT. CHOWHALL - TASK FORCE COMPOUND - NIGHT

           Tony eats dinner with Ann and Mike, mid-conversation. 
                                 TONY
                        That dark spiral...it’s always 
                        pulling at you. We need to rise 
                        above it. 

                                 MIKE
                        Or maybe we’re the ones who need to 
                        change our way of thinking. We’re 
                        losing this ballgame. Could be time 
                        to loosen up the ROEs. 

           Tony loses his cool.

                                 TONY
                        Bullshit. America has spent a 
                        hundred years perfecting the art of 
                        interrogation. Find me one FBI 
                        agent who thinks he could get a 
                        confession by punching a serial 
                        killer in the nose.

                        You don't have to break the law to 
                        break a terrorist.

           Tony spots Rip and Worm dining across the room.

                                 TONY (CONT’D)
                        That knuckle-dragger murdered our 
                        only lead. If we don't convert 
                        targets into actionable intel, 
                        what's the point? 

           Tony stews, tunnel vision setting in.

                                 TONY (CONT'D)
                        I'm going to talk to him.

           Ann knows Tony well enough to fear where this is going. 

                                 ANN
                        Talk?

                             (cavalier)
                        What do you think, Mike? “Pride and 
                        Ego Up” or “Love of Comrades.”

                                 MIKE
                        You’re going to run an approach on 
                        an Operator?!  

                                 ANN
                        You sure this is a good idea?
           Tony shrugs. Stands up.  

                                 TONY
                        Fortune favors the brave.

                                 ANN
                        So do fuckups.

           Tony seats himself across from Worm and Rip, who barely 
           acknowledge his presence.

                                 TONY
                        Thought you said you were going to 
                        bring the target in alive.

           Rip doesn’t need to justify himself to anyone.

                                 RIP
                        He didn’t make it.

                                 TONY
                        Guess he had it comin'.

                                 WORM
                        You could say that.

           Tony addresses Rip, the man he knows he needs to convert.

                                 TONY
                        Hard not to hate. Every time I see 
                        a beheading video, makes me think 
                        our enemies are fucking animals. 

           Rip studies Tony. Beat. 

                                 RIP
                        Save the empathy approach for the 
                        hajis.  

           Tony realizes he may have underestimated Rip. 

                                 TONY
                        Twelve deployments and twenty plus 
                        years active duty...guessing you 
                        could be coaching high school 
                        football or spending time with your 
                        family. But you keep coming back. 
                        Why?

                                 RIP
                        Me and the Sheikh have unfinished 
                        business.
                                 TONY
                        And you think what you did today 
                        got you any closer to him? You need 
                        to fight smarter, not harder.

                                 RIP
                        What we did today wasn't about 
                        Zarqawi. That was revenge for our 
                        boy, Sandy. Warrior code shit. 
                        Outside your wheelhouse.

                                 TONY
                        Your boy Sandy gave his life trying 
                        to find Zarqawi - that was the 
                        mission. And you dumping a mag in 
                        Ali Wali just lowered the chances 
                        that we'll make his death count.

                                 WORM
                        Watch your fucking step.

           Tony presses...

                                 TONY
                        Your boy may end up dying for 
                        nothing because your thirst for 
                        revenge just killed the one good 
                        lead we had on the Sheikh.

           Rip puts his utensils down, wiping his mouth. Simmering.

                                 RIP
                        Let me tell you something.

           Rip leans in, something important to say.

                                 RIP (CONT’D)
                        Come here.

           Tony leans across the table, prepared for whatever secret Rip 
           is going to unveil. Instead, Rip yanks Tony by the collar so 
           he is flat on the table with his head hanging off the edge.

           Rip wraps his shemagh (rag) around Tony’s neck like a boa 
           constrictor, choking him. Tony thrashes violently on the 
           table, but it’s no use.

           Ann and Mike look up from their dinner, preparing to 
           intervene as the entire chowhall watches the scene unfold.

           Worm rises, posturing. His body language letting everyone in 
           the room know not to get involved.

           Rip whispers in Tony’s ear.
                                 RIP (CONT’D)
                        I asked around about you. Turns out 
                        the only people here who don’t hate 
                        your guts are the terrorists.  

           Tony tries to wrestle free, but Rip subdues him. His voice is 
           cold as a cadaver.

                                 RIP (CONT'D)
                        You want to sing kumbaya and buy 
                        the world a Coke, that’s on you. 
                        But don’t ever question me or my 
                        men again. You have no fucking idea 
                        what it’s like outside the wire.

           Tony struggles to breathe, face red.

                                 TONY
                        One question.

           Rip releases the tension just enough for Tony to speak.

                                 TONY (CONT’D)
                        Do you want revenge, or do you want 
                        to win? Because I’m here to find 
                        Zarqawi. 

           Worm spots TWO MILITARY POLICE approaching.

                                 WORM
                        Another time. Let’s go.

           Rip releases Tony and leaves with Worm, who address the MPs.

                                 WORM (CONT’D)
                        We’re good.

           Tony rests on the table, adrenaline coursing as he catches 
           his breath - what the fuck just happened? Ann approaches.

                                 ANN
                        That went well.

           OFF Tony, watching Rip exit -

           INT. GATOR PIT - DAY

           Back at his desk, Tony types up a report. Nearby, Mack 
           mentors a small group of gators -
                                 MACK
                        It’s just like Yoda said, “Fear 
                        leads to anger, anger leads to 
                        hate, hate leads to suffering, and 
                        suffering leads to intel.”

           The gators laugh.  

           Tony looks over at Mack and Mack nods, glad he overheard. The 
           other gators glare at Tony -- after the chowhall, he’s 
           persona non grata. Tony gives up, calls it a day and heads 
           for the door.

           EXT. TRAILER - TASK FORCE COMPOUND - DUSK

           Tony enters to find his surfboard broken in half. He picks up 
           the tail and inspects it. Beyond repair, he tosses it out the 
           door into the dirt. 

           Combing through the rest of his stuff looking for more 
           casualties, he flips through his vintage copy of the Qur’an 
           and...

           ...the worn PHOTO of a young girl falls out. 

           Tony picks it up, eyes it for a second, then replaces it and 
           shuts the book. 

           EXT. TRAILER / TASK FORCE COMPOUND - DUSK

           Tony steps out of his rickety box and crosses the compound.

           EXT. COMPOUND PERIMETER - DUSK 

           Looking like a prison inmate, Tony stands with his fingers 
           curled around the perimeter fence.

           He stares out into the empty desert...outside the wire.    

           Suddenly an OLD BEDOUIN appears, herding camels. He spots 
           Tony and stops. Raises an old thermos. Tony fishes a couple 
           dollars out of his pocket, indicating his interest. 

           Tony watches as the old Bedouin milks one of his camels into 
           the thermos. The camel GROANS. 

           The Bedouin then pours the fresh milk into a filthy tin cup.  
           He passes it to Tony through the fence.  
                                 TONY
                             (’thank you’ in Arabic)
                        Shukran.

           Tony notes a thick layer of film-coating on top.  Hesitant, 
           he raises the cup to his lips - half expecting his bowels to 
           spontaneously combust the second he takes a sip.  

                                 BEDOUIN
                             (Arabic, subtitled)
                        Good, yes?  

           Forcing the milk down, Tony responds in English. Sarcastic. 

                                 TONY
                        Yeah, it’s fucking great.

           The Bedouin gestures to see if Tony wants more. Tony waves 
           his hands, graciously declining.

           INT. GATOR PIT - NIGHT

           Tony marks locations on a map of Iraq as the World Cup plays 
           on an old tube TV on his desk. The picture cuts out and Tony 
           slaps the side of the TV. The picture comes back in for a 
           moment, then frizzes back out.

           Tony uses a compass to draw a circle around the cluster of 
           locations, then rubs his red eyes. Beyond exhausted...

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        You bring tac gear?

           Tony turns to see Randy.

                                 TONY
                        Sorry?

                                 RANDY
                        Just received a request for a 
                        battlefield interrogation.

                                 TONY
                        My shift is over. 

                                 RANDY
                        It was a by-name request. Asked for 
                        you specifically.

           Tony turns, suspicious.

                                 TONY
                        From who?
                                 RANDY
                        Doesn’t matter. Tarmac in twenty. 
                        Be there.

           Off Tony, realizing he's stepped in some major shit.

           EXT. HANGAR - HELO PAD - NIGHT

           Tony boards an MH-47 Chinook, where the elite Night Stalker 
           check their instruments.

           Tony sees the large passenger area of the helo is empty.

                                 TONY
                        Who else are we waiting for?

           The PILOT calls back to Tony.

                                 PILOT
                        Just you, Major.

           The roar of the engine builds as the rotors spin up.

           I/E. CHINOOK - NIGHT

           CLOSE ON Tony, staring down at the desert as TRACER ROUNDS 
           sporadically streak into the sky.

           In his headset Tony can hear the Pilot and CO-PILOT chatter.  
           They are clearly confused by the orders. 

                                 PILOT (ON RADIO)
                        Can you verify these coordinates?  
                        There’s nothing down there.

                                 CO-PILOT (ON RADIO)
                        This is the place.

           The pilot calls back to Tony.

                                 PILOT
                        This is your stop, buddy.

           Tony glances out into the pitch black desert.

                                 TONY
                        Where’s my rendezvous?

                                 PILOT
                        We only guarantee on-time delivery.  
                        Rest is on you.

           Off Tony, rubbing his dog tags-
           EXT. DESERT - OUTSIDE TIKRIT - NIGHT

           The Chinook sets down in a dust cloud and Tony jumps out.

           The helo departs, leaving Tony standing all alone in the 
           middle of the desert, dark as three feet up a bull's ass.

           He strains to peer into the inky abyss stretched out before 
           him. His labored BREATH cuts through the silence.

           He checks his GPS, cupping his hand to avoid light bleed.

                                 TONY
                        Fuck it...

           He takes a sip of water from his camelback as he waits.

           And as he wonders if he's just been set up, on the horizon - 
           HEADLIGHTS.

           He fumbles to raise his rifle.

           SCOPE POV: FOUR SHITTY TOYOTA PICKUPS race toward him.  
           Headlights blinding. Indigenous vehicles.

           Tony drops to a knee...clicks off his safety...places his 
           finger on the trigger. Lining up the vehicles in his sights--

           Tony can just make out the silhouettes of Arab men inside the 
           vehicles.  

           The trucks draw near and suddenly skid to a stop. The window 
           of the lead truck rolls down, revealing Rip at the wheel, 
           keffiyeh wrapped around his face and neck.

           Rip addresses Tony, cool as the other side of the pillow.

                                 RIP
                        Asalama alaykum.

           Tony isn’t sure what to make of it, but doesn’t want to show 
           fear. Especially if this is how it ends for him. He responds 
           with the traditional Muslim greeting.

                                 TONY
                        Wa alaikum-salaam.

                                 RIP
                        Get in.  

           Tony gets in the truck.
           INT. TRUCK - NIGHT

           As the truck pulls away, Tony glances at Rip in the low 
           lights of the cabin. Rip keys his radio.

                                 RIP
                        I send checkpoint Zeus, over.

           Tony takes note of Rip’s thumb tapping on the steering wheel - 
           a telltale of some sort. Tony breaks the awkward silence.

                                 TONY
                        The Azurri knocked the U.S. out of 
                        Group A.

           Rip turns, uncertain what Tony is talking about...

                                 RIP
                        Is that a soccer thing..?

                                 TONY

           So much for common ground... 

                                 TONY (CONT’D)
                        I guess if you were gonna shoot me, 
                        you’d already have done it.

           Rip’s thoughts are elsewhere.

                                 RIP
                        If it were up to George Senior, 
                        we’d have handled this shit back in 
                        ‘91. Would’ve wiped our asses with 
                        every last one of their turbans. 
                        Instead, we’re still here because 
                        people like you with your pink 
                        gloves keep imposing rules as if 
                        war is something other than what it 
                        is.

                                 TONY
                        And what is it?

                                 RIP
                        A global fucking cage match.

           After an uncomfortable beat, Rip switches gears.

                                 RIP (CONT’D)
                        Why’d you go Air Force? You watch 
                        Top Gun as a kid and buy that shit 
                        that they’d let you fly planes?

           Rip can sense the pain in Tony’s response. Maybe they have 
           some common ground after all.

                                 RIP
                        No greater sin. You deploy anywhere

                        Lots of places I ain’t been.

           As the pickup pulls into a residential area, Rip keys his 
           radio.

                                 RIP (CONT’D)
                        I send checkpoint Medusa. Go dark, 
                        over.

           Rip turns off his headlights and the pickups behind him 
           follow suit.

           Rip parks the pickup on the side of the road.

                                 RIP (CONT’D)
                        Stay in the truck.

           Rip departs, leaving Tony alone in Indian country.
           EXT. PICKUP - NIGHT

           Rip grabs a plastic LAWN CHAIR with rope attached from the 
           truck bed as the other OPERATORS join him.

           He places the chair against a wall and all the men use it to 
           silently hop over.  

           Tony watches as the rope tugs the chair up and over the wall, 
           leaving no sign of the men.  

           Tony sits in silence in the truck, feeling extremely exposed.

           Suddenly, Tony hears the unmistakable POP-POP-POP-POP of a 9-
           banger flash-bang grenade. Followed by the CRACK of AK47s and 
           the THUMP-THUMP of suppressed rifles.

           Then the SCREAMING of a woman...the SHOUTING of Operators...

           Rip marches from the front door of the house and pulls open 
           Tony’s door. There is a dark aggressive intensity in Rip’s 
           voice.

                                 RIP
                        You think you’re better than us.  
                        This is your chance to prove it.  
                        Haji inside stripped the SIM card 
                        from his phone. You’ve got two 
                        minutes to find it, and then we’re 
                        tail-lights.  

           It takes Tony a second to even process what Rip is 
           suggesting...

                                 TONY
                        Two minutes?!

           Rip casts a sideways glance at the curious Lookie Loos who 
           have now gathered on the street.

                                 RIP
                        Unless you want to stick around for 
                        the block party. Welcome to life 
                        outside the wire.

           Tony gets out of the truck...

           INT. LIVING ROOM - HOUSE - NIGHT

           Tony and Rip enter the living room, which is total chaos.  
           Operators rip apart the house, intimidating the family with 
           overwhelming force. The family responds with fear and panic.
           Worm has TARIQ (40s, Iraqi, thick 'stache) hog-tied on the 
           ground. He struggles under the weight of Worm’s knee while 
           another Operator forcibly searches him.

                                 WORM
                        Where is it, motherfucker?!

           Tony turns to Rip, looking for an explanation. 

                                 RIP
                        A little well placed pain goes a 
                        long way.  

           Before Tony can respond, Rip reminds him...

                                 RIP (CONT’D)
                        Two minutes.

           Crapshoot joins from the bedroom, manhandling Tariq's young 
           DAUGHTER (10, all bones). As he throws her onto the floor...

                                 CRAPSHOOT
                        This one was hiding in the closet.

           Another Operator, STORMY, opens a cabinet. 

                                 STORMY
                        Looks like we’re in the right 
                        house.

           The Operator next to him, Pope, turns to see shelves filled 
           with RPGs, AKs, M72s.

                                 POPE
                        Good intel. That’s a first.

           Worm roughs up Tariq.  

                                 WORM
                        Maybe your little girl knows where 
                        it is.

           Tony watches in shock as Worm approaches the daughter.  

           Tariq's wife goes COMPLETELY APESHIT and lunges at him.  
           Crapshoot seizes the screaming, thrashing woman.

           The only one in the room who isn’t dialed up to eleven is 
           Rip, who is the portrait of equanimity, seemingly taking 
           pleasure in the whole affair and Tony’s imminent failure.
                                 RIP
                             (to Tony)
                        Ninety seconds. You just gonna 
                        stand there, flyboy? 

           Worm pulls a pistol on the mother, but that causes even more 
           chaos as she SCREAMS and Tariq YELLS--

                                 TARIQ
                             (in Arabic)
                        Get away from my wife!

           The daughter starts to CRY. Suddenly, the girl darts for the 
           door, only to be snagged by Worm.

                                 WORM
                        Oh no you don’t!

           But his touching the girl only inflames Tariq's wife more and 
           she starts WAILING at the top of her lungs.

           Tony can’t take it any more.

                                 TONY
                        Take your hands off her!

           Worm turns to Rip. Is he fucking serious?  

                                 RIP
                             (to Worm, casual)
                        You heard the man.

           Rip checks his watch, wanting Tony to fail on his own terms.

                                 RIP (CONT’D)
                        One minute.  

                                 WORM
                        Boss, we gotta find that SIM card.

                                 TONY
                        And you think this is how you’re 
                        going to find it? 

           Tony eyes the room, the impossible challenge set out before 
           him. Rip meets eyes with Tony, the gauntlet dropped.

                                 RIP
                        No one’s stopping you.

           Tony realizes he needs to play the game on his own terms. He 
           addresses Tariq’s wife.  
                                 TONY
                             (in Arabic)
                        Easy now...cool heart, sister.

           The woman calms at the sound of his voice.

                                 CRAPSHOOT
                        Look at that. Dude is the fucking 
                        Haji Whisperer.

           Tony turns to Rip.

                                 TONY
                        I need everyone out of the house.

                                 RIP
                        Not an option.

           Tony gets in Rip’s face, losing his cool at having to waste 
           time explaining.

                                 TONY
                        Listen, all these men standing 
                        around with guns. Right now she...
                             (indicating the wife)
                        ...is thinking we're going to gang-
                        rape her daughter. And there's no 
                        way this guy...
                             (indicating Tariq)
                        ...is going to cooperate as long as 
                        she's thinking that.

                                 RIP
                        Everyone out.

                                 WORM
                        Since when does an augmentee decide 
                        actions on the objective.

           Rip casts his wolfpack a look. Chill out fellas.  

                                 RIP
                        We’ll be right behind you.

           The men file out, annoyed, but team players. 

           Tony searches the room for some way to square the circle.  
           Tony motions toward Tariq's wife and daughter.

                                 TONY
                        You two - sit.

           As the family sits on the couch, Tony pulls Tariq to his 
           feet, straightens his dishdasha, wiping dirt from it.

                        Okay, okay.

           Rip checks his watch.

                                 RIP
                        Thirty seconds, Dr. Phil. I don’t 
                        see a SIM card.

           Tony ignores Rip, his attention on Tariq.

                                 TONY
                        You care about your daughter?

                                 TARIQ
                        Yes, yes.

                                 TONY
                        Great. Let’s do something about 
                        that. What’s her name?

                                 TARIQ
                        Sarah.

                        Perfect. Now, you want to get Sarah 
                        and your wife out of this jam, then 
                        you’re going to repeat exactly what 
                        I say.

           Tariq shuffles on his feet, uncertain. He nods.

           Tony whispers something in Tariq’s ear. Tariq’s eyes go wide.  
           Rip interrupts...

                                 RIP
                        Ten seconds.

                             (to Tariq)
                        Say it!

           Tariq hesitates...

                        I said say it.  

           Tariq breaks, shouting the words.

                                 TARIQ
                        Sarah, give me what you’re hiding!

           The words hang in the air for a moment. 

                                 RIP
                        Time. We’re done here.

           Suddenly, Sarah rises from the couch and removes the SIM card 
           from under a cushion and extends it toward her father. 
           Tariq's face falls.

           Rip’s eyes fall on the SIM card, then Tony. Challenge met.  

           INT. PICKUP - DAWN

           Tony and Rip get back in the truck as the first rays of sun 
           breach the horizon. Tony exhales, still processing how close 
           he was to failure. Talk about a long fucking night.

                                 RIP
                        How did you know that would work?

           zeroing in on the Sheikh.
           The trucks jump an embankment, crash through a fence, and 
           swerve onto the highway.

           The sedan exits the highway and races into a dense shanty 
           town of tin roof slums.

           Inside the sedan, the driver nervously scans his

           Then, in the back seat, we see the face of the beast himself -

           Instead of slowing, he guns the gas to close distance...

           ...Tony’s face goes white. Doesn’t want to scream, but HOLY 
           SHIT they are about to smear into a wall....

           ...At the last second, Rip throws the hand brake and DRIFTS

           The trucks skid to a stop, reverse, and then accelerate into 
           the alley. The tin shanties claw at their sides.

           INT. TRUCK - MORNING

           More and more IRAQIS emerge on the street to start their 
           morning, only to find themselves in the middle of a street 
           race.

                        Negative.

           Ahead, Tony spots the sedan. He sees a figure in a black 
           burqa shut the back door, then turn back and make eye contact 
           with the truck, before taking off. 

                                 TONY
                        Zarqawi! In the burqa!

           Rip pulls to a stop just short of the sedan.

           EXT. STREET - TIKRIT - MORNING

           Tony exits, M4 trained on Zarqawi’s driver. The driver pulls 
           a handgun.

                                 TONY
                        Put the gun down--

           Before Tony can finish the thought, Rip empties a pistol mag 
           into the driver, never breaking stride.

                                 RIP
                        On me.

           Rip sprints into the shanty town after Zarqawi. Realizing he 
           is way out of his depth, Tony follows.

           The second vehicle pulls up behind them and the other 
           Operators give chase on foot as well.
           EXT. SHANTY TOWN - MORNING

           Rip sprints through the tight alleys in search of 
           Zarqawi...bouncing off walls...leaping fences...

           He sees a door bang shut and fearlessly charges through it...

           ...down a corridor...out a front door...

           ...into a square CROWDED WITH WOMEN IN BLACK BURQAS.

           Rip stops in his tracks. He scans the women with his pistol, 
           wondering which specter in this hall of mirrors is the devil. 
           The women recoil at the sight of the weapon.

           Suddenly...BANG! BANG! BANG! One of the women fires on Rip.  
           It’s fucking Zarqawi!  

           Rip is slammed back against a wall.

           Tony emerges behind him.  

                                 TONY
                        You’re hit...

           Rip clutches his torn bulletproof vest, wheezing for air.

                                 RIP
                        I’m fine - it’s just a cracked rib.  
                        Move!

           Rip struggles to breathe as he and Tony resume the chase...

           Rip and Tony enter a tin shanty. Rip’s gun-sights settle on a 
           frightened IRAQI BOY. The boy's FATHER points towards the 
           back door and Rip takes off.

           Rip and Tony press through the shanty, covering each other.  
           Working together for the first time. 

           Everything is a threat. A black burqa drying on a line.  
           Hanging pots. A goat.

           A woman's SCREAM sends Rip running down an alley where he 
           comes face to face with...

           ...a LARGE FIGURE IN A BURQA standing beside a man - 
           ostensibly her HUSBAND.  

                                 RIP (CONT’D)
                        Hands up!

           Tony trains his rifle on the ‘woman’ as Rip scans the area.  
           No way Zarqawi slipped away. This woman must be the Sheikh.
                                 HUSBAND
                             (Arabic)
                        Please. Don’t hurt us.

           Rip points his gun at the woman.

                                 RIP
                        Take it off.

           The husband and wife trade a look, uncertain what to do. The  
           husband turns to Tony for help, pleading --

                                 HUSBAND
                        Please. She’s my wife. 

           Tony raises his rifle.  

                                 TONY
                             (Arabic)
                        Take it off.   

           The husband and wife look at Tony’s raised M4. They can see 
           in his eyes that Tony will not hesitate to drop the hammer.  

           The husband shouts something angrily in Arabic and spits.  
           Rip pistol-whips him to the ground. The wife stands her 
           ground.

                                 TONY (CONT’D)
                        Last chance, sister.

           The wife, hands shaking, slowly unveils her face to reveal...

           ...just some old big-boned Iraqi lady.

           Tony lowers his rifle, embarrassed.

                                 TONY (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry.

           OFF the old lady, spitting defiantly at the feet of our 
           soldiers...

           EXT. TRUCK - MOMENTS LATER

           Rip storms back to the truck, furious he let Zarqawi slip 
           through his fingers. Unable to contain his rage...

                                 RIP
                        FUUUUUCK!!

           ...Rip punches the molded plastic knuckles of his Oakley 
           gloves through the window of the truck.
           Tony watches, knowing to keep his mouth shut.

           INT. TRUCK - DAY

           Rip and Tony ride back to base in silence. Rip simmers. He 
           pulls a bottle of pills from his pocket.  

                                 RIP
                        Ambien?

                                 TONY

           Tony watches with concern as Rip shakes a couple pills into 
           his mouth, then pulls a bottle of Wild Turkey out of the 
           glove box, using it to wash down the pills.

                                 ABU GAMAL
                        When you find your true love, time 
                        is like an arrow.

           Tony senses a door opening...

                                 TONY
                        Does she know you’ve been captured?

                                 ABU GAMAL
                        No. I was waiting for a fare when 
                        your soldiers arrested me.
                                 TONY
                        Do me a favor. Close your eyes.

           Abu Gamal looks at Tony suspiciously.

                                 TONY (CONT’D)
                        Here, I’ll go first.

           Tony closes his eyes. Abu Gamal eyes the screwdriver...

           ...then closes his eyes as well.

                                 TONY (CONT’D)
                        Okay, picture this. We release you 
                        and you get into your taxi, drive 
                        home to your neighborhood, and park 
                        in front of your house. Then you 
                        turn off the car and just sit 
                        there. What do you see inside your 
                        house?

           Abu Gamal shifts in his chair.

                                 ABU GAMAL
                        My wife.

           Final confirmation for Tony that he's on the right track.

                                 TONY
                        And she's probably worried sick. 
                        Doesn't know what's happened to 
                        you. Her eyes are red because she's 
                        been crying. Now, all of a sudden, 
                        she's heard something outside. She 
                        thinks it might be your car, but 
                        she doesn't know. And she can't 
                        bring herself to go look for fear 
                        that it might not be you.

           INT. HOLLYWOOD ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Rip watches curiously as Ann stands next to him.

                                 MACK
                        What is this bullshit?

           INT. INTERROGATION BOOTH - CONTINUOUS

           Tony digs deeper.

                                 TONY
                        So now you're just sitting there in 
                        your taxi, paralyzed. Too afraid to 
                        go inside for fear that your wife 
                        won't be there. And she's too 
                        scared to look out the window to 
                        see if it's you.

           Abu Gamal's brow furrows, the words hitting close to home.

           Tony knows he's getting close, so he pours it on, voice 
           rising, hands orchestrating a tide of emotions-

                                 TONY (CONT’D)
                        And then suddenly you find the 
                        courage to open the door and get 
                        out of the car. And you walk up to 
                        the front door of your home and you 
                        open it. And there, standing in 
                        front of you is...
                             (softly)
                        ...your wife.

           A single tear streaks down Abu Gamal's face.

           And now Tony changes tone...squeezing everything he can out 
           of the picture he's painting.

                                 TONY (CONT’D)
                        Now just imagine the look in her 
                        eyes. Imagine how overwhelmed she 
                        is to see you. After worrying all 
                        this time, not knowing if you were 
                        dead or alive.

           Abu Gamal pounds his fist on his thigh (an Arab gesture), 
           struggling to maintain composure.

                                 TONY (CONT’D)
                        Now tell me, my friend, what do you 
                        see behind her eyes? Do you see a 
                        woman who is proud of her husband 
                        who wires suicide vests? Or do you 
                        see a woman who is ashamed because 
                        she's married to a man who helps 
                        murder children?

                                 ABU GAMAL
                        No, I am not that man!
                                 TONY
                        Tell her why you are not that man.

                                 ABU GAMAL
                        My love, I have done things that 
                        you cannot understand. But please 
                        know that everything I have done I 
                        did for you. I was ashamed... I 
                        failed you as a husband. But then 
                        they offered me money. A chance to 
                        support you. All I ever wanted was 
                        to give you the life you deserved.    

           INT. HOLLYWOOD ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Rip listens to the terrorist’s confession, moved. Hearing 
           parts of his own story in the bomb-maker’s tale.

           INT. INTERROGATION BOOTH - DAY

           Tony hands a handkerchief to Abu Gamal, whose face streams 
           with tears.

                                 TONY
                        I’m going to be honest with you, my 
                        friend.  

           Abu Gamal looks up.  

                                 TONY (CONT'D)
                        Our soldiers found detonators in 
                        your car. You are responsible for 
                        killing innocents--

                                 ABU GAMAL
                        Only Allah decides who is innocent.

           Tony meets eyes with Abu Gamal, his face inscrutable.  

                                 TONY
                        Either way - you are going to hang.  
                        There’s nothing I can do about 
                        that. And they’ll never let you see 
                        your wife again.

           Abu Gamal internalizes his fate.  

                                 TONY (CONT’D)
                        But I can offer you something they 
                        can’t. I will let you write a 
                        letter to your wife to tell her all 
                        of the things you just told me. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 TONY (CONT’D)
                        That way when you die, she will 
                        always know the true depth of your 
                        love for her.  

           Tony slides a pen and paper to Abu Gamal, who eyes them 
           suspiciously.

                                 ABU GAMAL
                        You would do this for me?

                                 TONY
                        For something in return. You tell 
                        me where you wired the vests.

                                 ABU GAMAL
                        How do I know you will deliver the 
                        letter?

                                 TONY
                        I swear on my life. I will deliver 
                        it myself.

           Abu Gamal glances between Tony and the pen. As he picks up 
           the pen and begins to write...

                                 ABU GAMAL
                        There’s a farmhouse...in Yusifiya.  

           INT. GATOR PIT - DAY

           Tony enters the Gator Pit, where people are already frantic 
           to act on the intel he just extracted.  

           His thoughts elsewhere, Tony crosses to the shredder and hits 
           the power button to turn it on. Letter in hand.   

                                 RIP (O.S.)
                        What are you doing?

           Tony turns to find Rip watching.  

                                 TONY
                        What does it look like I’m doing?  
                        You got your target.

           As Tony is about to feed the letter into the shredder...

           Rip grabs Tony’s arm. Uneasy that Tony is violating some 
           elemental law of humanity.

                                 RIP
                        You swore on your life to deliver 
                        that letter.
                                 TONY
                        Yeah, well, fuck him. I never heard 
                        an apology for killing those kids.

           Rip calls Tony out on his hypocrisy, sensing him being sucked 
           down the dark spiral.

                                 RIP
                        So this is revenge?

                                 TONY
                        I seem to remember you telling me 
                        something about some “Warrior 
                        Code”.  

           Tony feeds the letter through the shredder.

                                 TONY (CONT'D)
                        This is my version.

           Rip watches Tony depart as the shreds of the letter cascade 
           into the bottom of the waste basket.

           EXT. HANGAR - NIGHT

           The Little Birds lift off with the Operators attached. As the

                                 TONY
                        I felt like watching some TV. M&Ms?

           Ann senses a new darkness in him. Concerned...

                                 ANN
                        No thanks.

           Ann hesitates, wanting to say something to Tony.

                                 TONY
                        Don’t you want to know what our 
                        intel is used for?
           Ann reluctantly takes a seat beside Tony, as if she is a meat-
           eater about to see a cow butchered for the first time.

           Danner reluctantly agrees, knowing enough to respect 
           fielder’s choice with the ops team.

           EXT. FARMHOUSE - YUSIFIYAH - NIGHT

           The Operators emerge like ghosts from the field. They 
           silently approach.

           Crapshoot and Worm stack up on a window. They peek in using 
           their night vision, spotting two men sleeping on the floor.  
           There are AK47s and extra mags laid out next to them. Boots 
           are unlaced and ready to go. These are trained fighters.

           The men level their silenced rifles through the window. IR 
           laser dots illuminating the enemy heads.

           TWO SIMULTANEOUS THUMPS and the bodies jerk ever so slightly, 
           down for the big sleep.

           Rip climbs through the window silently, one leg at a time, 
           rifle never leaving the ready -

           INT. FARMHOUSE - YUSIFIYAH - NIGHT

           The Operators move silently through the building in a complex 
           improvised ballet. Every man knows exactly where to move, 
           never crossing fields of fire.

           Rip passes a bedroom where a husband and wife sleep in bed.  
           On his night vision, he can see two operators standing on 
           either side of the bed. The husband sits up in bed, looking 
           around. With his naked eyes in the pitch black, the husband 
           has no idea he is staring down the barrel of an assault 
           rifle.

           The operators seize the husband and wife violently - without 
           a sound - and ziptie them.

           Rip flies through with Crapshoot in tow.

           FLASHLIGHTS wave at the soldiers, blinding them as PISTOLS 
           CRACK in their direction.
           The scene is total chaos (or at least seems to be from the 
           audience perspective) as Rip and Crapshoot trade fire with 
           the enemies. 

           Then the flashlights drop.

           RIP’S POV: Crapshoot rips off his broken NV goggles.  

                                 CRAPSHOOT
                        Fuck! They shot my nods.

           Rip flips on a light-switch and pulls off his nods as well.  
           And just when it seems the house is secure, Rip double-takes 
           at the sight of the dead suicide bombers wearing their 
           vests...

                                 RIP
                        Shit, we only got two crows.
                             (keying his radio)
                        This is Zulu 1-1, we still have a 
                        bomber on the loose. I say again, 
                        we still have one crow unaccounted 
                        for.

                                 CRAPSHOOT
                        No one’s left the house.

           Situational awareness kicking in, the men raise their rifles, 
           searching for the missing bomber. Crapshoot approaches a 
           closet...

           ANGLE ON the floor. A trap door beneath a rug creaks open 
           ever so slightly.  

           POV from under the trap door -- Crapshoot tosses open the 
           closet.

           ON RIP - looking in the empty closet. A sixth sense kicking 
           in...Rip doesn’t have to look back to know...

                                 RIP 
                        Landslide! Landslide!

           And then Rip experiences a phenomenon known as ‘time 
           dilation’, seconds turning into minutes as the adrenaline 
           floods his veins. Behind him...

           ...the trap door flies open...

           ...and the SUICIDE BOMBER emerges.

                                 SUICIDE BOMBER
                        Allah Akbar!
           As the suicide bomber reaches for his detonator, Rip spins 
           and trains his rifle on the man...pulling the trigger...

           ...clipping the bomber in the shoulder. The bomber spins 
           and...

           ...BOOM! The fireball expands outward, impossibly slow as it 
           consumes Rip and Crapshoot...

           Tony lunges upright in his chair at the images of tiny IR

           RIP’S POV - time dilated, vision blurry, ear-drums blown out.  
           The room is now black, illuminated only by flaming debris.  

           Concrete cascades from the collapsed ceiling like balloons.

           As Rip struggles to focus, he rises to a seated position and 
           discovers the suicide bomber's HEAD lying in his lap.

           With limited motor-functions, he tosses it aside.

           Rip gets his bearings, his hearing returning. He sees 
           Crapshoot’s body, buried in concrete, twisted in a grotesque 
           position. 

           Rip sees a blurry pair of legs enter the room. Coming into 
           focus, we see they protrude from a dishdasha...not friendly.

           Rip spots his assault rifle lying nearby and reaches for it, 
           but his leg is trapped under a rock and he can't move.
           As the Figure bends down and picks up Rip's rifle, he comes 
           into a focus...

           A TEN-YEAR-OLD IRAQI BOY, face covered in soot.

           Rip pulls his Glock from his vest, leveling it at the boy.

           He struggles, but can't bring himself to pull the trigger.  
           The fight slips from his body.

           And just when it seems the Iraqi boy will execute Rip with 
           his own rifle...

           ...WHACK. Worm snatches the rifle out of the kid's hands.

           Rip collapses, Glock slipping from his bloody fingers. 

                                 WORM

                        could save.

                        gonna have Mack take a run at him.

           Tony considers, but it's not really a choice. He knows what 
           Mack will do to the kid. Between a rock and a hard place-

                                 TONY
                        Come back in an hour.

           As Randy turns to leave, Tony stops him, concerned...

                        Second degree burns and a pretty 
                        bad concussion. Best thing we can 
                        do now is make it worth it.  

           Tony considers. Randy softens, knowing Tony needs some tough 
           medicine.

                                 RANDY (CONT’D)

                        Yeah. Never better.

           Tony enters the room...

           INT. INTERROGATION BOOTH - DAY

           Tony slides into the interrogation on autopilot. His mouth 
           moving, though his heart is clearly pained by this.

                                 TONY
                             (faking sympathy)
                        Tell me about it.

           Naji betrays the slightest vulnerability for the first time, 
           nervous to ask the next question.

                                 NAJI

                        Infidels cannot touch my mother. 
                        She'd rather die.

           Tony clears his throat, continuing to lie.

                        We have Iraqi doctors helping her.

                        My father was training me to be 
                        like uncle Zarqawi.

           Masking his surprise at the revelation...

                                 TONY
                        You've met the Sheikh?

                                 NAJI
                        He kissed my cheek and called me 
                        brave.

                                 TONY
                        No way.  

                                 NAJI
                        Yes!

                                 TONY
                        The Sheikh, Zarqawi, said this to 
                        you? He called you brave?

                                 NAJI
                        It's true.

           Tony leans back in his chair, studying Naji. He can see the 
           opening, but is still unsure about manipulating a ten-year-
           old who just lost his parents. Still, he presses...

                                 TONY
                        So this uncle Zarqawi...you must 
                        make him proud. He only speaks with 
                        men of great stature.
                                 NAJI
                        One day I will be just like him and 
                        kill many infidels.

                                 TONY
                        How will you do that?

                                 NAJI
                        My father trained me. He introduced 
                        me to many mujahideen.

           Seizing the opportunity to prey on his ego, Tony twists the 
           knife-

                                 TONY
                        They would never take a little boy 
                        to such meetings. You are a liar, 
                        Naji. 

                                 NAJI
                        I am not! My father brought me to 
                        many meetings.

           The path now completely open, Tony goes for the kill.

                                 TONY
                        Prove it. Where were these 
                        meetings?

                                 NAJI
                        At our warehouse.

                                 TONY
                        I don't believe you. And I don’t 
                        even believe this warehouse exists.

                                 NAJI
                        It does!

                                 TONY
                        Liar. Where?

           Naji, eager to defend his own little ego-

                                 NAJI
                        I’m not a liar! From the mosque you 
                        go straight past the old souq, then 
                        you'll see a road. You take that.

                                 TONY
                        How do I know it's your warehouse 
                        and not someone else's?
                                 NAJI
                        Our’s has a grain silo. We're the 
                        only family who has one. Because 
                        we're friends of the Sheikh! I make 
                        him proud!

           Tony, eyes filled with pity, stares at Naji. Having achieved 
           his objective, he's now awash in guilt.

                                 TONY
                        I'm sure you do, Naji. I'm sure you 
                        do...

           Off Naji, beaming with pride-

           INT. HALLWAY - DAY

           Tony emerges from the booth, shuts the door and softly places 
           his head against the door, wrestling with what he just did.

           Randy approaches.

                                 TONY
                        Find his next of kin and get him 
                        out of this facility.

                                 RANDY
                        Check your tone, Major.

           Tony hands Randy a MAP with a red circle on it.

                                 TONY
                        I got what you wanted.  

           As Randy studies the map.

                                 RANDY
                        What is it?

                                 TONY
                        Someone else to kill. Consider it 
                        my resignation.

                                 RANDY
                        Excuse me?

                                 TONY
                        This elite unit is all volunteer, 
                        right?  Well, I’m un-volunteering.

           Tony turns his back on Randy and begins to walk away. Randy 
           calls after.
                                 RANDY
                        On what grounds?

           Tony gives him the middle finger.

                                 TONY
                        Conscientious objector.

           EXT. TARMAC - DAY

           The Delta Operators from Rip’s team stand in silence in faded 
           jeans and t-shirts as Crapshoot’s flag-drapped coffin is 
           loaded into the back of a C-130 by UNIFORMED ARMY SOLDIERS.

           INT. MEDICAL FACILITY - DAY

           Rip lies unconscious, bandaged and hooked up to monitoring 
           equipment. Stormy sets a CD player on the bedside table and 
           loads a Black Mountain album. He presses play and “Set Us 
           Free” begins to play as...

           Pope and Stormy carefully place Rip’s personal mementos 
           around the room - PHOTOS of Rip and his wife at his 
           graduation from Ranger School, Rip’s teenage son playing 
           football...

           INT. TRAILER - DAY

           Tony packs up all of his belongings - not much. A glass of 
           water sits on his desk, its surface rippling from the 
           vibrations of an incoming MORTAR.

           Tony pulls out his desk drawers and empties them directly 
           into the trash.

           Tony spots something in the trash. He stoops down to pick 
           up...the photo of the girl who was burned. A memento of 
           unfinished business. Tony’s heart aches as he places the 
           photo in his breast pocket, thinking of all the other kids he 
           won’t be saving. 

           EXT. STREET - DAY

           SUPER: SAMARRA, IRAQ  

           A sedan ambles through the busy city street.  
           INT. SEDAN - DAY

           Inside, FIVE IRAQIS ride in silence.  

           Blocking the road ahead, they spot a truck with the hood 
           open, smoking. An Iraqi man fans away the smoke.  

           The driver, ABU BAYDA, turns back.

                                 DRIVER
                        Do you want me to go around?

           In the middle back is ABU HAYDAR - built like a statue, with 
           eyes like a cobra.

                                 ABU HAYDAR
                        No, we don’t need any unnecessary 
                        attention.

           The sedan rolls to a stop by the truck. Upon closer 
           inspection, we realize the Iraqi man fanning away the smoke 
           is...one of the Delta Operators, POPE.

           No sooner does the sedan stop than...the windows explode 
           inward as the barrels of the Ops Team’s rifles break and rake 
           the glass.

                                 OPERATOR 1
                        Out of the fucking car! 

                                 OPERATOR 2
                        Hands up!

           The men comply as they are dragged out and laid on the 
           ground. Knees digging into their backs as they are cuffed.

           SUPER: Detainees #0877-0881 A.K.A. ‘THE GROUP OF FIVE’

           In a SERIES OF QUICK SHOTS, we see the brutal efficiency of 
           the Ops Team as they drag away their captives and search 
           every inch of the car...glove box...under mats...ripping off 
           side panels...slicing open seats...

           One of the operators, Stormy, digs his knife into the fabric 
           of the roof and rips it open, revealing...

           ...A HIDDEN ENVELOPE.

           Stormy tears open the envelope and unfolds the letter inside.  
           His eyes saucer. Jackpot.

                                 STORMY
                        Oh shit...
           INT. BALAD AIR BASE - DAY

           Tony sits alone in the terminal, thumbing through a copy of 
           the Lonely Planet guide to the Maldives.

           Ann takes a seat beside him in her uniform, sitting in 
           silence for a moment.

           book as he quotes Lewis Carroll.

           Tony puts down his book, annoyed.

                        about the warehouse. The ops team 
                        intercepted a vehicle leaving it.   

           Tony is caught up in the futility of the operation...

           launches in the second Tony opens the door...
                                 ABU BAYDA
                        I already told the other--

           Tony cuts him off, assertive. A man on a mission.

                                 TONY
                        Shut the fuck up. I don’t have much 
                        time and neither do you, so listen 
                        close to every word I say. I know 
                        there were five of you in the car, 
                        and I know that you all say the man 
                        in the front seat was the big boss. 
                        I also know enough about your 
                        customs to know the senior member 
                        of the group was one of the three 
                        in back. The question is which?

                                 ABU BAYDA
                        I know nothing of-

                                 TONY
                        I’m not finished. I also know you 
                        have a son. 

           Tony SLAPS the photo down on Abu Bayda's thigh.

           CLOSE ON THE PHOTO: A MUGSHOT of Abu Bayda's SON (Bayda, 19, 
           spitting image of his father).

           One look at the photo and Abu Bayda turns white as a ghost.

                                 ABU BAYDA
                        Where did you-

                                 TONY
                        He was arrested last week and is 
                        being held by the Ministry of 
                        Interior. I’m surprised he’s lasted 
                        this long. Shi'a run prisons aren't 
                        exactly known for hospitality. 
                        Especially for the sons of Al Qaeda 
                        leaders. He’ll be lucky if he 
                        survives another day.

                                 ABU BAYDA
                        What do you want?

                                 TONY
                        I told you what I want. I want to 
                        know who was the head motherfucker 
                        in your car. Do we have a deal?
                                 ABU BAYDA
                        I touch my son’s face. Then we 
                        speak.  

           INT. GATOR PIT - DAY

           Randy shakes his head as Tony implores him for help.  

                                 RANDY
                        No fucking way!  

                                 TONY
                        What happened to ends justifying 
                        means? We are holding Zarqawi’s 
                        right hand man, and my detainee is 
                        willing to tell us which one it is.  

                                 RANDY
                        And what makes you think I have the 
                        power to get some Sunni kid out of 
                        the Ministry of Interior?

                                 TONY
                        Then I’ll talk to Colonel Danner.

                                 RANDY
                        I don’t care if you call Donald 
                        Fucking Rumsfeld. The Iraqis deal 
                        with their own trash and we do not 
                        interfere. Now stop telling me how 
                        to do my fucking job and start 
                        doing yours.

           INT. MEDICAL FACILITY - DAY

           Rip rolls in bed, bleary eyes falling on Worm sitting beside 
           him. Worm looks healthy, but strangely agitated.

                        certain parts of the brain.

                        I’m done, bro.

           Rip doesn’t know what to say...

                        Shit, I don’t even know how to go 
                        home anymore. It’s like there’s 
                        this switch on the back of your 
                        head that you have to turn on and 
                        off when you go home. Last time I 
                        went back, it was like the switch 
                        was broken. All I could think about 
                        was coming back here.

                        You can only burn it down so far 
                        before this place...it changes you. 

           Worm rises to leave. Rip can see his friend is unmoored and 
           adrift. Doesn’t want Worm to become another statistic.

                                 RIP
                        Anything you need. Don’t ever 
                        hesitate. You hear me?

           Worm turns back in the doorway.

                                 WORM
                        Just find the Sheikh and put a 
                        fucking bullet between his eyes.

           Rip can’t help but smile.
           INT. GATOR PIT - DAY

           Tony stands impatiently over the printer waiting on a 
           document. He glances over at his laptop which plays the 
           multiple simultaneous interrogations of the Group of Five.  
           All leading to nothing if Tony can’t deliver Abu Bayda’s son.

           Ann walks by...

                                 TONY
                        Hey, you mind covering the rest of 
                        dayshift? I got an errand to run.

           Ann looks down at the printer tray as a letter spits out.

           Tony grabs it off the printer, unsuccessful in his attempt to 
           hide it.

                                 ANN
                        What the hell--

                                 TONY
                        ...is the thing you never saw?

           Tony folds the letter and puts it in his pocket. His eyes 
           willing her not to rat him out.

                                 ANN
                        Tony--

                        You roped me back in because you 
                        know one of these detainees may be 
                        the link to Zarqawi. We’ve never 
                        had a lead remotely close to this.

                        I know what I'm doing. Just running 
                        out of time to make it happen.

           Ann nods towards the corner, where Mack rises from his desk, 
           preparing to head in for another round on the detainees..

                                 ANN
                        Just don't let Six Figures over 
                        there get wind of this.  

           Tony looks over at Mack, eyes falling on a bottle of Jameson 
           on Mack’s desk.

           Worm packs up his gear, placing his handycam in his duffel.  
           A KNOCK at the door.

           Worm turns to see Tony in the doorway.

                                 WORM
                        What do you need, Haji Whisperer?

                        He’s still at medical.

                        What’s this?  

           Tony studies Rip’s link analysis chart on the wall. More than 
           half the faces have red X’s.

                        Bit different from the one in the

                        That’s Rip’s personal shitlist.  

           Tony pulls down the single sheet with the question mark 
           between Zarqawi and his lieutenants. Off the question mark...

           Tony enters Rip’s room.

                                 TONY
                        Because it has to be off books. And 
                        I know you have a tendency to view 
                        the rules as suggestions.

           Rip casts Tony a look...then pulls the cords from his veins.

           Tony sprints over to a Little Bird, lugging his gear. Rip is 
           already clipped in. Rip notices a paper bag in Tony’s hand.

                        down south...we take him.

           EXT. PRISON ENTRANCE - BASRA - DAY

           SUPER: BASRA, IRAQ - MINISTRY OF INTERIOR PRISON

           Dark and medieval, Saddam's former torture chamber makes 
           Rikers look like Cinderella's Castle. It's the last place on 
           earth two American soldiers would want to be trapped.
           As three very suspicious IRAQI GUARDS open the gates to hell, 
           we follow Rip and Tony inside...

           INT. PRISON - BASRA - DAY

           Sitting rigidly behind his desk is Iraqi Police COLONEL 
           MOHAMMED BADRI (40s, severe face, thick Saddam-era mustache 
           means he might very well still be a Loyalist). The guards 
           post themselves auspiciously at the door, blocking Tony and 
           Rip’s exit. Tony hands over the (forged) letter.

                                 TONY
                        We have a request for a transfer. 
                        It's time-sensitive.

           Badri inspects the letter.

                                 BADRI
                        Of what importance is this man to 
                        you?

           Tony falters--

                                 RIP
                        That’s classified.

                                 BADRI
                        Which terrorist?

                                 TONY
                        It's all there in the letter--

           Badri isn’t sold...

                                 BADRI
                        All transfer requests have to come 
                        from your Coalition Headquarters.

                                 TONY
                        We'll only need the prisoner for a 
                        day or two. And for your trouble...

           Tony pulls out Mack’s bottle of Jameson.

                                 TONY (CONT’D)
                        ...a gesture of our gratitude.

                                 BADRI
                        Alcohol is forbidden in Iraq.

           Seeing what appears to be a miscalculation, Rip chastises 
           Tony under his breath.
                                 RIP
                        Nice move, slick.

           Tony ignores Rip. Addresses Badri--

                                 TONY
                        Sorry, I didn't mean to offend. 
                        Just thought -

                                 BADRI
                        - I'll have to confiscate that.

           Understanding the subtext...

                                 TONY
                        Of course.

           Tony hands Badri the bottle and the Iraqi drops it into the 
           bottom drawer of his desk. Shutting the drawer.  

                                 BADRI
                        Next time go through proper 
                        channels.
                             (to the Guards)
                        Show these men to the prisoner.

           The Guards salute sharply.

           Tony trades a nod with Rip - refusing the bottle was just 
           theater.

           INT. CELLBLOCK - DAY

           Rip and Tony are led by the Guards through a corridor of 
           moldy, blood-stained walls and floors. Marilyn Manson 
           freakshow territory.

           Inside the cells, PRISONERS have been beaten to within inches 
           of their lives. SCREAMS echo through the corridors.

                                 TONY
                        This place makes Abu Ghraib look 
                        like Magic Mountain.

                                 RIP
                        Reminds me of Ranger School.

           A PRISONER reaches through the bars and grabs Tony's leg.

                                 PRISONER
                        Please, help me! American! 
                        Please...
           Tony pulls his leg away, ignoring the man's pleas.

           They arrive at a cell where the Guards unlock the door 
           revealing...BAYDA (19, Iraqi). The fresh-faced teen looks out 
           of place in his euro designer clothes.

                                 TONY
                        Bayda?

           Bayda looks at Tony. He's emaciated, but exceptionally polite 
           considering the circumstances.

                                 BAYDA
                        What do you want?

                                 TONY
                        We've come to take you to our 
                        prison for questioning.

           Bayda backs away.

                                 BAYDA
                        My father has told me what you 
                        Americans do to Muslims.

                                 TONY
                        Your father loves you very much. He 
                        wants to protect you.

                                 BAYDA
                        You spoke with him?

                                 TONY
                        This morning. He wants to see you.

           Bayda considers, then recoils.

                                 BAYDA
                        You lie. I'd rather be beaten by 
                        Iraqis than humiliated by infidels.

           Rip runs out of patience.

                                 RIP
                        Enough talky talk. Time for the 
                        humiliation.

           Rip steps into the cell and Bayda tries to resist. Bad idea.

           Rip puts him in a quick wrist lock, head to the floor.

                                 RIP (CONT’D)
                        We can do this the easy or my way. 
                        Your choice.
           Tony kneels down next to Bayda.

                                 TONY
                        Look - you're not going to last one 
                        day in here as soon as they find 
                        out your father is a high-ranking 
                        Al Qaeda leader.

                                 BAYDA
                        They don't know who my father is.

           Tony turns and looks at the Guards, whose faces suddenly show 
           deep concern about what is happening.

                                 TONY
                        They do now.

           Rip pulls Bayda to his feet, zipties him, and marches him out 
           of the cell. Tony then takes him by the collar and moves him 
           along.

           As they start down the corridor, one of the Guards turns to 
           the other...

                                 GUARD #1
                             (Arabic, subtitled)
                        Something is not right.

                                 GUARD #2
                        I'll call the Colonel.

           Guard #2 raises his radio.

           Rip reads the concern on Tony’s face.

                                 RIP
                        What are they saying?

                                 TONY
                        We’re burned.

           Rip seizes the radio from the guard.

           The guard SHOUTS at Rip.

                                 RIP
                             (to Tony)
                        Tell him we don’t want any 
                        problems. We just want the kid.

           Tony TRANSLATES.

           The guards trade a look. Their eyes tell us they are about to 
           make a bad choice. One of them reaches for his baton and...
           ...Rip delivers an elbow to his face, crumpling him to the 
           floor.

           A second guard fumbles for his pistol. As he draws, Rip 
           delivers a quick series of body blows before judo tossing him 
           to the ground.   

           Rip spins the weapon on the third guard, who raises his hands 
           in surrender. As Rip backs away.

                                 RIP (CONT’D)
                             (to Tony)
                        Move.

           Tony grabs Bayda.

                                 TONY
                        If you want to live, come with us.

           EXT. PRISON - DAY

           Tony and Rip stuff Bayda in the Little Bird as...

           ...guards rush out of the prison in pursuit.

                                 RIP
                             (to Pilot)
                        Get us in the air!

           As Tony and Rip clip in...

                                 TONY
                        What the hell was that back there?

                                 RIP
                        We call that a habeus thumpus.

                                                                CUT TO:

           INT. BOOTH - DAY

           Tony places a hooded figure in the seat in front of Abu 
           Bayda. He pulls the hood off, revealing his son, Bayda.

           Abu Bayda takes one look at his son and melts, falling to his 
           knees and throwing his arms around him. He runs his fingers 
           over the boy’s face in disbelief as his eyes well with tears.

                                 TONY
                        We had a deal. Who was delivering 
                        the letter to Zarqawi?
           Abu Bayda meets eyes with Tony, his gratitude evident.

           INT. HOLLYWOOD ROOM - DAY

           Tony, Ann, and Mike watch tapes of Mack interrogating the 
           leader of the group, ABU HAYDAR (the imposing Iraqi from the 
           back seat).

           ON SCREEN: Though we can’t make out what Mack is saying, his 
           body language tells us everything. Mack’s broad shoulders 
           lean over the table as he pounds his fists.

                                 MIKE
                        What the hell is Mack doing? He’s 
                        been hollering at this guy for 
                        hours.

                                 TONY

                                 MIKE
                        I don’t remember that approach in 
                        the playbook.

                                 TONY
                        It’s in a different playbook. Army 
                        field manual.

                                 MIKE
                        Does it work?

                                 TONY
                        On some shit-scared kid...maybe.  
                        But not on someone with counter-
                        interrogation training. A guy like 
                        this - you need to make him think 
                        he is helping himself by helping 
                        you. And to do that, we need to get 
                        inside his head.  

           Ann shakes her head, frustrated as she studies Abu Haydar.

                                 ANN
                        This guy’s the fucking sphinx.  

           Tony looks at the monitor, wondering what they are missing.

                                 TONY
                        Forget pressure points, forget 
                        trying to pull keywords or gestures 
                        that betray his deepest desires.  
                        Just look at the detainee. Tell me 
                        what you see.
                                 MIKE
                        He’s like you.

                                 ANN
                        More like Hannibal Lecter. Look at 
                        him. The dude has the dead eyes of 
                        a snake. 

           Tony turns to Mike, not wanting to lose the thread.

                                 TONY
                        Mike, finish the thought. How is he 
                        like me?

                                 MIKE
                        Intelligent, confident...

           Mike trails off, not wanting to offend.

                                 TONY
                        Keep going.

                        to know he’s the smartest guy in 
                        the room.

           Tony betrays the faintest smile. Way to go, Mike.

                                 TONY
                        And who does that?

           Ann’s lightbulb goes off, catching up.

                                 ANN
                        A ‘grand egoist’.

           Tony realizes he has found what makes the man tick...

                                 TONY
                        I need to talk to him myself.

           ...and now it’s time to make him talk. Tony rises to depart.

           Mike checks his watch.  

                                 MIKE
                        Haydar’s getting transferred in 
                        fifteen minutes. Colonel’s order. 
                        Even if Randy approved it, which he 
                        won’t, there’s no way you are going 
                        to have enough time to interrogate 
                        him.
                                 TONY
                        Then we need to make more time.

           EXT. TARMAC - DAWN

           The first signs of daylight are emerging at the edge of the 
           big desert sky. Looking like an Arab Hannibal Lecter, Abu 
           Haydar and the rest of the Group of Five are led across the 
           tarmac by guards towards the open ramp of a C-130.

           Tony pulls up in a Humvee and leaps out, intercepting the 
           guards.

           He holds out a letter.

                                 TONY
                        New orders. One of the detainees is 
                        needed for follow-up. 

           Tony meets eyes with Abu Haydar, who senses this is not some 
           routine red tape.

                                 GUARD
                        But he’s due at Abu Ghraib..?

                                 TONY
                        He got switched to the eleven-
                        hundred flight. He’s due at the 
                        gator pit five minutes ago.

           The guard studies the orders, curious.

                                 TONY (CONT’D)
                        You got a problem with this, go 
                        wake up Colonel Danner.

           The guard folds, unwilling to call Tony’s bluff.

           INT. INTERROGATION BOOTH - DAY

           CLOSE ON Abu Haydar in the plastic chair.  

           Opposite him is...

                                 TONY
                        Asalama alaykum.

           OUTSIDE THE BOOTH

           The guard locks the padlock, leaving the key in it (since it 
           is not accessible from the inside).
           BACK INSIDE THE BOOTH

                                 ABU HAYDAR
                        We haven’t met.

           Tony signals to the camera. 

                                 TONY
                        But I've been watching. I have a 
                        question for you.

           Tony pulls out his personal copy of the Qur’an.

                                 TONY (CONT’D)
                        I’ve read this a few times, but 
                        there is something I still don’t 
                        understand. A riddle that no Muslim 
                        has been able to answer.

           Abu Haydar shifts, every so slightly betraying his interest.

                                 TONY (CONT'D)
                        I know the Qur’an is Allah’s word, 
                        but if it was written by man, isn’t 
                        it possible there are mistakes? 

           Abu Haydar considers the question, which would border on 
           blasphemy were it not the genuine curiosity in Tony’s voice.

                                 ABU HAYDAR
                        If there are mistakes, Allah would 
                        have intended them.

                                 TONY
                        You are a very wise man.

                                 ABU HAYDAR
                        You are not like the others. You’re 
                        Army?

                                 TONY
                        No.

           Abu Haydar studies Tony.

                                 ABU HAYDAR
                        Then who?

                                 TONY
                        I think you already know the answer 
                        to that question. 

                                 ABU HAYDAR
                        CIA.
           A smile creeps across Tony’s face, pleased with the answer.

                                 TONY
                        Yes.

           INT. HOLLYWOOD ROOM - SAME TIME

           Ann and Mike watch the interrogation on the monitors.

                                 ANN
                        Jesus fuck. He’s impersonating a 
                        CIA officer. He could get locked up 
                        in Leavenworth for that. Is he out 
                        of his fucking mind?

           Ann looks over to see Mike pulling the wires out of the 
           monitors and VCRs.

                                 ANN (CONT’D)
                        Mike?

                                 MIKE
                        He needs all the time he can get.

           INT. HALLWAY - DAY

           Mike approaches the booth where Tony is interrogating Abu 
           Haydar. The guard intercepts him as Mike tries to peep 
           through the hole.

                                 GUARD
                        Can I help you?

                                 MIKE
                        Thought my detainee was in there.  
                        Wrong cell.

           CLOSE ON Mike’s hand, as he breaks off the key in the 
           padlock, the guard none the wiser--

           INT. INTERROGATION BOOTH - DAY

           Abu Haydar turns to Tony.

                                 ABU HAYDAR
                        You did not come here to discuss 
                        religion.
                                 TONY
                        No, I didn’t. I came here because I 
                        run a program, one I believe you 
                        would be very interested in.

           Tony unrolls a map of the greater Middle East on the table.

                                 TONY (CONT’D)
                        Tell me what you see here.

                                 ABU HAYDAR
                        America has invaded Afghanistan and 
                        Iraq.

                                 TONY
                        And do you believe they were the 
                        real prize? Or part of a larger 
                        plan?

           Abu Haydar looks at the map, spotting the country directly in 
           the middle.

                                 ABU HAYDAR
                        You are planning to invade Iran... 
                        you’ve flanked them on both sides.

           INT. GATOR PIT - DAY

           Randy enters the gator pit, where Ann and Mike sit 
           inconspicuously at their desks.

           As Randy settles in for the day, he addresses a junior 
           staffer. Randy doesn’t pay much mind to the fact that the 
           monitors are all blacked out. He wasn’t expecting anyone.

                                 RANDY
                        Place is a ghost town for once.

                                 STAFFER
                        Except for the one in booth three.

           Randy turns, confused. Sees the monitor on booth three is 
           off. He tries to turn it on but it’s disconnected.

                                 RANDY
                        Who’s in booth three?

           The staffer holds up the new transfer orders for Abu Haydar.

                                 STAFFER
                        Abu Haydar - that Air Force guy got 
                        approval to take a whack at him.
           Randy takes the transfer order, studying it in disbelief. He 
           runs his finger over the seal, realizing it’s bullshit. 

                                 RANDY
                        Get the guards!

           Ann and Mike swallow their concern, not wanting to get any 
           more deeply involved than they already are.

           INT. INTERROGATION BOOTH - DAY

           Tony baits the hook for Abu Haydar.

                                 TONY
                        Iran is Shi’a, and I know the only 
                        group you hate more than the 
                        Americans is the Shi’a. When the 
                        great war comes, the Agency will 
                        need all the help we can get 
                        fighting our common enemy. I need 
                        Sunni allies I can trust.

                                 ABU HAYDAR
                        So you're here to recruit me...

                                 TONY
                        I want you to broker a deal that 
                        will shape the future of the Middle 
                        East. I want to partner with 
                        Zarqawi.

                                 ABU HAYDAR
                        I cannot help you.

           EXT. HALLWAY - DAY

           Randy and the guards storm toward the door to the booth.  

                                 RANDY
                        Open that door! I want the detainee 
                        on the first helo out of here...

                                 GUARD
                        And the Major?

                                 RANDY
                        Toss him in a cell where he can 
                        await a court-martial.

           The guard fumbles with the padlock, realizing the key is 
           broken off.
                                 GUARD
                        Someone broke it off.

                                 RANDY
                        Get it open!

           INT. INTERROGATION BOOTH - DAY

           Tony hears the SLAMMING against the door. He doubles down his 
           urgency.

                                 TONY
                        Listen to me, Abu Haydar, because 
                        we don’t have much time. I know you 
                        are someone with wasta - someone 
                        with influence. The men on the 
                        other side of that door are Army, 
                        and they have only one goal - to 
                        find and kill your friend Zarqawi. 
                        And it’s only a matter of time 
                        until they find him. Help me save 
                        his life and build a new Middle 
                        East.   

           Abu Haydar considers. Not sold. Tony pushes hard, desperate. 
           His words rushed.

                                 TONY (CONT’D)
                        This is a one-time offer. When they 
                        come through that door, they are 
                        shipping you off to Abu Ghraib.  
                        Maybe I was wrong. Maybe you don’t 
                        have wasta. But I think you do.

           Abu Haydar considers as the SHOUTING builds outside the 
           booth...

           INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           The guard uses a pair of boltcutters to snip the lock. No 
           sooner does it break off, than the men flood into the room.  

           They dash straight for Tony, tackling him to the ground and 
           cuffing him. Abu Haydar watches in shock as his interrogator 
           becomes a detainee...

           EXT. TARMAC - DAY

           Shackled, Abu Haydar is led onto a helo for transfer. As the 
           helo lifts off...
           ...Abu Haydar takes in the base receding below, mind racing.  
           Uncertain what to make of the man he just met.

           INT. BRIG - DAY

           Tony sits in a cell, locked up.

                        understand the detainees, and I 
                        think my interrogation days are

                        probably be locked up too. But you 
                        let me work my mojo because I get 
                        results. You want to go down as the 
                        motherfucker who found Zarqawi? 
                        Fastest way to do that is to cut 
                        that gator loose and own this.

           flaw in his logic.

                        the gator loose if this intel

           Rip is clearly agonized by the decision. The Operator next to

           The Little Birds land and Rip and the Operators jump off and 
           race towards the smoke-obscured home.

           Impossibly, the IRAQI POLICE have beaten them to the crime 
           scene.

           Rip spots TWO IRAQI POLICEMEN carrying off a MAN on a 
           stretcher. He raises his M4-

                                 RIP
                        Stop!

           Either they don’t hear Rip, or they are ignoring him. 

           Rip runs, fighting through the fog...barely able to make out 
           the stretcher...

           Suddenly the policemen are within arm's reach. Rip LUNGES 
           and....

           ....grabs hold of the stretcher with one hand while shifting 
           his rifle frantically between the two Iraqi policeman.

                                 RIP (CONT’D)
                        Back off!

           The Iraqi policemen lower the stretcher to the ground and 
           raise their hands in the air. Before Rip can look down at the 
           body, the Iraqi police run off.

           Rip looks down to see...

           The MAN on the stretcher (face obscured, hair burnt) GROANS 
           as he attempts to roll off, but Rip grabs him...

                                 RIP (CONT’D)
                        You’re not going anywhere, pal.

           Rip pulls him back on the stretcher, revealing...

           ZARQAWI.
           Pope and Stormy emerge beside Rip. Jaws drop.

                                 POPE
                        Holy fuck...

           EXT. HOUSE - BAQUBA - DAY

           Before Rip can answer, Stormy draws his Glock and hands it to 
           Rip.  

           Rip takes the weapon, poised for his final act of revenge.

           Stormy and Pope turn to Rip. Do the honors, boss.

           Rips stands over Zarqawi, looking down the barrel of his 
           Glock at Black List #1...swollen face...moaning...a worthless 
           piece of meat...a portrait of the banality of evil.

           Rip pauses, then lowers his weapon as his men watch in silent 
           understanding. Their fight is over.

           The bomb blast having already done the damage, Zarqawi coughs 
           up blood and dies. Rip keys his radio.

                        little girl would still be alive.

                                 RIP
                        And so would the Sheikh. You think 
                        you’re the first soldier with 
                        collateral damage on his 
                        conscience?   

                                 TONY
                        Our job was to protect them.

                                 RIP
                        Zarqawi made that choice. Signed 
                        their death certificates the second 
                        he stepped foot in that house.

                                 TONY
                        Do you think they would have made 
                        it if you’d raided the house?

                                 RIP
                        You mean if we’d risked letting him 
                        go? That wouldn’t have been the 
                        smart call. Quit thinking about 
                        Zarqawi’s family and think about 
                        all the other families who get to 
                        live tonight because that bastard’s 
                        dead. 

                                 TONY
                        And who gets to decide who dies so 
                        that others can live?

                                 RIP
                        We do, brother. It’s what we 
                        volunteered for.  

           Rip gazes out at the dessert.

                                 RIP (CONT’D)
                        Some men find themselves in war. 
                        Others lose themselves in it. 

                                 TONY
                        How about you?
           A beat as Rip takes inventory of his life.

                                 RIP
                        Both.

           Tony realizes he isn’t the only one grappling with the toll 
           of war.

                                 TONY
                        You headin’ home?

                                 RIP
                        End of the month. Gonna be busy 
                        until then. We recovered a laptop 
                        at Zarqawi’s house. They've already 
                        worked up twelve new targets we’re 
                        hittin’ tonight.

           Tony returns to staring out into the desert. Rip considers 
           their station in life. As much directed at himself as Tony--

                                 RIP (CONT’D)
                        We save as many as we can. 

           Rip’s words seem to offer some path through the darkness. 
           Tony nods, a hint of renewed purpose in his eyes.

           A chinook touches down on the tarmac.

                                 TONY
                        That’s my ride.

           Tony rises and the two men stand before each other for the 
           last time. An awkward beat.

                                 RIP
                        Been a while since I saluted 
                        anyone.

                                 TONY
                        No reason to start now.

           Tony extends his hand. Rip shakes it. 

           As Tony lugs his bag and crosses the tarmac toward the 
           Chinook...

           SUPER: "Tony spent his last thirty days in northern Iraq on a 
           raid team conducting battlefield interrogations, leading to 
           the capture of another high-ranking Al Qaeda leader."

           Tony disappears inside the helo.
           SUPER: “Rip returned home and started a foundation to prevent 
           veteran suicide, which is currently the greatest threat to 
           American armed service members. In his free time, he is an 
           assistant coach on the local football team.”

           As Tony’s Chinook lifts into the sky, we hold on Rip...

           SUPER: "This was the last tour either man would ever do."

           And as Rip turns away, we are left on an empty tarmac...

           SUPER: "The network Zarqawi founded regrouped and rebranded 
           under a new name...The Islamic State. In 2014, the Islamic 
           State marched into Mosul and declared a Caliphate. They are 
           still fighting to achieve Zarqawi’s dream.”

                                                              FADE OUT.
