           MORNING

           A succession of images along small, winding roads under a 
           grey Pennsylvania sky.

           * The horse farms and flea market off Aquetong Road.

           * The twinkling Delaware River visible through the dark trees 
           that line River Road.

           * Half-crumbled stone houses, overgrown and mostly hidden 
           from Stony Hill Road.

           * The flat jut of Bowman’s Tower barely clearing the tree 
           line into the low cloud cover.

           EXT. KERMIT ST. LUCY’S PENNSYLVANIA COTTAGE - CONTINUOUS

           A comely if small stone cottage nestled at the end of a short 
           driveway and framed by giant oak trees. Squirrels kiss the 
           moist ground with stuttered speed then disappear into oaks.

           INT. KERMIT ST. LUCY’S PENNSYLVANIA COTTAGE

           KERMIT ST. LUCY (35yrs old) is unremarkable in every way save 
           that he always wears a black jeff cap, an untucked white 
           button-down shirt, and a thin black tie that is an emergency 
           state of uncleanliness.  

           It is a tiny cottage. Two bedrooms. Small kitchen. A 
           bookshelf upon which are several books with “Kermit St. Lucy” 
           printed on the spine.
           At the table are two children, MILLICENT (6yrs old) and 
           SEBASTIAN (12yrs old.) They eat an odd breakfast of pop-
           tarts, eggs, bacon, and grape soda.

           Both children are very fair skinned; nearly white. Millicent 
           has a mass of shoulder-length red hair that curls wetly 
           inward, Sebastian a brown bowl-cut with deep set eyes.

                                 KERMIT
                        Is this okay?

           Millicent holds up two different kinds of pop-tarts.

                                 MILLICENT
                        There are so many kinds of pop 
                        tart. It’s making me crazy!

                                 KERMIT
                        In a good way?

                                 MILLICENT
                        In a very good way!

                                 KERMIT
                        Sebastian?

                                 SEBASTIAN
                             (finishing up)
                        Yeah. It’s fine.

           Kermit takes a deep breath, a tiny bite of toast, and a sip 
           of soda.

                                 SEBASTIAN (CONT’D)
                        Gonna be late for the bus. Bye.

           Sebastian gets up and slings his bookbag over his shoulder.

           Kermit calls after.

                                 KERMIT
                        Wait. You need that?

           Kermit points to a notebook on the kitchen counter. 

           Sebastian walks back and grabs it...

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Thanks.

           ...then leaves.

                                 KERMIT
                        You almost finished, Millicent?
                                 MILLICENT
                        You should call me “Millie.” Only 
                        muggles call me “Millicent.”

                                 KERMIT
                        Alright. Alright. You almost 
                        finished, Millie?

                                 MILLICENT
                        All done!

                                 KERMIT
                        Taking the bus today or you want me 
                        to drive?

                                 MILLICENT
                        Could you drive me?

                                 KERMIT
                        Sure thing.

           Millicent picks up her bag and skips to the front door. 
           Kermit follows. They leave.

           A car can be heard pulling away.

           The lighting through the windows changes as TIME PASSES. It 
           grows darker. Rain begins to pitter-pat on the roof and 
           windows. 

           ANGLE ON: A sealed CARDBOARD BOX in the corner of the room 
           marked “Alex’s Things.”

           As we stay fixed on the BOX, a car can be heard returning. A 
           front door opening and closing. Footsteps. And then Kermit’s 
           back is seen sitting on the couch then laying down.

           ANGLE ON: Kermit’s vacant eyes.

           ANGLE ON: The box marked “Alex’s Things.”

           TEXT: Forty Days Ago.

           The sound of typing. A clicking of the tongue. More typing. 
           Then...

                                 KERMIT (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                             (reading aloud)
                        “But that is the underwater 
                        slowtime of seventeen;

                        that absurdly enchanted age where 
                        single Summers could see lifetimes 
                        and permanence was just another 
                        moment to burn through.”

           INT. KERMIT ST. LUCY’S PENNSYLVANIA COTTAGE - NIGHT

           The cottage is different. No trace of children whatsoever. No 
           cardboard box in the corner.

           Kermit’s eyes read over what he just read aloud.

                                 KERMIT
                        I can’t tell if this makes sense or 
                        not. I don’t think it does.
                             (beat)
                        What do you think?

           Kermit directs this question to the fat orange tabby curled 
           up next to the laptop. This is RANMA (Not Long For This World 
           yrs old.)

                                 KERMIT (CONT’D)
                             (in morose cat voice)
                        It sounds okay.
                             (still in cat voice)
                        I’m gonna die of kidney failure.
                             (beat)
                        I’ll just highlight the whole 
                        fucking passage and come back to it 
                        tomorrow.

           Kermit highlights, saves, and his phone rings.

                                 KERMIT (CONT’D)
                        Hullo.

                                 VOICE (O.S.)
                        Are you the shield that guards the 
                        realms of men?

                                 KERMIT
                        Nope. Wrong number. This is the 
                        ambition that is thoroughly 
                        thwarted.

           INT. ALEXANDRA FREEPORT’S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS

           ALEXANDRA FREEPORT (36yrs old) holds her cellphone against 
           her ear as she pours a glass of white wine. Her skin is pale 
           and white, her hair is red and wavy, and an inch from 
           shoulder length.
                                 ALEX
                        Ah, you sound cute. Wrong number or 
                        not, I’m gonna talk to you.
                             (take a sip)
                        So how’s tricks, Kermit?

                        Trying to finish a short story and 
                        talking to my cat.

                                 ALEX
                        And how is that coming along?

                                 KERMIT
                        My grasp of the English language is 
                        deteriorating into high school 
                        journal pastiche. My editor will 
                        either have a fatal stroke or a not 
                        quite fatal stroke that leaves him 
                        paralyzed. And my cat says he’s 
                        going to die of kidney failure.
                             (in cat voice)
                        And I want a Buick. Used.
                             (normal voice)
                        And he wants a used Buick.

                                 ALEX
                        I got my hedgehog a Mercury. What 
                        is it with pets and cheap cars? 
                        Fucking animals.

           Sebastian and Millicent run into the kitchen with officially 
           licensed Harry Potter wizard hats and wands.

                                 MILLICENT
                             (flourishing wand at 
                              Sebastian)
                        Hat-Fly-Officus!

           Sebastian quickly swipes his hat off his head.

                        Trip-On-Sofarius!

           Millicent bounces into the sofa and falls down with dramatic 
           flare.

                                 ALEX
                             (into phone)

                        Foolish mortals! Dare you intrude 
                        upon the lair of her most ineffable 
                        strangeness!?

           Millicent squeals and Sebastian smiles.

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        Away with you to sleepytimes or 
                        else you shall sip from the Goblet 
                        Infernal!!

           The children run upstairs in laughing delight.

           And Kermit smiles warmly with his eyes closed.

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        I’m back.

                                 KERMIT
                        Bravo.

                                 ALEX
                        I’m just glad they’re still playing 
                        together. Six year age difference 
                        and all.

                                 KERMIT
                        You seemed to be into it too.

                                 ALEX
                        Yeah well, I don’t get out much. 
                        Although that’s going to have to 
                        change soon. Haven’t received an 
                        alimony or child support check in 
                        three months.

                                 KERMIT
                        Jesus. Talk to your lawyer?

                                 ALEX
                        Yeah, but nothing much can be done 
                        at the moment. Can’t even pinpoint 
                        where the fucker lives now. There 
                        was some talk about him moving to 
                        St. Croix or Mexico. No way to know 
                        though. His scumbag friends are 
                        surprisingly loyal.
                             (drinks)
                        Still can’t believe I was married 
                        to the cocksucker for thirteen 
                        years.
                                 KERMIT
                        Are you alright? You and the kids?

                                 ALEX
                        For now. I’ve got savings. And I 
                        happen to live on the outskirts of 
                        a neighborhood where every mother 
                        is desperate to have their kid 
                        tutored in fucking everything. So I 
                        can always break glass on the old 
                        Master’s Degree in English Lit. 
                        Everything’ll work out. It always 
                        does.

                                 KERMIT
                        Because if you need any-

                                 ALEX
                        No.

                                 KERMIT
                        I’m just saying. I’m not “loaded 
                        loaded” but I’m, uh, I’m kinda 
                        loaded.

                                 ALEX
                        Not from you.

                        Look, I know I was weird and stalky 
                        after we broke up but that was,

                        Okay. Because I could-

                                 ALEX
                        Oh, just shut up, Kermit!

           And Kermit shuts up sharply. The degree to which he has shut 
           up has startled his cat.

           LONG BEAT

           He sips quietly, a spot in the National Shutting Up 
           Championship assured.
                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        Kermit?

                                 KERMIT
                             (quietly)
                        Yes?

                                 ALEX
                             (cheerful)
                        What are you doing Monday?

                                 KERMIT
                        Uh...nothing.

                                 ALEX
                        You can speak up. I’m not mad at 
                        you. I just needed you to shut the 
                        fuck up for a second. 

                                 KERMIT
                             (louder)
                        Nothing. I am doing nothing on 
                        Monday. 

                                 ALEX
                        Great. It’s a three day weekend for 
                        the kids. We’ll go to lunch. 

                                 KERMIT
                        Uh, with the kids?

                                 ALEX
                        You’ve been back in my life a year 
                        and you haven’t met the kids yet. I 
                        want you to meet the kids.

                                 KERMIT
                        I’m not good with kids. 

                                 ALEX
                             (softly, firmly)
                        Kermit. I really want to see you 
                        Monday. And you need to do this for 
                        me. You need to or...

           She leaves the “or” hanging. Kermit may be one of the few 
           practitioners of literary fiction below the age of fifty but 
           he is not a complete idiot.

                                 KERMIT
                        Okay.

                                 ALEX
                        Yeah?
                                 KERMIT
                        Sure. For all I know I am okay 
                        around kids. Can’t remember the 
                        last time I saw one in the wild 
                        but...yeah. I’m in.

                                 ALEX
                             (sweet, harrowing relief)
                        Thank you, Kermit. I... I really 
                        look forward to it.

                                 KERMIT
                        As do I.

                                 ALEX
                        Okay.

                                 KERMIT
                        Okay.

                                 ALEX
                        Yeah. Well, bye.

                                 KERMIT
                        Goodnight.

           Neither hangs up. This lasts uncomfortably long.

                                 ALEX
                        What are we? Fucking teenagers? 
                        Goodnight.

                                 KERMIT
                        Goodnight.

           Neither one of them hangs up.

           Kermit smiles to himself and at Ranma who is now back to 
           sitting next to the laptop.

                             (in cat voice)

           Sebastian lies in bed playing his Playstation Vita. Alex pops 
           her head in.

           Millicent is curled up underneath the blankets. On a shelf in 
           her room is an aquarium with wood chips and a little bowl of 
           water. This is MISTER HEDGIE (cute yrs old.)

           Alex comes into the room and kneels beside the bed.

                                 ALEX
                        You asleep, woggle-bug?

           Millicent sits up quickly and pulls out a copy of The 
           Marvelous Land Of OZ.

                        late to read to you.

                                 MILLICENT
                        I know. Who were you talking to?

                                 ALEX
                        Kermit.

                                 MILLICENT
                        You weren’t talking to Kermit. He’s 
                        not real.
                                 ALEX
                        Oh, he’s very real. He’s a friend 
                        of mine. His name is just Kermit.

                             (giggling)
                        His mommy named him after Kermit

                        Honey, the name Kermit is reaaaally

                                 MILLICENT

                        She was an odd woman. Militantly 
                        Catholic and obsessed with Muppets.

                        Mumsy? Do you like him?

           Alex leans in close to her daughter.

                                 MILLICENT
                        Okay.

           Alex turns off the light and leaves the room.

           Alex walks downstairs singing Robyn Hitchcock’s “Superman” 
           softly to herself in a pitch-perfect imitation.

           Humming, she goes to the couch in front of the television. 
           She turns over a pillow, pulls a blanket over herself, and 
           lowers the volume to the History Channel.

           EXT. BALE LUXURY APARTMENTS, CITY AVENUE, PHILADELPHIA - 
           MORNING

           These are indeed as advertised: “High-end luxury apartments 
           in the shadow of Center City, Philadelphia.”

           INT. BALE APARTMENTS, APT.#215

           A woman in her early 30s is dressed in a black and gray work 
           dress. Her hair is still a tiny bit damp from the shower. 
           This is CRISPINA ST. LUCY (30yrs old.)

           A sharp KNOCK on the door.

           Crispina quickly opens the door to reveal Kermit.

                                 KERMIT
                        Crispy!

                                 CRISPINA
                        Kermit. What the hell are you doing 
                        here? Are you in trouble? I can’t 
                        help you right now. I’m only going 
                        to be fifteen minutes early for a 
                        client meeting. Shit. What did you 
                        do?

                                 KERMIT
                        That’s a very accusatory “Hi, big 
                        brother.”

           Silence from Crispina.
                                 KERMIT (CONT’D)
                        I’m not in trouble.

                                 CRISPINA
                        Good. Want some coffee?

                                 KERMIT
                        Sure.

                                 CRISPINA
                        It’s over there. Mugs above the 
                        machine. 

           Kermit pours his coffee, looks at the mug then looks at 
           Crispina’s.

           ANGLE ON: Kermit’s mug. “World’s Best Lawyer.”

           ANGLE ON: Crispina’s mug. “World’s Best Author.”

                                 KERMIT
                        Crispina? I think we have each 
                        other’s mug.

                                 CRISPINA
                        Even if we switched it wouldn’t be 
                        true.

                                 KERMIT
                        Point.

                                 CRISPINA
                        So what on earth brings you down 
                        here?

                                 KERMIT
                        Couldn’t sleep. Meeting Alex today 
                        for lunch.

                                 CRISPINA
                             (groaning)
                        Aren’t you two back together yet? 
                        It’s been over a year, right?

                                 KERMIT
                        A little over a year, yeah.

                                 CRISPINA
                        And you’ve been doing your dumbfuck 
                        “take it super slow” plan?

                                 KERMIT
                        It’s not “dumbfuck” it’s...it’s 
                        innocently calculating.
                                 CRISPINA
                        Stick to “dumbfuck.” “Innocently 
                        calculating” makes you sound like a 
                        sociopath. So what? You want 
                        advice? I have to leave in ten 
                        minutes.

                                 KERMIT
                        No. No, I just wanted to tell you. 
                        Didn’t want to tell any of my 
                        friends. Alex is too...”private” 
                        for me.

                                 CRISPINA
                        You don’t have any friends.

                                 KERMIT
                        There’s you.

                                 CRISPINA
                        I’m your sister. There’s a 
                        difference. 

                                 KERMIT
                        All right. Fine. I’m talking to you 
                        then.

                                 CRISPINA
                        Uh-huh. Well, I don’t have advice. 
                        But I do have criticism. You’re my 
                        older brother and yet you act like 
                        a fifteen year old girl on 
                        mandatory lithium injections. 
                        Kermit? Just tell her. You’ve been 
                        in love with her since I was a 
                        little girl. You never stopped 
                        being in love with her. Tell her 
                        that and get on with your life. 
                        Hell, you probably don’t have to 
                        tell her at all. You must glow like 
                        a motherfucker when you’re with 
                        her. Shit, you’re glowing now.

                                 KERMIT
                        I am?

                                 CRISPINA
                        Yeah. It’s disgusting.

                                 KERMIT
                        How are you, Cripsy?
                                 CRISPINA
                        Kermit. Absolutely nothing has 
                        happened to me since I last spoke 
                        with you. Not even a food or drink 
                        I never had before. Nothing. You 
                        should be happy. You at least have 
                        things going on in your life.

                                 KERMIT
                        I think I am happy. I hate that 
                        word. Well, not hate it but the 
                        immensity of my mistrust is 
                        staggering.

                                 CRISPINA
                        I don’t even hate new things. Look, 
                        I’m running late. I run any later 
                        I’m going to be on time for the 
                        meeting.

                                 KERMIT
                        Which is late for you.

                                 CRISPINA
                        Which is late for me.

           Crispina gives Kermit a hug.

                                 CRISPINA (CONT’D)
                        Good luck. Gimme a call when you 
                        two stop being idiots and are back 
                        together. We’ll all hang out.

                                 KERMIT
                        Alright. Love you. Good luck on 
                        your meeting.

           Kermit follows Crispina out the door.

                                 CRISPINA
                        Don’t need luck. I know exactly 
                        what’s going to happen. You don’t 
                        need luck for that. I live a life 
                        of stasis, Kermit.

                                 KERMIT
                        Opulent stasis.

                                 CRISPINA
                        Stasis nonetheless.
                                 KERMIT
                             (remembering)
                        Oh! Hey, Crispy. I can pretend to 
                        like kids, right?

                                 CRISPINA
                        You should have started with that.

           EXT. ALEXANDRA FREEPORT’S HOME - NOON

           Kermit pulls up in his kind of nice, kind of sporty, kind of 
           luxury, car.

           Kermit walks to the door, all the while patting and wiping 
           cat hair off himself.

                                 KERMIT

           INT. ALEXANDRA FREEPORT’S HOME - CONTINUOUS

           Alex nods before Sebastian and Millicent. They are dressed 
           completely in black.

                                 ALEX
                        You guys ready?

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Oh yeah.

           Millicent giggles and nods.

           EXT. ALEXANDRA FREEPORT’S HOME

           Kermit opens the door to reveal Sebastian and Millicent. They 
           have their eyes slightly rolled back into their heads and 
           their hands are raised, fingers moving like tiny white worms.

                                 KERMIT
                             (sheepish)
                        Hullo.

                                 SBEASTIAN AND MILLICENT
                             (in creepy high-pitched 
                              voices)
                        We’re children. Chillllldren! We’re 
                        children! Cheeeeldren!

           Kermit isn’t stupid...but he is not entirely sure this is a 
           joke.
                                 KERMIT
                             (trying to fake laugh)
                        Is...is Alex...

           Sebastian and Millicent take a step closer and tilt their 
           heads at unnatural angles.

                                 SBEASTIAN AND MILLICENT
                        CHEEEELDREN! CHEEEELDREN!

           Kermit takes a step back.

                                 ALEX (O.S.)
                        Okay! Okay, he’s had enough. Go get 
                        changed.

           Sebastian and Millicent take off to their respective rooms. 
           Alex comes into view, impish smile firmly planted beneath her 
           hexagonal eyeglasses.

                                 KERMIT
                        You astonishing bitch.

                                 ALEX
                        Yeah, yeah, yeah.

           Alex embraces Kermit. As she pulls away she gives him a tiny 
           kiss on the mouth. Kermit inhales sharply.

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                             (off kiss, smiling)
                        Huh. That was different. C’mon in.

                        Eh. Same old, same old. Just 
                        writing and watching television. 
                        Saw Crispina this morning.

                                 KERMIT
                        What?

                                 ALEX
                        It just struck me that we have so 
                        much more to catch up on.

           Sebastian and Millicent come into the kitchen, dressed like 
           normal human children and not the undead.

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        Okay. This young man is Sebastian.

                        And this little firecracker is 
                        Millicent. This is Kermit.

                        That she did. That she did. It’s 
                        made my life incredibly ridiculous 
                        and lonely.

                                 ALEX
                        Alright, woggle-bugs. Where do you 
                        want to eat?

                        Sounds good. We can take my car.

           As Kermit walks to the front door he looks back at Millicent 
           and smiles.

           Kermit and Alex sit at a picnic table near a large, wooden 
           playground. An empty pizza box is before them. Sebastian sits 
           on a swing and plays his Playstation Vita. Millicent climbs 
           the slide.

                             (still laughing)
                        You’ve brought the lowest form of 
                        wit into a stinking pile of shit.

                                 ALEX
                        Shit? Oh, no. The pun is mightier 
                        than the “S” word.

                                 KERMIT
                        Geez.

                                 ALEX
                        Today’s nice.

                                 KERMIT
                        Absolutely.

           Alex moves her index finger back and forth, pointing at 
           herself then Kermit then back again.

                                 ALEX
                        So you want to do this again?

           A sharp inhalation from Kermit. He’s not stupid.

                                 KERMIT
                        Yes. Yeah. I mean, yeah. If that’s 
                        what you want. ‘Cause I could just, 
                        you know, do whatever I do. Which 
                        is...whatever I do, I guess.

                                 ALEX
                             (quietly)
                        Good. Good. Because I really want 
                        to. And I am so sorry, Kermit.

           Alex sniffles.

                                 KERMIT
                        Hey. It’s okay. I was fucking 
                        stupid-

                                 ALEX
                        You were stupid, I was stupid, 
                        plenty of fucking stupid to go 
                        around and then... Sixteen fucking 
                        years, Kermit.

                        Sixteen years of hating you or 
                        possessed by throat-crushing 
                        regret. There were so many times I 
                        wanted to track you down and call 
                        you up. So many times when I wanted 
                        to apologize even though I thought 
                        I was still in the right.   

                                 KERMIT
                        I never hated you. Even when I 
                        thought I did I...
                             (beat)
                        I feel like my life stopped when we 
                        did. And everything that came after 
                        was either hoping for the 
                        impossible or embracing the guilt. 
                        Gladly. “I deserve this and I’m not 
                        giving it up” guilt.

                        Oh, you poor tortured thing.
                             (beat)
                        Time...time is so goddamn stupid.

                                 KERMIT
                        Hey, Allie. Look at me. It’s 
                        alright. The past is a place.

           Alex reaches over and clutches Kermit’s hand.

                                 ALEX
                        Then let’s go there and do the past 
                        sixteen years right this time.

           They kiss. It is a lingering, gentle thing.

                                 MILLICENT (O.S.)
                        Mumsy’s kissing the froggie!

           EXT. LOWER MAKEFIELD TOWNSHIP PLAYGROUND - LATER

           Kermit, Alex, Sebastian, and Millicent walk to Kermit’s car. 
           Sebastian notices that Kermit and his mother are holding 
           hands.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Hey. Frog man.

                                 KERMIT
                        Yeah?
                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Keep me in video games and I won’t 
                        give you any problems.

           Sebastian gets into the car and closes the door.

                                 ALEX
                             (short laugh to Kermit)
                        Told you he was a little mercenary.

           INT. KERMIT’S CAR

           They drive in silence except for the audio from Sebastian’s 
           video game. Until...

                                 ALEX
                        Hey, guys. You mind if Kermit stays 
                        over tonight?

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        I’ll have to go to GameStop 
                        tomorrow.

                                 ALEX
                        Done. Millicent?

                                 MILLICENT
                        I like him! He can stay. But he has 
                        to ask nice to see my room.

                                 ALEX
                        Think you can do that, Kermit?

                                 KERMIT
                        Pretty certain.

                                 ALEX
                        Good. Good, good, good.

           Alex winces.

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        Hey...you think you could stop at a 
                        drug store?

                                 KERMIT
                        Sure. You okay?

                                 ALEX
                        Need some Advil. Been getting 
                        headaches. Probably just stress.
                                 KERMIT
                        Not a problem.

                                 ALEX
                        Do you have a pluggy thingy for an 
                        iPod?

                                 KERMIT
                        That blue wire.

                                 ALEX
                        Remember this?

           She hits play and starts to sway her shoulders back and forth 
           to Laura Nyro’s “When I Was A Freeport And You Were The Main 
           Drag.”

                                 KERMIT
                        Oh my God.

           Millicent and Sebastian have never seen this before.

                                 ALEX
                             (singing)
                        “You took my heart, misery / You 
                        showed me blues / Well, I’ve got / 
                        A lot of patience, baby / That’s a 
                        lot of patience to looooose...

           Alex dramatically puts the back of her hand against her 
           forehead, mock-swooning.

                                 ALEX (CONT’D)
                        ...I’m crying! / I’m mad at my 
                        country / Oh, and I’ve been treated 
                        bad / When I was a freeport and you 
                        were the main drag!”

           Sebastian shakes his head back and forth but he can’t stop 
           grinning.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        This is horrible.

                                 ALEX
                        Oh!

           Alex winces in pain.

                                 KERMIT
                        Alex?

           And Alex clutches his hand tightly, her nails digging into 
           it.
           The music is turned off.

                                 KERMIT (CONT’D)
                        Alex?

                                 ALEX
                        No...no no no no no no 
                        nononononono...

           Alex pitches forward and vomits.

                                 KERMIT
                        ALLIE?!

           Brakes are slammed.

           Alex twitches violently.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Mom!?

                                 MILLICENT
                        Mumsy?

                                 KERMIT
                        ALEX!

           And she doesn’t move at all.

           A small, two-story house of aluminum siding and faux brick.

           It is snowing outside. Already the ground is white and 
           undisturbed by shovels and footprints.

           TEENAGE KERMIT and TEENAGE ALEX are on the couch watching the

                        My sister, Celia. She bakes cookies 
                        and smokes weed. I mean, that’s 
                        like all she does.

                                 TEEN KERMIT
                        I meant your cooter.

                        It’s snowing out.

                        That’s the point.

                        Goddammit, Kermit. Is this how it’s 
                        going to be all the time? You act 
                        like a stubborn child until I yell 
                        at you and you call me a bitch?

                        That could be easily avoided if you 
                        didn’t want me to do things.

           Teen Alex and Teen Kermit trudge up a slope with no houses

                        Here we are.

           Teen Alex and Teen Kermit get to the top of the clearing.

                        Look at that.

                        Look up, jackass.

           And there against the sky’s low clouds, backlit by a sun that 
           is desperately trying to shine through the weather, are their 
           SILHOUETTES: tall, gray, and blasted high.

           Kermit, Sebastian, and Millicent sit in a hallway.

           A DOCTOR comes into the hall. 

           He says something to Kermit and the children. 

           The children seem to understand better than Kermit.

           Silence.

           Sebastian takes out his wallet, bites his lip, finds a card 
           with a phone number on it and hands it to the Doctor.
           The Doctor says something else to them but there is only 
           silence.

           Kermit still hasn’t moved.

           Sebastian has fallen asleep.

           A tearful WOMAN with dyed black hair and a gray fedora comes 
           up to them. This is RAYNA HORAN (28yrs old.)

           The silence diminishes just a little bit.

                        Hey, guys. Hey.

           Sebastian and Millicent wake up and and embrace Rayna. 
           Finally the tears come from Sebastian.

                                 RAYNA (CONT’D)
                        Hey....hey....shhhhh. I got you 
                        now.
                             (to Kermit)
                        You’re Kermit, right?

           A weak nod from Kermit.

                                 RAYNA (CONT’D)
                        I heard a lot about you. I’m so 
                        sorry.
                             (beat)
                        I’m Rayna. Alex’s friend. What 
                        happened?

           Kermit can’t say anything. He can barely shake his head. This 
           is a man who is not an idiot who is trying very fucking 
           desperately to hold his shit together.

                                 RAYNA (CONT’D)
                        I’m gonna talk to the Doctor and 
                        take the kids back to my place. Try 
                        to get in touch with whatever 
                        family she had. Do you know?
           Kermit shakes his head.

                                 KERMIT
                             (very quietly)
                        Her parents are gone. Don’t know 
                        anyone else.

                                 RAYNA
                        Okay. Okay. Hey, do you have a 
                        number where I can reach you?

           Kermit fumbles for his pen and notepad. He writes his number 
           twice. His name once. He tears out the page and hands it to 
           Rayna.

           She says something but the silence has returned.

           Kermit stands up and gives the tiniest, most pathetic wave to 
           Sebastian and Millicent.

           Tearfully, Millicent returns it.

           EXT. SAINT MARY’S HOSPITAL, NEWTOWN, PA

           Kermit gets into his car.

           EXT. KERMIT ST. LUCY’S PENNSYLVANIA COTTAGE - NIGHT

           Kermit gets out of the car and walks to his door.

           He enters and closes the door behind him.

           The silence subsides once more and we hear a number being 
           dialed on a cell phone.

                                 CRISPINA (O.S.)
                        Hello?

                                 KERMIT (O.S.)
                        Cripsy?

                                 CRISPINA (O.S.)
                        Hi, Kermit. How’d everything go 
                        with Alex? Oh! Before I forget, 
                        something new almost happened to me 
                        today. It didn’t. But it almost did 
                        and I think that’s the important 
                        thing.

                                 KERMIT (O.S.)
                        She’s dead.
                                 CRISPINA (O.S.)
                        Kermit?

           BEAT

           A great CRASH of glass and metal is heard within the darkened 
           house.

           BLACK

           INT. KERMIT ST. LUCY’S PENNSYLVANIA COTTAGE - DAWN

           Kermit awakens on the couch. Crispina is pouring sugar into a 
           coffee in the background. Broken glass has been swept into a 
           small pile in the hallway.

                                 KERMIT
                        Crispy? What are you....

           And then it hits him. 

                                 CRISPINA
                        Hey. Hey, Kermit.

                                 KERMIT
                             (stuttering)
                        Th-th-this cccccan’t be l-l-l-like 
                        this-

                                 CRISPINA
                        Kermit.

                                 KERMIT
                             (howling)
                        Oh God, Crispy...

           Crispina puts down her coffee and rushes over to her brother, 
           hugging him as hard as she can.

                                 CRISPINA
                        I’m here, Kermit. I’m here. As long 
                        as you need me. I’m not going back 
                        to the office anytime soon, okay? 
                        So don’t worry, okay? I’m here.

                                 KERMIT
                             (whimpering)
                        Alex.

           Crispina’s embrace tightens threefold.
           INT. RAYNA HORAN’S APARTMENT - MORNING

           The only decoration of note is a giant WEEN poster. 

           Sebastian and Millicent sit on the couch watching Harry 
           Potter & The Sorcerer’s Stone on DVD. Both of their faces are 
           raw and red.

           Rayna sits down next to him with a cup of hot tea.

                                 RAYNA
                        You sure you guys don’t want any 
                        orange juice or anything?

                                 SEBASTIAN
                             (softly)
                        No.

           Millicent turns to Rayna.

                                 MILLICENT
                        I want mumsy.

           She turns back to the television. Sebastian puts his arm 
           around her.

           INT. KERMIT ST. LUCY’S PENNSYLVANIA COTTAGE - LATER

           Kermit is back asleep on the couch.

           Crispina is on the phone.

                                 CRISPINA
                        I’ve never seen him like this 
                        before. I mean, when Adelaide died-
                             (beat)
                        Adelaide, mom. Our sister. Your 
                        fucking daughter. Adelaide!
                             (beat)
                        Okay, okay. I’m sorry. All I’m 
                        saying is that when Adelaide died 
                        he was devastated, okay? We all 
                        were. But this is different. This 
                        is... He spent sixteen years 
                        becoming the kind of person that 
                        could get her back. And he did. And 
                        then right after, she fucking dies. 
                        I can’t imagine it. This isn’t like 
                        losing a person you love. For 
                        him...this must be like losing a 
                        world.

           Crispina wipes an eye.
                                 MOM (O.S.)
                        Well, I never liked her. Sweetheart 
                        I have to go, my back really hurts 
                        and-

                                 CRISPINA
                             (spitting into phone)
                        You should’ve fucking died.

           Crispina hangs up and walks to the sleeping Kermit. She sits 
           on the floor in front of the couch.

                                 CRISPINA (CONT’D)
                             (whispering)
                        Mom sends whatever her black heart 
                        pumps instead of “love.”

           Crispina hears a ringing from Kermit. She reaches into his 
           jacket and pulls out his cellphone.

                                 CRISPINA (CONT’D)
                        Hello?
                             (beat)
                        This is his sister.

           TEXT: Funeral.

           EXT. ALEXANDRA FREEPORT’S HOME - MORNING

           Rayna and a fidgeting WOMAN are dressed in black. This is 
           CELIA FREEPORT (45yrs old.)

           INT. ALEXANDRA FREEPORT’S HOME

                                 CELIA
                        You know where we’re going, right?

                                 RAYNA
                        Yeah.

                                 CELIA
                        Stupid question. I’m sorry.

                                 RAYNA
                        No, it’s okay.

                                 CELIA
                        I hadn’t seen her in years, you 
                        know? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 CELIA (CONT'D)
                        I was supposed to come down last 
                        Christmas but I couldn’t get away 
                        from work. When we were kids I used 
                        to call her “Cheeseburger.”

                                 RAYNA
                        Yeah?

                                 CELIA
                        Because she had red hair like 
                        Wendy. From Wendy’s.

           Sebastian and Millicent come into the room. They are dressed 
           immaculately in a little black suit and a little black dress.

           Millicent is holding a book tight to her chest, “The 
           Marvelous Land Of Oz.”

                                 MILLICENT
                        Aunt Celia? I’m taking the Woggle-
                        bug book with me.

           INT. KERMIT ST. LUCY’S PENNSYLVANIA COTTAGE, BEDROOM

           Kermit is in a black suit. There is absolutely nothing going 
           on in his features.

                                 CRISPINA
                        Here’s your cap. You don’t go 
                        anywhere without it.

           Crispina puts the cap on his head.

                                 CRISPINA (CONT’D)
                        Okay. Good. All you have to do is 
                        sleepwalk through today, okay? I’ll 
                        be right there. You just go through 
                        the motions.

                                 KERMIT
                        Okay.

                                 CRISPINA
                        You want some pills?

                                 KERMIT
                        Yes, please.

           EXT. DOYLESTOWN CEMETERY - LATER

           Silence again.
           Mourners stand silently. All of them are in their early 20s. 
           About three dozen.

           Kermit stands graveside beside his sister. Aunt Celia, 
           Sebastian, and Millicent are across from him. And between 
           them that terrible polished box.

           EXT. ALEXANDRA FREEPORT’S HOME, BACKYARD

           Silence.

           Tables are set up with cold cuts and beverages. A few folding 
           tables and chairs are scattered around the yard. Kermit 
           stands alone by a table as Crispina puts some turkey on a 
           paper plate.

           Aunt Celia walks up to him and begins to talk. But he can’t 
           hear her because there is only silence.

           Only silence until Millicent tugs at his sleeve and Kermit 
           looks down.

                                 MILLICENT
                        Kermit? She wants to talk to you.

                                 KERMIT
                        Okay.

           Kermit looks up.

                                 KERMIT (CONT’D)
                        Hi.

                                 CELIA
                        You’re Kermit. You probably don’t 
                        remember me. I’m Celia. Alex’s 
                        older sister.

                                 KERMIT
                        Celia. I remember you. You were 
                        always baking cookies and smoking 
                        weed.

                                 CELIA
                        I haven’t really changed all that 
                        much.
                             (looks down at Millicent 
                              and Sebastian then back 
                              to Kermit)
                        Can I talk to you in private for a 
                        second?
                                 KERMIT
                        Sure. Sure.

                                 CELIA
                             (to kids)
                        Stay here, guys. 

           INT. ALEXANDRA FREEPORT’S KITCHEN

                                 CELIA
                        I’m leaving in one week.

                                 KERMIT
                        Ok.

                                 CELIA
                        I can’t take care of the kids. I 
                        live in a shitty one room 
                        apartment. I had to borrow money 
                        from my boss just to hop a flight 
                        here.

                                 KERMIT
                        What about whatsis name? The 
                        father. Ed.

                                 CELIA
                        Ed’s a fucking cocksucker.

                                 KERMIT
                        Never met him but I’m inclined to 
                        agree.

                                 CELIA
                             (begins to tear up)
                        I...I was able to finally get in 
                        touch with him. You know what he 
                        said? “Send them to a fucking 
                        orphanage for all I care.”

                                 KERMIT
                        Jesus.

                                 CELIA
                        Kermit, I can’t take care of these 
                        kids. I don’t want to send them to 
                        strangers. I’m the only family she 
                        had and I-I-I asked around and 
                        Alex’s only friends are kids in 
                        their 20s. 
                             (beat)
                        Except for you.
                                 KERMIT
                        You want-

                                 CELIA
                        Alex would want you to take care of 
                        them. She loved you, Kermit. She 
                        did. She loved you so much.

           Technically, Kermit’s shit is still together.

                                 KERMIT
                             (choking)
                        What do they think?

                                 CELIA
                        I don’t know. But their mother’s 
                        dead and they can’t go to a 
                        complete stranger.

                                 KERMIT
                        One week?

                                 CELIA
                        One week. They can’t go to a 
                        stranger.

                                 KERMIT
                        Excuse me.

           He is about to return outside when he eyes a bottle of 
           scotch.

                                 KERMIT (CONT’D)
                        You mind?

                                 CELIA
                        No. Not at all.

           EXT. ALEXANDRA FREEPORT’S HOME, BACKYARD

           Kermit walks out of the house with a tumbler of scotch and 
           lights a cigarette.

                                 KERMIT
                        Right.

           He sees Crispina talking to Rayna by the shrimp and walks 
           over.

                                 CRISPINA
                        Kermit. This is Rayna. One of 
                        Alex’s friends. 
                                 RAYNA
                        We met at the hospital.

                                 CRISPINA
                        Oh.
                             (beat)
                        You okay, Kermit?

                                 KERMIT
                        I talked to her sister. She wants 
                        me to take the kids. She can’t do 
                        it.

                                 CRISPINA
                        There’s no one else?

           Kermit shakes his head.

                                 CRISPINA (CONT’D)
                        No one at all?

                                 KERMIT
                        No.

                                 RAYNA
                        You should. She’d want that. She 
                        loved you.

                                 KERMIT
                             (looking straight down at 
                              the grass)
                        Not to be rude. But I wish people 
                        would stop fucking telling me that. 
                        She never told me that.

                                 RAYNA
                        She did. And you should do it.

                                 KERMIT
                        Crispy? What do I have to do?

                                 CRISPINA
                        You should think about this, 
                        Kermit.

                                 KERMIT
                        I can’t let her kids go to a 
                        fucking stranger. I-

                                 CRISPINA
                        Kermit. You, out of everyone on 
                        this fucking planet, needs to take 
                        time and think about this.
                                 KERMIT
                        Yeah...yeah. I’ll think. But, you 
                        could help me right?

                                 CRISPINA
                        If it’s what you really think is 
                        the right thing, I’ll prepare a 
                        petition for guardianship. I’ll 
                        need to talk to her sister. 
                        There’ll be a brief investigation 
                        to make sure there’s no other 
                        relatives. Make sure you’re not a 
                        felon and all that happy horse 
                        shit.  

                                 RAYNA
                        How long’s that usually take?

                                 CRISPINA
                        Off the top of my head? Up to two 
                        months.
                             (to Kermit)
                        But you need to hit “Pause” and 
                        think. I know you have a million 
                        things running through you right 
                        now but this isn’t a decision you 
                        can half-ass.

                                 KERMIT
                        Okay. You’re right. You’re always 
                        right.

           Millicent comes up to Kermit, dragging Sebastian by the hand.

                                 MILLICENT
                        Kermit?

                                 KERMIT
                        Hi.

                                 MILLICENT
                        Aunt Celia says we’re going to live 
                        with you.

                                 KERMIT
                        I don’t know yet. She asked. You 
                        don’t even know me. 

                                 MILLICENT
                        You know what a Woggle-Bug is.

                                 KERMIT
                        What does your brother think?
                                 MILLICENT
                        He doesn’t care.

                                 KERMIT
                        I have to, uh, do some things 
                        first. So...maybe you’ll live with 
                        me. I don’t...I don’t know.

                                 MILLICENT
                        Okay.

                                 KERMIT
                        Uh...this is my sister. Crispy? 
                        This is Millicent and Sebastian.

                                 MILLICENT
                        Crispy?

           Crispina kneels before Millicent.

                                 CRISPINA
                        That’s what he calls me. It’s 
                        Crispina.

                                 MILLICENT
                        Christina?

                                 CRISPINA
                        With a “P.” Crispina. Crispy.

                                 MILLICENT
                        He’s a frog and you’re bacon.

           TEXT: Five Years Ago.

           INT. KERMIT ST. LUCY’S PENNSYLVANIA COTTAGE - NIGHT

           Kermit talks on his Blackberry. He is very much like he is 
           today except he wears no jeff cap. Instead he has a beaten 
           Phillies baseball cap.

                                 KERMIT
                             (excitedly)
                        Yeah. No, I looked over the proofs 
                        and they’re great. 
                             (beat)
                        Wow. Well, that’s a good print run. 
                        Better than last time, right?
                             (beat)
                        Cool. Thank you so much, Erik. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 KERMIT (CONT'D)
                        Really. This means a lot to me. 
                        Alright, man. Later.

           The phone is put away. A smile is put on.

                                 WOMAN’S VOICE (O.S.)
                        Good news?

           The voice belongs to ADELAIDE ST. LUCY (32yrs old.) She is 
           tall with round glasses and a hodge-podge of clothing that is 
           at once both trashy and the height of style. She wears a 
           black jeff cap.

                                 KERMIT
                        Yeah. New book goes to press in two 
                        weeks. 

                                 ADELAIDE
                        Well, check you the fuck out. 
                        Congrats, mein Bruder. You’ll have 
                        to sign a copy for me and all that 
                        happy horse shit.

                                 KERMIT
                        You headed off?

                                 ADELAIDE
                        Yeah. Got another place to stay for 
                        a few days before Denise and I go 
                        to Portland. Plus, I know me being 
                        here was making you pissy.

                                 KERMIT
                        It wasn’t making me pissy. Just you 
                        staying up all night drinking and 
                        listening to music out back.

                                 ADELAIDE
                        That’s me, Kermit. That’s what I 
                        do. And it made you pissy.

                                 KERMIT
                        Look, if you want to stay longer 
                        it’s cool.

                                 ADELAIDE
                        You don’t mean that.

           Kermit says nothing.

                                 ADELAIDE (CONT’D)
                             (laughing)
                        Exactly. Ah, little brother I do 
                        love you. 
           Adelaide embraces Kermit. He weakly returns it.

                                 ADELAIDE (CONT’D)
                        You should visit me when I get to 
                        Portland.

                                 KERMIT
                        Yeah, absolutely.

                                 ADELAIDE
                        You won’t. You never mean what you 
                        say and you never do anything you 
                        don’t want to do. All I’m saying is 
                        you should.

                                 KERMIT
                        Yeah.

                                 ADELAIDE
                        You should, Kermit.
                             (picks up her bag)
                        Give Crispy my love. Tell mom to go 
                        hell.

           Kermit follows Adelaide out the door. She stops.

                                 ADELAIDE (CONT’D)
                        Huh.

                                 KERMIT
                        What?

                                 ADELAIDE
                        I just feel like I should have some 
                        advice for you, y’know? Me going 
                        away for a long time. You staying 
                        here. Some Big Sister advice for 
                        you to chew on and magically

                                 ADELAIDE
                        Suppose not.

           Adelaide gets to her car and loads her single bag.

                                 ADELAIDE (CONT’D)
                             (calling to Kermit)
                        I got it!

                                 KERMIT
                        Got what?
                                 ADELAIDE
                        You need people in your life, 
                        Kermit. You can’t just sit in your 
                        house and jerk off. People, Kermit. 
                        That’s my advice.

                                 KERMIT
                        Duly noted.

           Adelaide waves farewell and drives away.

                                 KERMIT (CONT’D)
                             (mumbling)
                        I prefer “alone” to the idiots you 
                        hang out with.

           EXT. LOGAN INN, NEW HOPE, PA - DAY

           Kermit and Crispina having lunch.

           They sit along the bar rail looking out onto Main Street. 
           Crispina plays with a salad in front of her. An untouched 
           bowl of soup is in front of Kermit.

                                 KERMIT
                        I want to go home.

                                 CRISPINA
                        An hour outside the house. You need 
                        at least an hour. You turned into a 
                        basket case after Adelaide because 
                        you shut-

                                 KERMIT
                        I killed her. That’s why I was a 
                        basket case.

                                 CRISPINA
                        Uh-huh. Sure.

                                 KERMIT
                        I never told you before but-

                                 CRISPINA
                        Kermit. You did tell me. You should 
                        have told her to stay with you 
                        longer, that it was no problem. You 
                        told me.
                                 KERMIT
                        I should have told her it was okay.

                                 CRISPINA
                        It wouldn’t have changed anything. 
                        You know that.

                                 KERMIT
                        People are always so quick to 
                        absolve others of guilt in matters 
                        of conscience. 

                                 CRISPINA
                        I’m sorry.

                                 KERMIT
                        For what?

                                 CRISPINA
                        I was about to call you a whiny 
                        little cunt. 

                                 KERMIT
                             (bawling)
                        I am...oh, God I am...

                                 CRISPINA
                        Jesus. Kermit? Kermit? Come on...

           Crispina hands Kermit a small stack of napkins.

                                 CRISPINA (CONT’D)
                        I’m gonna grab you a beer. Hold on.

           Crispina gets up and goes to the bar and Kermit? Kermit does 
           those silly, pathetic things one does when trying to keep 
           their shit together in public. A squeeze of the nose’s 
           bridge. Some top teeth jammed into the bottom lip. A head and 
           posture suddenly straight and firm, looking askance at 
           nothing coming down the street... 

                                 CRISPINA (CONT’D)
                             (puts beer in front of 
                              Kermit)
                        Here. Guinness. 

                                 KERMIT
                        They’re all that’s left of her.

                                 CRISPINA
                        Huh?

                                 KERMIT
                        Alex.
                                 CRISPINA
                        Oh. 

                                 KERMIT
                        They’re the last living piece of 
                        her. Literally. There’s...there’s a 
                        theory that memory is transmitted 
                        through DNA; nucleotides infused 
                        and charged with the past. Memory 
                        is matter is memory. The engine of 
                        deja vu.

                                 CRISPINA
                        Crawl out of your own ass for a 
                        second and think, Kermit. Don’t 
                        think of reasons why you should 
                        take the children. Ask yourself 
                        honestly and truly: do you want to 
                        take them? Can you take them?

                                 KERMIT
                        They’re her.

                                 CRISPINA
                        Kermit.

                                 KERMIT
                        What if that’s the only way I-

                                 CRISPINA
                        Kermit.

                                 KERMIT
                        I...I can’t. I have panic attacks 
                        going to the supermarket. I’m 
                        terrified of everything. I want to, 
                        Crispy. I want to for her. Even for 
                        them. I want to. But I can’t. I...I 
                        can’t.

           Kermit covers his face with his hands. Crispina lightly rubs 
           his back.

                                 KERMIT (CONT’D)
                             (muffled)
                        Can I go home now?

           EXT. ALEXANDRA FREEPORT’S HOME - MORNING

           Crispina pulls up with Kermit in the passenger seat.
                                 KERMIT
                        Thanks for coming with me. It just 
                        seemed wrong to not do it person.

                                 CRISPINA
                        It’ll be okay, Kermit.

           INT. ALEXANDRA FREEPORT’S HOME - CONTINUOUS

           Sebastian sits on the couch cross-legged, hunched over his 
           Playstation Vita. Millicent sits a little bit away from him 
           clutching a Harry Potter wand, a pointed wizard hat a size 
           too big on her small red head. 

           Celia drinks tea at the kitchen table and looks up when the 
           doorbell RINGS.

           Millicent trots to the door and opens it to reveal Kermit and 
           Crispina.

                                 KERMIT
                        Hullo.

                                 MILLICENT
                             (calling inside)
                        Aunt Celia! Froggie and bacon are 
                        here!

                                 CELIA
                        Kermit. Crispina. Please, come in.

                                 KERMIT
                        Actually, we’re not going to be 
                        staying long...

                                 MILLICENT
                        Hey, Kermit.

                                 KERMIT
                        ...we just stopped by to-

                                 MILLICENT
                        Kermit!

                                 CELIA
                        I think she wants to tell you 
                        something.

                                 KERMIT
                        Huh?
                             (looks down)
                        Oh. Hi.
                                 MILLICENT
                        I was thinking about what you said. 
                        I used my brain and everything.

                                 KERMIT
                        Oh, yeah? What...what did I say?

                                 MILLICENT
                        You said we didn’t know you. But 
                        that isn’t the truth at all because 
                        mumsy said she liked you very, 
                        very, very, very much. So we know 
                        that.

           And whatever Kermit was trying to do get this over with quick 
           is lost in the tears rimming his eyes.

                                 MILLICENT (CONT’D)
                        Does your house have a pool? I’ve 
                        never had a pool. I go to the pool 
                        sometimes but I don’t like the 
                        other kids. They’re nice. But I 
                        don’t like them. I don’t need a 
                        diving board. Maybe when I’m older 
                        but mumsy said getting old was 
                        stupid so maybe I’ll never need 
                        one.

                                 KERMIT
                        I don’t have a pool. But there’s a 
                        little pond.

                                 CELIA
                        Thank you again for doing this, 
                        Kermit.

                                 CRISPINA
                        Actually-

                                 KERMIT
                        No need to thank me. When are you 
                        guys ready to move in?

                                 MILLICENT
                        I’m ready now. We just have to 
                        carry Mister Hedgey down.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        I’ll get him.

           Sebastian trots up the stairs to Millicent’s room.
                                 MILLICENT
                        I will make sure Mister Hedgey is 
                        calm when he is being carried! He 
                        gets scaredy easy!

           Millicent follows Sebastian.

                                 CELIA
                        Be right back. There’s something 
                        else.

                                 CRISPINA
                        Kermit? I thought you decided not 
                        to.

                                 KERMIT
                        Get the petition ready.
                             (beat)
                        They’re hers, Crispy. I only had 
                        doubt. Never a choice.

           Sebastian comes downstairs with the aquarium in his arms. 

                                 SEBASTIAN
                             (morose)
                        Frog? Meet hedgehog.

                                 KERMIT
                             (waving weakly through 
                              glass)
                        Hey there.

                                 CELIA (O.S.)
                        Here we go. Thought you might want 
                        this.

           Celia comes over and places a large, sealed CARDBOARD BOX 
           marked “Alex’s Things” at the feet of Kermit.

           Brown leaves gather unraked on the lawn. A Jack O’Lantern 
           rests by the front stoop. The face is the exact same shape of 
           Jack Pumpkinhead in The Marvelous Land of Oz.
           INT. KERMIT ST. LUCY’S PENNSYLVANIA COTTAGE - MORNING

           Kermit sleeps on the couch. An alarm clock GOES OFF next to 
           him: 6:30 AM.

           Kermit wakes. The first thing he sees is...

           ANGLE ON: The sealed cardboard box marked “Alex’s Things.”

           INT. KERMIT ST. LUCY’S PENNSYLVANIA COTTAGE, MASTER BEDROOM

           Sebastian is sitting up in bed rubbing his eyes. Kermit pokes 
           his head in.

                                 KERMIT
                        School.

           Sebastian nods and gives a thumbs up.

           Millicent is softly snoring.

                                 KERMIT
                        Milly? School.

           Millicent stretches herself awake.

                                 MILLICENT

           INT. KERMIT ST. LUCY’S PENNSYLVANIA COTTAGE, KITCHEN - LATER

           Sebastian and Millicent finish breakfast. Millicent is 
           dressed for Halloween in a tiny green old-fashioned military 
           uniform with a tall hat. In glitter glue she has written “OZ” 
           below her left shoulder. Sebastian is not dressed for 
           Halloween.

                                 KERMIT
                             (to Millicent)
                        You did that all by yourself?

                                 MILLICENT
                        I had the jacket and hat. But I did 
                        the glitter and painted the boots.
                                 KERMIT
                        Very nice.

                                 MILLICENT
                        Aren’t you going to ask who I am?

                                 KERMIT
                        And why on earth would I do that, 
                        General Jinjur?

                                 MILLICENT
                             (broad smile)
                        You’re smart!

                                 KERMIT
                             (to Sebastian)
                        No costume for you?

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        I’m going as an orphan.

                                 KERMIT
                        Fair enough.

           Millicent slams her tiny fist on the table.

                                 MILLICENT
                             (to Sebastian)
                        Don’t SAY that!

           Sebastian shrugs, stands up, grabs his bookbag and walks to 
           the door.

                                 KERMIT
                        Have a good day at school.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Uh-huh. Oh. Can I go to the mall 
                        after school? Greg’s mom’ll drive 
                        us.

                                 KERMIT
                        Yeah, sure. Just call if you get 
                        stuck or have any problems or rocks 
                        start falling out of the sky or...I 
                        don’t know.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Kay.

           Sebastian leaves.
                                 KERMIT
                             (to Millicent)
                        Car or bus today?

                                 MILLICENT
                        Hmmmm. I do believe I shall take 
                        the bus.

                                 KERMIT
                        You just want to show off.

           Millicent nods fiercely.

                                 KERMIT (CONT’D)
                        Okay.

           EXT. KERMIT ST. LUCY’S PENNSYLVANIA COTTAGE - LATER

           The school bus comes. Millicent turns and waves goodbye to 
           Kermit. Kermit waves back and then goes inside.

           INT. KERMIT ST. LUCY’S PENNSYLVANIA COTTAGE

           And closes the door.

           And collapses in a howling, sobbing wreck.

           BLACK

           INT. KERMIT ST. LUCY’S PENNSYLVANIA COTTAGE - LATER

           Kermit has fallen asleep in a hunched over, uncomfortable 
           position. He awakens when the front door HITS him in the 
           back.

                                 KERMIT
                        Ow!

           Crispina pops her head in.

                                 CRISPINA
                        What in a thousand fucks are you 
                        doing down there?

                                 KERMIT
                        I fell asleep.

                                 CRISPINA
                        Get up. Get up and meet me in the 
                        car. I’m getting you out of this 
                        house.
           EXT. LAMBERTVILLE HOUSE BAR & RESTAURANT - NOON

           Establishing.

           INT. LAMBERTVILLE HOUSE BAR & RESTAURANT

           Kermit sits across from Crispina at a corner table in the bar 
           section. The waitress, LAH (25yrs old) is taking Crispina’s 
           order.

                                 LAH
                        French onion soup and the chicken 
                        pot pie.
                             (to Kermit)
                        Anything for you?

                                 KERMIT
                        I’m good. Thank you, Lah.

                                 CRISPINA
                        Are you still not eating?

                                 KERMIT
                        I can eat little things. Like one 
                        slice of pizza. Anything more than 
                        that I throw it up.

                                 CRISPINA
                        You think about seeing someone?

                                 KERMIT
                        I’m not seeing a therapist. It’s 
                        not like she was my wife. Or even 
                        my girlfriend...until a half hour 
                        before she died.

                                 CRISPINA
                        Whether you acknowledge it or not, 
                        you spent half your life with her.

                                 KERMIT
                        Largely as an absence.

                                 CRISPINA
                        And who’s fault was that? There 
                        were plenty of times you could have 
                        moved past her. Amelia? Courtney? 
                        And let’s not forget Meredith. That 
                        girl was completely devoted to you. 
                        And what did you do? You’d get 
                        bored of them and then retreat into 
                        this Alex world of yours-
                                 KERMIT
                        Hey.

                                 CRISPINA
                        I’m not trying to play it down, 
                        Kermit. What happened is horrible 
                        and I truly fucking ache for you. 
                        But in a way, you chose it.

                                 KERMIT
                        Why are you saying this?

                                 CRISPINA
                        You don’t have any friends. You 
                        have a sister. And it’s true.

           Kermit’s mouth is doing a tight-lipped, quivering thing more 
           suited to exotic deep-dwelling creatures in the Antarctic 
           ocean than a face.

                                 CRISPINA (CONT’D)
                        Hey. Okay, sorry. Let’s try to do 
                        the Not Crying In Public thing 
                        today, okay?

                                 KERMIT
                        Shit. Shit. 

                                 CRISPINA
                        At least have a beer. Calories will 
                        strengthen your mental defenses.

                                 KERMIT
                        No. No, I can’t be drunk around the 
                        kids.

                                 CRISPINA
                             (hissing in a whisper)
                        It’s one beer, Kermit. Not a goddam 
                        gallon of scotch.
                             (aloud)
                        Hey, Lah? Can he get a beer?
                             (to Kermit)
                        Guinness, right?
                             (to Lah)
                        Guinness.

           INT. LAMBERTVILLE HOUSE BAR & RESTAURANT - LATER

           Kermit’s Guinness is half-finished. 

           Crispina is finishing the chicken pot pie.
                                 CRISPINA
                        Last bite. Sure you don’t want it?

                                 KERMIT
                        Fine.

           Kermit takes her fork and eats.

                                 CRISPINA
                        Theeeeere’s a good boy. Who’s my 
                        big boy?

                                 KERMIT
                        I don’t think I have a sense of 
                        humor anymore.

                                 CRISPINA
                        Get back to me when you lose your 
                        sex drive as well.

                                 KERMIT
                        Oh, I’ve definitely lost that.

           Crispina pushes her plate aside.

                                 CRISPINA
                        So how are things with Sebastian 
                        and Millicent?

                                 KERMIT
                        Millicent’s getting better every 
                        day. She’s great, Crispy. And she 
                        looks so much like her 
                        it’s...it’s...
                             (struggling not to break)
                        I don’t have the words. I don’t 
                        have words anymore, Crispy. That’s 
                        supposed to be my thing, the words 
                        and stuff, and I don’t have them 
                        anymore. 

                                 CRISPINA
                        Hey. Focus. How’s Sebastian?

                                 KERMIT
                        He’s... Well, shit. He’s sullen and 
                        morose. He wants to be alone all 
                        the time but he goes through the 
                        motions of trying to be social. 
                        He’ll go out with his friends and 
                        then call me an hour later to pick 
                        him up. Last week he only lasted 
                        forty-five minutes at a sleepover.

                        I’m just dreading the inevitable 
                        “lashing out at the world” period. 
                        But y’know, these days? It’s not 
                        like when we were kids when lashing 
                        out was like, getting into fights, 
                        shoplifting, and smoking 
                        cigarettes. No. No. Today it’s 
                        like, like fucking heroin and 
                        fucking...shooting fucking people 
                        with guns and shit.

                                 CRISPINA
                        I don’t know if you’re more 
                        effective when you’re inarticulate 
                        but you’re definitely more amusing.

                                 KERMIT
                        So, yeah. That’s how the kids are.

                                 CRISPINA
                        No regrets? No second thoughts?

                                 KERMIT
                        No.

           Crispina reaches down and pulls out a thin folder.

                                 CRISPINA
                        Good, because it’s too late now.

           Kermit opens the folder.

                                 KERMIT
                        Wow.

                                 CRISPINA
                        Yep. You’re officially their 
                        guardian. I’m still unofficially 
                        their aunt.  

                                 KERMIT
                        Thank you so much, Crispy. For 
                        everything.

                                 CRISPINA
                        Didn’t mind. It was something new. 
                        That was great to have something 
                        new. Oh! Speaking of which, last 
                        night I ate something I never ate 
                        before. Okonomiyaki. Japanese pizza 
                        pancake thing. Fucking outrageous.

                                 KERMIT
                        Yay.
                                 CRISPINA
                        Fucking A, “Yay!”

                                 KERMIT
                        I should get back. Kids’ll be home 
                        soon.

                                 CRISPINA
                        Sure. Sure. 
                             (beat)
                        Hey. I’m really proud of you, 
                        Kermit.

                                 KERMIT
                        Thanks.

                                 CRISPINA
                        And I think Alex would-

                                 KERMIT
                        Don’t. Please. Just don’t.

                                 CRISPINA
                        Okay. Okay, let’s get you back.

           INT. KERMIT ST. LUCY’S PENNSYLVANIA COTTAGE - LATE AFTERNOON

           Kermit is at his laptop. He stares at words. He types. He 
           erases.

           Kermit looks at a corner of the room.

           ANGLE ON: The large sealed cardboard box marked “Alex’s 
           Things.”

           Kermit goes back to staring at the computer. At words.

           Kermit sees a reflection that isn’t his in the window behind 
           the laptop.

           He leaps without leaping from his chair panicked and fearful, 
           his arms flailing.

                                 KERMIT
                        GAH!

           It’s only Sebastian.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        What the hell, man!?
                                 KERMIT
                             (out of breath)
                        Shit....sorry...I startle easily.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        You looked like a cartoon. People 
                        are only supposed to do that in 
                        cartoons.

                                 KERMIT
                        Sorry. Shit. Are you okay?

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Me? I’m fine. You’re the cartoon.

                                 KERMIT
                        Yeah...yeah...sorry.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                             (trying desperately not to 
                              smile)
                        Named after a muppet. Acts like a 
                        cartoon.

                                 KERMIT
                        I thought you were going to the 
                        mall with your friends.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Didn’t feel like it. All they do is 
                        wander around and make lame jokes 
                        about girls. I just came ho- 
                             (he corrects himself)
                        Here after school.

           The sound of the school bus screeching to a halt.

           Sebastian walks to the refrigerator.

                                 SEBASTIAN (CONT’D)
                        Millie’s back.

           Sebastian is about to open the refrigerator when he sees a 
           white piece of paper hanging by a magnet.

           Millicent comes into the house.

                                 MILLICENT
                        Hello, hello! I’m home, I’m home!

           Millicent goes to the fridge, stops, and reads what Sebastian 
           is rereading.
                                 MILLICENT (CONT’D)
                        What’s... “Guardian?”

                                 KERMIT
                        Oh, yeah. It’s official. I’m, uh, 
                        your legal guardian. It doesn’t 
                        really change anything. It just 
                        means no one’s going to take you 
                        away.

                                 MILLICENT
                        So....like, If I go on a dangerous 
                        adventure to fight an evil King, 
                        you’d be my guardian and have to 
                        protect me on the way?

                                 KERMIT
                        Well, yeah. I mean, I’d do that 
                        anyway. But, yeah.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        You didn’t have to hang it up.

                                 MILLICENT
                        ‘Bastian.

                                 KERMIT
                        I just thought it might make you 
                        feel better. That I wasn’t gonna 
                        leave you or anything.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Why? Did you have plans to turn 
                        into an asshole?

                                 MILLICENT
                        Sebastian you ruin everything!

                                 KERMIT
                        This is alien to me, okay? This is 
                        so...so different. But I’m doing 
                        it, okay? I’m doing it. I’m doing 
                        it. I’m doing it. I have to do 
                        this, I want to do this.

           And Kermit, this near idiot, does not in this moment care one 
           whit if he loses his shit.

                                 KERMIT (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry, Sebastian. I’m sorry 
                        this happened to you. I’m sorry 
                        this happened to your sister. I’m 
                        sorry this happened to all of us. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 KERMIT (CONT’D)
                        If you want to hate me then hate 
                        me. I could tell you that you’re 
                        young and that you’ll grow out of 
                        this but that’s bullshit. You don’t 
                        grow out of this. It doesn’t get 
                        better it gets worse. And just 
                        because it’s quieter doesn’t mean 
                        it’s not worse. So...so yeah...
                             (sniffling, losing his 
                              point)
                        I’m a fucking cartoon.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                             (quietly)
                        I don’t hate you. I was just a 
                        little mad.

                                 KERMIT
                        Okay. Okay. Sorry.

           Sebastian goes to his room. He doesn’t slam the door.

           Kermit goes to the couch and huddles in a corner of it like a 
           teenage girl that couldn’t care less about going to the prom. 
           No, really. Couldn’t care less. Who needs the prom anyway?

           Millicent sits next to him.

                                 MILLICENT
                        I’m sorry.

                                 KERMIT
                        We apologize a lot, don’t we?

           Millicent nods emphatically.

                                 KERMIT (CONT’D)
                        Is it okay if I hug you like a 
                        pillow?

                                 MILLICENT
                        Okay! Can you put on a UFO show?

                                 KERMIT
                        I think I can handle that.

           Kermit hugs Millicent like a pillow. She smiles.

                                 MILLICENT
                        Kermie? Do you always sleep on the 
                        couch?

                                 KERMIT
                        Yeah. Beds freak me out.
                                 MILLICENT
                        Mumsy always slept on the couch 
                        too.

           TEXT: Before.

           EXT. WOODED AREA - DAY

           Teen Kermit chainsmokes and reads “The Information” by Martin 
           Amis. Sunlight flits through the canopy of trees above and 
           twinkles off the waters of a deep stream.

           Teen Alex’s head breaks the surface of the stream water.

                                 TEEN ALEX
                        Fucking beautiful out today. 

                                 TEEN KERMIT
                        I can’t believe you swim in that.

                                 TEEN ALEX
                        It’s a creek, Kermit. It’s a deep 
                        creek. Deep creeks are meant to be 
                        dived in.

                                 TEEN KERMIT
                        It’s meant to collect pesticide 
                        runoff and fish shit.

                                 TEEN ALEX
                        You suck.
                             (beat)
                        How do you like it?

                                 TEEN KERMIT
                        Like what?

                                 TEEN ALEX
                        The book, jackass.

                                 TEEN KERMIT
                        I like it.

                                 TEEN ALEX
                        Good. 
                             (beat)
                        Hey. What do you think of the name 
                        “Millicent?”
                                 TEEN KERMIT
                        I have a cousin named Millicent. 
                        Why?

                                 TEEN ALEX
                        Figured if we ever had a daughter 
                        it would be a good name. Millicent. 
                        Millie. ‘Cent.

                                 TEEN KERMIT
                        Yeah. I suppose. Don’t really think 
                        about it.

                                 TEEN ALEX
                        Why?

                                 TEEN KERMIT
                        Because... I already told you this. 
                        We’re young as shit, Allie. We’re 
                        basically fucking kids. Who knows 
                        what’s going to happen in a year or 
                        even next month?

                                 TEEN ALEX
                        What’s that supposed to mean?

                                 TEEN KERMIT
                        I dunno. Just forget about it.

                                 TEEN ALEX
                        You know exactly what you meant.

           Teen Kermit lights a cigarette and puts down the book.

                                 TEEN KERMIT
                        Well, I’m right! We’re kids for 
                        Christ’s sake. We change our minds 
                        all the fucking time. It’s stupid 
                        to think about kids and marriage 
                        now. It’s bullshit.

           Teen Alex gets out of the water, picks up her clothes, and 
           shoves an arm through her Robyn Hitchcock t-shirt. 

                                 TEEN ALEX
                             (tears pool in her eyes)
                        You think you’re being mature and 
                        reasonable, Kermit. You think 
                        you’re so goddamn smart. But you’re 
                        not. You’re a cruel, fucking idiot. 
                        And I am tired of you breaking my 
                        heart.
           Teen Alex grabs her shoes and starts to walk away. Kermit 
           calls after.

                                 TEEN KERMIT
                        Alex, come on! You know I’m right. 

                                 TEEN ALEX
                        What do you know about the future, 
                        Kermit?

                                 TEEN KERMIT
                        What? I don’t know.

                                 TEEN ALEX
                        Exactly. You don’t know shit about 
                        the future. And yet you treat it 
                        like this great fucking thing. 
                        “Ooh! The magical future! So much 
                        awesome shit is there! Don’t want 
                        to be tied up when all that awesome 
                        shit happens!”

                                 TEEN KERMIT
                             (laughing)
                        That’s not how I-

                                 TEEN ALEX
                        Did you ever once think to yourself 
                        that now, this moment, is perfectly 
                        fine? Did you ever think that this, 
                        right here, right now, is the 
                        future? Something to carry with you 
                        if that splendid fucking tomorrow 
                        turns out to be shit?

                                 TEEN KERMIT
                        Oh, come on.

                                 TEEN ALEX
                        You don’t know, Kermit. You don’t 
                        know how great we have it. You 
                        probably never will. You’re an 
                        idiot. A sad, stupid idiot, Kermit.

           Teen Alex walks away slowly.

                                 TEEN KERMIT
                        Where are you going?

                                 TEEN ALEX
                        Away.

           Teen Alex gets further away and then, still walking, looks 
           behind her.
                                 TEEN KERMIT
                             (not looking up from book)

           EXT. RED ROBIN RESTAURANT - THE NEXT DAY

           Kermit, Sebastian, and Millicent eat lunch. 

                                 SEBASTIAN
                             (eating with purpose)
                        This is good.

                                 KERMIT
                        Great. 
                             (beat)
                        So. I got a question for you guys.

                                 MILLICENT
                        Shoot.

                                 KERMIT
                        So here’s what I was thinking. The 
                        place we’re in now? Our place? It’s 
                        kinda cramped, right?

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        A little bit.

                                 MILLICENT
                        I like it.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Okay. Because I was thinking that--
                        if you want, of course--I have a 
                        house down in Florida that’s a bit 
                        bigger.

                                 MILLICENT
                        You gots two houses?

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Where in Florida? A crazy part?

                                 KERMIT
                        No. Orlando. Right by the theme 
                        parks. 
                                 SEBASTIAN
                             (inspecting a burnt french 
                              fry)
                        Okay.

                                 KERMIT
                        Yeah? We’d go after this marking 
                        period for school. You sure?

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        I hate the cold. If Millie wants to 
                        go too, I’ll go.

                                 KERMIT
                             (to Millicent)
                        So, what do you think?

                                 MILLICENT
                             (index finger on chin)
                        The theme parks you say... Hmmm. 
                        Tell me more about this “Orlando.”

                                 KERMIT
                        Uh... It’s warm. It’ll rain but 
                        only for like twenty minutes a day. 
                        There’s a little lake behind the 
                        house. Um, let’s see. Well, the 
                        theme parks of course. Disney 
                        World, Universal, Torture Aquatic 
                        Mammals World. The house has a 
                        pool. There’s little lizards and 
                        froggies everywhere. Oh! And 
                        there’s the Wizarding World of 
                        Harry Potter.

           Millicent’s eyes go wide, she puts her hand to her forehead 
           and tilts to the side out of her seat, collapsing to the 
           floor.

                                 KERMIT (CONT’D)
                        Millie?

                                 MILLICENT (O.S.)
                        Can we leave now?

           Sebastian laughs and spits burger all over Kermit’s face.

           TEXT: November.
           EXT. FRAN’S PUB & PIZZERIA, NEW HOPE, PA - NOON

           Kermit, Crispina, and Rayna sit at the outside bar. The only 
           clue that they just had pizza are the crescent crusts on 
           paper plates.

           Outdoor heaters stand high but they are not turned on.

                                 CRISPINA
                        Sixty degrees in November and 
                        you’re moving to Florida.

                                 KERMIT
                        Yeah, yeah, yeah.

                                 RAYNA
                        So are the kids excited, Kermit?

                                 KERMIT
                        Actually, they are. Even Captain 
                        Miserable himself. 

                                 CRISPINA
                        You only say that because he’s 
                        exactly like you were at that age.

                                 KERMIT
                        I was not like Sebastian.

                                 CRISPINA
                        Oh, my God! You SOOOOOOO were!
                             (to Rayna)
                        When Kermit was that age he’d 
                        always wear a black turtleneck, the 
                        same fucking hat he’s always worn, 
                        and his hair was this big bowl cut 
                        and let the bangs droop over his 
                        eyes. Oh! And he always had a candy 
                        cigarette hanging out of his mouth! 

                                 RAYNA
                        Wow!

                                 CRISPINA
                        Ha! And the glasses! He convinced 
                        our aunt to take him out for 
                        glasses and he had these wire-
                        framed granny ones but the funny 
                        thing was he lied!

                                 RAYNA
                        Lied?
                                 CRISPINA
                        To the eye doctor! He was just so 
                        desperate to have glasses that he 
                        lied when he was being tested! He 
                        spent two fucking years walking 
                        around blind with lenses he didn’t 
                        need!

           Rayna is howling.

                                 KERMIT
                        Well, I need glasses now.

                                 CRISPINA
                             (laughing)
                        Because you fucked your eyes up 
                        when you were twelve!

                                 KERMIT
                        Well, I like to think that I’m a 
                        little bit less ridiculous now.

                                 CRISPINA
                             (snorting)
                        Not really.

           And Crispina points up and down at his everyday garb of 
           shirt, jacket, filthy thin black tie, and cap.

                                 RAYNA
                        Hey. Hey, Kermit. Can I ask you 
                        something? 

                                 KERMIT
                        Please.

                                 RAYNA
                        How did you and Alexandra meet?

           Crispina shoots Rayna a look.

                                 KERMIT
                        Uh...

                                 RAYNA
                        I’m sorry. If you don’t want to-

                                 KERMIT
                        No. No, no. I’m thankful for the 
                        change of subject. We met-

           The sound of a cassette tape being fumbled and then slammed 
           into a Walkman.

           BLACK INK ON STRIP OF NOTEBOOK PAPER: Pennsbury High School.

           The sound of a plastic button being pressed.

           The Breeder’s “When I Was A Painter” plays.

           SMASH TO WASHED-OUT COLOR, NEARLY BLACK & WHITE

           EXT. PENNSBURY HIGH SCHOOL

           The last school bus pulls away. Snow falls lightly.

           Teen Kermit comes out of the school, turns a corner and leans 
           against the wall. He flips a cigarette into his mouth. Teen 
           Kermit turns his baseball capped head.

           ANGLE ON: Teen Alex twenty yards away, leaning against the 
           wall, headphones on and cassette Walkman in one hand. Teen 
           Alex: her short hair curved up under a Marlon Brando-in-The 
           Wild One peaked cap. 

                                 TEEN ALEX
                             (lip-synching to Breeders)
                        “Inside legs of corduroy I’ve been 
                        / Heard stories of air velveteen / 
                        Twenty hours later I fill the room 
                        / With bad sex and bad TV.”

           Teen Kermit turns away. He fumbles for something in his 
           pocket: a Zippo lighter with “The Pixies” scratched on it.

                                 TEEN ALEX (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Hey.

           Kermit turns. That girl is next to him.

                                 TEEN ALEX (CONT’D)
                        Got a cigarette?

                                 TEEN KERMIT
                        Sure. Here.

                                 TEEN ALEX
                        Light?

           A flick, a flame, a light.

                                 TEEN ALEX (CONT’D)
                        Thanks.
           She stays next to Teen Kermit.

                                 TEEN KERMIT
                        It’s fucking freezing out.

           Teen Alex moves a half-step closer. Her shoulder touching 
           his.

                                 TEEN ALEX
                        Let’s freeze together then.

           The music grows louder as we PULL AWAY from the two.

                        Huh.

                                 KERMIT
                        Not really a great story. But 
                        that’s how it happened.

                                 RAYNA
                        And how did you guys break up?

                                 KERMIT
                        I don’t really remember. It was 
                        just...we were and then we weren’t. 
                        And then I spent sixteen years 
                        regretting what I couldn’t really 
                        remember.

                             (gathering his things)
                        The school. Something happened with 
                        Sebastian. I gotta go.

                                 CRISPINA
                        Call me when you...

           But Kermit is already gone.

           Crispina shrugs.

           Crispina gestures without looking to the television hanging

           From OFF SCREEN, the stamp-stamp of shoes that find running 
           entirely strange. And then the shambling black mass that is 
           Kermit running inside.

           INT. SOLEBURY SCHOOL, MAIN OFFICE

           Kermit walks quickly inside and goes to the counter. A female 
           CLERK (60s) peers at Kermit over her pointed-rim glasses that 
           have a drooping beaded chain to prevent misplacement.

                        Hey.

           Kermit grabs him by the shoulders.

           Kermit, the idiot impersonator with logorrhea, shoots his 
           hand up to cover his mouth but only succeeds in poking 
           himself in the eye.

           Kermit is sitting on the couch watching staring at a Game Of 
           Thrones Blu-Ray menu on the television. Or rather, he doesn’t 
           stare at it so much as he stares through it.

           His attention, or lack thereof, is diverted by a tiny sound. 

           Millicent is on her knees in front of the sofa, her nose 
           pressed against Kermit’s fingers.

           Millicent lifts herself onto the couch, her face never 
           leaving Kermit’s hand, and lies down next to him, eyes 
           closed.

                        I’m using words to take out my 
                        frustrations, okay? Not actions. 
                        Just words. Oh, and don’t emulate 
                        this kind of speech.
                             (beat)
                        FUCKING STINKBOMBS!? That’s what 
                        passes for a serious fucking 
                        infraction these days? A goddamn  
                        stinkbomb!? Fucking abstemious, 
                        zero tolerance bullshit! Wishy-
                        washy, every child is a 
                        motherfucking snowflake, post-9/11 
                        alarmist nonsense!

           Kermit takes a deep breath and rolls down the window.
                                 KERMIT (CONT’D)
                        When your mother and I were growing 
                        up? Stinkbombs every goddamn day! I 
                        step into a school I expect it to 
                        smell like a stinkbomb. My sister 
                        Adelaide? She got into real 
                        trouble. You’re what, Sebastian? 
                        Twelve years old?

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Thirteen in February.

                                 KERMIT
                        Thirteen in February! When my 
                        sister was your age, she stole a 
                        goddamn car and drove it through 
                        the front of a Burger King. That 
                        was when she was twelve! At 
                        seventeen she was arrested for 
                        dealing drugs and spent a year in 
                        juvie. At nineteen she was arrested 
                        for selling a fucking shotgun! THAT 
                        was trouble! A fucking stinkbomb!?

           Kermit catches Sebastian’s reflection in the rearview mirror. 
           His eyes are wide open as well as his mouth.

                                 KERMIT (CONT’D)
                        You okay? I’m not mad at you at 
                        all.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        You sound exactly like mom.

                                 KERMIT
                        Fucking-A-right, I sound like your 
                        mother. We pickpocketed each 
                        other’s personalities since junior 
                        year in high school. Speaking of 
                        which, that Vice Prinicipal was 
                        lucky I was in there instead of 
                        Alex. She’d have shoved a stapler 
                        through her skull.

           Kermit takes deep breaths.

                                 KERMIT (CONT’D)
                        Okay. In conclusion: stinkbombs not 
                        a threat to National Security. I’m 
                        done. Any questions?

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Uh...you passed the house. Where 
                        are we going?
                                 KERMIT
                        GameStop. Any more?

                                 MILLICENT
                        Kermit?

                                 KERMIT
                        Yes?

                                 MILLICENT
                        Very bad language.

                                 KERMIT
                        I know. That was bad of me.

                                 MILLICENT
                        But you did sound like mumsy.
                             (beat)
                        What happened to Add-ad--

                                 MILLICENT
                        What happened to Adelaide?

                                 KERMIT
                             (deep sigh)
                        She wrapped her car around a tree 
                        five years ago.

           INT. KERMIT ST. LUCY’S PENNSYLVANIA COTTAGE - DAWN

           Kermit is in the hallway with Sebastian and Millicent. 
           Millicent carries her aquarium in her tiny arms. Mister 
           Hedgey is nonplussed.

                                 KERMIT
                        Alright. Car’s packed. The rest of 
                        the stuff is already down there 
                        waiting for us. This is your last 
                        chance to double-check. Anything 
                        you think you might want, grab it.

                                 MILLICENT
                        I got everything.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        I’m good.
                                 KERMIT
                        Okay. If you say so. I’ll meet you 
                        in the car.

           Millicent and Sebastian leave. Kermit looks around the place 
           one last time then walks out the door, locking it behind him. 

           And a car door is open and shut outside and an engine starts.

           And a car pulls way, the hum of its departure eventually 
           terminating into silence.  

           ANGLE ON: The sofa.

           ANGLE ON: Master Bedroom.

           ANGLE ON: Guest Room.

           ANGLE ON: Empty Kitchen.

           ANGLE ON: The sealed cardboard box marked “Alex’s Things.”

           And then a hum from the silence. The sound of a car door 
           opened followed by a jingling of keys and a door pushed wide.

           And Kermit grabs the box and walks out of the house.

           The sound of a door slammed shut.

           EXT. SOUTHWEST MIDDLE SCHOOL - MORNING

           Palm trees, concrete, brightly colored metal, little anole 
           lizards scampering across the warm ground and warmer sun.

           Sebastian walks from the school bus into his school. A YOUNG 
           ASIAN-AMERICAN GIRL (12yrs old) passes him quickly with a 
           tiny, circular red bookbag. 

                                 YOUNG GIRL
                             (to Sebastian)
                        Hi.

           INT. SOUTHWEST MIDDLE SCHOOL - BETWEEN CLASSES

           Sebastian stands before his locker. He has decorated the 
           inside with magazine pages advertising his favorite video 
           games: Persona 4, Atlelier Shallie, Diablo III, etc.
           He closes his locker and the Young Girl walks by again.

                                 YOUNG GIRL
                        Hi.

           EXT. SOUTHWEST MIDDLE SCHOOL - LUNCHTIME

           Sebastian does not eat his tuna sandwich, Fritos, and generic 
           grape soda lunch at the outdoor tables provided. Instead he 
           sits by himself in the shade of a palm tree. He crumples his 
           trash into a ball, plunks it into a nearby garbage can, and 
           takes out his Playstation Vita. Just then the Young Girl 
           reappears. She stands in one place this time.

                                 YOUNG GIRL
                        Hi.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Hi.

                                 YOUNG GIRL
                        Whatchya playing?

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Persona 4. Again.

                                 YOUNG GIRL
                        Oh, cool! That’s one of my 
                        favorites. You ever get into the 
                        Shin Megami Tensei Devil Summoner 
                        series for PS2? Kind of old looking 
                        but it’s a lot like Persona. 

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        No.

                                 YOUNG GIRL
                        Would you like to?

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        I...I guess. 

                                 YOUNG GIRL
                        Cool. I’ll bring ‘em in tomorrow.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        I don’t have a PS2 anymore.

                                 YOUNG GIRL
                        I got a Slim you can have. 
                        Tomorrow. Bye!
           The Young Girl walks away quickly. Her bookbag clutched 
           tightly.

           EXT. KERMIT ST. LUCY’S FLORIDA HOME - LATER

           This is not a cottage. This is a very nice four bedroom home 
           with stone tile floors and marbled counter tops. A medium 
           sized pool is screened-in to prevent people from running off 
           into the lake behind it.

           ANGLE ON: Ranma The Cat pawing the aquarium of Mister Hedgey.

                        Hey. Hey, you. What’s up? Wanna 
                        play?

                                 MILLICENT (O.S.)
                             (in hedgehog voice)
                        No, thank you. I have plenty of 
                        wood chips and water and a little 
                        wheel. That’s all I need.

                                 KERMIT (O.S.)

                        we can overthrow the humans. I’m 
                        totally not going to eat you.

                                 MILLICENT (O.S.)
                             (in hedgehog voice)
                        But the humans are nice! I protect 
                        them with my magic hedgehog powers!

                                 KERMIT (O.S.)
                             (in cat voice)
                        Magic powers?

           ANGLE ON: Kermit and Millicent lying down on their stomachs, 
           gazing at the cat and aquarium. In the corner by the 
           bookshelf is the sealed box marked “Alex’s Things.”

                                 MILLICENT
                             (in hedgehog voice)
                        Yeppers! I’m a wizard hedgehog!

                             (in cat voice)
                        Hmm. I’ve never eaten a wizard 
                        before. Wanna see my Buick?
           Kermit and Millicent crack themselves up. Sebastian comes 
           into a house echoing with their laughter. The boy walks over 
           and looks down at them in front of the cat and aquarium.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                             (smiling)
                        You having a jackass convention?

                                 MILLICENT
                             (loudly)
                        HEEE-HAAAWWW!

                                 KERMIT
                             (to Sebastian)
                        How was school today? “Shitty”, 
                        “horrible”, or “whatever?”

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Gonna have to say today was 
                        “whatever.”
                             (walks away, pauses)
                        It was also kind of cool.

           Sebastian runs up the stairs.

                                 KERMIT
                        He seems different.

                                 MILLICENT
                        Hedgehog magic?

                                 KERMIT
                        Hedgehog magic.

           EXT. SOUTHWEST MIDDLE SCHOOL - LUNCHTIME

           Under his usual tree with the Young Girl, Sebastian puts the 
           PS2 and games into his bookbag. 

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Thanks.

                        What’s your name?

                        Sebastian. Sebastian Freeport.

                                 YOUNG GIRL
                        Cool. I’m NABIKI. Nah-Bee-Key. 
                        Nabiki Shidou. That’s me.
                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Cool name.

                                 NABIKI
                        I know. We both have cool names. 
                        We’re gonna be great friends. 
                        There’s no stopping it.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Oh yeah?

                                 NABIKI
                        I believe that people who have the 
                        same number of syllables in their 
                        name are awesome for each other. 
                        Nah-Bee-Key. Three. Seh-bast-yun. 
                        Three.

                                 SEBASTIAN

           Kermit types away at his computer on a little desk. As always

                        here, her shoes were muddy so she

                        terrible ache recede, she’ll take

                        For years they swore they’d never

                        was devastated. But it was easier 
                        for us than others. I inherited a 
                        fortune. Money is more effective 
                        than a therapist.

                        I’d probably lose my fucking mind 
                        and eat a shotgun. I’m embracing 
                        that old cliche’ of “I live for the

                        I write. About Alex, their mother,

                        it. But I outsmarted myself because

                                 KERMIT
                        Uh-huh.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                             (laughing)
                        What the hell, Kermit? Aren’t you 
                        glad we both had fun? Shouldn’t you 
                        be flipping out?

                                 KERMIT
                        I am glad. I am flipping out. 
                        Really. I just have to call Aunt 
                        Cripsy and talk about some stuff, 
                        okay?

                                 MILLICENT
                        Aunt Crissssssssspeeeee!
                                 KERMIT
                        I’ll be outside, okay? Just need to 
                        talk to her.

                                 MILLICENT
                             (notices something’s off)
                        Okay.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        C’mon. I’ll show you what Nabiki 
                        taught me to draw.

           Sebastian and Millicent bound up the stairs.

           Kermit grabs a glass from the kitchen, fills it with ice, and 
           grabs an unopened bottle of scotch from a cabinet.

           He pours himself a drink and then empties the rest of the 
           bottle in the sink. Appropriately armed, Kermit goes out by 
           the pool area.

                                 KERMIT
                             (into phone)
                        Crispy, what in fuck is going on?

           INT. BALE APARTMENTS, APT.#215

           Crispina is leaning over the kitchen counter looking at 
           documents and drinking straight from a bottle of wine.

                                 CRISPINA
                        Edward Steadman has entered a 
                        petition for the termination of 
                        your guardianship.

           INTERCUT between Kermit and Crispina.

                                 KERMIT
                        What does that mean?

                                 CRISPINA
                        Ostensibly, it means he wants to 
                        take Sebastian and Millie from you. 

                                 KERMIT
                        Jesus Christ... What, what does 
                        that mean? What do I do, Crispy? 
                        Lawyer me!
                                 CRISPINA
                        The good news is that this 
                        douchebag has no intention of 
                        actually taking the kids.

                                 KERMIT
                        But you said-

                                 CRISPINA
                        It’s a shakedown, Kermit. His 
                        attorney admitted as much.

                                 KERMIT
                        You already talk-

                                 CRISPINA
                        Perks of not having a sex life? I’m 
                        a thousand fucking steps ahead of 
                        everyone. Especially some Langhorne 
                        ambulance chaser. Apparently Eddie 
                        boy googled you or something and 
                        got it into his head that you’re a 
                        fucking Daddy Warbucks.

                        D-List Nicholas Sparks knockoffs 
                        have higher sales than I do! What 
                        the fuck!?

                                 CRISPINA
                        Regardless, you’ve done pretty well 
                        yourself.

                                 KERMIT
                        That’s because I gave you nearly 
                        all my money to invest!

                                 CRISPINA
                        I am pretty fucking awesome.

                                 KERMIT
                        Cripsy!

                                 CRISPINA
                        Alright, alright. So the good news 
                        is that this is a shakedown, plus 
                        the guy has a criminal record. Get 
                        this, he’s on probation right now.
                             (beat)
                        The bad news is that this could be 
                        dragged out over a long time. Lots 
                        of time. Lots of money. For us. His 
                        attorney doing this pro-bono.

                        He sees a big fucking pay day at 
                        the end just like his client. I 
                        know the fucker. Miller & Miller & 
                        Miller. It’s one fucking guy.

                                 KERMIT
                        But if this is a shakedown and he’s 
                        a criminal-

                                 CRISPINA
                        The worst news is that he is their 
                        father. And if he suddenly decides 
                        to see this all the way through it 
                        could be hell. Because depending on 
                        the judge, they’ll look at him all 
                        cleaned up, nice hair, nice suit, 
                        and the judge’ll think, “Everyone 
                        makes mistakes. I can’t separate 
                        this man from his children.” And 
                        that’s that.

           LONG BEAT

                                 CRISPINA (CONT’D)
                        Hate to say it, but I almost wish 
                        he had a history of abusing the 
                        kids. That’d make this a cakewalk.

                                 KERMIT
                        How much does he want?

                                 CRISPINA
                        Fifty-thousand.

                                 KERMIT
                        Fifty-thousand?

                                 CRISPINA
                        Yeah.

                                 KERMIT
                        Pay it.

                                 CRISPINA
                        Kermit.

                                 KERMIT
                        Just fucking pay it. 

                                 CRISPINA
                        And after a little while he burns 
                        through that and wants another 
                        fifty. And another. Until both 
                        those kids are eighteen.
                                 KERMIT
                        I can teach at UCF. Sell both 
                        houses. Get a smaller one down 
                        here. Just pay him.

                                 CRISPINA
                        No. We’re not giving this 
                        cocksucker a cent. We fight.

                                 KERMIT
                        That’s the aunt talking. Not the 
                        attorney. Pay it.

                                 CRISPINA
                        No fucking way, Kermit. Find 
                        another lawyer if you want. I’m not 
                        letting that piece of shit take 
                        anything from you.
                             (breaks out in tears)
                        You’ve had too fucking much taken 
                        from you already.

                                 KERMIT
                        Fine.
                             (sighing defeated)
                        Fine. I trust you, Crispy.

                                 CRISPINA
                        I love you, Kermit. I’ll take care 
                        of this. We’ll take care of this.

                                 KERMIT
                        I miss Adelaide. I miss her so 
                        much. Can’t believe she’s gone 
                        either.

                                 CRISPINA
                        I miss her too. Least you got her 
                        hat.

           INT. KERMIT ST. LUCY’S FLORIDA HOME - AFTERNOON

           Sebastian is in bed, switching between texting on his phone 
           and then playing the PS2 Nabiki gave him. Kermit knocks and 
           steps inside.

                                 KERMIT
                        You guys really had fun tonight, 
                        huh?

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Yeah. Millie’s exhausted. You can 
                        probably hear her snoring.
                                 KERMIT
                        I need to talk to you for a second. 
                        You mind?

           Kermit quietly closes the door behind him.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        You don’t have to do that. Millie 
                        sleeps through anything.
                             (beat)
                        You okay?

           When Kermit speaks it is even, slow, and sad. 

                                 KERMIT
                        Guess I do a shitty job of hiding 
                        how I feel.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Well, yeah. You’re a cartoon.

                                 KERMIT
                        How...uh, what do you think about 
                        your father?

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        My father?

                                 KERMIT
                        Please.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Permission to swear?

                                 KERMIT
                        Of course. I never get mad at you 
                        when you curse. How could I? My 
                        sister’s a walking library of 
                        obscenity.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        He’s a fucking cocksucker. 

                                 KERMIT
                        Everyone says that.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Because it’s true. He’s a fucking 
                        asshole. Mom hated him. He left 
                        before Millie was even born. I 
                        barely remember what he looked 
                        like. He never hit me or anything 
                        but he was rough. A pusher. Mom 
                        burned every picture of him.
                                 KERMIT
                        I know you’re angry at him but-

                                 SEBASTIAN
                             (clenching teeth)
                        No, Kermit! I’m not “angry.” I’m 
                        not “angry” at all! I hate him. 
                        HATE HIM. I watch these movies and 
                        read these stories and they all 
                        say, “You can never really hate 
                        your father.” Like deep, deep, down 
                        there’s a place where you love him 
                        after all? No. I fucking hate him. 
                        When I think about him I’m not sad 
                        or angry. When I think about him I 
                        think of being grown up and fucking 
                        killing him.

           With those hateful words, Kermit collapses and hugs 
           Sebastian. Surprisingly, he returns it.

                                 SEBASTIAN (CONT’D)
                        What’s this all about?

                                 KERMIT
                        Your father is contesting my 
                        guardianship.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        What? Does that mean we have to 
                        live with him?

                        Aunt Crispy’s fighting it.

                        I’ll run away, Kermit. I swear to 
                        God, I’ll run away and take Millie 
                        with me. 

                                 KERMIT
                        That’s not gonna happen. You’re 
                        staying right where you are.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Don’t tell Millie. You can’t. 
                        Promise me. 

                                 KERMIT
                        I-

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Promise me.
                                 KERMIT
                        I promise.

           Kermit gets up to leave.

                                 KERMIT (CONT’D)
                        Thank you, Sebastian.

           Kermit walks out the door.

                        Kermit.

                                 KERMIT
                        Yeah.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        I...I know I give you a lot of 
                        shit. But I’m glad we’re here. And 
                        you’re here. Just...

                        Just don’t let him take us. Mom 
                        would fucking kill you.

           Kermit nods and walks downstairs.

           INT. KERMIT ST. LUCY’S FLORIDA HOME - LATER

           Kermit lies down on the couch. Then he sits up on the couch. 
           Then he goes to the kitchen and splashes water in his face. 
           Then he vomits in the sink. Then his breathing accelerates to 
           the point of hyperventilation. And his hands spasm and he 
           moves to the couch but falls to his knees. And he crawls 
           around the room muttering to himself.

                                 KERMIT
                        Ican’tdothisIcan’tdothisIcan’t...

           His hand falls on a corner of a cardboard box and he crushes 
           that corner tightly. And slowly, very slowly, his breathing 
           evens out. He stops shaking. He looks up. He knows that box: 
           “Alex’s Things.”

           Kermit, Sebastian, and Millicent are met by Crispina. They 
           are all dressed for court.

                        There’s a bench to sit on. King 
                        Cunt is on the phone right by the 
                        vending machine. You sure about 
                        this? 

                                 KERMIT
                        Yeah.

           INT. DOYLESTOWN COURTHOUSE, LOBBY AREA - MOMENTS LATER

           Kermit, Sebastian, and Millicent sit on the bench. Millicent 
           sings to herself and kicks her feet dancing while seated. 
           Kermit and Sebastian stare daggers at EDWARD STEADMAN (40yrs 
           old.) Edward has a nice suit and jacket, slicked hair, and a 
           cell phone pressed to his ear.

                                 EDWARD
                             (into phone)
                        I’m telling you, sweetie. Today’s 
                        the start of the rest of my life.
                             (laughing)
                        You know it! 
                             (lower)
                        Get this asshole to pay up and 
                        that’s that. You tell Lori yet? 

                                 MILLICENT
                        Kermit!

           Kermit stares at Edward. Kermit reaches into the interior 
           pocket of his jacket and pulls out a folded check. 

                                 MILLICENT (CONT’D)
                        Kermit!

                                 KERMIT
                        Eh?

                                 MILLICENT
                        Can I have money for the vending 
                        machine? I do believe I am 
                        hankering for a hunk of candy.

           Kermit ignores her, Sebastian hands Millicent a five dollar 
           bill.
           Kermit slips the check back into his pocket. Millicent skips 
           over to the vending machine singing loudly.

                                 MILLICENT (CONT’D)
                             (singing)
                        “Oh, my hedgehog is a wizard! / He 
                        is friends with all the lizards!”

           Edward tries to move away from the singing child but a 
           WOMAN’s back blocks him.

                                 WOMAN
                             (talking loudly into her

                             (ignoring Edward)

                        Shit. Hold on- I know, baby. I 
                        know. Just hold-

                             (louder)

                        He’ll survive in any blizzard!” 
                        Oooh! They have Twix! I looooove 
                        Twix!

           Millicent spins, her hand brushes Edward’s arm.

           Edward grabs her by the shoulder.

                                 EDWARD
                        Can you shut up, kid!?
           And Millicent falls backwards, hitting her head on the 
           vending machine. She cries loudly in pain.

           Chaos.

           Kermit and Sebastian run over to Millicent.

           The Woman talking loudly on the phone turns around: Rayna.

                                 RAYNA
                        Oh my God! Call an ambulance! He 
                        just hit that kid!

           Kermit cradles Millicent’s head.

                                 KERMIT
                        Sweetheart! Are you okay!? 
                        Sebastian! Call an ambulance!

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Millicent!

           And at those names Edward drops his phone in horror.

           Kermit removes his hand from the back of Millicent’s head. 
           Blood.

           Sebastian slams into Edward, fists flying.

                                 SEBASTIAN (CONT’D)
                        Fucking kill you! Kill you!

           Rayna comes over to Millicent, taking over for Kermit.

           And then Kermit slams Edward against the wall.

                                 KERMIT
                        You know who that is?! That’s your 
                        daughter, you fucking monster!

           The sirens from nearby Doylestown Hospital are audible in the 
           distance. 

                                 EDWARD
                        I didn’t...Ker...Kermit?

           An African-American POLICE OFFICER jogs up, others follow.

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        Hey, hey, hey! Back away from each 
                        other! What’s going on?

           Millicent sobs louder.
           RANDOM WITNESSES in the waiting area point at Edward.

                                 RANDOM WITNESS#1
                        That man pushed that little girl

                        He was on the phone! The little 
                        girl wasn’t doing shit! He pushed 
                        her and busted her head open!

                                 RANDOM WITNESS#3
                        You need to arrest that

                                 RAYNA
                        It looked like he punched her!

           The ambulance pulls up. MEDICS rush inside. 

           Kermit put his hand up to the officer.

                                 KERMIT
                        This is her blood!

           And Millicent cries even louder.

                                 POLICE OFFICER
                        Okay, tough guy.

           The Officer pushes Edward up against the wall and cuffs him 
           roughly.

                                 EDWARD
                        This is bullshit! I barely touch-

           The Police Officer, obviously not one to play Devil’s 
           Advocate in such a situation slams Edward’s face harder into 
           the wall.

                                 EDWARD (CONT’D)
                        This is brutality! Ferguson!

                                 MEDIC
                        Sir? Your daughter has a bump and a 
                        little cut. If you want, she could 
                        stay under observation at the 
                        hospital, but I doubt she has a 
                        concussion.

                        I’m your daughter. He said I’m your 
                        daughter!

           Millicent stands up and gives Kermit a giant, heart-shaking 
           hug.

           through the doors in SLO-MOTION to The Polyphonic Spree’s,

                        quiet he’d push them. Give them a 
                        little shove.
                             (beat)
                        Why?

                                 KERMIT
                        I think I have a very stupid plan.

           INT. KERMIT ST. LUCY’S FLORIDA HOME, POOLSIDE - DAY

           Kermit on phone.

                                 KERMIT
                        So what do you think?

                                 CRISPINA
                        This is the plan of an idiot. As 
                        your sister, as your attorney, and 
                        as a human being, I strongly advise 
                        against such idiocy.
                                 KERMIT
                        I’ll have a very large check as a 
                        back-up. I’m not a complete idiot.

           INT. KERMIT ST. LUCY’S FLORIDA HOME, SEBASTIAN’S ROOM - DAY

                                 KERMIT
                        Millie’s the key.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        That means we have to tell her.

                                 KERMIT
                        Yeah.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Let me do it.

           INT. KERMIT ST. LUCY’S FLORIDA HOME, LIVING ROOM

           Millicent is on the couch. Kermit and Sebastian kneel before 
           her. Sebastian holds a tiny razor blade.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        It’ll hurt a bit.

                                 MILLICENT
                        I don’t care. I’m not letting this 
                        person take us from Kermit.

                                 KERMIT
                        It will sting. 

                                 MILLICENT
                        Can you do it on my forehead? I 
                        could be like Harry Potter! “The 
                        Girl Who Lived!”

                                 KERMIT
                        No.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                             (to Kermit)
                        You sure?

                                 KERMIT
                        No!

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Kidding. Kidding.
                                 MILLICENT
                        You should do it now so I’m ready.

                                 KERMIT
                        Wait. Maybe this is-

           Sebastian ignores Kermit, reaches behind Millicent and 
           lightly draws the razor across the back of her head.

                                 MILLICENT
                        I’m ready.

           Sebastian sits back.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Already did it.

           Millicent quizzically touches the back of her head.

           She shows her hand excitedly.

                                 MILLICENT
                        Yay! Blood!

           Kermit is ready with a paper towel and bag of ice.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Now you need to cry.

                                 MILLICENT
                        Cry?

                                 KERMIT
                        Like, think of something that makes 
                        you really-

           Millicent’s lip quavers.

                                 MILLICENT
                        I---I---d-don’t...agh...ehhhhh...

           She explodes into tortured sobs, the tears falling fast from 
           her white cheeks.

           And all of a sudden...

                                 MILLICENT (CONT’D)
                        Like that?

                                 KERMIT
                        Yes.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Oh, yeah.
           She looks intently at Kermit, when she speaks it is the voice 
           of the weary.

                                 MILLICENT
                        I don’t need to think of anything 
                        to cry.

                        You know what makes me mad? I was

           INT. KERMIT ST. LUCY’S FLORIDA HOME - MORNING

           A teenage Sebastian stands by suitcases in the foyer. He is 
           taller of course, broader, but he still keeps the bowl cut. 
           An older Kermit, still youthful but beaten a little by the 
           Florida sun, stands next to him, his hands in his pockets.

                                 KERMIT
                        Last chance to bail out.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Nah, I’m good. Wish Millicent was 
                        here. 

                                 KERMIT
                        Me too. I tried to talk to her-

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        She hates goodbyes. I completely 
                        understand.

                                 KERMIT
                        You’ll like NYU. Alex loved it.

           A horn honks from outside.

           Sebastian opens the door. Soun and Nabiki are in a loaded 
           SUV.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                             (in Japanese, English 
                              subtitles)
                        I’ll be out in a moment.

           Soun and Nabiki wave at Kermit. He gives that friendly wave 
           no one ever thinks twice about.
                                 SEBASTIAN (CONT’D)
                        Listen. I...I want to tell you 
                        something. I’ve been meaning to 
                        tell you for a while, actually, 
                        but...
                             (beat)
                        You know what my favorite memory 
                        is?

                                 KERMIT
                        I still have enormous difficulty 
                        sounding your depths.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        My favorite memory is the day mom 
                        died.

           Kermit bursts out laughing from shock.

                                 SEBASTIAN (CONT’D)
                        Not when she died. But right 
                        before. We were all together. And 
                        she looked so happy. You looked so 
                        happy. Everyone was so...happy.

           Kermit embraces Sebastian.

                                 KERMIT
                             (whispering)
                        Thank you for that.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Yeah, yeah, you too.

           Sebastian picks up his bags.

                                 KERMIT
                        Last chance.

                                 SEBASTIAN
                        Take care of yourself. Take care of 
                        Millie. I’ll see you at 
                        Thanksgiving.

           And Sebastian loads up the SUV. And gets in the car. And 
           there are waves goodbye. And they pull away.

                                                           DISSOLVE TO:

           More photographs being pinned to the board.

           * A photo of Sebastian in a black NYU sweatshirt.

           * A photo of Ranma.
           * A photo of Mister Hedgey.

           * A photo of Kermit and Soun at a barbecue.

           * A photo of tiny graves marked “Ranma” and “Mister Hedgey.”

           * A photo of Teen Millicent with her friends at a theme park.

           * A photo of Teen Millicent in a graduation gown.

           And from there the photos are unpinned by the same young 
           woman’s hand and piled in a shoe box.

           INT. KERMIT ST. LUCY’S FLORIDA HOME, MILLICENT’S ROOM

           A bare poster board and a bed are all that populate the room.

                                 KERMIT (O.S.)
                        You ready? Don’t wanna miss the 
                        plane.

                                 MILLICENT
                        Coming right down.

           Millicent is older now. A young woman. She looks uncannily 
           like her mother. She takes a book out of the shoebox, puts it 
           in her purse, and walks downstairs.

           EXT. ORLANDO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT

           Kermit pulls up in the departing flights lane.

                                 KERMIT
                        You get confirmation that all your 
                        stuff is there?

                                 MILLICENT
                        Oh yeah. Just got the one suitcase.

           Millicent gets out of the car, grabs her suitcase from the 
           trunk. Kermit gets out too.

                                 MILLICENT (CONT’D)
                        Alright, dad. Big hug.

           A big hug does indeed follow.

                                 MILLICENT (CONT’D)
                        Love you.

                                 KERMIT
                        I love you too.
                                 MILLICENT
                        Here. Take this.

           Millicent pulls out The Marvelous Land Of Oz from her purse 
           and gives it to Kermit.

                                 KERMIT
                        Your old book. You know, Alex tried 
                        to give me a copy of that once. 
                        Don’t know why I didn’t take it.

                                 MILLICENT
                        Yeah, I know. I want you to have 
                        it. Don’t want to risk losing it or 
                        having it stolen during some 
                        dumbass party Emily throws.

                                 KERMIT
                        Thank you.

                                 MILLICENT
                        The first two pages have a habit of 
                        sticking together. You should pull 
                        ‘em apart when you get a chance. 
                        Foreshadowing! Oooooh! One last 
                        hug.

           There is one last hug and Millicent walks away.

                                 KERMIT
                        Call me when you land.

                                 MILLICENT
                        Absolutely!
                             (remembering)
                        Hey! This is new for you.

                                 KERMIT
                        Well, I’ve never sent you off to 
                        college before.

                                 MILLICENT
                        No. No. I mean, I’m gone and 
                        Sebastian’s gone. You’ll have 
                        plenty of time to yourself.

                                 KERMIT
                        Yeah. I suppose.

                                 MILLICENT
                        You should enjoy it. Try new things 
                        and all that.

           Kermit watches her disappear behind automatic sliding doors.

           INT. HOME OF THE FREEPORTS - LATE AFTERNOON

           Through double windows in the living room, snow can be seen 
           struggling to the ground below.

           Teen Alex and Teen Kermit stir sugar into tea cups and walk 
           to the kitchen.

                                 TEEN ALEX
                        You’ll like this, I think. It’s my 
                        favorite tea.

                                 TEEN KERMIT
                        “Cloudberry?”

                                 TEEN ALEX
                        Look, I have no idea what the fuck 
                        a “cloudberry” is either but it’s 
                        good.

                                 TEEN KERMIT
                             (sips)
                        Wow. It is.

           The doorbell RINGS.

                                 TEEN KERMIT (CONT’D)
                        Shit. What time it is?

                                 TEEN ALEX
                        It’s only four. You have to go 
                        already?

                                 TEEN KERMIT
                        My mother...she’s....I don’t know 
                        how else to say it. She’s a 
                        paranoid psycho.
                                 TEEN ALEX
                        It’s too bad. My parents aren’t 
                        coming home until Sunday. You could 
                        stay all weekend.

           Teen Kermit groans in pain, goes to Alex’s door and opens it. 
           It’s Adelaide.

                                 ADELAIDE
                        Hey, Kermit.

                                 TEEN KERMIT
                        Where’s mom?

                                 ADELAIDE
                        She’s out shopping with Aunt 
                        Michelina. She asked me to grab 
                        you. Ready?

                                 TEEN KERMIT
                             (sighing)
                        Not really. It’s stupid. I could 
                        just stay here for the weekend. Why 
                        doesn’t mom let me do anything?

                                 ADELAIDE
                        Because she’s a cunt.

           Teen Alex comes over.

                                 TEEN ALEX
                        Hello!

                                 TEEN KERMIT
                        Uh, Alex this is my sister, 
                        Adelaide. Adelaide, Alexandra 
                        Freeport.

                                 ADELAIDE
                        Wow. You are beautiful.
                             (to Teen Kermit)
                        No wonder you talk about her all 
                        the time.

                                 TEEN KERMIT
                        Addie.

                                 TEEN ALEX
                        You want to come in?

                                 ADELAIDE
                        Nah.
                             (to Kermit)
                        Tell you what. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 ADELAIDE (CONT'D)
                        I’ll make up some bullshit story 
                        and tell mom you’re staying over at 
                        my apartment to help me shovel or 
                        some shit and then we’ll 
                        conveniently get snowed in. Call me 
                        Sunday.

                                 TEEN KERMIT
                        Really?

                                 ADELAIDE
                        Yeaahhhh. I’m used to getting 
                        screamed at anyway and I haven’t 
                        taken the fall for you in a while.

                                 TEEN KERMIT
                        Thank you so much, Addie. You’re 
                        the fucking best.

                                 TEEN ALEX
                        Thank you, Adelaide.

                                 ADELAIDE
                        Wow. You seriously give me chills, 
                        girl. 
                             (to Teen Kermit)
                        Don’t do anything I wouldn’t do. 
                        Which means do exactly everything I 
                        would do.
                             (to both)
                        Later, guys.

           Adelaide walks back to her car.

                                 TEEN ALEX
                        She’s really nice.

                                 TEEN KERMIT
                        She’s the best.

           INT. HOME OF THE FREEPORTS - MOMENTS LATER

           On the couch, Teen Alex sits sideways, her legs and bare feet 
           laid across Teen Kermit’s crossed-legs. 

                                 TEEN KERMIT
                             (looking down)
                        Those are incredible ankles.

                                 TEEN ALEX
                        What?
                                 TEEN KERMIT
                        Your ankles. They’re incredible. 
                        They divot in all the right places. 
                        Very white too. I mean, you’re 
                        white, like hardcore white, but 
                        these ankles are even whiter.

                                 TEEN ALEX
                        You’re fucking awesome.

                                 TEEN KERMIT
                        I am?

                                 TEEN ALEX
                        You are.
                             (beat)
                        Bite them.

                                 TEEN KERMIT
                        Bite your ankle?

                                 TEEN ALEX
                        Say, “with this bite, I thee wed” 
                        and then bite down.

                                 TEEN KERMIT
                        Wow. Ankle marriage so soon. That’s 
                        a pretty big commitment.

                                 TEEN ALEX
                        We’ve known each other a month. 
                        That’s long enough to know what you 
                        want forever. 

                                 TEEN KERMIT
                        I agree.

           He bends down.

                                 TEEN KERMIT (CONT’D)
                        With this bite, I thee wed.

           He bites down. And then he cranes his neck to her mouth, 
           embraces and kisses her. As she moves her leg, it knocks over 
           a copy of The Marvelous Land of Oz. A foot accidently pushes 
           it under the couch.

           ANGLE ON: The book in the darkness under the couch.

           BLACK
           INT. KERMIT ST. LUCY’S FLORIDA HOME - EVENING

           Kermit enters the house carrying the book. He does not turn 
           on the lights. There is plenty of illumination from outside 
           and the television is on. He puts down the book on a counter 
           top and walks to the refrigerator...but stops and returns to 
           Oz.

           ANGLE ON: Kermit pulling apart the first two pages to reveal 
           an inscription in dull ink.

                                 TEEN ALEX (V.O.)
                        “Merry Christmas, Kermit. I am the 
                        luckiest girl in the world. So glad 
                        I decided to freeze with you that 
                        day. I love you. I love you so 
                        much. - Alexandra Freeport”

           And then below that in brighter, newer ink that could have 
           been written a day ago...

                                 ALEX (V.O.)
                        “And God help me, I still do. I 
                        love you. I do.”

           Kermit closes the book and turns off the television.

           He then walks to the corner of the room. There, underneath 
           blankets and books is a faded but still sealed box marked 
           “Alex’s Things.”

           The Innocence Mission’s “Tomorrow On The Runway” begins.

           Kermit drags the box into the light and sits down in front of 
           it.

           He finally peels off the tape.

           He opens the box and-

           THE END
