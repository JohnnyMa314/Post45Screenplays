           SIRENS. LOUD.

           THEN:

           EXT. BOSTON - CITY STREETS - NIGHT

           A POLICE CRUISER flings itself down a city block, sirens 
           screaming, tailing a GRUNGY SEDAN.

           The two do their best stock car impressions, hopping in and 
           out of traffic, jockeying to gain the upper hand -- 

           The sedan gambles on a skidding turn around a corner. The cop 
           calls. Raises. Takes the turn at speed.

           BOOM -- a throng of trash cans topple. Game over.

           As they continue to race off in search of danger, CAMERA 
           hangs behind and VOLUME BARS appear on screen, ticking up.

           Camera floats backward through the electromagnetic waves and 
           wider to REVEAL... that this has all been on a TELEVISION.

           INT. TESS & JENNA’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           The volume ticks up again as camera loses interest in the TV, 
           turning its attention toward a nearby bedroom to hear:

           GRUNTING AND MOANING. Yes, that kind.

           INT. TESS’ BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Now inside the bedroom, the noises are clearly coming from 
           TESS, 29, and her date-of-the-night, CLINGER, whose real name 
           isn’t important.

           Tess is a walking tornado: a whirlwind force of nature who’s 
           probably sucked up at least one of every drug at some point.

           Clinger slinks down under the sheets, now going down on Tess 
           with boisterous enthusiasm. Tess, however, couldn’t be more 
           bored. She’s on her PHONE, texting someone named JENNA: 

           TESS: “WHAT NOW”

           JENNA: “THE COPS ARE CHASING THE GUYS”

           TESS: “WOW THAT WAS POETRY DID YOU GO TO OXFORD”

           JENNA: “AREN’T YOU A LITTLE BUSY RIGHT NOW”
           Tess snaps a PHOTO with Clinger under the sheets. Send.

           JENNA: “UNSUBSCRIBE” 

           TESS: “LOVE YOU TOO”

           Tess hides the phone and taps Clinger on the shoulder. He 
           rises from the sheets with a doe-eyed grin. 

                                 CLINGER
                        What’s wrong, Tessy-Wes?

                                 TESS
                        Nothing. I’m just tapping out.

                                 CLINGER
                        Have you orgasmed? 

                                 TESS 
                        I have before, yes.

                                 CLINGER 
                        I can keep going if you want. 
                        Tonight is Ladies’ Night.

                                 TESS
                        Oh... no. And let’s maybe not call 
                        it that. But thank you.

                                 CLINGER
                        Just the kind of guy I am. I’m a 
                        giver, not a taker.

                                 TESS
                        Good, because “taker” sounds a 
                        little rapey.

           Clinger laughs, too hard.

                                 CLINGER
                        Tess, you’re like, super funny.

           He yawns, snuggling up to Tess. The last thing she wants.

                                 TESS
                        Wellp, I guess it’s about time you--

                                 CLINGER
                        Goodnight--

                                 TESS
                        Fell asleep here... ugh...
           Wide-eyed and trapped, Tess lies still until he falls asleep. 
           After he does, she wiggles out from under him.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           MOVING BOXES are scattered around the apartment. JENNA, 29, 
           Tess’ roommate and best friend, packs a box and watches TV.

           Jenna has a timid charm that she’s been trying for years to 
           replace with edge -- like a teenager who could never fully 
           commit to her punk phase. 

           Tess enters and makes her way to the couch. GWEN, 20s, their 
           clingy idiot third roommate, is unfortunately also present.

                                 JENNA
                        Hi, my name is Jenna and I’d like 
                        to take a moment to talk to you 
                        about personal space.

                                 TESS
                        Pass.

           She sits next to Jenna and immediately reaches for her wine.

                                 JENNA
                        Exhibit A, your honor!

                                 TESS
                        I don’t want a full glass!

                                 GWEN 
                        You can share mine.

                                 TESS
                        You have mono.

                                 GWEN
                        That was like two years ago.

           Jenna yanks the glass as Tess talks to Gwen, spilling wine.

                                 TESS
                        Thanks a lot, Gwen.

           Tess reaches into a nearby BOX and pulls out a shirt.

                                 JENNA
                        Dude, I just finished packing that.

                                 TESS
                        Don’t remind me.
           She swaps her shirt, putting Jenna’s new one on.

                                 TESS (CONT’D)
                        Who am I supposed to hang out with 
                        once you’re gone? Her?

                                 GWEN
                        Ooh, yeah. We can have sleep-overs!

                                 TESS 
                             (too aggressive)
                        Every night is a sleep-over when 
                        you live in the SAME PLACE, GWEN. 

           Tess moves to a PIANO in the corner, opens the bench’s seat 
           and pulls WEED and a PIPE out. Sits back down. Lights up.

                                 JENNA
                        What’s this one’s name?

                                 TESS
                        I want to say Steven.

                                 JENNA
                        Wow, I thought you’d be through all 
                        the normal names by now. 

           Tess jabs Jenna in the leg -- 

                                 JENNA (CONT’D)
                        Oh, now you get to D.V. me when I 
                        try to compliment your womanly 
                        conquests?

                                 TESS
                        Fuck off, you were not.

           Another play-punch from Tess.

                                 JENNA
                        What if I had been abused and this 
                        was like, some sort of trigger? 
                        That’s highly insensitive.

                                 TESS
                        I can deal with being 
                        hypothetically insensitive.

           Gwen grabs at the pipe, but Tess hands it to Jenna instead.

           Tess pulls out her phone and opens a DATING APP -- already on 
           the prowl for someone new. Swipe and click. Swipe and click.
                                 JENNA
                        What’s wrong with this guy?

                                 TESS
                        He’s a total clinger, he was 
                        proposing with his eyes already.

                                 GWEN
                        How did you hear it?

                                 JENNA
                        Shut up, Gwen. 

                                 TESS
                        Plus, his moves were just not doin’ 
                        it for me. I had to call a timeout.

                                 JENNA
                        Why not fake it?

                                 TESS
                        Faking it is for cowards. Mother 
                        Earth gave us mouths for words, not 
                        just for blowies. Read a book.

                                 GWEN
                        Did he blink the proposal to you?

                                 JENNA
                        Please. Fake orgasms are the car 
                        alarm panic button of sex. It’s too 
                        late to lock that shit up so you 
                        just honk the horn and hope he’s 
                        finished robbing your dignity.

                                 TESS
                        Are we still talking about me? 
                        ‘Cause if you mean Todd, I’d highly 
                        reconsider this move-in sitch.

           This time, Jenna rears back to jab Tess -- 

                                 TESS (CONT’D) 
                        Trigger!

                                 GWEN
                        Can you see what I’m thinking?

           Gwen stares at Tess, blinking in a pattern.

                                 JENNA
                        Aaand that’s my cue.

           Jenna moves to stand up, but Tess pulls her back down.
                                 TESS
                        Don’t leave me out here all alone!

                                 JENNA
                        Gwen’s here.

                                 TESS
                        Why would that count?

           Tess puts on her best puppy dog eyes. Jenna wants to leave, 
           but can’t bring herself to say it. She sits back down, 
           letting Tess rest her head on her shoulder.

                                 GWEN
                        Do you guys wanna--

                           TESS
                                                          JENNA
           I hope you die.
                                              No.

           Tess watches the TV with heavy eyelids. Sleep coming on fast.

           QUICK, DRUG-INDUCED DREAM SEQUENCE:

           A COLLAGE OF MOVING BOXES SWIRLS INTO A KALEIDOSCOPE -- 

           FIFTY CATS CLIMB AROUND, THEIR MEOWS MAKING SIREN NOISES --

           A GIANT CUTOUT OF GARY BUSEY’S FACE BITES GWEN’S HEAD OFF -- 

           JENNA LAUGHS, THEN JUMPS ONTO A RAINBOW AND FLIES AWAY -- 

                                 TESS (V.O.)
                        WAIT FOR ME!

           INT. LIVING ROOM - THE NEXT DAY

           Morning. Tess startles awake, now alone on the couch. She 
           finds a note that reads: “HEART YOU LATER, TESSY-WES.”

           Disgusted, she crumples the note and walks toward Jenna’s 
           room. As she opens the door, she’s already talking.

                                 TESS
                        Jenna? I was thinking today could 
                        be the day we get high and throw 
                        eggs at the Boy Scout kids--

           INT. JENNA’S ROOM - CONTINUOUS 

           Tess stops short as she realizes Jenna isn’t there. Moreover: 
           her room is almost fully packed up. In here, Tess can’t hide 
           her vulnerability behind a joke. She opens her PHONE...
           EXT. TESS & JENNA’S APARTMENT - STREET - DAY

           A crisp New England day. A car squeals up and Tess hops in.

           INT. JENNA’S CAR - MOVING - DAY

           The car is moving forward as quickly as it stopped. Jenna 
           anxiously jams the gas as Tess rests her feet on the dash.

                                 JENNA
                        Where are we going? Hospital? 
                        Planned Parenthood? I have snacks 
                        in the back if you need them.

                                 TESS 
                        Oh, no I’m fine. I just wanted to 
                        hang out and my car’s busted.

           A blink of disbelief from Jenna.

                                 JENNA
                        Your text said that you could feel 
                        the life draining from your soul.

                                 TESS
                        That was a metaphor. True, though.

                                 JENNA
                        Seriously? I should drive this car 
                        straight to the mental hospital.

                                 TESS
                        Sorry for wanting to hang with my 
                        best friend, I hardly think that 
                        qualifies for a Cuckoo’s Nesting.

                                 JENNA
                        God dammit, I don’t mean literally!  
                        I was in the middle of furniture 
                        shopping with Todd. I abandoned him 
                        at the store like a drunk mother. 
                        Did you even think about that?

                                 TESS
                        I don’t want to think about Todd 
                        picking out furniture. He wears Ed 
                        Hardy shirts.

                                 JENNA
                        That was one time.

                                 TESS
                        One time too many.
           The car slows as Jenna pulls over. Amused but exhausted.

                                 TESS (CONT’D)
                        Why are we pulling over?

                                 JENNA
                        Would you rather barrel roll out?

                                 TESS
                        You’re booting me?

                                 JENNA
                        It’s not a big deal. I just need to 
                        make sure Todd isn’t out there 
                        putting my face on a milk carton.

           Tess sighs and exits the car, still holding the door open. 

                                 TESS
                        What am I supposed to do, walk home 
                        alone down the dark, scary streets?

                                 JENNA
                        It’s noon.

                                 TESS
                        Rapists don’t have business hours.

                                 JENNA
                        I’ll come by the bar later.

           The car rumbles as Jenna keys the ignition.

                                 TESS
                        Fine. But you’re violating federal 
                        law here. No Child Left Behind.

                                 JENNA
                        You’re not my child.

                                 TESS
                        I’m someone’s child. So.

           She slams the car door shut -- 

           QUICK, ACTION-PACKED SERIES OF SHOTS:

           TWO EMPTY PINT GLASSES SLAM DOWN ONTO A BAR -- 

           SHOT GLASSES TOUCH TO LIPS, THROWN BACK -- 

           A TAP HANDLE PULLS FRESH BEER INTO A GLASS -- 
           INT. DIVE BAR - NIGHT

           Jenna and Gwen sit on stools. Tess is behind the bar, 
           thoroughly ignoring customers to hang out with her friends.

                                 TESS
                        Jenna. Truth or dare.

                                 GWEN
                        Ooh, dare. Always dare.

                                 JENNA
                        I don’t like this game.

                                 TESS
                        Because you’re a dirty liar?

                                 JENNA
                        Why am I a liar?

                                 TESS
                        Only a fucking liar would allow  
                        Todd to buy a snake skin sofa. 

           Gwen cackles a laugh.

                                 JENNA
                        I can’t just tell him “no,” it 
                        would hurt his feelings. 

                                 TESS
                        So! What’re you afraid of?

                                 JENNA
                        South American insects. Long 
                        fingernails. Dying alone.

                                 GWEN
                        I’m afraid of velvet.

           On the drunk scale, Gwen’s at “struggling to open peanuts.”

                                 TESS
                        I’m this close to cutting you off.

                                 GWEN
                        I’m not even that drunk.

                                 TESS
                        No, Gwen. From communication. 

           Gwen shrugs and slugs from her beer.
                                 TESS (CONT’D)
                        One more question. Was it warm 
                        inside of the costume? When you 
                        played the Cowardly Lion?

           Gwen raises a hand for a high-five. Tess ignores her.

                                 JENNA
                        Obviously that makes you two 
                        Scarecrow and Tin Man, yes?

                                 TESS
                        Hell yeah, I’m fucking metal.

                                 JENNA
                        How about another beer then, you 
                        heartless asshole?

                                 TESS
                        Are you sure? I bet I could find 
                        some warm milk instead.

           Jenna makes a “shoo” motion with her hand. Tess crosses off.

           BEHIND THE BAR:

           Tess pulls a tap, but it’s dry. She turns and heads to the:

           BACK ROOM:

           Tess finds a BAR EMPLOYEE, KYLE, and approaches.

                                 TESS (CONT’D)
                        Kyle, the keg on three kicked.

                                 KYLE
                        Why can’t you change it?

                                 TESS 
                        Oh, because I don’t want to.

           Kyle rolls his eyes and leaves to find a keg.

           Bored, Tess opens the DATING APP on her phone yet again. 
           Swipe. Douchebag. Swipe. Dick pic. Swipe. Definitely not.

           She swipes once more and a NOTIFICATION pops up:

           INSERT NOTIFICATION: A frowny face with the text: “You have 
           run out of options. Please try again later.”

           She fiddles with a few buttons, confused, until the 
           realization hits: “YOU HAVE RUN OUT OF OPTIONS.”
                                 TESS (CONT’D)
                        What the dick?

           BACK AT THE BAR:

           TODD, 30, Jenna’s boyfriend, has now joined the group. He’s 
           nonthreatening, though Tess treats him as the opposite.

                                 TODD
                        Isn’t it dope? It’s hand-crafted 
                        from old Norwegian windmill blades.

           Gwen squints at a PHOTO of a tacky table on Todd’s phone. 

                                 GWEN
                        Is it like a Magic Eye?

           Tess approaches, hurrying a few drinks to her friends.

                                 TESS
                        Jenna, I have to pee. Let’s go.

                                 JENNA
                        Todd’s here. 

                                 TESS
                        I said hello. Did I not say hello?

                                 TODD
                        Hi, Tess. Cry wolf lately?

                                 TESS
                        Jenna hates your furniture.

                                 JENNA
                        Jesus! Fine, I’ll go to the fucking 
                        bathroom with you.

           Tess hooks Jenna’s arm, leading her away.

                                 GWEN
                        I have to go, too.

                                 TESS
                        No you don’t.

           The two girls scurry off, leaving Gwen alone with Todd.

           INT. DIVE BAR - WOMEN’S RESTROOM - LATER

           Jenna pees in a stall, Tess sits on the floor outside it. Two 
           girls having a drunken heart to heart. Emphasis on drunken. 
                                 TESS 
                        What if I’ve been waiting too long?

                                 JENNA
                        In the bathroom? Nobody’s noticed.

           Jenna flushes and exits the stall, washing her hands.

                                 TESS
                        No, to find someone or settle down 
                        or whatever. I mean I don’t know if 
                        I want that right now, but what if 
                        the world won’t wait for me?

                                 JENNA
                        I mean, it won’t. The world does 
                        whatever the fuck it wants. If the 
                        world was waiting for people, we 
                        wouldn’t have hurricanes and shit.

           Tess lets out an annoyed grunt as Jenna sits on the counter.

                                 TESS
                        I might as well buy a cat. Just 
                        hand me all the cats now, let’s get 
                        my future over with.

                                 JENNA
                        Dude, you couldn’t even handle a 
                        cat, let alone all the cats. Maybe 
                        you could become a fish lady or a 
                        gerbil lady.

                                 TESS
                        I hate gerbils.

                                 JENNA
                        Nobody likes gerbils. That’s why we 
                        give them to hyper kids as pets. 

           A FEMALE PATRON washes her hands. Jenna hands her a towel. 

                                 JENNA (CONT’D)
                        I thought you didn’t want a real 
                        relationship?

                                 TESS
                        I don’t. Or... I don’t know. I 
                        thought I’d have more time. Now all 
                        that’s left to do is choke on a 
                        Lean Cuisine in our apartment.
                             (correcting herself)
                        My apartment.
           Jenna picks up on the subtle disappointment, perhaps the real 
           reason behind this meltdown... but doesn’t bite.

                                 TESS (CONT’D)
                        Or worse, die with Gwen.

           Jenna hops off the counter, quickly spreads some paper towels 
           out onto the dirty floor, and sits on them next to Tess.

                                 JENNA
                        Look at me. I know you’re panicking 
                        about dying alone like that isn’t 
                        gonna happen to us all anyway. We 
                        don’t even get to chill in a room 
                        with our pets and shit anymore like 
                        the Egyptians. Literally everyone 
                        just lies in a metal box alone 
                        until our eyeballs explode.

                                 TESS
                        Do you think you’re helping?

                                 JENNA 
                        But you’re not dead yet. 
                        Relationships are crazy, I know. 
                        Fuck it up and you could end up 
                        with some psycho drug dealer. But 
                        you need to realize that the 
                        terrible, insane roller coaster of 
                        pain and trouble you go through 
                        when you put yourself out there can 
                        be worth it for the right person.

           A beat for that to soak in. Maybe two.

                                 TESS
                        When did you get so insightful?

                                 JENNA
                        Somewhere around beer four?

           Jenna hands a NEW PATRON paper towels and receives a TIP. 

                                 TESS
                        Okay, so where do I go to meet the 
                        right person? A bookstore? Amazon!

           Tess starts to stand up. Jenna pulls her back down.

                                 JENNA
                        Bookstores barely exist, what 
                        century do you think you’re in? Are 
                        you a time traveler? 
                                 (MORE)
                                 JENNA (CONT'D)
                        If you are and you didn’t tell me, 
                        I’m gonna be super peeved.

                                 TESS
                        Where then?

           Light bulb. Jenna perks up -- 

                                 JENNA
                        What about a blind date?

                                 TESS
                        Ugh, no. You went too far, reel it 
                        back to this century.

                                 JENNA
                        No profiles, no apps, no 
                        preconceived opinions. Just a 
                        regular date with a human male.

                                 TESS
                        You’re right.

           Tess leans over and dumps her CELL PHONE into a toilet.

                                 JENNA
                        I didn’t mean--

                                 TESS
                        It’s done.

                                 JENNA
                        Fine, then I’m setting you up! Soon 
                        enough we’ll be having couples 
                        dinners, houses on the same block--

                                 TESS
                        That sounds gross.

                                 JENNA
                        Grosser than this bathroom floor?

           Tess regards her situation. It is indeed gross.

                                 TESS
                        Fuck it, I’m in. What do I do?

           A deep, excited breath from Jenna as we SMASH TO:

           INT. TESS & JENNA’S APARTMENT - A FEW DAYS LATER

           Now the evening of the blind date, Tess is busy prepping.
           SERIES OF QUICK, ACTION-PACKED SHOTS:

           AS JENNA’S DRUNKEN V.O. CONTINUES OVER THE SCENE, THE 
           CHARACTERS ON SCREEN MOUTH ALONG WITH IT.

                                 JENNA (V.O.) 
                        First things first, you’re gonna 
                        clean your business up. This will 
                        not be another chapter in your 
                        forthcoming novel, “How to Get Laid 
                        Without Leaving Your Apartment.”

           A GLINTING RAZOR DRAGS SHAVING CREAM OFF OF TESS’ HAIRY LEG -- 

           A BRA IS CLIPPED ONTO TESS’ BACK LIKE SHOULDER HOLSTERS -- 

           TESS SECURES HER PURSE STRAP, SHEATHES HER PHONE -- 

                                 JENNA (V.O.)
                        Then you’re gonna look in the 
                        mirror and tell yourself:

           TESS STARES INTO A MIRROR, MOUTHING ALONG -- 

                                 TESS/JENNA (V.O.)
                        “Your 401K plans and intentionally-
                        grown facial hair do not intimidate 
                        me. I will march out there and nail 
                        this date in more ways than one.”

           LATER, AT A RESTAURANT, A HOT MANLY GUY APPROACHES TESS -- 

                                 JENNA (V.O.)
                        He’ll shake your hand and be like: 

           NOW MANLY GUY MOUTHS ALONG -- 

                                 MANLY GUY/JENNA (V.O.)
                        “I’m not a sad little boy like the 
                        guys you usually date. I’m a man.”
                             (burp)
                        “I wear gasoline-scented cologne 
                        and carve wooden bowls for homeless 
                        cancer kids to eat out of.”

           FAST FORWARD: MANLY GUY AND TESS EAT DINNER, WALK HOME -- 

                                 JENNA (V.O.)
                        Then he walks you home and is all:

                                 MANLY GUY/JENNA (V.O.)
                        “Will you marry me you beautiful 
                        goddess woman?” And you’ll be like:
                                 TESS/JENNA (V.O.)
                             (hiccup)
                        “I don’t know. Maybe. Whatever.”

           SOMEHOW, THIS MAKES MANLY GUY SWOON EVEN HARDER -- 

                                 JENNA (V.O.)
                        Piece of cake.

           ALL OF THE PREVIOUS SNIPPETS REWIND, UNTIL WE’RE BACK IN 
           TESS’ ROOM. SHE LOOKS IN THE MIRROR, SATISFIED. THIS’LL DO.

           INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Semi-fine dining. Three dollar signs on Yelp. 

           MYSTERY DATE, 30s, white shirt and jeans, sits alone at a 
           table for two. Obviously waiting for Tess.

           EXT. RESTAURANT - STREET - SAME

           Outside, A BLACKED-OUT SUV sits parked near the crowd of 
           evening socialites. CAMERA inspects the car, floating inside:

           INT. BLACKED-OUT SUV - CONTINUOUS 

           DOUG, 30s, sits in the SUV wearing almost the exact same 
           outfit as Mystery Date. Doug is big-hearted, tough, and loyal 
           to a fault -- like if Prince Charming grew up on the streets 
           of South Boston. He’s watching a HOW-TO VIDEO on his phone.

           INSERT VIDEO: “WHAT IS TISSUE PAPER?” Martha Stewart-esque.

           A TEXT MESSAGE interrupts the video. FROM: “KEATON”

           “YOU’RE LATE, GET IN THERE. DO NOT FUCK THIS UP AGAIN, DOUG.”

           Doug closes the message and steels himself, determined. He 
           glances to the passenger seat, where a nicely-crafted GIFT 
           BAG sits, and reaches all the way under the seat to pull out:

           A BRICK OF COCAINE.

           He carefully stuffs the drugs into the bag and exits the car.

           EXT. RESTAURANT - CONTINUOUS

           Doug ducks into the restaurant, gift bag in hand.
           MOMENTS LATER, Tess appears. Now cleaned up and ready to 
           roll, she crosses the street and enters the restaurant.

           INT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT

           Tess enters the restaurant, annoyed to find a long line to 
           speak to the HOSTESS. She bypasses the line entirely, sees 
           DOUG sitting alone at a table, and approaches.

                                 TESS
                        Hi, sorry I’m late. You must be--

                                 DOUG
                        Doug.

           Doug speaks with a Southie accent, albeit an endearing one.

                                 TESS
                        Doug, hey. I’m Tess. All I got was 
                        “white shirt and jeans,” so it’s 
                        nice to finally put a face to that. 
                        I was picturing a coat hanger with 
                        those clothes on it flying around, 
                        which would’ve been super spooky.

           Doug takes a sip of water, not getting it.

                                 DOUG
                        Okay. 

                                 TESS
                        Sorry, I’m a little nervous. I’m 
                        being weird, aren’t I?

                                 DOUG
                        Nah. You’re good. Just act natural 
                        and we’ll be fine.

                                 TESS 
                        Good tip. That’s a good tip. Sorry, 
                        it’s been a while since I actually 
                        did this for real.

                                 DOUG
                        That’s alright, I’ve done this like 
                        a million times and I still get mad 
                        nervous out in public like this.

                                 TESS
                        Me too.
                                 DOUG
                        I usually like spots that are a 
                        little less crowded, but I guess 
                        you guys liked this place?

                                 TESS
                        I didn’t really get a say.

                                 DOUG
                        Ugh, I know how that goes.

                                 TESS
                        You work with Todd or something?

                                 DOUG
                        Nah, I work with Keaton and Blair.

                                 TESS
                        I don’t know them.

                                 DOUG
                        That’s the way they like it.

           Now Tess doesn’t get it.

                                 TESS 
                        Okay...

           MYSTERY DATE’S TABLE: 

           Way on the other side of the restaurant, Mystery Date gathers 
           his things as a WAITER approaches.

                                 WAITER
                        Are we ready to order?

                                 MYSTERY DATE
                        I’m actually gonna take off.

                                 WAITER
                        I see you enjoyed the free bread 
                        and water. 

                                 MYSTERY DATE
                        No, it’s just my date didn’t--

           But the Waiter’s already gone. Mystery Date exits, dejected.

           BACK TO TESS’ TABLE:

           Doug nervously shovels bread and water into his mouth. Tess 
           notices but tries not to pry, picking up her MENU instead.
                                 TESS
                        What’re you gonna order?

                                 DOUG
                        We’re actually ordering?

                                 TESS
                        That’s what you usually do after 
                        they hand you the menu.

           THE SAME WAITER approaches before they can answer.

                                 WAITER
                        Have you folks decided?

                                 DOUG
                        I think we’re set with bread and 
                        water for now, chief.

                                 WAITER
                        Fuck this job.

           The Waiter stomps off, over it.

                                 TESS
                        We don’t have to get food.

                                 DOUG
                        Do you eat every time?

                                 TESS
                        What have you heard about me?

                                 DOUG
                        Nothing, I usually just try to get 
                        this part over with pretty quick.

           Tess makes a face, not sure how to take that. 

                                 TESS
                        Look, this is weird. We’re holding 
                        up a table. If we’re not gonna 
                        order anything, we should leave.

                                 DOUG
                        Yeah, okay. Sorry, it’s just... I 
                        usually fuck these up. But I really 
                        don’t want to this time.

           Tess sighs out a smile, charmed despite herself.

                                 TESS
                        Would you want to walk me home, or 
                        do you try not to do that, too?
                                 DOUG
                        No, no, I can do that.

           She gathers her belongings and exits. Doug follows behind. 

           EXT. KEATON’S HOME BASE - AFFLUENT NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT

           BLAIR, 50s, a calm, cold-blooded silver fox, approaches an 
           upper-class home. Not a place you’d expect to find drug 
           dealers. He KNOCKS, adjusting his designer glasses, and -- 

           KEATON, 50s, his sister and literal partner in crime, answers 
           the door -- a sharp, brazen veteran who doesn’t suffer fools.

                                 KEATON
                        You’re not supposed to use the 
                        front door.

                                 BLAIR
                        We have a bigger problem.

           EXT. TESS & JENNA’S APARTMENT - STREET - NIGHT

           Night falls as Doug and Tess walk and talk toward her 
           apartment building. Charming in its negligent upkeep. 

                                 DOUG
                        Robin Hood. No doubt about it.

                                 TESS
                        Seriously? Me too! Guys always say 
                        Prince Charming just to be cute. 
                        Once in a while Hercules, but--

                                 DOUG
                        Not me. Robin Hood was pulling mad 
                        cash and still looked out for his 
                        people. Where I’m from, that’s 
                        worth way more than super strength. 

                                 TESS
                        I just thought he was the hottest.

                                 DOUG
                        What? He was an animal!

                                 TESS
                        Yeah, a fox. 

           They chuckle playfully as they reach Tess’ front door.
                                 DOUG
                        I don’t wanna jinx it, but this is 
                        like the best one of these has ever 
                        gone for me.

                                 TESS
                        Yeah. Me too, actually.

                                 DOUG
                        So... where do you wanna do this?

                                 TESS
                        What?

                                 DOUG
                        Out here could be good. You can’t 
                        really see much from the street.

                                 TESS 
                             (off-put)
                        Wow, I mean... I had fun, but I 
                        think I’m gonna call it a night.

           Doug holds out his GIFT BAG, handing it to Tess.

                                 DOUG
                        I’m just gonna hand this to you.

                                 TESS
                        You didn’t have to do that.

                                 DOUG
                        I didn’t want it to look weird out 
                        in the open, so I thought I should 
                        put it in a bag or somethin’. It 
                        looks wicked legit though, right?

                                 TESS
                        Yeah, it looks great.

                                 DOUG
                        I watched a video.

           A moment of awkward silence. Time to go.

                                 TESS
                        Well, thanks for the bread.

           She kisses Doug on the cheek, then ducks into the apartment.

                                 DOUG
                             (calling after)
                        Our guys will be in touch!
           He stares for a moment, confused by the kiss. Then walks off.

           INT. TESS & JENNA’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Equally confused, Tess hovers at the door.

                                 TESS
                             (to self)
                        “Our guys?”

           The noise alerts Jenna, who enters like Tess is past curfew.

                                 JENNA
                        What the H-E-double-hockey-fucks?

                                 TESS
                        What did I do now?

                                 JENNA
                        Your date, genius. The one I slaved 
                        over setting you up on?

                                 TESS
                        Let’s be careful about how we’re 
                        using the word “slaved.”

                                 JENNA
                        Why did you flake out? I thought 
                        you wanted to give this a shot.

                                 TESS
                        First of all, I did go on your 
                        date. Boom. Proof.

           Tess drops the GIFT BAG onto the counter for emphasis. 

                                 TESS (CONT’D)
                        Also, Doug was weird. I feel like I 
                        should be the one yelling.

                                 JENNA
                        Who is Doug?

                                 TESS
                        The guy you set me up with!

                                 JENNA
                        I only know one person named Doug 
                        and he is a cartoon.

                                 TESS
                        Then who just gave me this?
           Their eyes dart to the gift bag on the table. Tess walks over 
           and reaches into the bag, pulling out: THE BRICK OF COCAINE.

                                 JENNA
                        Is that...

                                 TESS
                        I just got a boner.

           EXT. STREETS - NIGHT

           Doug is walking down the street when his phone rings: 
           “KEATON.” He burps, waves the smell away, and then answers.

                                 DOUG
                        Hey, boss. Quick question. That 
                        thing about your stomach expanding 
                        and blowin’ up if you eat too much 
                        bread and water is just like an old 
                        wise tale, right?

           INT. KEATON’S HOME BASE - LIVING ROOM - SAME

           A home base that looks an awful lot like a regular home. 
           Scented candles. Crown molding. She’s hidden herself well.

                                 KEATON
                        Did you say wise tale?

           Blair reaches for a nice whiskey, but Keaton slaps it away.

           INTERCUT DOUG/KEATON:

                                 DOUG
                        Yeah, like people cracking wise, 
                        fucking with you or whatever.

                                 KEATON
                        It’s wives’ tale. But that bread 
                        thing is true, it happened to a 
                        bunch of concentration camp people.

                                 DOUG
                        Oh, for real? That’s too bad.

                                 KEATON
                        It is too bad. You know what else 
                        is too bad?

                                 DOUG
                        What?
                                 KEATON
                        My brother got a very upsetting 
                        call from our buyers. They said 
                        they waited for you to deliver the 
                        product and you never showed.

                                 DOUG
                        Fuck that, I just handed it off.

                                 KEATON
                        Where?

                                 DOUG
                        The place they told me to be! I got 
                        a note under my door yesterday.

                                 KEATON
                        Who did you meet with?

                                 DOUG
                        Their girl. Her name was Tess.

                                 KEATON
                        What did she look like?

                                 DOUG
                        Nice hair. Dressed up. Didn’t look 
                        like a dealer, that’s for sure.

                                 KEATON
                        Do you think maybe she didn’t look 
                        like a dealer because she FUCKING 
                        WASN’T ONE?

           The realization hits Doug. He mouths “fuck” over and over.

           INT. TESS & JENNA’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Tess and Jenna stare at the brick of cocaine. Faces blank.

                                 TESS
                        Do you think it’s okay to keep?

                                 JENNA
                        No, I don’t think this is okay to 
                        keep. Nothing about this is okay.

                                 TESS
                        What do we do then?

                                 JENNA
                        Flush it! Flush it like they do on 
                        fucking The Wire, I don’t know!
                                 TESS
                        Do you know how hard it is to get 
                        real coke as an adult? We can’t 
                        just flush this heavenly gift down 
                        the same place you take your dumps.

           Tess grabs some nearby SCISSORS and cuts a sliver of the bag 
           open. Then SNORTS SOME POWDER RIGHT OFF THE SCISSORS.

                                 JENNA 
                        What’re you--

           She holds the scissors out to Jenna.

                                 JENNA (CONT’D)
                        No way. The first and last time I 
                        did coke I stayed up for three days 
                        cross-stitching.

                                 TESS
                        And where would our walls be 
                        without that?

           A closer look at the walls reveals spastic CROSS-STITCHINGS 
           of birds, cities, celebrities -- all of them terrible.

           Jenna stares at the drugs, contemplating.

                                 TESS (CONT’D)
                        Come on. This may be our last 
                        chance to do something dumb 
                        together before you’re domesticated 
                        by a Norwegian windmill blade.

           An eye roll from Jenna. She leans down, SNORTS -- 

                                 JENNA
                        Mother-FUCK!

           BACK TO DOUG/KEATON:

                                 DOUG
                        I’m sorry, Keaton. It was an 
                        accident. She just seemed nice, I--

                                 KEATON
                        Nice? If this goes any further 
                        south, we’ll all end up in fucking 
                        caskets. Does that sound nice?

                                 DOUG
                        No, ma’am.
                                 KEATON
                        No. So why don’t you get the 
                        package, get the girl, and get the 
                        hell back here to sort it out.

           Doug listens, tail between his legs. 

                                 DOUG
                        Why the girl?

                                 KEATON
                        Proof! We need to convince them 
                        this bullshit mix-up is real, Doug. 
                        I’m not sure showing them your SAT 
                        scores is gonna be enough.

                                 DOUG 
                        Right...

                                 KEATON
                        Now, where are you?

           Doug looks up to street signs, orienting himself.

           INT. TESS & JENNA’S APARTMENT - BATHROOM - NIGHT

           NOW HIGH, Tess and Jenna hold the drugs above the toilet.

                                 TESS/JENNA
                        One, two, three--

           Jenna lets go of her side of the brick, but Tess refuses.

                                 JENNA 
                        Tess! This is the fifth time we’ve 
                        done this for fuck’s sake!

           Jenna’s spastic hands struggle to pry the brick from Tess, 
           accidentally DUMPING the drugs in and around the toilet.

                                 JENNA (CONT’D)
                        Why did you do that?!

                                 TESS
                        Boo hoo, what’s the big deal?

                                 JENNA
                        The cocaine. The cocaine is 
                        obviously the big deal.

           They both drop down onto their knees, trying to clean it up.

           KNOCK, KNOCK, KNOCK.
                                 TESS
                        Stop it, I’m doing it. You don’t 
                        need to make a bunch of noise.

                                 JENNA
                        I’m not doing that noise.

                                 TESS
                        What is it then? It feels like it’s 
                        coming from my corneas.

           They stand there for a second, not getting it, then -- 

                                 JENNA
                        The door!

                                 TESS
                        Uh oh.

                                 JENNA
                        WHY “UH OH?”

           INT. KEATON’S HOME BASE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Keaton paces back and forth. Blair sits sipping a scotch, too 
           cool for panic. Or perhaps just a tad too psychotic.

                                 KEATON
                        I have to call the buyers.

                                 BLAIR
                        Call them? Are you out of your 
                        actual mind? We’re talking about a 
                        guy who once set a man on fire and 
                        then used that man to light his 
                        entire family on fire.

                                 KEATON
                        That’s exactly why I need to call! 
                        If they think we bailed on purpose, 
                        we’re dead! We have to try to 
                        maintain an honest relationship.

                                 BLAIR
                        Honest relationship? We’re still 
                        dealing in illegal narcotics, yes?

                                 KEATON
                        Don’t get cute.

                                 BLAIR
                        Get cute? I mean, look at me.
           Keaton scoffs, upset she walked into that one.

                                 KEATON
                        If I could go back in time, I’d--

                                 BLAIR
                        Tell mom to have an abortion?

                                 KEATON
                        No. I’d go back, study to become a 
                        doctor, and then do it myself.

           Blair nurses hurt feelings with a sip of scotch.

           INT. TESS & JENNA’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           The KNOCKING has grown louder now. Tess slowly army crawls to 
           the door, peeking through the blinds to see: DOUG.

                                 DOUG
                        Hi.

           The blinds snap shut.

                                 TESS
                        He saw me.

                                 JENNA
                        How does he know where we live?

                                 TESS
                        I kinda asked him to walk me home.

                                 JENNA
                        WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

                                 TESS
                        You told me to! I was still 
                        deciding if I was gonna bone him!

                                 JENNA
                        Hi, I’m Tess, I’m so stupid I 
                        almost had sexual relations with a 
                        drug dealer named DOUG.

                                 DOUG (O.S.)
                        Open up or I’ll punch it down!

                                 JENNA
                        If you get another one of our doors 
                        broken down, I swear to god. 

           Tess opens the door. Doug slips in, shutting it behind him.
                                 DOUG
                        I need you to gimme back the gift I 
                        gave you. It’s the wrong... size.

                                 TESS
                        We know it was drugs, friend-o.

                                 JENNA
                        Tess!

                                 TESS
                        It’s not like he doesn’t know!

                                 JENNA
                        Stop yelling! It’s making my heart 
                        beat out of my fucking chest!

                                 TESS
                        That’s OBVIOUSLY the drugs!

           Doug can’t believe his ears. He pulls a HANDGUN out of his 
           waistband, instantly quieting the girls.

                                 DOUG
                        You took some of the drugs?

                                 TESS 
                        I’ll answer that if you promise to 
                        never go in the bathroom.

           INT. KEATON’S HOME BASE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Keaton raises a phone to her ear. Deep breath.

                                 KEATON
                        Eugene, hi. It’s Keaton. Keaton. 
                        Your supplier. Oh, you -- I see. 
                        Funny joke, Eugene. That’s good.

           INT. EUGENE’S APARTMENT - SHITTY NEIGHBORHOOD - SAME

           A stark change of scenery. Dimly lit. Henchmen counting cash.

           EUGENE, 30s, sits in a beanbag chair wearing gold L.A. Lights 
           and a leather snapback. Equal parts unhinged and exasperated, 
           Eugene would kill his own mother if it made him a buck.

                                 EUGENE
                        Hurts your feelings when someone 
                        forgets who you are, doesn’t it?
           Eugene’s cronies, ZIGGY and FINCH, listen nearby. ZIGGY, 30s 
           female, is a quirky, over-caffeinated enforcer. FINCH, 30s 
           male, is a whiny, wiry buzzkill.

           INTERCUT KEATON/EUGENE:

                                 KEATON
                        I didn’t forget who you are, 
                        Eugene, I would never do that!
                             (listening)
                        I know you had someone waiting. I 
                        know that’s embarrassing. I don’t 
                        like being stood up, either. 
                             (listening)
                        That’s why I wanted to reach out 
                        myself and explain the situation!

                                 EUGENE
                        Situation? Here’s the situation. I 
                        paid you for drugs. You didn’t 
                        deliver those drugs. And now I have 
                        to murder someone about it!

                                 KEATON
                        Whoa, whoa, whoa. Just hang on. Is 
                        it at all possible that one of your 
                        guys accidentally gave Doug the 
                        wrong address?

           Eugene turns to Finch -- 

                                 EUGENE
                        Did you give Doug the wrong place?

                                 FINCH
                             (overly-defensive)
                        No way! Why would I do that?

                                 EUGENE
                             (into phone)
                        No. Not possible.

           Keaton inhales a deep breath. Not sure where to begin.

                                 KEATON
                        Look. You and I know in our line of 
                        work, not everybody has a proper 
                        education. Sometimes people like 
                        you and I... we have to put up with 
                        a certain level of... stupidity.

           Eugene glances to Ziggy and Finch. Blank stares all around.
                                 EUGENE
                        I’m familiar.

                                 KEATON
                        Well, one of our guys, Doug... is 
                        the exact kind of stupidity I’m 
                        talking about. What happened is, 
                        well, he made a little... boo boo.

                          EUGENE
                                                          BLAIR
           Boo boo?
                                              Boo boo?

                                 KEATON (CONT’D)
                        Yes. A boo boo.

           Keaton listens, then sighs. Can’t believe what she’s saying.

                                 KEATON (CONT’D)
                        It’s kind of hilarious when you 
                        think about it, but it sounds like 
                        Doug went to the wrong restaurant, 
                        and then accidentally delivered 
                        your product to... a random girl.
                             (beat, listening)
                        It’s September, so... no. This 
                        wouldn’t be for April Fools.
                             (listening)
                        Look, I’m gonna kill the girl 
                        that’s involved, Eugene! 
                             (listening)
                        Of course I can show you the body. 
                        I wouldn’t have it any other way!

           BACK TO TESS & JENNA’S APARTMENT:

           Doug walks from the bathroom to the couch and flops down, GUN 
           still in his hand. Jenna approaches cautiously. 

                                 JENNA
                        Hey... buddy. Can we get you 
                        anything? Water? Pop Tart? 

                                 TESS
                        Ooh, make it two.

           Jenna shoots Tess a look -- make your own.  

                                 DOUG
                        You have no idea what you just did.

                                 TESS
                        Sure we do. We all just went over 
                        there and looked at it.
                                 DOUG
                        You know how when you’re on coke 
                        you feel like you can do anything?

                                 TESS 
                        I can do anything. I’m a twenty-
                        first century woman.

                                 JENNA
                        Preach.

                                 DOUG
                        This drug is like that, times ten. 

                                 JENNA
                        Wait, this wasn’t coke?

                                 DOUG
                        It’s synthetic. Purest shit on the 
                        market. Nobody has it but us.

                                 JENNA
                        Does it have a cool nickname?

                                 DOUG
                        No? I don’t know. Like “really, 
                        really awesome drugs.”

                                 JENNA
                        How about “fuck-dust?”

                                 DOUG
                        Are you even listening?

           Tess blinks at Doug, then at his gun -- eyes wild.

                                 TESS
                        Times ten you said?

                                 DOUG
                        Yeah...

                                 TESS
                        I think it’s kicking in.

           In a flash, Tess turns and RUNS FOR THE KITCHEN. Doug sprints 
           after her, Jenna in tow, lunging toward the counter -- 

           Doug grabs Tess’ arm, holding her back, but Jenna dives onto 
           his leg, keeping him from grabbing her entirely.

           Tess stretches her fingers toward a KNIFE BLOCK, inching for 
           a weapon, but can’t quite make contact.
                                 DOUG
                        I’m stronger than you. 

                                 TESS
                        Maybe physically, but my will power 
                        is through the roof right now.

                                 JENNA
                        GWENNN! GWEN, GET IN HERE!

                                 DOUG
                        Who’s Gwen? Is someone else here?

           Right on cue, Gwen emerges from her room holding a CAT. The 
           trio momentarily stops struggling, holding their ground.

                                 JENNA
                        You have a cat?

                                 GWEN
                        There are a lot of things you guys 
                        would know about me if you took the 
                        time to ask.

                                 TESS
                             (too aggressive)
                        OUR BUILDING DOESN’T ALLOW PETS, 
                        YOU DICK. NOW HELP US!

           Doug snaps back into action, pulling on Tess’ arm. Gwen 
           debates the odd situation, watching from afar.

                                 GWEN
                        You guys never include me unless 
                        you need something from me!

                                 TESS
                        Because we fucking hate you!

                                 JENNA
                        Can this discussion wait?

                                 GWEN
                        I’m sorry, but I’m done!

           Gwen runs into the nearby bathroom and locks the door.

                                 TESS
                        DOES NOBODY HERE BELIEVE IN NO 
                        CHILD LEFT BEHIND?

           Tess turns and stares at the KNIFE BLOCK... and then goes 
           limp, causing everyone to fall over backwards. 
           BACK TO KEATON/EUGENE:

                                 EUGENE
                        I like you guys, you know? We had a 
                        good thing going. I don’t want my 
                        last memory of you to be me burning 
                        your bodies, but here we are.

                                 KEATON 
                        Eugene, we can’t fall apart over a 
                        little mix-up! Remember the time I 
                        went to your niece’s confirmation?
                             (listening)
                        Of course I wanted to be there! I 
                        only brought it up to remind you 
                        how much I care about you.

           Blair makes a jack off gesture. Keaton flips him off.

                                 KEATON (CONT’D)
                        I know. I’ll figure it out. I know 
                        you deserve better. I agree, we all 
                        deserve better. Okay. Bye bye.

           She hangs up, exhausted.

           INT. EUGENE’S APARTMENT - SAME

           Eugene snorts a line as Ziggy and Finch wait for a verdict. 

                                 ZIGGY
                        How much do we think they’re lying,  
                        scale of one to ten, five being the 
                        highest?

                                 EUGENE
                        I wanna know what’s going on, too, 
                        but these uppity fucks still stood 
                        us up. We gotta go eye for an eye 
                        and kill this Doug dude.

                                 FINCH
                        That is way more than eye for an 
                        eye! Why can’t we just go talk to 
                        Keaton face to face?

                                 ZIGGY
                        I’m down for that, if by “talk” you 
                        mean “kill Doug,” and by “face to 
                        face” you mean... face to face.
                                 FINCH
                        This is business, no one wants to 
                        deal with a bunch of violent thugs!

                                 ZIGGY
                        That’s like the number one kind of 
                        thugs people go for!

           Finch turns to Eugene, pleading his case.

                                 FINCH
                        Think about this. Doug’s a fall guy 
                        at best. We could kill him, or we 
                        could use him to get to Keaton. Why 
                        not find out what’s really going 
                        on? Just like you said yourself.

                                 ZIGGY
                        Great thinking, Eugene.

           Eugene nods, as if he came up with the idea himself.

                                 EUGENE
                        Yeah, okay. Find Doug, find out 
                        where Keaton’s at, and then call me 
                        so I can tag in on this shit.

           He points to Finch and Ziggy, then to himself -- 

                                 EUGENE (CONT’D)
                        Good cop, bad cop.

           PRE-LAP SFX: BANG, BANG, BANG.

           BACK TO TESS & JENNA’S APARTMENT:

           Tess is pounding on the bathroom door -- 

                                 TESS
                        I’m gonna kill your cat and shove 
                        it down your throat you Aaron Burr, 
                        Benedict Arnold bitch!

           INSIDE THE BATHROOM, Gwen listens intently, stewing.

                                 DOUG
                        Come on. I have the last few re-ups 
                        at my place, we might be able to 
                        scrape up enough to cover it.

                                 TESS
                        We?
           Jenna spots her CELL PHONE, but Doug’s blocking her path to 
           get to it. Instead, she notices GWEN’S PHONE on the floor and 
           discretely picks it up, hiding it in the front of her pants.

                                 DOUG
                        You gotta come with me.

                                 TESS
                        I don’t want to!

                                 DOUG
                        Don’t make me point a gun at you.

           Still high, Tess kicks into red alert, looking for an out.

                                 TESS
                        I’m not going without Jenna.

                                 DOUG
                        I don’t need Jenna. 

                                 TESS
                        But she’s seen your face! What if 
                        she goes to the cops and talks to a 
                        sketch guy? She’s very descriptive. 
                        She went to Oxford.

                                 JENNA
                        Are you for real right now?

           Doug narrows his eyes. He clearly hadn’t thought of this.

                                 DOUG
                        Okay. You’re coming, too.

                                 JENNA
                        Me? What about Gwen? Take her!

                                 DOUG
                        She won’t be getting out of there.

           Jenna whips around to Tess, pissed -- 

                                 JENNA
                        You just screwed yourself out of a 
                        rescue, dumbass! I was gonna drink 
                        like forty bottles of water, and 
                        maybe eat like a quick sandwich, 
                        and then run to the cops. 

                                 TESS
                        A quick sandwich?
                                 JENNA
                        And then run! Like ru--

           Mid-word, Jenna FALLS TO THE GROUND, ASLEEP. Tess stares.

                                 DOUG
                        That also happens.

                                 TESS
                        Why the fuck does that--

           Aaand... Tess’ eyes roll back as she flops to the floor -- 

           CUT TO BLACK. 

                                 BLAIR (PRE-LAP)
                        You really think that went well?

           INT. KEATON’S HOME BASE - NIGHT

           Keaton and Blair hold court from high-end armchairs.

                                 KEATON
                        No, not really, but I’m not just 
                        getting too old for this, I am 
                        presently too old for this.

                                 BLAIR
                        You see what we’re doing right now? 
                        Anxiously nit-picking how the call 
                        went? You think that’s not 
                        happening on the other side?

           He has a point.

                                 KEATON
                        What’s your bright idea, then? 

                                 BLAIR
                        Kill all of them, who gives a crap? 
                        They’re a two-bit street gang, 
                        their loved ones probably all OD’d 
                        on cheap methamphetamines by now.

                                 KEATON
                        And how would we do that?

                                 BLAIR
                        I’d prefer to use a handgun, but a 
                        brainstorm would be lovely.
                                 KEATON
                        I mean how would we keep the 
                        business going after we’ve 
                        assassinated half our distribution?

           Blair purses his lips. Knows she’s right.

                                 KEATON (CONT’D)
                        I’d love to kill that low-life 
                        prick. Truly. But we both know if 
                        we cut this dick off it’ll be like 
                        trying to castrate Hydra.

                                 BLAIR 
                        Another dick will grow. I get it.

                                 KEATON
                        But if we’re making suggestions, 
                        then I suggest you go babysit Doug. 

           Keaton holds out an ADDRESS. Jotted down during the call.

                                 BLAIR
                        Fine. But you owe me.

                                 KEATON 
                        Don’t even start.

           Blair reaches toward a credenza and PUSHES ON A KEY HOLE. A 
           SECRET COMPARTMENT opens, revealing a SLEEK SILENCED PISTOL.

           QUICK, DRUG-INDUCED DREAM SEQUENCE:

           COCAINE RAINS DOWN INSIDE AN HOURGLASS -- 

           TESS’ DATING APP NOTIFICATION BLARES, “OUT OF OPTIONS” -- 

           CLOSE ON SOMEONE’S MOUTH BEING FILLED WITH BLUE SLURPEE --

           DOUG REACHES TO HIS EAR AND PULLS HIS FACE OFF, MISSION 
           IMPOSSIBLE-STYLE, TO REVEAL HE HAS A CAT’S FACE INSTEAD --

                                 TESS (PRE-LAP)
                        AHHHHHHHHHH!

           INT. TESS’ CAR - MOVING - NIGHT

           Tess wakes up SCREAMING, then realizes she’s in a moving car. 
           She sees Jenna in the back seat and shakes her awake.

                                 JENNA
                        Oww, dude! Stop! I’m awake. 
           They look to Doug, then look around at the car.

                                 TESS
                        You’re carjacking now, too?

                                 DOUG
                        I’ll give it back.

                                 TESS
                        Is this a date rape?

                                 DOUG
                        You have to go on a date first for 
                        that. If anything, this would be a 
                        regular rape.

                                 JENNA
                        ...is this a regular rape?

                                 DOUG
                        NO!

           Tess tries the door handle, but the child locks are on. Shit.

                                 DOUG (CONT’D)
                        You have the right to attempt 
                        escape, but anything you say or do 
                        can and will be used against you at 
                        a later juncture.

                                 JENNA
                        What is that, our Patty Hearst 
                        rights?

           Doug taps Tess with his GUN, waving her away from the door.

                                 TESS
                        Technically, we did go on a date.

                                 DOUG
                             (realizing)
                        That’s why you were talking to me? 

                                 TESS
                        Why were you talking to me? Why 
                        didn’t your business partner come 
                        up and interrupt?

                                 DOUG
                        I fucked up. I must’ve gone to the 
                        wrong restaurant.
                                 JENNA
                        That’s a pretty big coincidence, 
                        isn’t it? You both being there?

                                 DOUG
                        No, I think me being a fucking 
                        idiot is pretty much god given.

           Tess and Jenna can’t help but empathize. None of them notice 
           a BLACKED-OUT SEDAN crawling up to the stoplight...

           INT./EXT. ZIGGY’S SEDAN - MOVING - NIGHT 

           The light turns red and Ziggy hits the brakes. Finch sits 
           shotgun, now wearing a NEW YORK METS baseball hat.

           Ziggy messes with the radio, searching for a good song.

                                 FINCH
                        Holy fuck.

                                 ZIGGY
                        Ditto, I love this song.

                                 FINCH
                        Not you. Him. That’s Doug.

           Finch points out the window and Ziggy turns to look. Two 
           lanes over, TESS’ CAR sits parallel to theirs. Unbelievable.

                                 ZIGGY
                        Are you sure?

                                 FINCH
                        I’ve seen him before. I’m sure.

                                 ZIGGY
                        Then get the duffel ready.

           Finch un-zips a DUFFEL BAG sees that it’s FULL OF GUNS.

                                 FINCH
                        Whoa! This is full of guns?

                                 ZIGGY
                        Of course it’s full of guns, what 
                        did you think was in it?

                                 FINCH
                        I don’t know, hockey equipment?

                                 ZIGGY
                        Why would I bring hockey equipment?
                                 FINCH
                        I was wondering the same thing! 
                        We’re supposed to talk to the guy, 
                        not blow his head off!

                                 ZIGGY
                        Two things can happen.

                                 FINCH
                        But we need him to tell us--

                                 ZIGGY
                        HEY, DOUG!

           INTERCUT TESS’ CAR/ZIGGY’S SEDAN:

           Doug stops talking to the girls and turns toward the sedan.

                                 DOUG
                        What?

           Ziggy’s jaw drops -- it really is him.

                                 ZIGGY
                        What’s the dealio with our drugs?

           Doug’s eyes shoot wide, realizing who he’s talking to.

                                 DOUG
                        I... I don’t have them.

           Finch spots Tess in the front seat.

                                 FINCH
                        Are you the girl he gave them to?

                                 TESS
                        Yes?

                                 FINCH
                        So... wouldn’t you have them?

                                 DOUG
                        It’s not what it looks like.

           Doug is at a loss for words. He can’t think of a lie. So 
           instead... HE FLOORS IT THROUGH THE RED LIGHT.

                                 ZIGGY
                        YAHTZEE, BITCHES!

           FINCH AND ZIGGY WHIP OUT GUNS, FIRING AT TESS’ CAR -- 
           Tess’ car is riddled with a few bullets but escapes the 
           intersection, BARRELING THROUGH A PLANTER before Doug regains 
           control. Ziggy floors it and chases after them -- 

           Doug zips in and out of traffic, trying to lose Ziggy. 

                                 DOUG
                        Do you have your seat belts on?

           Jenna clicks hers in, terrified. Tess doesn’t bother.

                                 TESS
                        Are these seat belts bullet proof?

                                 DOUG
                        No.

                                 TESS
                        Then I don’t think it’ll matter!

           Doug YANKS the wheel, causing Tess to SMACK her face on the 
           window. She curses in pain and buckles her seat belt...

           Doug yanks the wheel again and ends up in a ROUNDABOUT --  

           He drives around the roundabout at top speed, Ziggy 
           following. But instead of exiting, Doug just keeps driving 
           inside it -- AROUND AND AROUND AND AROUND -- 

                                 ZIGGY
                        Why is he doing this?!

                                 FINCH
                        Just stop the car. Stop and he’ll 
                        blow past us on the way around.

           Ziggy brakes. Doug sees it and stops, too. A standoff.

                                 ZIGGY
                        He stopped, too!

                                 FINCH
                        Just go again!

           Ziggy guns it and Doug matches -- AROUND AND AROUND AGAIN -- 

                                 JENNA
                        I’m gonna throw up.

                                 DOUG
                        Me, too.

           This time, Doug stops first. Instinctively, Ziggy does, too.
                                 FINCH
                        Why did you stop?

                                 ZIGGY
                        He’s in my head!

           Doug sees a narrow window in the traffic and SHOOTS THE GAP 
           out of the roundabout -- losing Ziggy in the process.

           Ziggy slams on the brakes, blocked in by a mess of cars. 

                                 ZIGGY (CONT’D) 
                        Well, this is just the tits. How 
                        are we supposed to stop him when 
                        he’s jolting around like that?

           Finch stares down Tess’ car as it recklessly speeds away. He 
           gets an idea and digs through the GLOVE BOX, pulling out:

           A POLICE SCANNER. He slams it on the dash, turning it on.

                                 FINCH 
                        Why bother stopping him if someone 
                        else will stop him for us?

           Ziggy cracks a smile as POLICE CHATTER filters in.

           INT. TESS’ CAR - MOVING - NIGHT

           Though the car is calm, Doug’s attitude is anything but.

           Jenna gets Tess’ attention and shows her GWEN’S CELL PHONE 
           hidden in her pants. Tess’ eyes light up, but Jenna holds a 
           “quiet” finger up to her lips. They need a plan. 

                                 TESS
                        Doug? Jenna started her period. We 
                        need to stop for tampons.

           Jenna wasn’t expecting this, but goes along with it anyway. 

                                 JENNA
                        Yeah, I’m totally bleeding.

                                 DOUG
                        You can’t stop when you’re on the 
                        run, it defeats the whole point.

                                 TESS
                        Dude, I’ve been living with Jenna 
                        for five years and we’re about to 
                        be dealing with an elevator doors 
                        in The Shining situation. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 TESS (CONT'D)
                        You might as well buy an air 
                        freshener that smells like old band-
                        aids and wet aluminum.

                                 JENNA
                        He probably gets the point.

                                 DOUG 
                        Fine, okay. I’ll find a store, 
                        just... let me think for a minute.

           Doug’s mind is elsewhere. He grips the wheel, nervous.

                                 JENNA
                        What’s wrong?

                                 DOUG
                        If those guys talk to my boss, 
                        Blair’s gonna come babysit me.

                                 JENNA
                        Who’s Blair?

           INT. TESS & JENNA’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           The doorknob jiggles. Turns. Opens.

           BLAIR steps into the quiet apartment, wearing leather gloves 
           to hide fingerprints. He spies a few stray pillows on the 
           ground and looks around, stopping to notice something odd -- 

           A MAKESHIFT BARRICADE has been built up to trap Gwen inside 
           the bathroom: a desk, a few chairs, and an assortment of 
           pillows and knick-knacks. Obviously Doug’s doing.

           Blair eyes it, curious...

           INT. BATHROOM - SAME

           Disaster zone, population: Gwen. She’s busy tracing her 
           reflection in the mirror with lipstick, clearly high.

           Then, slowly but surely, she hears faint MUSIC from outside.

           BACK TO LIVING ROOM:

           The door to the bathroom begins to budge, being slammed from 
           the inside. The desk barricade scoots forward until Gwen 
           BURSTS OUT OF THE DOOR, SHOULDER FIRST -- 

           She catches her breath outside until she notices Blair in the 
           living room, calmly playing JAZZ PIANO.
                                 GWEN
                        Who the fuck are you now?

           He holds up a finger... and finishes the song. Then, finally:

                                 BLAIR
                        Hi. I’m Blair.

           A FEW MINUTES LATER:

           Gwen sits on the couch. Blair offers her some ice water.

                                 GWEN
                        Are you a drug dealer, too?

                                 BLAIR
                        I prefer kingpin. Are you Tess?

                                 GWEN
                        Tess can get fucked.

                                 BLAIR
                        Roommate, then.

           Gwen doesn’t refute it. Blair makes a “bingo” gesture.

                                 GWEN
                        I’m Gwen.

                                 BLAIR
                        Ah, Gwen. Lovely name. Short for 
                        Gwendolyn, I’m sure. Like wonderful 
                        poet Gwendolyn Brooks.

                                 GWEN
                        Or wonderful poet Gwen Stefani.

           Blair stands and surveys the room, looking for something.

                                 BLAIR
                        I am sincerely interested in your 
                        roommate debacle here, but I’d like 
                        to cut to the chase: do you know 
                        what happened to the narcotics?

                                 GWEN
                        They’re in the bathroom. Sort of.

           Blair peeks his head into the bathroom.

                                 BLAIR
                        Holy cats.

           He adjusts his glasses, moving back to the living room.
                                 BLAIR (CONT’D)
                        And where did Doug go?

                                 GWEN
                        I heard him say he had more at his 
                        apartment. That it might be enough 
                        to replace or some crap.

                                 BLAIR
                        And one could surmise based on your 
                        ability to Bruce Banner yourself 
                        out of the washroom here that you 
                        used some of the narcotics?

                                 GWEN
                        It wasn’t my fault. I fell when I 
                        was trying to get out and--

                                 BLAIR
                        Shh, shh, shh. It’s perfectly fine.

                                 GWEN
                        Really? That’s super cool of you.

                                 BLAIR
                        You know me.

                                 GWEN
                        Actually, I don’t.

                                 BLAIR
                        Right. Well, best keep it that way.

           Blair checks the time. Scratches his forehead.

                                 BLAIR (CONT’D)
                        Just to do the safe thing for the 
                        both of us, I’d prefer you not see 
                        which way I’m going once I leave. 
                        Is that equitable?

                                 GWEN
                        I don’t know what that means.

                                 BLAIR
                        Would you put that pillow up to 
                        your face and count to one hundred?

                                 GWEN
                        Could I count to ten a bunch of 
                        times instead?

                                 BLAIR
                        If you must.
           Gwen grabs a nearby pillow and holds it against her face. As 
           soon as she does, Blair PULLS OUT HIS PISTOL, HOLDING THE 
           MUZZLE RIGHT UP NEXT TO THE PILLOW -- 

                                 GWEN
                        One, two...

           And then she FALLS OVER, SNORING -- the side effect from the 
           drugs. Blair stares at her body, annoyed. Then --

           BANG! Gwen’s already-silent body falls quieter. DEAD. 

           EXT. TESS & JENNA’S APARTMENT - STREET - NIGHT

           Blair walks away, cell phone to his ear.

                                 BLAIR
                        Keaton, it’s me. True or false: 
                        Doug lost all of the narcotics. 
                        I’ll give you a hint. It’s true.

           INT. KEATON’S HOME BASE - STUDY - SAME

           Keaton pulls a FALSE BOOK on a shelf and a bottle of whiskey 
           pops out of a HIDDEN COMPARTMENT. She unscrews it, pouring.

                                 KEATON
                        Motherfucking cock-fuck!

                                 BLAIR
                        Quite.

           INTERCUT BLAIR/KEATON:

                                 BLAIR (CONT’D)
                        He and the girl are en route to his 
                        apartment to scrounge from the 
                        other re-ups, but to borrow a 
                        phrase, this is one big boo boo.

                                 KEATON
                        You think?

                                 BLAIR 
                        What’s my move here?

           Blair listens, slowly breaking into a wide, psychotic grin.
           INT. DRUG STORE - NIGHT 

           BEEP. A BOX OF TAMPONS is scanned at a register. The Cashier, 
           20s, miserable, looks up at Doug and the girls.

                                 CASHIER
                        Eight forty-two.

           Jenna eyes a few dollar bills in her wallet but Tess steps in 
           front of her, handing over a CREDIT CARD.

                                 TESS
                        I got it. 

                                 JENNA
                        Since when have you ever offered to 
                        pay for something of mine?

                                 TESS
                        Can’t I just be a good friend?

           Jenna narrows her eyes. Sure.

                                 CASHIER
                        Sign here.

           Tess writes “HELP” in giant letters at the bottom of the 
           receipt and hands it back. Jenna notices, getting it.

                                 JENNA
                        That signature’s gonna be worth a 
                        lot of cash someday.

                                 CASHIER
                        Lucky me.

           The Cashier takes the receipt and pins it into a stack 
           without looking at it. The girls stare at her, crushed.

                                 JENNA
                        Can I have the restroom key?

                                 DOUG
                        Seriously?

                                 TESS
                        It’s not a bluetooth, she actually 
                        has to shove it in there.

           The Cashier pops her gum and hands the key over. 
           INT. TESS & JENNA’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           TODD enters the apartment holding a few empty bankers boxes. 
           With his hands full, he doesn’t clock the unlocked door...

                                 TODD
                        Jen? You home? I figured I’d take 
                        another load over before--

           He spots Gwen’s dead body and FLIPS HIS SHIT.

                                 TODD (CONT’D)
                        GWEN?!

           He feels for a pulse, but it’s no use.

           INT. DRUG STORE - BATHROOM - SAME

           A dingy, windowless bathroom. Doug surveys it, satisfied.

                                 DOUG
                        I really thought this place was 
                        gonna have some windows or vents or 
                        something to escape out of.

                                 JENNA
                        What a shame.

           He holds the door open for Jenna to enter, but just before 
           the door closes, Tess jumps inside and LOCKS DOUG OUT.

                                 DOUG
                        Oh, come on!

                                 TESS
                        Relax, we’re not Shawshank-ing our 
                        way out of the toilet tubes. 

           Now alone, Jenna pulls GWEN’S PHONE out of her pants.

                                 TESS (CONT’D)
                        You should get a medal of honor.

                                 JENNA
                        I’ll probably get vagina cancer.

           Jenna dials 9-1-1 and they intently listen together.

                                 AUTOMATED MESSAGE (O.S.)
                        You’ve reached the 911 Emergency

                        right now. Please hold for the--
           Jenna hangs up in frustration. You’ve got to be kidding.

                                 DOUG (O.S.)
                        I hear you whispering in there!

                                 TESS
                        Whispering isn’t illegal, dude!

           The girls stare at the phone, unable to speak freely.

                                 TESS (CONT’D)
                        Can you text 9-1-1?

                                 JENNA
                        I don’t think so.

                                 TESS
                        How can you not text 9-1-1? We’re 
                        in the fucking future.

           Jenna finds “TODD” in the phone. NEW MESSAGE: “TODD!!!”

           INT. TESS & JENNA’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - SAME

           Todd stares at Gwen’s dead body in shock. Suddenly, his phone 
           lights up with a text... FROM GWEN. 

           SPOOKED, he jumps and drops his phone. Fuck that.

           Then he slowly types back: “HELLO...?”

           “IT’S JENNA. START TRACKING GWEN’S PHONE.”

           INTERCUT APARTMENT/DRUG STORE:

           Jenna has the “FIND MY IPHONE” app open and running on Gwen’s 
           phone -- a personal tracking device. 

           TODD: “SOMEONE SHOT GWEN - SHE’S DEAD”

           Jenna’s jaw drops.

                                 DOUG (O.S.)
                        Let me in!

                                 TESS
                        He’s about to break in, what’s up?

           Jenna holds the phone up. A beat as Tess scans the text.

                                 TESS (CONT’D)
                        What? I mean... WHAT?
           They’re both at a loss.

                                 TESS (CONT’D)
                        Is he joking? Is it a joke?

                                 JENNA
                        Todd doesn’t make jokes. He thinks 
                        birthday cards are hilarious. 

           Tess starts hyperventilating. 

                                 TESS
                        They fucking killed her? I’ve 
                        wished for Gwen to die like a 
                        million times but none of my other 
                        wishes have ever come true! 

                                 JENNA
                        Are we gonna die?

                                 TESS
                        Fuck! I’m gonna die before I even 
                        get one cat!

                                 JENNA
                        Calm down, you’re freaking me out!

           Doug SLAMS ON THE DOOR, trying to open it. 

                                 TESS
                        What do we do?

                                 JENNA
                        Contact her family?

                                 TESS 
                        I mean about US!

                                 JENNA
                        Distract Doug ‘til I can figure out 
                        how to explain all this in a text.

           Jenna locks herself into a STALL. Tess lets Doug in.

                                 DOUG
                        What’s the hold up?

                                 TESS
                        It’s a war zone in here. Blood has 
                        been shed.

           KNOCK, KNOCK, KNOCK. A CUSTOMER is banging on the outer door.
                                 CUSTOMER (O.S.)
                        Hurry it up!

           Jenna texts Todd: “TESS WENT ON A DATE WITH A GUY WHO TURNED 
           OUT TO BE A--” She stops. Too long. Delete, delete, delete.

                                 DOUG
                        Just give us a sec!

                                 CUSTOMER (O.S.)
                        Us? This isn’t a truck stop, pal.

                                 JENNA
                        Don’t rush me!

                                 DOUG
                        Just stick it in there!

           OUTSIDE THE BATHROOM, the Customer misinterprets Doug’s words 
           and their face fills with awkward disgust.

                                 JENNA
                        You can’t just stick it in there, 
                        okay? It’s a delicate dance!

           Jenna texts Todd again: “WE’RE KIDNAPPED. LONG STORY. GO TO 
           THE COPS AND TELL THEM YOU’RE TRACKING US. NOW.”

           BACK WITH TODD, he picks up Gwen’s tablet, also running “FIND 
           MY IPHONE,” and sprints out of the apartment. Still spooked.

                                 DOUG
                        If you don’t finish in about ten 
                        seconds, I’m coming inside.

           Doug bangs his fist on the bathroom stall, which sounds 
           strikingly similar to someone being banged up against it.

                                 JENNA
                        Do not come inside!

                                 TESS
                        Let her finish!

           Tess holds Doug back and the two get into a physical tussle.

                                 JENNA
                        It just takes a while sometimes! 
                        You wouldn’t know, you’re a guy.

           Jenna covertly slips the phone into the TAMPON BOX.

                                 DOUG
                        Oww, fuck!
                                 TESS
                        You asked for this!

                                 JENNA
                        I’M COMING! ARE YOU FUCKING HAPPY?

           Jenna lets out an annoyed GRUNT and flushes the toilet. She 
           slams open the stall, shooting a death stare at Doug.

           The trio then exits the bathroom, where the Customer is 
           staring at them in disgusted shock. Jenna adjusts her pants.

                                 DOUG
                        All yours, pal. 

           QUICK, ACTION-PACKED SERIES OF SHOTS:

           INT. DOUG’S APARTMENT - NIGHT

           A doorknob twists. Doug opens the door, leading the girls 
           into his apartment. It’s surprisingly lived-in. Fish tank in 
           the corner. An unfinished game of Connect Four on the table.

                                 TESS
                        So this is where the enemy sleeps.

                                 DOUG
                        Who says we’re enemies?

                                 TESS
                        Feels like a safe term for 
                        hostages, right?

                                 DOUG
                        I don’t think we need labels yet.

                                 TESS
                        So are we exclusive, or can I see 
                        other kidnapping drug dealers?

                                 DOUG
                        Look, I’m sorry. I didn’t sign up 
                        to be a kidnapper, but you didn’t 
                        do us any favors by flushing the 
                        drugs. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 DOUG (CONT'D)
                        You’re a part of this now, so it 
                        would be a lot easier to keep you 
                        safe if we worked together.

           A beat as the girls silently acknowledge his point.

                                 JENNA
                        Sorry about the drugs.

           Doug makes his way to the fish tank and diligently feeds his 
           TWO PET BETTA FISH. Tess follows, face up against the glass.

                                 DOUG
                        This fucker keeps messing with my 
                        guy Reggie.

           Jenna hangs back, browsing a table of PHOTOS, but calls out:

                                 JENNA
                        Betta fish fight. They’re 
                        aggressive toward their own kind.

           Doug regards his fish in a new light. 

                                 DOUG
                        I feel your pain, Reg.

           Jenna notices an upside-down PICTURE FRAME and turns it over, 
           revealing a photo of Doug and a WOMAN. Smiling. Domestic.

                                 JENNA
                        Who’s this?

                                 DOUG
                        Who’s what?

                                 JENNA
                        This girl who appears to be 
                        spending time with you willingly.

           Doug pulls a few PACKAGES OF DRUGS out from behind his fish 
           food. He and Tess walk over to look at the photo.

                                 DOUG
                        My girlfriend. Ex-girlfriend.

                                 JENNA
                        What happened?

                                 DOUG
                        She uh... cheated on me.

                                 TESS
                        Fuck her then.
                                 DOUG
                        It’s not all her fault. I mean I 
                        know I should be angry, but... my 
                        job came between us a lot. She 
                        wasn’t the biggest fan of that.

                                 JENNA
                        Just because she doesn’t like how 
                        you spend your time doesn’t mean 
                        she has to be a dick.

           Tess clocks this. Sounds familiar...

                                 DOUG
                        She doesn’t mean to be a dick. But 
                        I can’t just bail on my job either. 
                        I’ve been with these people a long 
                        time, you know? They need me. She 
                        didn’t really understand that.

                                 TESS
                        Sounds like she doesn’t understand 
                        a lot of things.

           She says this to Doug, although it feels meant for Jenna.

                                 DOUG
                        I don’t know. We might still try to 
                        work it out.

           A quiet beat as Doug combines the new packages into a kilo.

                                 JENNA
                        This is the plan? Won’t the latest 
                        model of psycho be pissed about 
                        these drugs an hour from now?

                                 DOUG
                        This dude once slit a guy’s throat 
                        because he forgot to bring ice to a 
                        barbecue. We can handle other 
                        people being pissed. Not him.

           Doug finishes taping up the new brick. 

                                 TESS
                        How do you guys learn to pack those 
                        in such tight squares, anyway?

                                 DOUG
                        I used to build igloos in the 
                        winter when I was a kid. I mean all 
                        day long.

                                 DOUG (CONT'D)
                        It was pretty much the only thing I 
                        wasn’t a total loser at outside of 
                        hockey. But being an amateur igloo 
                        builder isn’t exactly gonna win you 
                        any respect in Southie. But this--

           He holds up the new brick. Good as new.

                                 JENNA
                        Impressive.

           Doug agrees, admiring it with an oddly sweet sense of pride.

                                 DOUG
                        We better get going.

                                 TESS
                        Can we have guns?

                                 DOUG
                        No.

                                 TESS
                        A snack?

                                 DOUG
                        No.

                                 TESS
                        A jacket, at least?

           Doug sighs and gives in, leading Tess to his room.

           Jenna wanders near the kitchen as she waits, seeing a POST-IT 
           NOTE on the fridge. It reads: “JULIANA’S RESTAURANT. 8PM.”

                                 JENNA
                        Doug, this post-it is right.

                                 DOUG (O.S.)
                        What?

                                 JENNA
                        The restaurant.

           Jenna picks up the POST-IT, trying to understand it.

                                 JENNA (CONT’D)
                        You didn’t go to the wrong place, 
                        someone gave you the wrong place.

                                 DOUG (O.S.)
                        Really? But why would they--
           Her gaze shifts to the counter, noticing a HOT MUG OF TEA.

                                 JENNA
                        Doug... do you have roommates?

                                 DOUG (O.S.)
                        No, why?

           A wave of tension rides up Jenna’s spine. She swiftly turns, 
           walking herself toward Doug and Tess.

           CLICK. Jenna whips around to see BLAIR locking the front 
           door. She SPRINTS into Doug’s room as Blair SILENTLY FIRES -- 

           BEDROOM:

           Jenna locks the bedroom door behind her, distraught. Tess 
           turns, now wearing an OVERSIZED CELTICS WINDBREAKER.

                                 TESS
                        I’m about to catch mad dick in this 
                        windbreaker.

                                 JENNA
                        A guy’s out there shooting at me!

                                 DOUG
                        What? What did he look like?

                                 JENNA
                        Does it matter?!

                                 DOUG
                        Yes!

                                 JENNA
                        Tall. Glasses. Holding a machine 
                        designed to kill me.

           Blair. Doug’s face falls as BULLETS fly through the door.

                                 DOUG
                        We gotta get the fuck outta here.

                                 JENNA
                        You think?!

                                 TESS
                        Do we need more stuff? Should I 
                        grab anything? Guns? Snacks? Does 
                        anyone else need a jacket? 

                                 JENNA
                        SHUT UP!
           They scramble to the fire escape, avoiding incoming bullets.

           EXT. DOUG’S APARTMENT - STREET - CONTINUOUS

           Now on the ground level, they sprint over to Tess’ car -- 

           Jenna reaches the driver’s side door first, fumbling with the 
           car keys. In the process, she notices a TRAIL OF WHITE POWDER 
           leaking out of the brick in Tess’ arms.

                                 JENNA
                        Tess, the drugs!

           Tess rights the package, examining a BULLET HOLE in the side.

                                 TESS
                        It’s fine! It’s not that... 

           She looks onto the street and sees it’s left a TINY COCAINE 
           BREAD CRUMB TRAIL all the way around the corner.

                                 TESS (CONT’D)
                        ...bad.

           BLAIR emerges from around the corner, eyes on the ground. 
           Clearly following the trail. He looks up and raises his gun --

                                 DOUG
                        Get in the car!

           The trio jumps into the car and peels off, bullets flying.

           INT./EXT. TESS’ CAR - MOVING - NIGHT

           Jenna speeds out of the neighborhood and onto a main road.

                                 DOUG
                        Go, go, go!

                                 JENNA
                        I am going! I’m going as fast as 
                        Tess’ broke-ass car allows!

                                 TESS
                        What did my car ever do to you?

                                 JENNA
                        I can think of at least six 
                        specific incidents. 

           They curve around a corner and seem to have lost Blair. Phew.  
           Doug opens a FIRST AID KIT, rummaging for BAND-AIDS. He 
           bandages the drugs, fixing the hole and reinforcing the tape. 

           Oddly, it looks like a DEMENTED HAPPY FACE.

                                 TESS
                        Aww, it looks like a little person.

           Doug holds the brick up to his face, trying to be funny.

                                 TESS (CONT’D)
                        You can’t have an adorable super 
                        drug and not give it a nickname.

                                 DOUG
                        What, then?

                                 TESS 
                        Crystal Pepsi?

                                 DOUG
                        No.

                                 TESS
                        Powder? From the movie Powder?

                                 JENNA
                        No.

                                 TESS 
                        Gary Busey?

           Jenna laughs, but Tess notices a STOP SIGN coming up fast -- 

                                 TESS (CONT’D)
                        STOPPPPP!

           She slams on the brakes -- but it’s no use -- they’re out.

                                 JENNA
                        The brakes are out!

           Jenna BLOWS through the stop sign and a nearby COP CAR flips 
           on its sirens. In pursuit.

                                 DOUG
                        Blair must’ve cut them. He’s a 
                        fuckin’ psycho, he thinks like 
                        fifty steps ahead. He used to play 
                        chess with Bobby Fischer. Freaked 
                        the kid so bad he went into hiding.

                                 TESS
                        That... might actually be my fault.
                                 JENNA
                        Bobby Fischer?

                                 TESS
                        No, the brakes. I took my car in 
                        last week and the guy gave me the 
                        whole “you’re a risk to yourself 
                        and society if you keep driving 
                        this car” bit. I thought he was 
                        just trying to swindle me!

                                 JENNA
                        I have to stop.

                                 DOUG
                        We can’t let the fuckin’ statie 
                        look inside the car, there’s a kilo 
                        of Gary Busey in here!

                                 JENNA
                        Does this piece of shit look like a 
                        getaway car to you? Who knows what 
                        else has been ruined by her 
                        carelessness.

                                 TESS
                        I’m not careless, I’m intentionally 
                        negligent. It’s different. 

           A MEGAPHONE from the COP CAR booms from behind them -- 

                                 COP CAR (O.S.)
                        Pull over the vehicle!

                                 JENNA
                        I’m trying!

           Slowly but surely, the car starts to decelerate on its own, 
           coasting down the black top. Slower... slower... too long... 
           until they hit gravel on the shoulder and rumble to a stop.

           Doug picks the drugs up and shoves them into Tess’ hands. 

                                 DOUG
                        Put this under your shirt. If he 
                        asks, you’re pregnant with my kid.

                                 TESS
                        This is moving pretty fast for me. 

                                 DOUG
                        You’re the one who named it.

           Tess takes the brick and shoves it under her shirt.
                                 TESS
                        If this doesn’t work, I’m aborting 
                        this coke baby in a hot second. 

                                 JENNA
                        I think he’ll be more interested to 
                        know why the car looks like a 
                        fucking snow globe.

           They look down to see a sprinkled layer of drugs on the seat.

                                 DOUG
                        Shit.

           They furiously start wiping down the seats. Tess catches the 
           brick’s band-aid face in the corner of her eye -- 

                                 TESS
                        Don’t give me that look, Busey.

           INT. COP CAR - SAME

           OFFICER KENNY, 40s and unlucky, is talking into his radio. 

                                 KENNY
                        License plate MAG022. Over.

           A brief silence. Then the radio crackles again.

                                 RADIO
                        Kenny, there’s an APB out on that 
                        plate’s registered address. We 
                        pulled a body out of the place ten 
                        minutes ago after some kid came in 
                        tracking his girlfriend’s phone. 
                        Says she was kidnapped.

           Kenny gulps, looking back toward Tess’ car.

                                 KENNY
                        Are you still tracking the phone?

           BACK IN TESS’ CAR:

           Doug and Tess are frantically trying to brush loose drugs off 
           of the car seats. Tess much less effectively. 

                                 DOUG
                        You’re just moving it around!
                                 TESS
                        I’m sorry! It’s like trying to get 
                        sand out of your underwear, it’s 
                        just a part of the car now.

           Jenna looks into a mirror and spots Kenny exiting his car.

                                 JENNA
                        He’s coming. What the fuck are we--

           Suddenly, BRIGHT WHITE LIGHTS flood the car’s interior. All 
           three of them turn and look towards Kenny, squinting to make 
           something out in the blinding light.

                                 TESS
                        Is that...

                                 DOUG
                        Oh, shit.

           BACK WITH KENNY:

           Kenny draws his gun, pointing it blindly into the white out.

                                 KENNY
                        Step out of the vehicle!

           A pair of LANKY LEGS exit the culprit’s car, walking out.

           HOOONK! HOOONK! Kenny turns around to see Tess’ car honking. 
           He regards it oddly, not understanding the warning...

           FROM TESS’ POV:

           A TALL FIGURE steps in next to Kenny. The figure RAISES A 
           SILENCED GUN and -- BANG -- sends Kenny slumping to the 
           ground. A mist of brain matter silhouetted in the lights.

                                 TESS
                        WAS THAT BRAIN? BRAIN DOES THAT IN 
                        REAL LIFE?

           Jenna SCREAMS but Doug reaches up and covers her mouth. As if 
           the screaming weren’t enough, Jenna VOMITS INTO DOUG’S HAND.

                                 DOUG
                        Fucking gross, man! Out of the car!

           The girls oblige, exiting and running around the side of the 
           car. Jenna continues to DRY HEAVE as they duck for cover.

                                 TESS
                        Pull your shit together, woman.
                                 JENNA
                             (fuck you)
                        Sorry I’m reacting poorly to seeing 
                        a guy’s head blown off.

                                 DOUG
                        Follow me.

           The trio scurries to the COP CAR. Meanwhile, Blair approaches 
           Tess’ car and finds the doors open. Empty seats.

                                 BLAIR
                        Marco!
                             (beat, silence)
                        This is where you say “polo.” I’ll 
                        try again. Ready? Marco!

           Doug tries the cop car’s passenger door -- locked. They 
           scurry even further, all the way to the back of BLAIR’S CAR.

                                 BLAIR (CONT’D)
                        Marco! Don’t leave me hanging!

           Doug opens the TRUNK and finds a breakfast buffet of murder 
           supplies -- guns, knives, chloroform -- you name it.

           Tess lunges for a HANDGUN, but Doug stops her.

                                 DOUG
                        No way.

                                 TESS
                        What happened to working together?

           Seeing the trunk pop, Blair SHOOTS THROUGH THE STEEL. Doug 
           lunges for the CHLOROFORM and then slams the trunk, hiding.

           Doug returns fire as they slip all the way back to Tess’ car.

                                 BLAIR
                             (calling out)
                        What is this, musical cars?

           He fires off a few rounds for good measure.

                                 DOUG
                        Get around the other side.

           Tess does. Jenna stays put, paralyzed with fear.

                                 TESS
                        Jenna. Come on.
           But Jenna sees Blair tracking toward the other end of Tess’ 
           car, giving her a potential window to make a break for it.

                                 JENNA
                        I’m gonna go get help.

           Tess is pinned on the other side of the car with Doug -- 

                                 TESS
                        Like fuck you are!

                                 JENNA
                        Don’t be an asshole. This is our 
                        chance, I need to go!

                                 TESS
                        You can’t just leave me!

                                 JENNA
                        I’m not leaving you, I’m helping 
                        you. You just don’t know it yet.

           With that, Jenna half-runs, half-crawls to the cop car.

                                 TESS
                        JENNA!

                                 DOUG
                        You let her go?!

                                 TESS
                        I don’t let her do anything. She 
                        just does it.

           Tess is fuming, a thousand emotions boiling to the surface.

           Doug pulls the CHLOROFORM and a RAG out of his pocket --

                                 DOUG
                        When she starts the car, he’s gonna 
                        start firing at her. I’m gonna 
                        shoot him, then you pop up and hit 
                        him with the chloroform. Cool?

                                 TESS
                        Not even a little bit.

                                 DOUG
                        Perfect.

           Jenna picks KEYS off of dead Kenny and starts the car up.
           FROM JENNA’S POV, Blair immediately fires two shots into the 
           windshield. Direct hits, if not for the bullet-proof glass. 
           She clumsily speeds away, off to supposed safety...

           Meanwhile, Doug snaps into action and shoots Blair in the 
           shoulder. Surprised, Blair doesn’t notice Tess pop up and 
           SMASH THE CHLOROFORM BOTTLE OVER HIS HEAD.

           Blair tumbles to the ground like a sack of potatoes. 

                                 DOUG (CONT’D)
                        What the fuck did you do that for?

                                 TESS
                        What was I supposed to do?

                                 DOUG
                        Put the chloroform on the rag and 
                        hold it over his mouth!

                                 TESS
                        You said “hit him” with it!

                                 DOUG
                        That’s just a figure of speech!

                                 TESS
                        Then maybe next time say 
                        “figuratively hit him with the 
                        chloroform.” 

           Now safe from imminent danger, the two can’t help but laugh.

                                 TESS (CONT’D)
                        What now?

           Doug reaches into Blair’s pocket and pulls out: CAR KEYS.

           INT./EXT. BLAIR’S CAR - SERIES OF SHOTS - NIGHT

           “Paw Due Respect” by Meow the Jewels plays.

           TESS FINDS WEED IN HER WINDBREAKER POCKET, THEY SMOKE IT --

           TESS AND DOUG REENACT THE PREVIOUS SCENE, MIMICKING BLAIR 
           GETTING SMACKED IN THE HEAD. HEARTY LAUGHS ALL AROUND -- 

           THEY PLAY WITH GARY BUSEY LIKE ITS AN ACTUAL BABY. TESS 
           TOSSES IT INTO THE AIR AND CATCHES IT -- 

           DOUG HANDS TESS A GUN, WHICH SHE HOLDS REVERENTIALLY. MOMENTS 
           LATER, THEY CRUISE DOWN THE STREET, SHOOTING AT MAIL BOXES --
           DOUG DRIVES BLAIR’S CAR LIKE HE’S INVINCIBLE. TESS LEANS OUT 
           THE WINDOW INTO THE WIND. BOTH OF THEM ON TOP OF THE WORLD --

           INT./EXT. COP CAR - MOVING - NIGHT

           Elsewhere, Jenna zips around in her stolen cop car, mid-way 
           through a panic attack.

                                 JENNA
                        Oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck...

           She wheels around a corner and sees another COP CAR waiting 
           to turn left at a red light intersection. 

                                 JENNA (CONT’D)
                        Thank you god. Thank you Jesus. 
                        Thank you Beyonce.

           She pulls up next to the car and rolls down her window. The 
           OFFICER sitting shotgun does, too -- extremely suspicious.

                                 JENNA (CONT’D)
                        Officer! I need help. My friend 
                        went on a date with this guy who 
                        turned out to be a drug dealer, and 
                        he came by our apartment and we 
                        ended up doing some of the drugs... 
                             (off the Officer’s look)
                        Let me fast forward. There’s a 
                        crazy guy chasing us and you guys 
                        need to help me get hooked up with 
                        witness protection, STAT.

           Both officers notice the considerable amount of BLOOD SPATTER 
           splayed across Jenna’s driver door. The officer sitting 
           shotgun slowly brings his RADIO up to his mouth...

                                 JENNA (CONT’D)
                             (under breath)
                        Fuck.
                             (then, out loud)
                        You know what? Nevermind. I’m good.

           The light turns green and Jenna casually ACCELERATES through 
           it. The COPS flip their sirens on and SPEED AFTER HER.

           Jenna continues to barrel through multiple red light 
           intersections, SCREAMING as she goes -- 
           EXT. ANOTHER STREET - NIGHT

           Jenna turns a corner, looking for an idea. She sees a 
           CIVILIAN CAR make an illegal turn and FLIPS ON HER LIGHTS.

           By the time the REAL COPS catch up, Jenna looks like an 
           actual patrol car making a traffic stop. They blow right by.

           Jenna pulls a GUN from the glove box and approaches the car.

                                 JENNA
                        Give me your phone!

                                 GIRLFRIEND
                        Are you even a cop?

                                 BOYFRIEND
                        Just do what the lady cop says!

           They both toss all of their belongings to Jenna.

                                 GIRLFRIEND
                             (to Boyfriend)
                        We’re gonna fight about this later.

           Jenna grabs one of their phones, quickly dialing 9-1-1.

                                 AUTOMATED MESSAGE (O.S.)
                        You’ve reached the 911 Emergency 
                        Hotline. All circuits are busy--

                                 JENNA
                        MOTHER-FUCK!

           Jenna hangs up, furious. Then gets an idea and dials again --

           INT. POLICE STATION - SAME

           Across town, a police station is bustling with evening 
           activity. TODD sits on a bench as his PHONE RINGS.

                                 TODD
                        Hello?

                                 JENNA
                        TODD!

                                 TODD
                        Jenna? Where are you? Are you okay?

           INTERCUT TODD/JENNA:

           Jenna futilely attempts to calm herself down.
                                 JENNA
                        9-1-1 put me on hold. I think I 
                        just mugged someone in self-
                        defense. I don’t know.

                                 TODD
                        What?

                                 JENNA
                        Nevermind. Are you still tracking 
                        Gwen’s phone?

           Todd gets up and moves over to see GWEN’S TABLET on a 
           detective’s desk. Two LAZY COPS sit nearby.

                                 TODD
                        Yeah. It looks like it’s on the 
                        move near the corner of 3rd and D.

           Jenna exhales. “On the move” is a good sign.

                                 JENNA
                        Thank god, she’s alive.

                                 TODD
                        Are you not with Tess?

                                 JENNA
                        No, I ran to get help. I need you 
                        to send backup to that location, 
                        there’s a crazy ass assassin guy 
                        fucking killing everyone.

                                 TODD
                        They said an officer was with you.

                                 JENNA 
                        Well, he’s no longer “with us” in 
                        more than one way.

           Todd whips around to the nearby officers -- 

                                 TODD
                        How fast can you get here?

                                 LAZY COP #1
                        Relax, kid. We’re putting a call 
                        out. Ten minutes tops.

                                 TODD
                        He says ten minutes.

           Jenna shakes her head.
                                 JENNA
                        That’s too slow.

                                 TODD
                        It’s as fast as they can go.

                                 JENNA
                        You haven’t seen this guy.

                                 TODD
                        Please come to the station. They’re 
                        professionals. They’ll handle it.

           Jenna looks around, deeply conflicted.

                                 JENNA
                        If your best friend was trapped in 
                        a burning house, would you wait ten 
                        minutes for the fire fighters to 
                        show, or would you run back in?

                                 TODD
                        You’re my best friend. 

           Jenna winces. She didn’t mean it like that.

                                 JENNA
                        Todd, I love you, I just--

                                 TODD
                        I’d run back in.

                                 JENNA
                        Me too.

           She hangs up, throws the couple’s belongings onto the 
           sidewalk and jumps back into her stolen cop car.

           EXT. STREET - NIGHT

           The sound of SIRENS (O.S.) startles Blair awake. His eyes 
           focus to find ZIGGY AND FINCH staring back at him.

                                 ZIGGY
                        Wakey, wakey, lemon shakey.

                                 BLAIR
                        What the devil does that mean?

           They lift Blair by his armpits and drag him off the road to a 
           more discreet location. Away from any potential cops.
                                 ZIGGY
                        Where’d Doug go, guy?

           Finch fishes through Blair’s pockets, pulling out a PHONE.

                                 BLAIR
                        Presumably he drove off in one of 
                        the available directions. 

           Ziggy digs her gun into Blair’s neck, eyes bulging.

                                 FINCH
                        Wait, wait--

           Finch reads Blair’s phone, pulling up his ADDRESS BOOK.

                                 FINCH (CONT’D)
                        Check this out.

           He holds the screen up the Ziggy’s face.

                                 ZIGGY 
                        Nice phone. Is that the new model?

                                 FINCH
                        I mean the ADDRESS.

           Sure enough, Blair has a contact card in his phone that 
           reads: “KEATON. SISTER. 5551 BEACON.”

           In a moment of opportunity, Blair pulls out his gun and 
           SHOOTS FINCH IN THE FOOT. Finch YELPS in pain, ripping his 
           shoe off to reveal a BLOWN OFF PINKY TOE.

                                 FINCH (CONT’D)
                        FUCK!

           Ziggy rears back and PISTOL WHIPS BLAIR with all of her 
           might. He drops like a sack of potatoes. Again.

                                 ZIGGY
                        Guess that means we found her.

           Finch growls in pain as Ziggy whips out her phone, dialing.

                                 ZIGGY (CONT’D)
                        Start the car. I’ll call Gene.

           She throws the keys at Finch as he limps off.

           INT./EXT. BLAIR’S CAR - GAS STATION - NIGHT

           Doug and Tess pull up to an empty gas station in Blair’s car.
                                 DOUG
                        I gotta make a phone call. You want 
                        anything?

                                 TESS
                        Salt and vinegar chips?

                                 DOUG
                        You like those?

                                 TESS
                        You don’t?

                                 DOUG
                        Barbecue’s way better.

                                 TESS
                        Barbecue chips can suck a dick.

           Doug makes a face and moves to get out of the car.

                                 TESS (CONT’D)
                        Wait. Could you also get me a 
                        Slurpee? And maybe some candy?

           BZZZZZT. A buzzing noise erupts from the tampon box. Tess’ 
           face falls. Doug takes the box and dumps it out, finding 
           GWEN’S CELL PHONE. Incoming call from: “TODD.”

                                 TESS (CONT’D)
                        I can explain.

                                 DOUG
                        You had this the whole time?

                                 TESS
                        I was gonna tell you, but--

                                 DOUG
                        Is there something wrong with me? 
                        Do I have a target on my back that 
                        says “stab here” or something?

                                 TESS
                        Don’t act like you’re the only 
                        victim! They killed our roommate, 
                        Doug! I’ve been hiding that, too!

                                 DOUG
                        Gwen?

                                 TESS
                        Someone shot her. She’s dead.
           Doug softens.

                                 DOUG
                        Were you guys close?

                                 TESS
                        Fuck no! But what else was I 
                        supposed to do?

           A sigh from Doug. He opens the glove box and finds HANDCUFFS.

                                 TESS (CONT’D)
                        Oh come on, you don’t need those.

                                 DOUG
                        What else am I supposed to do?

           Doug handcuffs Tess to the passenger door.

                                 DOUG (CONT’D)
                        Guess I thought you were different. 

                                 TESS
                        Doug, wait--

           He shuts the driver’s side door and walks across the lot.

           Swiftly and discreetly, he drops Gwen’s phone into an empty 
           parked car. Then walks back to a PAY PHONE --

           As he does, an OLD WOMAN exits the mini-mart, gets into her 
           car and drives away, carrying Gwen’s phone away with her.

           Doug SETS THE DRUGS ON TOP OF THE PAY PHONE in order to fish 
           his pockets for loose change. He raises the phone to his ear, 
           praying to feel any emotion other than betrayal.

           INT. KEATON’S HOME BASE - NIGHT

           The PHONE RINGS. Keaton answers, then rolls her eyes.

                                 KEATON
                        Yes, I’ll accept the charges.

           INTERCUT KEATON/DOUG:

                                 DOUG
                        Hey, boss. It’s Doug.

           Keaton snaps her fingers, instructing a nearby GOON to listen 
           in on the call. He puts on headphones, opens a computer.
                                 KEATON
                        Doug! I assume you’re calling me 
                        from right outside to tell me 
                        you’re here and everything’s fine?

                                 DOUG
                        Why’s Blair trying to kill me?

                                 KEATON
                        What do you mean?

                                 DOUG
                        I mean the dude is obsessed with 
                        trying to murder me right now! 

           Keaton tries to think of a lie, rubbing her temples.

                                 KEATON
                        Listen... Blair went rogue. 

                                 DOUG
                        Rogue?

                                 KEATON 
                        You know, rogue. AWOL. Defected. I 
                        think he finally snapped. Further 
                        than he already had, that is.

           Keaton snaps again, looking for an update on Doug’s location.

                                 DOUG
                        So you didn’t send him?

                                 KEATON
                        You and I are like family, Doug. We 
                        don’t go after our own.

           Doug rubs his head, thinking. His betta fish come to mind.

                                 KEATON (CONT’D)
                        Do you still have the girl?

           AT THE CAR:

           Tess sees Doug turn away from her suspiciously, so she 
           stretches her un-cuffed hand toward the RADIO, muting it.

                                 DOUG
                        Yeah, I still have the girl. 

           Tess smells something’s up, as if she all at once remembered 
           she’s been kidnapped. She looks down, thinking, and notices: 
           the keys are still in the ignition.
           BACK WITH KEATON/DOUG:

                                 KEATON
                        Good boy. I’m proud of you, Doug. I 
                        know we’ve had our difficulties in 
                        the past. Mostly you having 
                        difficulties and me having to scold 
                        you for them. But this is good.

                                 DOUG
                        I’m not fucking things up anymore. 
                        I promise. I got this.

           Just then, Tess and the car PEEL OUT OF THE GAS STATION -- 

                                 DOUG (CONT’D)
                        I gotta go.

           Doug quickly hangs up and SPRINTS AFTER THE CAR.

           SIMILARLY, Keaton turns to her goon without missing a beat -- 

                                 KEATON
                        Blair. Now.

           INT./EXT. COP CAR - MOVING - NIGHT

           Jenna pulls up toward the gas station, having found the 
           address Todd provided. She sees Doug sprinting away and 
           follows, one hand still holding a gun.

           INT./EXT. BLAIR’S CAR - MOVING - NIGHT

           Still handcuffed to the passenger side door, Tess has one leg 
           stretched over the CENTER CONSOLE to the gas and one arm 
           leaned over to the wheel. A human pretzel stock car driver.

                                 TESS
                        Shit, shit, shit, shit--

           She tries to flail her foot toward the BRAKE PEDAL, but it’s 
           no use -- too far. CARS SQUEAL OUT OF THE WAY. A FEW CRASH.

                                 TESS (CONT’D)
                        I’m sorry!

           INTERCUT TESS/JENNA:

           Jenna SWERVES in and out of traffic, locating Blair’s car. 
           Tess doesn’t seem to notice, so Jenna FLIPS ON HER SIRENS and 
           rolls down a window, sticking her GUN HAND OUT -- 
           Tess looks into her rear view mirror and sees the gun -- 

                                 TESS (CONT’D)
                        Don’t shoot! This isn’t my car!

           Unable to stop and driving a car full of murder weapons, Tess 
           floors it, trying to evade the cop. Jenna notices.

                                 JENNA
                        No, wait! Tess, it’s me!

           Jenna sticks her head fully out of the window. No use.

                                 JENNA (CONT’D)
                        Hello! It’s Jenna! I’m not a cop!

           A few BYSTANDERS hear this and give confused looks.

           Tess squeals around a corner at top speed and checks her 
           mirror again, this time finally noticing JENNA. She lets off 
           the gas and YANKS THE E-BRAKE, grinding the car to a halt.

           Jenna doesn’t react in time and SLAMS INTO TESS, driving them 
           both into a WALL. A gnarly crash. Both cars totaled.

           EXT. STREETS - NIGHT

           BZZZT. BZZZT. 

           Blair stirs awake, blinking to orient himself. He digs his 
           ringing CELL PHONE out of his pocket and answers.

                                 BLAIR
                        Yes?

           INTERCUT BLAIR/KEATON:

                                 KEATON
                        I don’t know what the fuck is going 
                        on, but you need to catch up to 
                        Doug and the fucking girl. I’m 
                        sending you an address.

                                 BLAIR
                        Speaking of, Eugene’s goons have an 
                        address on us. If we don’t have 
                        product when they show up, this boo 
                        boo is gonna turn into a boo hoo.

           Keaton inhales a furious breath. She’s surrounded by idiots.
                                 KEATON
                        Were you dropped on your head as a 
                        child?

                                 BLAIR
                        You’d have been the one to do it.

           Blair hangs up, still a bit woozy, and walks around a corner 
           to find a PARKED CAR. The DRIVER inside on his cell phone. 

           He taps on the window with his gun, motioning for the Driver 
           to hang up. Frozen with fear, the Driver obliges.

                                 BLAIR (CONT’D)
                        Please exit your automobile.

           The Driver obeys, kneeling onto the pavement.

                                 DRIVER
                        Are you gonna kill me?

                                 BLAIR
                        Should we flip a coin?

           Eyes wide, the Driver takes a deep breath.

                                 BLAIR (CONT’D)
                        I’m just kidding--

           BANG -- Blair’s pistol fires into the Driver’s forehead.

                                 BLAIR (CONT’D)
                        I don’t have a coin.

           EXT. STREETS - MIDDLE OF NOWHERE - SAME

           Tess coughs, coming to. Sees her handcuffs have broken off.

                                 TESS
                        Thank fuck.

           She scrambles out of the car and finds Jenna doing the same. 
           A wave of residual anger boils up as they lock eyes.

                                 TESS (CONT’D)
                        What the hell are you doing?

                                 JENNA
                        Me? You slammed on the fucking 
                        brakes in the middle of the road!

           Tess bites her tongue. She reaches back into the car to the 
           TAMPON BOX, quickly unwrapping five tampons. 
                                 JENNA (CONT’D)
                        What’s that for?

                                 TESS
                        I’m gonna stick them in the gas.

                                 JENNA
                        Pretty sure cars don’t get periods. 

           Tess quickly ties the tampon strings into a chain.

                                 TESS
                        Do you want to get out of here? We 
                        have to do something to create a 
                        diversion or look like we died.

                                 JENNA
                        A few hours with a drug dealer and 
                        now you’re an expert on diversions?

           Tess can’t take it anymore.

                                 TESS
                        Why did you even come back then? I 
                        figured you’d be glad to finally 
                        get rid of me.

           Caught off guard, Jenna tries to catch up.

                                 JENNA
                        What are you talking about?

                                 TESS
                        You bailed on me! Just up and ran 
                        away like you always do.

           Tess opens the trunk and throws all the GUNS and KNIVES out, 
           finally emerging with RUBBING ALCOHOL and a FLARE.

                                 JENNA
                        You’re the one that forced me to 
                        come along tonight! Doug wasn’t 
                        even gonna take me.

                                 TESS
                        It’s not just this! It’s not 
                        hanging out, setting me up, you 
                        moving out. It’s everything.

                                 JENNA
                        That’s what this is about? You 
                        think me moving in with my 
                        boyfriend is bailing on you?
           Jenna opens her mouth to speak further, but stops short.

                                 TESS
                        What? Say it!

                                 JENNA
                        You’re just trying to pick a fight!

                                 TESS
                        You always do this. You never say 
                        anything. You just run away and lie 
                        to me like you lie to Todd about 
                        his stupid fucking furniture.

                                 JENNA
                        I’m not lying, I’m avoiding 
                        needless conflict. Sorry if I 
                        actually care about hurting other 
                        people’s feelings.

                                 TESS
                        Telling it like it is isn’t a bad 
                        thing if it’s the truth!

                                 JENNA
                        Fine! You want the truth?

           With a deep breath, finally, Jenna decides to let loose.

                                 JENNA (CONT’D)
                        You’re SO selfish, Tess! Did you 
                        even think to say sorry for 
                        dragging me along tonight?

           Tess shakes her head, not having it. Dips one end of the 
           tampon chain into the rubbing alcohol. 

                                 JENNA (CONT’D)
                        You think moving in with my 
                        boyfriend or going furniture 
                        shopping has anything to do with 
                        you? Did you ever think about what 
                        I want to do with my life? What 
                        makes me happy?

           Tess fishes the dry end of the chain into the OPEN GAS VALVE.

                                 JENNA (CONT’D)
                        No. You don’t. Because you’re too 
                        busy thinking about yourself.
                                 TESS
                        We’re supposed to be best friends. 
                        Best friends who grow up together 
                        and do stupid shit together.

                                 JENNA
                        We did! We did all of that, Tess. 
                        What am I supposed to do, watch 
                        movies and do drugs with you for 
                        the rest of my life?

                                 TESS
                        If that’s what you want!

                                 JENNA
                        But that’s not what I want! That’s 
                        what you want.

                                 TESS
                        Is that such a bad thing?

           Jenna inhales a deep breath. 

                                 JENNA
                        When we were younger, hanging out 
                        with you was always fun. It was 
                        exciting and dangerous and--

                                 TESS
                        So what’s changed? What’re you so 
                        afraid of? 

                                 JENNA
                        Of dying! I mean what the fuck, 
                        Tess? Look at where we are! 

                                 TESS
                        The most fucked up thing about this 
                        is that it’s the most time we’ve 
                        spent together in months.

                                 JENNA
                        Seriously?

           Tess lights the flare. Fire reflecting in her eyes.

                                 TESS
                        It’s not like I knew this was gonna 
                        be such a big deal.

                                 JENNA
                        That’s not an excuse anymore!

           Tess holds the flare up to the tampon chain. Ignites it.
                                 JENNA (CONT’D)
                        You’re too busy not worrying about 
                        consequences to realize that there 
                        are big fucking consequences. Some 
                        of us actually have lives you’re 
                        fucking with.

                                 TESS
                        Like I don’t have a life?

                                 JENNA
                        Not one that matters.

           Jenna wants to take it back, but it’s too late. Tess is 
           already pouncing, TACKLING HER TO THE GROUND.

                                 TESS
                        Fuck you!

                                 JENNA
                        Fuck you more! Become a cat lady 
                        for all I care.

           The tampon wick burns closer to the gas as they wrestle...

                                 TESS
                        Maybe I will!

           Suddenly, DOUG APPEARS, out of breath, having finally caught 
           up to them on foot. He clocks the situation and sprints 
           further forward, pulling the girls out of the blast radius.

                                 DOUG
                        You’re gonna get yourselves killed!

           Doug tosses them onto the grass near the sidewalk.

                                 JENNA
                        What else is new?

           Tess spits blood, refusing to make eye contact with Jenna.

                                 TESS
                        Why hasn’t it exploded?

                                 JENNA
                        Maybe your tampons are too 
                        absorbent, Menstrual Macgyver.

                                 TESS
                        Go fuck your--
           BOOM! The car ignites into a ball of flames, stunning the 
           trio silent. A moment later, the GUNS and AMMUNITION near the 
           car ignite, popping off like popcorn -- 

                                 DOUG
                        Shit!

           Doug pushes them further to the ground as they cover their 
           heads and ears. BULLETS SPRAY in a random spatter -- 

           EXT. GAS STATION - NIGHT

           BLAIR stands at the gas station, surveying the scene. He 
           follows the tire marks trailing out of the station. Curious.

           He then turns his head back for a moment and his EYES LIGHT 
           UP, noticing SOMETHING INTERESTING near the pay phone...

           EXT. STREETS - MIDDLE OF NOWHERE - NIGHT

           The trio sits up, surveying the explosion’s damage. Only a 
           few trees sustained injuries. Doug dusts himself off.

                                 DOUG
                        Why did you run off? I thought we 
                        were starting to get along.

           Tess snaps, feeding off emotion from her fight with Jenna.

                                 TESS
                        Get along? It’s been like six 
                        hours, I’m pretty sure you need 
                        more than that to Stockholm 
                        Syndrome someone.

                                 DOUG
                        I told you I’m not a kidnapper. My 
                        boss just needs you to help explain 
                        the misunderstanding. That’s it.

           Somehow, it seems like he earnestly believes this.

                                 TESS
                        You seriously think that’s it? I’ve 
                        seen enough television to know what 
                        happens to us when we get where 
                        we’re going. We’re dead, Doug! All 
                        of us. Just like Gwen.

                                 DOUG
                        They aren’t as bad as you think.
                                 TESS
                        Just like your cheating girlfriend?

           Doug’s finally had enough -- 

                                 DOUG
                        You have no idea what you’re 
                        talking about, okay? You don’t know 
                        Keaton. When my parents died, I had 
                        nothing. No job, no money, no 
                        friends. Keaton took me in and gave 
                        me all of that. We’re basically 
                        family. She said so herself.

           His honesty quiets the girls. Jenna softly speaks up.

                                 JENNA
                        When did your parents die?

                                 DOUG
                        Almost two years ago.

                                 TESS
                        Oh, COME ON!

                                 JENNA
                        Tess--

                                 TESS
                        Fuck you. You’re still a sucker. 
                        You almost left me un-cuffed in a 
                        running car because you thought we 
                        were friends. You’re not my friend, 
                        Doug, you’re a fucking kidnapper.

                                 DOUG
                        Maybe I am a sucker. But Blair and 
                        the buyers are coming for you 
                        either way. I could leave you for 
                        dead right now, how about that?

           Tess bristles, again refusing to make eye contact.

                                 JENNA
                        Okay. We’re with you. At least 
                        until Blair is out of the equation.

           Satisfied, Doug turns to Tess -- 

                                 DOUG
                        Can I have the drugs back now?

                                 TESS
                        What do you mean?
                                 DOUG
                        I mean I’d like to hold the drugs 
                        in my hands.

                                 TESS
                        I don’t have them.

           Doug furrows his brow, confused.

                                 TESS (CONT’D)
                        You had them at the--

                                 DOUG
                             (realizing)
                        FUUUUUUUCK...

           PRE-LAP SFX: DING, DING.

           INT. MINI MART - GAS STATION - NIGHT

           The bell on the mini-mart door JINGLES as Doug enters. He 
           turns down an aisle and finds BLAIR calmly shopping.

                                 DOUG
                        Hey, Blair.

                                 BLAIR
                        Douglas! I hadn’t even finished 
                        brainstorming my dramatic entrance 
                        line yet.

                                 DOUG
                        Save it.

                                 BLAIR
                        That one’s not bad.

                                 DOUG
                        Give me back the drugs.

                                 BLAIR
                        How about... I give you the 
                        narcotics, but you let me handle 
                        the girls. You appear competent for 
                        once, and I deliver clean bodies--

                                 DOUG
                        Bodies? You’re gonna kill them?

                                 BLAIR
                        Of course we’re gonna kill them. 
                        Did you seriously think we wanted 
                        you to bring them in alive?
           All in one motion, Doug reaches out and picks up a HOT POT OF 
           COFFEE, SMASHING it over Blair’s head. He goes tumbling down.

                                 BLAIR (CONT’D)
                        Could everyone kindly stop smashing 
                        my head with blunt objects? 

           The SOLE MINI-MART EMPLOYEE, 20s, pulls A SHOTGUN from behind 
           the counter and jumps out, ready to fuck shit up.

                                 MINI-MART EMPLOYEE
                        Let’s go, assholes!

           TESS AND JENNA see this and run in, JUMPING onto his back. 
           They tumble to the ground and the shotgun goes flying -- 

           Doug is already on top of Blair, pinning him down.

                                 DOUG
                        I’m not letting you kill them!

                                 BLAIR
                        It’s not up to you!

           Blair WINDMILLS HIS LEGS AROUND, freeing himself. He then 
           pulls Doug up and drags him toward the SLURPEE MACHINE.

           Jenna and Tess wrestle the Employee away from his gun as --

           Blair forcefully shoves Doug’s head UNDER THE SPOUT of the 
           Slurpee machine -- then YANKS the handle down, effectively 
           WATERBOARDING Doug in blue raspberry-flavored fashion.

                                 DOUG
                        Brain freeze! BRAIN FREEZE!

           Jenna grabs the Employee’s FALLEN SHOTGUN and aims it at the 
           Slurpee machine, trying to avoid aiming at Doug.

                                 TESS
                        Do it already, you pussy!

                                 JENNA
                        Don’t call me that!

           Tess lunges up and takes the gun from Jenna -- BANG!

           The blast RICOCHETS off the Slurpee machine, hitting no one, 
           but allowing Doug to gain the upper hand --

                                 TESS
                        Shit!
                                 DOUG
                        Be more useful!

           Tess and Jenna work together to pull the Employee over to the 
           ICE CREAM FREEZER, slamming his head in the drawer until he’s 
           knocked out. Tess sees BAGS OF ICE inside and gets an idea...

           Doug pushes Blair toward the HOT DOG ROLLER and forces his 
           head down toward it, SEARING HIS CHEEK ON THE HOT METAL.

           Blair SLAMS Doug’s head against the sneeze guard, freeing 
           himself. Doug holds his now-bloody nose as he backs up --

                                 DOUG (CONT’D)
                        Eww. Your face. Your face looks 
                        super gross.

                                 BLAIR
                        Take it back!

           He SLAMS Doug up against a soda machine --

                                 DOUG
                        I can’t! It’s disgusting!

           Blair pushes his BURNED, DANGLING CHEEK toward Doug’s face.

                                 DOUG (CONT’D)
                        EWWWWW! Okay, okay! Your face looks 
                        not gross! I take it back! You’re a 
                        very handsome gentleman!

           Blair lets off on the pressure, satisfied, and Doug PUNCHES 
           him square in the teeth. Blood immediately fills his mouth.

           Tess and Jenna over to the door with a bag of ice, RIPPING IT 
           OPEN as Doug runs toward them -- 

                                 TESS
                        Jump!

           Doug dodges the ice as it sends Blair slipping to the ground. 
           He slams his head on the floor for the sixtieth time.

                                 TESS (CONT’D)
                        Go, go, go!

           She and Jenna scurry out, running through the parking lot -- 

           EXT. GAS STATION - PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS

           BANG -- 
           Jenna yelps in pain, grabbing her leg, as they turn around 
           and find Blair sprawled out on the ground. SHOTGUN in hand.

                                 TESS
                        You didn’t bring the gun?

                                 JENNA
                        Don’t yell at me, I’m shot!

           Doug charges Blair, who fires again -- but it’s out of 
           shells. Doug reaches into Blair’s jacket and pulls out:

           THE DRUGS. Finally.

                                 DOUG
                        Find a car!

           He TOSSES THE DRUGS to Tess as she helps Jenna toward a CAR.

           Blair sweeps Doug’s legs in a flash and pulls him to a gas 
           pump, wrapping a GASOLINE HOSE around his neck.

                                 DOUG (CONT’D)
                        Fuck you! You picked a hell of a 
                        time to go insane, asshole.

                                 BLAIR
                        I didn’t pick a time, I’m a 
                        professionally diagnosed 
                        psychopath.

                                 DOUG
                        Keaton told me you went rogue.

                                 BLAIR
                        Rogue? Like I’m an international 
                        man of mystery?

           Blair lets out an enormous chuckle.

           INT. PARKED CAR - PARKING LOT - SAME

           Tess squeezes a single shotgun pellet out of Jenna’s calf.

                                 JENNA
                        Am I gonna die?

                                 TESS
                        Not from this. 

           Tess hears the commotion and notices Doug’s in trouble -- 
                                 TESS (CONT’D)
                        Fuck.

           BACK OUTSIDE:

                                 BLAIR
                        You honestly believe Keaton didn’t 
                        send me? That’s dreadfully sad.

           Doug lashes out, getting a solid punch in.

                                 BLAIR (CONT’D) 
                        Obviously she sent me! And once she 
                        heard about what an extravagant 
                        mess you made with the narcotics, 
                        she ordered me to kill anyone who 
                        got in my way. Including you.

           Doug’s clearly hurting. Doesn’t want to believe it.

                                 DOUG
                        That’s not true.

                                 BLAIR
                        You poor boy. Of course it is.

           OUT OF NOWHERE, Tess flies in and smashes Blair across the 
           head with THE DRUGS. He rolls off of Doug, stumbling to his 
           feet, as Doug DIVES onto the brick of drugs.

                                 TESS
                        Are you okay?

           Doug won’t say.

                                 TESS (CONT’D)
                        Okay. You’ll be okay.

           Without the drugs or a gun, Blair turns to his next best 
           option: and begins commandeering the CAR JENNA IS IN. Tess 
           runs over just in time for Blair to turn to her -- 

                                 BLAIR
                        Tell your friend Douglas he needs 
                        to bring the narcotics home. For 
                        her sake, I hope you’re convincing.

           He gestures to Jenna, who bangs on the windows from inside.

                                 TESS
                        No!

           Blair hops into the car and peels off. 
           Tess runs back over to Doug, splayed out on the ground. He’s 
           bloody and beaten, trying to catch his breath.

                                 TESS (CONT’D)
                        He took Jenna! Doug, get up!

           Tess slaps Doug across the face. He rolls over in pain.

                                 TESS (CONT’D)
                        Blair took Jenna. We have to bring 
                        the drugs in or he’ll kill her.

           Doug nurses his wounds. Both physical and emotional.

                                 DOUG
                        I’m sorry. It’s over.

           Doug rolls over and Tess sees that the DRUGS have burst open, 
           most of the contents scattering away in the breeze.

                                 TESS
                        FUCK!

           Tess runs her hands through her hair, distraught.

                                 DOUG
                        You were right, I’m a sucker. 
                        Nobody cares about me. I’m just a 
                        fuck up. 

                                 TESS
                        I was just upset before.

                                 DOUG
                        My girlfriend was just using me for 
                        my money. She never even loved me.

                                 TESS
                        You don’t know that.

                                 DOUG
                        She said all that on my voicemail 
                        the other day. 

                                 TESS
                        It’s not your fault. You’re just 
                        too good to bad people. You need to 
                        find people who deserve your 
                        loyalty. Who aren’t too selfish to 
                        appreciate you for who you are.

           Tess falters, hearing some of her and Jenna in her words. 
                                 TESS (CONT’D)
                        If this is anyone’s fault, it’s 
                        mine. I went on the date. I sat at 
                        your table. I flushed the drugs. 
                        And now I let Jenna go. She 
                        deserves better than that.

           Doug hears this, empathizing.

                                 DOUG
                        I just wanted people to like me.  
                        I’m tired of being the fuck up.

                                 TESS
                        I know. Me too. 

           A beat. Two broken people in their broken worlds.

                                 TESS (CONT’D)
                        Is there any way to fix this?

                                 DOUG
                        We can try.

           Doug smiles. Still a bit broken, but a bit optimistic, too.

           EXT. KEATON’S HOME BASE - STREET - NIGHT

           Ziggy pulls the car up to Keaton and Blair’s house. Finch 
           looks out the window, bewildered to finally be there.

           A GUN COCKING catches his attention. 

                                 FINCH
                        What are you doing?

                                 ZIGGY
                        Loading my gun.

                                 FINCH
                        For what?

                                 ZIGGY
                        For shooting.

                                 FINCH
                        We need to talk to them!

                                 ZIGGY
                        I’ve had enough of you whining 
                        about talking all the time. I was 
                        hired as a bruiser and I wanna give 
                        out some goddamn bruises already!
           Ziggy opens the door to get out, but Finch CLOSES IT.

                                 ZIGGY (CONT’D)
                        Real mature.

           Finch then PISTOL WHIPS Ziggy in the teeth. As she recovers 
           from the shock, he pulls HANDCUFFS out of his pants and cuffs 
           her to the wheel like a human anti-theft device. 

                                 ZIGGY (CONT’D)
                        Fuck! Why the fuck did you do that?

                                 FINCH
                        Because...

           At his wit’s end, Finch finally explodes -- 

                                 FINCH (CONT’D)
                        Because I’m a fucking COP!

           Ziggy fires a wad of bloody spit at his face.

                                 ZIGGY
                        You’re too dumb to be a cop.

           Finch wipes his face, even angrier now --

                                 FINCH
                        How do you think Doug ended up at 
                        the wrong restaurant?

                                 ZIGGY
                        He’s a fucking dummy, too!

                                 FINCH
                        No. It’s because I gave him the 
                        wrong restaurant. I’ve been trying 
                        to get to Keaton for MONTHS, but 
                        every time I got close, you or 
                        Eugene would fuck it up with your 
                        gangster bullshit! I knew if you 
                        got stood up, you fuck-heads would 
                        do anything to retaliate. You 
                        basically led me straight to her.

                                 ZIGGY
                        That was your plan?

                                 FINCH
                        It worked, didn’t it?

                                 ZIGGY
                        I guess, but what if we--
                                 FINCH
                        Don’t overthink it!

           Finch opens the car door, exiting -- 

                                 FINCH (CONT’D)
                        You’ve been waiting for bruising, 
                        I’ve been waiting for this. 

           Ziggy furiously writhes around, screaming as he runs off.

           PRE-LAP SFX: DING DONG.

           INT. KEATON’S HOME BASE - NIGHT

           Keaton answers the door to find: EUGENE. He’s wearing full 
           shield sunglasses and lighting a joint. Keaton bristles.

                                 KEATON
                        Eugene? Hi, I wasn’t...

                                 EUGENE
                        This is your house? Damn, Keaton, I 
                        think you’ve been over-charging me.

           He pushes past Keaton, letting himself in.

           INT. GUEST BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Blair pulls Jenna into a surprisingly calm guest bedroom. 
           Clean comforter. Designer lamps. Art on the walls.

                                 JENNA
                        Let go of me!

                                 BLAIR
                        There’s a bed if you’re tired, or a 
                        television in the corner, which 
                        might provide some enjoyment.

           Blair sets her down on the bed and leaves, then turns back.

                                 BLAIR (CONT’D)
                        Oh, one more thing. I’ve booby-
                        trapped this whole house, and there 
                        are some real doozies in here. Best 
                        not get curious.

                                 JENNA
                        WHY ARE YOU SO WEIRD?!
                                 BLAIR
                        Many professionals have tried to 
                        answer that question. Inconclusive, 
                        I’m afraid. 

           As Blair shuts the door -- 

                                 JENNA
                        YOU DON’T SAY?

           Jenna flops onto the bed, noticing a nearly-invisible lattice 
           of fishing line running up the wall. What the fuck? 

           EXT. FRONT YARD - NIGHT

           FINCH climbs through the yard, sneaking up to get a view 
           through a window. He spots KEATON AND BLAIR in the living 
           room, mocking each other and flipping each other off.

           Finch pulls a BURNER CELL PHONE out of his sock. Dials.

                                 FINCH
                        This is detective Dave Berton. I’m 
                        outside Keaton and Blair’s home 
                        base. I’ve got eyes on both.

           An OFFICER on the other end pipes up.

                                 OFFICER (O.S.)
                        That plan actually worked?

           Finch rolls his eyes, exhausted.

                                 FINCH
                        Yes, okay? God dammit!

                                 OFFICER (O.S.)
                        Can you see what they’re doing?

                                 FINCH 
                        They look to be arguing about 
                        something. Blair is making a 
                        masturbatory gesture with his hand. 
                        Keaton has him in a headlock now. 
                        Appears to be giving him a noogie. 

                                 OFFICER (O.S.)
                        You have an address?

                                 FINCH
                        Yes.

           A long pause.
                                 OFFICER (O.S.)
                        ...can you give it to us?

                                 FINCH
                        Oh. Yes. 5551 Beacon.

                                 OFFICER
                        We’re sending a squad over now. 
                        Once you see product on the table, 
                        we’ll move in.

                                 FINCH
                        Copy.

           Finch hangs up and pockets his phone. He takes a deep breath, 
           draws his gun, and begins inching closer to the house...

           EXT. KEATON’S HOME BASE - STREET - NIGHT

           Doug parks the car a safe distance away from Keaton’s house.

                                 DOUG
                        I’m not sure if I can do this.

           A beat as Tess unbuckles her seat belt.

                                 TESS
                        What would Robin Hood do?

           Doug smiles as they exit the car.

           They move around to the trunk and Doug pulls out the pathetic 
           last remains of GARY BUSEY, POCKETING IT. He then pulls out a 
           BAG OF FLOUR taken from the mini-mart. He tapes the flour up 
           to look like a fake brick and holds it up to Tess.

                                 DOUG
                        What do you think?

                                 TESS
                        It has Gary Busey’s eyes. 

           Doug smiles, then pulls out a POCKET KNIFE and slits the pad 
           of his own palm -- enough to draw blood.

                                 TESS (CONT’D)
                        Doug, don’t--

           He brings his bloody hand up to her head, gently applying 
           blood to resemble a head wound. 

                                 TESS (CONT’D)
                        How do I look?
           Doug nods, satisfied with his work. 

                                 DOUG
                        Ready to die?

                                 TESS
                        Hopefully only figuratively.

           INT. KEATON’S HOME BASE - FOYER - LATER

           KNOCK, KNOCK, KNOCK. 

           Blair opens the door to find Doug holding a limp Tess in his 
           arms -- playing dead well enough. Keaton exhales.

                                 KEATON
                        Thank Christ, Doug, you finally did 
                        something right.

                                 EUGENE
                        That’s the girl?

           Eugene steps in front of Doug. The room holds its breath.

                                 EUGENE (CONT’D)
                        You thought this girl was a dealer? 
                        Your SAT scores must’ve been sad.

           Doug walks Tess down to the guest room, opening the door.

           INT. GUEST ROOM - CONTINUOUS

           Inside, Jenna is sitting calmly on the bed, trying to work 
           the TV REMOTE. She jumps up when he sees “dead” Tess enter.

                                 JENNA
                        What happened? Doug, what happened? 
                        Did you kill her, you asshole?

           Doug looks back toward the still-open door.

                                 DOUG
                        Yeah, she’s dead. Now keep your 
                        voice down, please.

           He sets Tess down on the floor and turns back out the door.

           Jenna regards Tess’ “dead” body. Her eyes are still closed as 
           she hears the sound of the door shut behind Doug.
                                 JENNA
                        Tess, I’m so sorry. I didn’t mean 
                        what I said. Your life matters, I--

           Tess opens her eyes, raising a finger to Jenna’s lips.

                                 TESS
                        Shh, don’t cry.

           Jenna snaps back, horrified.

                                 JENNA
                        Fuck! What?!

                                 TESS
                        Sorry! 

                                 JENNA
                        Do you know how traumatic that was?

                                 TESS
                        We had to sneak in. I’m sorry.

           Jenna calms down, wrapping Tess into a hug.

           BACK TO THE FOYER:

           Doug re-enters the foyer, joining Keaton, Blair and Eugene.

                                 KEATON
                        I’ll give you credit for showing 
                        up. If I were you, I’d be knee deep 
                        in the witness protection program.

                                 DOUG
                        I guess I’m not like you.

           Doug hands Keaton the POST-IT note from his fridge.

                                 KEATON
                        What’s this?

                                 DOUG
                        I went to the right restaurant. It 
                        was Eugene’s people who gave me the 
                        wrong place. So maybe you should 
                        start scolding him instead.

           Eugene cocks an eyebrow, confused.

                                 EUGENE
                        That’s not my stationary. 

           BACK TO THE GUEST ROOM:
           Jenna and Tess sit side by side. Embracing the quiet calm.

                                 TESS
                        I’m sorry. 

                                 JENNA
                        I get it, I just don’t want to see 
                        another dead body until it’s the 
                        back of my own eyelids. 

                                 TESS
                        I don’t mean that. I mean I do mean 
                        that, but also for everything else. 
                        You have a great life. I’m sorry 
                        for being too wrapped up in my own 
                        shit to acknowledge that. 

                                 JENNA
                        I know I’ve been busy lately--

                                 TESS
                        It’s not your fault. It’s just... 
                        before, I feel like no matter what 
                        happened, no matter where I ended 
                        up, you’d be there and I could lean 
                        on your shoulder. But one day I 
                        woke up and you were moving on. 

                                 JENNA
                        Not moving on. Just moving out.

                                 TESS
                        I don’t know what to do without 
                        you. I’m afraid, too.

                                 JENNA
                        Just because I’m moving in with 
                        Todd doesn’t mean he gets sole 
                        custody of my shoulder.

           Tess smiles and they hug again. Then -- 

                                 TESS
                        Should we get the fuck out of here?

                                 JENNA
                        Yes, please. 

           Tess pulls out a GUN as their eyes turn to the VENTS...

           BACK TO THE FOYER: 
                                 EUGENE
                        I don’t know what ya’ll are talking 
                        about, but I didn’t come here to 
                        braid your hair and swap gossip. Do 
                        you have my shit or do you not?

           Doug pulls the FAKE DRUGS out of his shirt. 

                                 DOUG
                        Here. Happy?

           Eugene grabs the fake drugs from Doug, elated.

                                 EUGENE
                        Smells like cash.

           Eugene whips out a SWITCHBLADE as Doug sweats nervously. But 
           just as he’s is about to slice open the brick, everyone hears 
           LOUD BANGING come from inside the walls.

                                 EUGENE (CONT’D)
                        What’s that noise?

                                 DOUG
                        I don’t hear anything.

           INT. STUDY - SAME

           The BANGING NOISES grow louder and louder, until... Tess and 
           Jenna tumble out of an AIR VENT, covered in spider webs.

                                 TESS
                        Why would anyone do that?!

                                 JENNA
                        We didn’t even get anywhere, we’re 
                        just in another room!

           As they recover, a window creaks open and a leg finds its way 
           in. Then a torso, and then: FINCH. Tess raises her gun -- 

                                 TESS
                        Who the fuck are you?

                                 FINCH
                        Whoa, whoa, don’t shoot! I’m a cop.

                                 JENNA
                        Oh my god.

                                 TESS
                        Are you serious?
                                 FINCH
                        Yes! I saw you before. At the 
                        stoplight. Remember?

                                 TESS
                        I remember you shooting at us!

                                 FINCH
                        I was undercover before. And before 
                        that. My real name is Dave. I like 
                        lattes and bicycles and I’ve never 
                        done a real drug in my life.  

           Tess lowers her weapon, relieved.

                                 JENNA
                        You have no idea how long I’ve been 
                        waiting for you.

                                 FINCH
                        Don’t worry. I’m gonna get everyone 
                        out of here. Just follow my--

           BOOM -- FINCH’S HEAD EXPLODES INTO A MIST. Too quickly for 
           the girls to realize that SOMEONE’S CLIMBING IN THE WINDOW.

           They SCREAM in terror, Tess dropping her gun, as Finch’s 
           lifeless body gives out to reveal: ZIGGY. Silenced gun and 
           all. Handcuffs broken but still on her wrists. 

                                 ZIGGY
                        Who are you two?

           Jenna VOMITS onto Finch’s body in response.

                                 TESS
                        God dammit, Jenna!

                                 JENNA
                        I can’t help it! His face is 
                        fucking gone!

                                 ZIGGY
                        Were you with this cop?

                                 JENNA
                        No way! We hate cops!

                                 TESS
                        “Fuck the Police” is like my 
                        favorite song of all time!

                                 ZIGGY
                        Is Eugene here?
                                 JENNA
                        We don’t know who that is.

           Ziggy pulls Tess and Jenna out of the door by their collars --

           A group of GOONS are milling about, searching for the source 
           of the loud noises. A GUNSHOT goes off and everyone whips 
           around to see ZIGGY -- gun aimed at Keaton.

                                 ZIGGY
                        Hands off the heat, fellas.

           Doug, Blair and the Goons take their hands off their guns.

                                 EUGENE
                        Chill, Zig! I have the shit. 
                        Everything’s accounted for.

                                 ZIGGY
                        Even the dead pig down the hall?

                                 EUGENE
                        Dead what?

                                 BLAIR
                        We’re in a metropolis, how did a 
                        pig even get in here?

                                 JENNA
                        She means a cop!

           Keaton’s night just got a little bit worse.

                                 KEATON
                        A cop?

                                 TESS
                        Her partner was fucking undercover!

                                 KEATON
                        I’m sorry, who are you?

                                 TESS
                        I’m Tess. Hi. Sorry. Continue.

                                 EUGENE
                        Finch was a fucking cop?

                                 ZIGGY
                        He screwed the deal up on purpose 
                        so we’d lead him here. To her.
           Doug shoots Keaton and Blair an “I told you so” look.

                                 ZIGGY (CONT’D)
                        It was all a frame up... conspiracy 
                        level... trick... what the heck 
                        phrase am I trying to think of?

                                 JENNA
                        SET UP. 

                                 ZIGGY
                        Set up! THANK YOU!

                                 KEATON
                        So why are you pointing a gun at 
                        me? He was on your side!

                                 ZIGGY
                        He had to be working with Doug. Why 
                        else would he fall for this shit? 

                                 KEATON
                        Because Doug is a fucking idiot. 
                        That part is for real.

           Fed up, Doug HITS KEATON IN THE FACE WITH THE FAKE DRUGS.  
           She stumbles as the FLOUR inside BURSTS OUT, raining down.

           Using the falling flour as a smoke screen, Blair whips his 
           gun out and SHOOTS ZIGGY in the arm. She rolls for cover --

                                 EUGENE
                        Is this flour?

           Eugene turns and SLITS A GOON’S THROAT with his switchblade. 
           He stabs his way through people on an unhinged rampage -- 

                                 DOUG
                        Get out of here!

           Tess and Jenna scurry out of the room at Doug’s command. 
           Keaton notices and RUNS OUT OF THE ROOM AFTER THE GIRLS -- 

           Blair pulls his gun toward Doug, but Doug body tackles him --

                                 BLAIR
                        I suppose I owe you an apology. 

                                 DOUG
                        Fuck you.

           Doug scrambles to his feet and Blair chases him out -- 
           Eugene slits another throat and then starts looting the 
           house, pocketing expensive-looking objects. He slowly reaches 
           up a shelf, not noticing the FISHING LINE connected to it...

           Ziggy finds the LAST REMAINS OF GARY BUSEY, which has fallen 
           out of Doug’s jacket. She opens up the bag and SNORTS--

           BOOM! Eugene triggers a BOOBY-TRAPPED EXPLOSION, blowing him 
           to pieces and sending Ziggy and a few GOONS flying.

           INT. KITCHEN - NIGHT

           Tess and Jenna run into the kitchen, scrambling to find an 
           exit, as KEATON enters behind them. 

                                 KEATON
                        YOU!

           Keaton power-walks toward them, rage intensifying with every 
           step. The girls grab nearby KITCHEN UTENSILS -- arming 
           themselves with anything -- as Keaton reaches them.

           Keaton quickly gains the upper hand, CHOKING TESS, until 
           Jenna gets a solid WHACK in with a frying pan. Keaton gets up 
           and walks toward a KNIFE BLOCK. Jenna notices the knives...

                                 JENNA
                        No, no, no...

           Jenna scrambles up and DIVES onto Keaton’s legs.

                                 JENNA (CONT’D)
                        Tess, help me!

           Tess slowly grumbles to her feet and jumps on Keaton -- both 
           girls now holding her legs back -- just as Doug did to them.

                                 TESS
                        Just let us go!

                                 KEATON
                        You’re the one holding my legs.

                                 TESS
                        Because you’re gonna stab us!

           Keaton reaches for a PARTICULAR KNIFE, her lanky arms giving 
           her enough stretch to get a fingertip on it.
           INT. DINING ROOM - SAME

           Blair catches Doug and they wrestle each other to the ground, 
           smashing through decorative candles and FINE CHINA.

                                 BLAIR
                        We can’t fight in here! This is the 
                        dining room!

           Doug intentionally SMASHES a dish as they continue to wreck 
           their way across the room, wrestling up against a wall --

           BACK TO KITCHEN:

           Tess and Jenna try with all their might, but Keaton gets a 
           hand on the knife. She PULLS, and -- 

           CLICK. The knife doesn’t come out of the block. Rather, it 
           TRIGGERS A SERIES OF SECRET COMPARTMENTS TO OPEN, REVEALING --

           GUNS HIDDEN EVERYWHERE. Behind cabinets, under tables, behind 
           paintings -- a booby-trapped buried treasure.

                                 TESS
                        No fucking way.

           INT. FOYER - SAME

           Ziggy recovers from the blast, her arm wound wrapped and her 
           brain on drugs. She notices a SECRET COMPARTMENT has flipped 
           open in a nearby demilune, revealing an AUTOMATIC RIFLE. 

                                 ZIGGY
                        It’s bruisin’ time.

           Ziggy grabs the gun and pops up, MOWING THROUGH GOONS -- 

           BACK TO DINING ROOM:

           A PAINTING has swung open right next to Blair. He and Doug 
           are lunging for the GUN hiding inside. Blair manages to get a 
           hand on it and SMASHES Doug’s head with the butt --

           Doug rolls under the dining table to avoid Blair’s shots.

                                 BLAIR
                        Being nearly concussed isn’t very 
                        pleasant, is it?

           Blair fires as Doug ekes out of the room, running away -- 

           BACK TO KITCHEN: 
           Keaton grabs a nearby gun from a now-open cabinet, causing 
           the girls to scurry away as fast as they can. 

                                 TESS
                        Shit, shit, shit!

           Keaton fires but misses as the girls wheel around the corner. 
           On their way out, they SCOOP GUNS OUT OF COMPARTMENTS --  

           BACK TO FOYER:

           Ziggy looks for Eugene -- but only finds his gold shoes. She 
           wails a coked-out scream and KILLS MORE GOONS, finally 
           basking in the badass glory she’s always wanted.

           Tess and Jenna wheel around the corner -- uh oh. Wrong turn. 

                                 ZIGGY
                        You dick-holes killed Gene!

           The girls freeze in fear, but as Ziggy raises her rifle... 
           HER EYELIDS FLUTTER, AND SHE FALLS TO THE GROUND. ASLEEP. 

           Tess and Jenna stare in shock until the last few GOONS pop up 
           and RIDDLE ZIGGY’S BODY WITH BULLETS. If Ziggy were awake, 
           she’d be proud to die in a hail of gunfire.

           The goons turn to the girls, but they’re already gone --

           INT. KITCHEN - SAME

           Doug sees Blair enter the kitchen and shoots -- trading fire. 
           Blair falls to the ground, hidden. 

           From BLAIR’S POV, he sees JENNA wheel around the corner into 
           the LIVING ROOM and smiles to himself...

           Doug re-loads his gun and grabs a KNIFE for good measure, but 
           when he gets to the spot where Blair fell, HE’S VANISHED.

           INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME

           Blair enters the living room after Jenna, but finds it empty. 
           He re-loads his gun clip and toes the carpet.

                                 BLAIR
                        Jenna?

           Nothing.
                                 BLAIR (CONT’D)
                        Jenna, I live here. I’ve already 
                        found all the good hiding places.

           He looks behind a sofa: nothing. 

                                 BLAIR (CONT’D)
                        This feels familiar, doesn’t it?

           He creeps over to a bookcase, shotgun raised.

                                 BLAIR (CONT’D)
                        Marco!

           Silence. Nobody behind the bookcase. 

                                 BLAIR (CONT’D)
                        Marco?

           More silence as he turns back around.

                                 BLAIR (CONT’D)
                        Marco?

                                 TESS (O.S.)
                        Polo.

           BANG --

           From behind Blair, Tess has pulled the trigger, lodging a 
           bullet into Blair’s head. His lanky frame timbers to the 
           ground with a curious smile. Amused somehow even in death.

                                 TESS (CONT’D)
                        That was for...

           Jenna pops up from inside a DECORATIVE TRUNK and crawls out.

                                 TESS (CONT’D)
                        That was for... ugh, I really want 
                        to say that was for Gwen but my 
                        body just won’t let me.

                                 JENNA
                        Tess!

                                 TESS
                        I’m sorry! I just can’t.

           They start to run out of the room.

                                 TESS (CONT’D)
                        Hey, you didn’t throw up that time.
                                 JENNA
                        It’s a wonder what seeing a bunch 
                        of dead bodies in a row will do to 
                        your gag reflex.

           INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS

           The girls run around a corner, finally in the home stretch, 
           until KEATON steps out into the hallway -- right into them.

                                 KEATON
                        Whoa, whoa, whoa.

                                 TESS
                        God dammit!

                                 KEATON
                        I’m not about to let two random 
                        girls bring down an empire. Do you 
                        realize how hard I’ve worked for 
                        this? Look at my fucking house.

           Keaton raises a gun up to Tess’ head.

                                 TESS
                        You have a very beautiful home.

                                 JENNA
                        I really like those pillows.

                                 KEATON
                        Thank you.

                                 JENNA
                        Where did you get them?

                                 KEATON
                        Pottery--

           Keaton GASPS. At first, the girls aren’t sure why.

                                 TESS
                        Pottery where? I mean I assume 
                        “Barn,” but...

           Keaton grabs her midsection, where blood begins seeping...

           Behind her, DOUG stands, holding the handle of a KNIFE. Blade 
           deep into Keaton’s lower back. She wobbles, losing strength.

                                 KEATON
                        You had to literally stab me in the 
                        back, after all these years?
                                 DOUG
                        It’s only been two years.

           A streak of blood on the wall guides Keaton to the floor.

                                 TESS
                        Come on, Doug.

                                 KEATON
                        Don’t walk away from me. 

           Tess pulls him away, leaving Keaton behind.

                                 KEATON (CONT’D)
                        DOUG!
                             (then, to self)
                        Fuck...

           Keaton slumps over, eyes flickering, finally dead.

           AT THE FRONT DOOR:

           Tess and Jenna open the front door, home free, only to 
           realize Doug isn’t following them.

                                 TESS
                        Aren’t you coming?

                                 DOUG
                        Nah, I think I’m good.

                                 JENNA
                        Don’t be silly. 

                                 DOUG
                        It turns out you guys are the 
                        closest thing to real friends I’ve 
                        ever had. I belong in here.

                                 JENNA
                        You’re not a bad guy.

           A small smile from Doug.

                                 DOUG
                        I may not be a bad guy, but I’m 
                        still a “bad guy.”

                                 TESS
                        You’re Robin Hood, Doug. You’ve 
                        just been looking out for the wrong 
                        people.

           Doug warms, taking this in.
                                 DOUG
                        Get going.

                                 JENNA
                        Bye.

           Tess waves a wordless goodbye as they exit the front door.

           Doug winces, adrenaline fading, and grips his side. When he 
           removes his hand, it’s glistening with WET BLOOD.

           EXT. KEATON’S HOME BASE - CONTINUOUS

           Tess seems to think of something else to say, but by the time 
           she turns back around, Doug’s nowhere to be found. 

           MOMENTS LATER:

           Tess and Jenna scramble into the front yard as SIRENS wail.

                                 TESS
                        I’m not working out for a full 
                        calendar year after this.

                                 JENNA
                        Fuck working out, I’m never going 
                        outside again.

           A dozen POLICE CARS squeal up and slam on the brakes as their 
           headlights reach the girls. OFFICERS open their car doors and 
           draw their handguns as a CAPTAIN barks out at the girls:

                                 CAPTAIN
                        Drop your weapons!

                                 TESS
                        Oh, shit.

           Tess remembers they’re holding guns and they both chuck them 
           ten feet in every direction.

                                 JENNA
                        Sorry!

                                 CAPTAIN
                        Hands in the air!

           They both shoot their bloodied hands in the air. 

                                 CAPTAIN (CONT’D)
                        Stay there, we’re coming down!
           Tess sees that Jenna’s left hand is shaking nervously. She 
           reaches over, hands still raised, and grabs it. 

                                 TESS
                        Remember when you said all the 
                        insanity is worth it for the right 
                        person?

                                 JENNA
                        Please don’t be talking about the 
                        drug dealers.

                                 TESS
                        I’m not.

           Jenna smiles, knowing she means her. They stand, holding 
           hands, as the police begin to surround them. 

           TODD exits a cop car and sprints toward Jenna. Instinctively, 
           Jenna runs toward him, LETTING GO OF TESS’ HAND...

           Tess allows herself a soft smile as she watches them embrace. 

           QUICK, DRUG-INDUCED DREAM SEQUENCE:

           A CELTICS WINDBREAKER IS UNZIPPED, DOVES FLY OUT -- 

           TESS AND JENNA HUG, CARTOON HEARTS SURROUND THEM -- 

           FIREWORKS EXPLODE IN FRONT OF AN AMERICAN FLAG --

                                 TODD (PRE-LAP)
                        TIME TO GO!

           INT. TESS & JENNA’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Moving day. Tess’ eyes open to find Todd standing over her. 

                                 TESS
                        Already?

           She stands up to hug Todd. No longer her adversary. 

                                 TESS (CONT’D)
                        She’s all yours, Todd.

                                 TODD 
                        We both know I’m the step dad in 
                        this situation.

                                 TESS 
                        Let’s not start off with an incesty 
                        metaphor.
           Todd smiles, grabs the last few boxes and heads for the exit.

                                 TODD
                             (to Jenna)
                        I’ll meet you there. I’m gonna pick 
                        up that really rad barrel I showed 
                        you. I was thinking we could turn 
                        into an organic espresso bar.

           Tess makes a face. Jenna tries to act happy, but then -- 

                                 JENNA
                        I was actually thinking... maybe we 
                        don’t get the barrel.

                                 TODD
                        You don’t like it?

                                 JENNA
                        I don’t love it...

           Finally the truth. Jenna braces herself for his reaction. 

                                 TODD
                        We’ll find something else. 

           Jenna exhales, a weight off her shoulders. Todd kisses her 
           sweetly and exits. The girls now alone in the apartment.

                                 JENNA
                        Here’s my key. 

           Jenna holds up her KEY to their apartment.

                                 TESS
                        Oh, you can keep it.

                                 JENNA
                        You’re not gonna move out? Someone 
                        was straight up murdered here.

                                 TESS
                        And because of that, I’m basically 
                        living here for free now. 

           Jenna smirks, pocketing the key.

                                 JENNA
                        Okay then.

           An awkward silence. Nobody wants to make the first move.

                                 JENNA (CONT’D)
                        See you around?
                                 TESS
                        Yeah. Of course.

           They hug. Awkwardly at first, and then a full embrace. 

                                 JENNA
                        Okay.

           Jenna exits with a soft wave, closing the door behind her.

           Tess inhales a deep breath and flops down onto the couch. 

           GWEN’S CAT appears, crawling onto Tess’ chest. Tess stares at 
           the cat uncomfortably, and then gives in and pets it.

                                 TESS
                        Okay, but I’m only gonna be a 
                        foster cat lady. 

           Tess looks around, taking in the empty room.

           INT. JENNA’S CAR - MOVING - DAY

           Something’s clearly on Jenna’s mind. She drives, brow 
           furrowed, as her PHONE RINGS. She answers.

                                 JENNA
                        Did I leave something behind?

           INTERCUT TESS/JENNA:

                                 TESS
                        No, no. You didn’t do anything. I 
                        just thought... maybe I could keep 
                        you company on the drive?

           Jenna smiles.

                                 JENNA
                        Yeah, I’d like that.

                                 TESS
                        What do you think about re-naming 
                        the cat Gary Busey?

           Jenna laughs, driving forward as the two friends keep 
           talking. Growing up together, one conversation at a time.

                                                              FADE OUT.

           THE END.
