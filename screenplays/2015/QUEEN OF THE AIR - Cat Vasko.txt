           INT. VALENCIA MUSIC HALL - NIGHT (1931)

           SUPER: Copenhagen, 1931

           A DARK ROOM. A CHARGED HUSH. Hundreds of people bristle with 
           anticipation. We catch glimmers of them in the TALL MIRRORS 
           lining the walls: GLAMOROUS WOMEN in ball gowns, WEALTHY MEN 
           in dark suits, GORGEOUS PROSTITUTES looking for rich marks. 

           And then the moment they’re all waiting for: with the POP of 
           a spotlight, a BEAUTIFUL WOMAN SEATED ON A TRAPEZE is 
           revealed, her mint-green dress bright against the GILDED 
           CEILING eighty feet above. WILD APPLAUSE SHAKES THE ROOM.

           Red lips. Golden hair. Ivory skin. LEITZEL PELIKAN may be 40, 
           but you’d hardly know it to look at her. She GRINS and every 
           heart in the room throbs at once. The APPLAUSE GROWS LOUDER.

           Suddenly she DROPS until she’s hanging from her trapeze by 
           her knees, then glides sensually back up the ropes in what 
           amounts to midair burlesque. Her legs curl arabesques before 
           she pulls herself upside-down, pausing for more APPLAUSE.

           She drops again to hang by her knees, then pumps herself back 
           and forth until she’s FLYING THROUGH THE AIR AT INCREDIBLE 
           SPEED. Momentum established, she spins her arched body around 
           the bar until she’s hanging on by JUST THE SMALL OF HER BACK. 

           And then, gripping the trapeze bar with her toes, she SWOOPS 
           DOWNWARD until she’s hanging on by the TOPS OF HER FEET. 

           The audience is stunned into silence. It’s like watching 
           witchcraft. The only sound is the creaking of the ropes. 
           Leitzel squeezes her eyes shut, blissful, lost in the thrill.

           As the momentum lessens, she pulls herself back up to the bar 
           and pushes her body upside-down into an aerial handstand. And 
           then something unexpected happens: she LETS GO.

           The crowd GASPS IN HORROR ...

           ... until she hooks the trapeze bar with her right foot, 
           catching herself, and mimes an upside-down curtsy to 
           THUNDEROUS APPLAUSE. She gazes into the crowd and drops a 
           quick wink, seemingly at one of the innumerable faces there. 

                                 EMCEE (O.S.)
                        Ladies and gentlemen, Lillian 
                        Leitzel, the Queen of the Air!

                                                                CUT TO:
           INT. SMALL BEDROOM - EARLY MORNING

           SUPER: Chicago, 1909

           Leitzel Pelikan’s eyes flutter open. She sits up quickly, 
           already exhilarated, like a kid on Christmas morning. She’s 
           just 19 years old, and tonight’s a big night for her, as the 
           handbill tacked next to her bed informs us:

           INSERT - HANDBILL

           Over an image of a BEAUTIFUL WOMAN dangling from a trapeze 
           bar by ONLY HER TEETH, the words: “The 1909 Barnum and Bailey 
           Circus, featuring the world-renowned aerialist La Belle 
           Nellie and her sisters in their American debut!”

           INT. SITTING ROOM - SAME

           Just outside her door, TONI and TINA PELIKAN, late 20s, solid 
           and muscular, pour tea for their sister, NELLIE, 31. La Belle 
           Nellie, true to her name, is as gorgeous as they are plain. 

           Nellie accepts the tea cup and hands it deferentially to 
           PROFESSOR LEAMY, their act’s trainer and manager. In his mid-
           60s, he has the worldly, distinguished air of a diplomat.

           We have just enough time to notice that the three women are 
           all attired in MATCHING, FORMAL DRESSES AND HATS before 
           Leitzel comes bursting in wearing a white practice leotard 
           and nothing else. Nellie’s face immediately reddens.

                                 NELLIE
                        What on earth are you wearing?

           Leitzel’s eyes roll at the start of a familiar argument.

                                 LEITZEL
                        My work clothes. Why do I have to 
                        spend an hour strapping myself into 
                        corsets and garters--

                                 LEAMY
                        Because society sets strict 
                        standards for ladylike comportment.

                                 LEITZEL
                        I’m an acrobat, not a ... princess, 
                        or something. 

                                 NELLIE 
                        That’s enough. I want you out here 
                        in ten minutes wearing the dress 
                        Mister Leamy bought you. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 NELLIE  (CONT'D)
                             (warning)
                        With stockings.

           Leitzel SLAMS her bedroom door. Nellie sighs. Disapproving:

                                 LEAMY
                        That girl’s willfulness is going to 
                        be the death of her. 

           INT. BEDROOM - SAME

           Holding her dress, irritated, Leitzel wanders to the window. 
           Breaks into a GRIN as she sees on the sidewalk below ...

           EXT. CHICAGO STREET - CONTINUOUS

           A CRYER thronged with EXCITED CHILDREN is passing by:

                                 CRYER
                        Just a few seats left for tonight’s 
                        world premiere of the 1909 Barnum 
                        and Bailey circus! Better get ‘em 
                        now, folks, they’re going fast ...

           INT. FANCY HOTEL LOBBY 

           The Cryer passes by outside as a SNOOTY OLDER WOMAN 
           desperately addresses a helpless CONCIERGE:

                                 SNOOTY OLDER WOMAN
                        How can every private box be sold 
                        out? I can’t be seen in the stands 
                        at the social event of the season! 

           EXT. CHICAGO COLISEUM 

           A JOSTLING CROWD of working-class patrons. The Cryer, now 
           accompanied by a CROWD OF CHILDREN, is drowned out by the 
           sounds of SCALPERS bargaining with BUYERS:

                                 SCALPER
                        I got three in the sixth row for 
                        three. Three in the sixth row for 
                        four. Yessir, the gentleman in the 
                        back, you’re offering five? 

           The Cryer continues up the steps toward the IMPOSING STONE 
           EDIFICE of one of the country’s BIGGEST VENUES. 
           INT. CHICAGO COLISEUM - DAY

           A LION ROARS as its HANDLER wheels its cage across the floor. 
           FEATHERS WAVE AND UNDULATE as SHOWGIRLS in headdresses 
           rehearse a dance. BOWLING PINS FLY, ONE FALLS as bare-faced 
           CLOWNS on unicycles juggle away. And in the midst of all the 
           chaos, WORKERS scurry everywhere like ants, readying the 
           arena for the opening night of the new circus season.

           Welcome to what was, for centuries, the most DAZZLING, 
           CELEBRATED AND BELOVED form of entertainment in the world.

           The CLICK OF CASTANETS draws our eyes upward to where 
           VICTORIA CODONA, 21, a beautiful violet-eyed girl in a 
           flamenco dress, DANCES ACROSS A WIRE. GRETCHEN, 20, a 
           showgirl darting across to join the troupe, glances up.

                                 GRETCHEN
                        Show-off!

           Victoria pauses to stick out her tongue playfully. 

                                 GRETCHEN(CONT’D)
                        Are your brothers here yet?

           Victoria points up before resuming her dance. We look higher, 
           just in time to see a TIGHTLY CURLED male body BULLET THROUGH 
           THE AIR, turning a somersault before another FIGURE swings 
           across on a trapeze and catches him with both hands. 

           As they swing back and forth, slowing down, we get a good 
           look at them: LALO CODONA, 14, boyishly cute, is the catcher. 
           And then there’s the bullet: his brother, ALFREDO, 17. He’s 
           almost dangerously handsome: muscular, with chiseled features 
           and the same startling eyes as his sister. He has the crooked 
           grin of a guy who relishes getting into trouble. 

                                 LALO
                             (looking down)
                        There sure are a lot of pretty 
                        girls here.

                                 ALFREDO
                        How about a little focus, huh?

           But Alfredo’s face is pointed even higher above, where a TINY 
           FIGURE IN WHITE hoists herself aloft on the roman rings. 

                                 LALO
                        You talked to her yet?

                                 ALFREDO
                        I can’t get near her. Her mother 
                        watches her like a hawk. 
           This is Leitzel rehearsing. She begins to spin her body 
           around the invisible axle formed by the rings. As she builds 
           momentum, the layers of fellow performers below turn hazy. 

           And then it happens. Her left hand SLIPS OFF THE RING. Her 
           right hand quickly follows.

           And then she’s FALLING. 

           On the arena floor, Professor Leamy quickly YANKS a guy line 
           in his hand. Leitzel is CAUGHT SHORT mid-fall by a safety 
           harness belted around her waist.

           Leamy happens to have halted her descent just level with 
           Alfredo and Lalo’s starting platform. As she spins slowly, 
           Alfredo catches her eye and WINKS. She quickly turns away.

           Leamy lowers her to the ground. Checking his pocketwatch:

                                 LEAMY
                        That’s the last time.

                                 LEITZEL
                        One more run. I know I can get it.

                                 LEAMY
                        This is no time to be playing with 
                        new tricks. You need at least four 
                        hours’ rest before a show--

                                 LEITZEL
                             (exasperated)
                        Everything’s rules! All the time!

                                 LEAMY
                        I’ve been training acrobats since 
                        before you were born.

                                 LEITZEL
                        But you’ve never been one.

                                 LEAMY
                        I have a better understanding of 
                        what you’re capable of than you do.

           She doesn’t budge. Defiant. Shaking his head, enraged:

                                 LEAMY (CONT’D)
                        When you make a mistake tonight 
                        you’ll have only yourself to blame!

           On the platform above, the boys watch as Leamy walks away, 
           leaving Leitzel alone. Lalo hisses urgently to Alfredo:
                                 LALO
                        Now’s your chance.

           Alfredo hesitates, then nods decisively. Gripping his trapeze 
           bar, he LEAPS EXUBERANTLY off the platform, swings until he’s 
           positioned above a safety net below, and quickly LETS GO. 

           On the floor, a WORKER notices him falling and shouts:

                                 WORKER
                        That net’s not bolted--

           But it’s too late. Leitzel and the other performers fall 
           silent, horrified, as Alfredo hits the net, which CAVES IN 
           IMMEDIATELY, its corners unsecured. He hits the floor in a  
           tight ball. The room HOLDS ITS BREATH.

           And then he ROLLS FORWARD before SPRINGING TO HIS FEET right 
           in front of Leitzel, grinning. Sticking out a hand:

                                 ALFREDO
                        I’m Alfredo. Nice to meetcha. 

                                 LEITZEL
                        How stupid are you?

                                 ALFREDO
                        I’m invincible. You’ll see.

           She rolls her eyes, turns her back on him and starts to walk 
           away, but pauses when he calls after her:

                                 ALFREDO (CONT’D)
                        Chalk. 

           Leitzel turns again. Eyes the handsome stranger suspiciously.

                                 LEITZEL
                        Excuse me?

                                 ALFREDO
                        Sweat. It’s why your feet keep 
                        slipping. Look at yourself.

           Leitzel glances down to see her arms and chest slick with 
           sweat. Irritated at the realization that he’s correct:

                                 LEITZEL
                        The last thing I need right now is 
                        another expert on what I should--
                                 ALFREDO
                        Chalk dust soaks it up. Gives you 
                        some grip. In Mexico we kept a sack 
                        of it tied to the trapeze bar.

           Leitzel’s eyes narrow with the realization:

                                 LEITZEL
                        You’re one of Victoria’s brothers.

                                 ALFREDO
                        Me and Lalo just got in the trapeze 
                        act. You probably already heard, 
                        but I can do a double somersault.

           Leitzel hadn’t heard that. She might be just a little bit 
           impressed. But she’s never going to let it show:

                                 LEITZEL
                        Victoria said to watch out for you. 
                        You have quite the reputation. 

                                 ALFREDO
                        Do I? 
                             (beat)
                        Look around. Plenty of pretty girls 
                        here. But I’m talking to you.

                                 LEITZEL
                        Is that meant to be flattering?

                                 ALFREDO
                        Well ... yeah.

                                 LEITZEL
                        Little hint -- was it Alfredo? 
                        You’re going to have to try harder 
                        if you want to impress me.

           She spins on her heel and struts away. But at the last 
           moment, she turns back to shoot him a mischievous half-smile. 

           EXT. CHICAGO COLISEUM - OPENING NIGHT - AERIAL VIEW

           An ENORMOUS CROWD OF PATRONS funnels through the entrance. 
           The throng reaches into the neighboring streets and 
           sidewalks, a MASSIVE AUDIENCE draining into the arena.

           INT. CHICAGO COLISEUM - ARENA 

           SMOKE DRIFTS UPWARDS from countless cigars and cigarettes. 
           POPCORN VENDORS roam the aisles. 
           Between WAGE WORKERS crowding the nosebleeds to BLUEBLOODS in 
           full opera dress in luxury boxes, the arena is packed. 

           Suddenly the LIGHTS GO DOWN. FULL DARKNESS, until ...

           A SINGLE SPOTLIGHT illuminates a jauntily attired RINGMASTER.

                                 RINGMASTER
                             (relishing the words)
                        Ladies and gentlemen. Children of 
                        all ages. Prepare to be thrilled. 
                        Delighted. Scintillated ... and 
                        excited. 

           NEAR THE CEILING - Alfredo, Lalo and thirteen other 
           TRAPEZISTS in matching leotards crouch on darkened platforms. 
           The Ringmaster’s just a colorful dot far below.

                                 RINGMASTER (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Our flyers are the finest money 
                        buys, and grown-ups, look closely. 
                        They’re easy on the eyes.

           Alfredo LAUGHS as this joke catches him by surprise. Another 
           Trapezist rolls his eyes: he’s an obvious rookie.

           FROM THE AUDIENCE - The Ringmaster’s face is dripping with 
           sweat from the lights.

                                 RINGMASTER (CONT’D)
                        So fellas and fillies, without 
                        further ado, our troupe of 
                        trapezists has a show just for you.

           The ORCHESTRA launches into a CHEERY MARCH as the lights 
           shift upward to illuminate the band of Trapezists. 

           NEAR THE CEILING - BUTCH, 20, waits next to Alfredo. As the 
           first few acrobats FLY AWAY, he claps a hand on his shoulder.

                                 BUTCH
                        You good?

                                 ALFREDO
                        Never better.

           ALFREDO’S POV - The sounds of the band and the crowd are 
           MUTED. All we hear is his RAPID HEARTBEAT, his JAGGED BREATH.

           And then, terrifyingly, we’re FLYING through open air. 

           FROM THE AUDIENCE - The flyers perform a synchronized MIDAIR 
           BALLET. A Trapezist on the right flies across, turning a 
           somersault, before one on the left does the same. 
                                 RINGMASTER 
                        A flying somersault is stunning, 
                        it’s true. But what’s even more 
                        stunning is not one but two!

           NEAR THE CEILING - On a downswing, Alfredo LAUNCHES.

                                 RINGMASTER (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        A mistake can be fatal, so hold 
                        your breath as Alfredo Codona 
                        attempts to cheat death. 

           ALFREDO’S POV - We HURTLE THROUGH THE AIR, spinning out of 
           control: ceiling walls floor ceiling walls floor--

           And then, with a THUNDEROUS CLAP as Alfredo’s hands meet 
           Lalo’s, the sound returns ALL AT ONCE. It’s a dazzled 
           audience on its feet CHEERING.

           INT. LEAMY DRESSING ROOM - SAME

           The sound of CHEERING is faint in this lamp-lit space. 
           Mirrors of various sizes reflect Nellie, Toni and Tina as the 
           latter two fuss over Nellie’s costume, tightening straps, 
           smoothing loose threads. It’s obvious who the star is here, 
           and that’s the way Nellie likes it.

                                 NELLIE
                        Come in!

           Leamy enters, walking with a cane he doesn’t seem to need.

                                 LEAMY
                        Are we all ready? Strong, 
                        sophisticated, beautiful? 

                                 TONI
                        Yes sir.

           He taps at his front teeth. Toni glances in the mirror to see 
           she has lipstick on hers. Licks them clean, blushing.

                                 LEAMY
                        Where’s Leitzel?

           INT. GRETCHEN’S DRESSING ROOM 

           Cushions scattered about seat an array of beautiful, HALF-
           DRESSED YOUNG WOMEN: Gretchen and Victoria; CHARLOTTE, an 
           equestrienne; RUBY, a snake charmer; and, at the center of 
           the group, Leitzel. The girls drink champagne from coupes and 
           share cigarettes.
                                 LEITZEL
                        So? What was it like?

           Ruby holds up her thumb and forefinger to indicate three, 
           then two inches. The girls COLLAPSE IN LAUGHTER.

                                 VICTORIA
                        But he’s so burly!

                                 RUBY
                        Well, you know what the Bible says. 

                                 GRETCHEN
                        The Bible says something about it?

                                 RUBY
                        Sure. The Lord giveth ... and He 
                        taketh away.

                                 LEITZEL
                        Speaking of, how’s Butch?

           Charlotte blushes, holds up her left hand to reveal a slender 
           gold band on her ring finger. The other women SHRIEK. 

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        He says we can go to Iowa. His 
                        family has a plot of land there. 

                                 GRETCHEN
                        And I’ve never been on a date. 

                                 VICTORIA
                        She’s still hung up on Hans.

                                 GRETCHEN
                        Shut up.

                                 RUBY
                        The pole balancing guy?

                                 VICTORIA
                        He doesn’t even know she exists.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        There’s plenty of fish in the sea.

                                 LEITZEL
                        Maybe for you all. Leamy acts like 
                        he’s done us some grand favor by 
                        hiring us rooms but it’s just so he 
                        can control everything we do. 
                                 GRETCHEN
                        Must be tough, not having to sleep 
                        in a Pullman car with sixty other 
                        girls gossiping and crying all 
                        night. My condolences.

           KNOCKING sounds at the door. From outside:

                                 NELLIE (O.S.)
                        Leopoldina Alitza Pelikan, get out 
                        here this minute.

                                 LEITZEL
                             (rolling eyes)
                        Yes, your majesty.

           The other girls GIGGLE at the impertinence.

           INT. HALL OUTSIDE

           Nellie leans in closer to the wooden door, sniffing.

                                 NELLIE
                        If that’s cigarette smoke I smell 
                        you’re going to be sorry!

           The door swings outward. Leitzel is squared in the doorway.

                                 LEITZEL
                        Hello, sister. 

           For some reason this last word sounds accusatory. 

                                 LEITZEL (CONT’D)
                        How can I help you?

                                 NELLIE
                             (looking into the room)
                        Are you girls drinking? 

                                 RUBY
                        No, Miss Nellie. This is a health 
                        tonic prescribed by a physician.

           The girls COLLAPSE IN GIGGLES again.

           INT. BACKSTAGE HALLWAY

           Nellie marches Leitzel down the hall by her arm.
                                 NELLIE
                        I expressly forbade you to 
                        associate with those girls. 

                                 LEITZEL
                        They’re fun.

                                 NELLIE
                        They’re vulgar and uneducated. I 
                        don’t want you picking up on their 
                        loose behavior. 

                                 LEITZEL
                        I can decide who I want to spend 
                        time with. I’m not some naive 
                        little girl who’s going to get 
                        herself knocked up because she 
                        doesn’t know any better.

           Nellie tightens her grip on Leitzel’s arm. 

                                 LEITZEL (CONT’D)
                        You’re hurting me!

                                 NELLIE
                        Get dressed. Now.

           INT. ARENA

           Eager MURMURS OF ANTICIPATION are cut short by the 
           Ringmaster’s booming voice:

                                 RINGMASTER
                        For the first time ever on this 
                        side of the Atlantic, a show 
                        guaranteed to drive the gentlemen 
                        frantic. Swaying, playing and 
                        sashaying through the air, it’s 
                        Professor Leamy’s Ladies of the 
                        Trapezone Rotaire!

           The spotlight CUTS OUT, immersing the hall in total darkness. 

           Then, near the roof of the hall, a CREAKING is faintly 
           audible as the glimmering trapezone rotaire is lowered. Toni 
           is silhouetted in the center, seated on a bicycle. As she 
           begins to pedal, the arms of the trapezone ROTATE. Tiny 
           lights embedded in its beams glitter like starlight.

           As the orchestra strikes up a WALTZ, the LIGHTS COME UP to 
           reveal Tina, Leitzel and Nellie hanging from the three 
           trapeze bars, which ROTATE FASTER AND FASTER as Toni pedals.
           While Toni pumps at the bike, Nellie, Leitzel and Tina begin 
           to swing from their respective trapezes - Tina turns flips 
           using her powerful arms, Leitzel hangs by her knees, and 
           Nellie flies back and forth by just the tops of her feet. 

           At first the audience OOHS and AAHS. But after a minute the 
           originality of the act starts to wear thin: is this it? 

           The waltz WINDS DOWN. The trapezone slows. Standing on their 
           trapezes, the women curtsy and bow, but no one applauds.

           The four Leamy Ladies exchange panicked expressions. 

           FROM THE AUDIENCE - One by one, the lights trained on the 
           women go dark, plunging them into obscurity. It’s over.

           NEAR THE CEILING - Leitzel slumps down on her trapeze bar, 
           discouraged. Suddenly she notices a small burlap sack tied to 
           one end. She nudges it open and sees it’s full of chalk dust. 

           She glances toward the backstage area. Alfredo’s bright grin 
           glows in the dimness. Her cheeks redden as her look of 
           concentration is briefly replaced with a smile. She quickly 
           powders her hands dry, then gives a loud HORSE WHISTLE.

           A set of ROMAN RINGS begin to lower. A SPOTLIGHT is quickly 
           trained on them as Leitzel leaps to them effortlessly. 

           BACKSTAGE - Alfredo watches as Leitzel swings her body 
           around, just like earlier, but with so much more power now. 
           There’s something STUNNING about seeing this tiny creature 
           display such incredible strength. As the audience begins to 
           CHEER WILDLY, Alfredo breaks into a smile.

           FROM THE AUDIENCE - On a whim, Leitzel reaches her left hand 
           around the back of her head to unpin her hair. It flies loose 
           and begins to whip around with her. The crowd LOVES IT. 

           LEITZEL’S POV - Leitzel breathes more rapidly as she picks up 
           speed. She opens her eyes and sees the world SPINNING PAST: 
           the Ringmaster, the audience, the ceiling, IMPOSSIBLY FAST.

           FROM THE AUDIENCE - She continues to pump her body around and 
           around while being lowered to the ground. As her bare feet 
           kiss the floor, THUNDEROUS APPLAUSE RATTLES THE BOARDS. 

           INT. LEAMY’S CARRIAGE - LATER

           Leamy explains to the four identically dressed women:
                                 LEAMY
                        Although he promised me otherwise, 
                        no matter which way we try it, 
                        Mister Barnum’s “big top” just 
                        isn’t sturdy enough to sustain the 
                        weight of the trapezone rotaire.

                                 TONI
                        What’s that mean?

                                 NELLIE
                        When the circus goes on the road in 
                        a month, we won’t be with it. We’ll 
                        go back to Europe ...

           She looks out the window disgustedly as a passing Model T, a 
           brand-new innovation, CHUGS BY LOUDLY, spewing exhaust.

                                 NELLIE (CONT’D)
                        ... thank God.

           EXT. CHICAGO STREET

           The carriage clatters to a stop in front of a pool hall. 

           INT. CARRIAGE

           Leamy smiles at the women.

                                 LEAMY
                        I’ll just run in for my cigarettes.

           He slides out. Nellie turns her attention to Leitzel.

                                 NELLIE
                        Well. That was new. 

                                 LEITZEL
                        I had to do something. 

                                 NELLIE
                        I know. 
                             (ominous beat, then)
                        I’m very ... proud of you. 

           Leitzel’s rapturous expression lets us know how rarely she 
           hears these words -- and how much she longs to.

           INT. POOL HALL

           While Leamy waits at the bar, Lalo approaches him.
                                 LALO
                        Excuse me, Mister Leamy? I’m Lalo 
                        Codona. I’m a catcher? In the 
                        trapeze troupe?

                                 LEAMY
                        Pleasure to meet you, Lalo.

                                 LALO
                        I was wondering, being as you’re an 
                        expert trainer and all, if you 
                        might help me with something.

           INT. CARRIAGE

           The women startle at the sound of RAPPING on the glass. It’s 
           Alfredo. With excessive formality:

                                 ALFREDO
                        Begging your pardon for disturbing 
                        you ladies, but I was wondering if 
                        I might have a word in private with 
                        Miss Leitzel.

                                 NELLIE
                        Absolutely not--

           But Leitzel is already sliding out of the carriage.

           EXT. CARRIAGE

           She grins giddily at Alfredo. He grins back. Finally:

                                 LEITZEL
                        Okay. I’m impressed. 

                                 ALFREDO
                        What are you doing tonight?

                                 LEITZEL
                        Being marched home at gunpoint. 
                        Sitting captive in my high tower. 
                        Sighing tragically. And yourself?

                                 ALFREDO
                        I’m rescuing you. 
           INT. POOL HALL

           As Leamy talks, Lalo looks over his shoulder and through the 
           window to the street outside, where Alfredo is whispering 
           something to Leitzel. She LAUGHS.

                                 LEAMY
                        And that’s why I’ve always 
                        maintained that lighter weights 
                        actually do more to build strength.

           Lalo watches as Leitzel climbs back into the carriage. 
           Alfredo turns and gives him a thumbs-up.

                                 LEAMY (CONT’D)
                        In fact, there’s a curious theory 
                        evinced by a Mister A.F. Hodgkiss--

                                 LALO
                        Wow. That’s great. Thanks a lot, 
                        Professor Leamy. Let’s talk more 
                        about that some other time.

           Lalo darts away as quickly as he appeared. Leamy is briefly 
           puzzled, until a BARTENDER arrives bearing his cigarettes:

                                 BARTENDER 
                        Your Ogdens, sir.

           EXT. ROOMING HOUSE - NIGHT

           Leitzel clambers down the fire escape. Alfredo is waiting on 
           the street below, holding a single flower and smiling.

           EXT. CHICAGO STREETS - NIGHT

           Alfredo and Leitzel walk the sidewalks of a brightly lit 
           shopping district together. 

                                 ALFREDO
                        You’d hate Mexico. Hate it.

                                 LEITZEL
                        How do you know?

                                 ALFREDO
                        It’s not refined.

                                 LEITZEL
                        I’m hardly refined.
                             (off his skeptical face)
                                 (MORE)
                                 LEITZEL (CONT'D)
                        Once Nellie got famous everything 
                        changed. Suddenly I had to speak 
                        French, learn the piano, dress up 
                        everyday, be a “lady.” But that’s 
                        her idea of success. Not mine.

                                 ALFREDO
                        It must have been hard.

                                 LEITZEL
                        It was.

                                 ALFREDO
                        Your piano was probably too shiny. 
                        Your fancy dresses were too itchy. 

                                 LEITZEL
                        You don’t believe me. 

           He shrugs: can’t help it.

                                 LEITZEL (CONT’D)
                        One winter in Silesia we were so 
                        hard-up I had to steal from the 
                        butcher shop to keep us fed.

           Alfredo glances around, then nods at the illuminated window 
           of a butcher shop down the street.

                                 ALFREDO
                        Prove it. 

           Leitzel hesitates for a moment before, seeing his skepticism 
           start to grow, she marches ahead determinedly. 

           INT. BUTCHER SHOP 

           A bell affixed to the door JINGLES as Alfredo and Leitzel 
           enter. The BUTCHER looks up from wiping down the counter:

                                 BUTCHER
                        Help you two?

                                 LEITZEL
                        My husband and I will take two 
                        pounds of szalonna.

                                 ALFREDO
                        Yes. This is my wife.

                                 BUTCHER
                             (sarcastic)
                        Thanks for letting me know.
           The Butcher busies himself wrapping the meat in white paper. 
           Alfredo eyes Leitzel skeptically before whispering:

                                 ALFREDO
                        You’ve got nothing.

           The Butcher goes to ring up the sale, punching keys on the 
           register until it pops open. Leitzel reaches into her purse 
           as Alfredo eyes her curiously. Then, suddenly:

                                 LEITZEL
                        Actually, make that one pound.

           Grunting, the Butcher turns around. As he unwraps the meat 
           again, she boosts herself onto the counter. Holding herself 
           aloft with one arm, she uses the other to reach over to the 
           other side and into the register. 

           Alfredo’s eyes widen, alarmed, but Leitzel is smooth, casual, 
           as she pulls back her clenched fist, sets herself down gently 
           and slips whatever she got into her purse. As the Butcher 
           turns back toward her:

                                 BUTCHER
                        That’ll be twenty cents.

           Leitzel hands him a quarter.

                                 LEITZEL
                        Keep the change.

           EXT. SIDEWALK OUTSIDE

           Leitzel and Alfredo half-run, half-walk away from the lighted 
           storefront, LAUGHING.

                                 LEITZEL
                        Drinks are on me. 

           INT. RAGTIME CLUB

           The HISS of a snare drum ushers us into this dim basement 
           where men and women dance to a slow, romantic piano tune. 

           Pushing through couples, we find Alfredo and Leitzel in the 
           center of the floor, SWAYING INEPTLY. 

                                 LEITZEL
                        Ruby says the girls all take 
                        pictures of you into bed with them.
                                 ALFREDO
                        I don’t know anything about that.

                                 LEITZEL
                        She says you can have your pick.

                                 ALFREDO
                        And you wanna know why you.

           The band ends the slow tune and strikes up a RAPID RAGTIME, 
           to CHEERS from the other patrons. The COUPLES all around 
           Alfredo and Leitzel begin to TWO-STEP RAPIDLY AND EXPERTLY.

                                 LEITZEL
                        I don’t know this dance.

                                 ALFREDO
                        Me neither. 

           She takes a moment to watch the feet of the other dancers 
           before beginning to imitate them. She takes his hands and 
           walks him through the steps. After an awkward measure or two, 
           they’re indistinguishable from the others. 

           Alfredo SPINS Leitzel, then DIPS her dramatically to WHISTLES 
           from the men. As he pulls her in close, she murmurs: 

                                 LEITZEL
                        I think I know why. Because nobody 
                        can have me.

                                 ALFREDO
                        No. Because there’s nobody else 
                        like you.

           EXT. ROOMING HOUSE - EARLY MORNING

           The sky is just lightening as Alfredo and Leitzel arrive in 
           front of the rooming house. Both are shy, unsure what to do. 

                                 ALFREDO
                        Well. Good night. 

                                 LEITZEL
                        Good night. 

           Is she a little disappointed? Hard to tell. She gives him a 
           quick smile over her shoulder before leaping to the first 
           rung of the fire escape, then pulling onto it using just her 
           arm strength. A move only an acrobat could do.
           INT. LEITZEL’S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

           Leitzel is brushing her hair when she is surprised by a 
           TAPPING at the window. Turns around and sees Alfredo framed 
           there, grinning. 

                                 ALFREDO
                        Forgot something.

           Leitzel goes to the window, pushes it open.

                                 LEITZEL
                        What did you--

           He interrupts her by kissing her. Just a quick kiss, but she 
           melts into it excitedly. Pulling away, bright red:

                                 ALFREDO
                        Okay. Good night. 

           He darts back down the fire escape. Leitzel grins as she 
           watches him go. Practically swooning. 

           INT. CHICAGO COLISEUM - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT

           Leitzel watches, fascinated, as the trapeze troupe performs 
           its ballet. Covers her eyes, then peers out from between her 
           fingers when it’s time for Alfredo’s double somersault. For 
           one long moment she doesn’t blink or breathe.

           But it goes off without a hitch. Hanging from Lalo’s hands, 
           his expression cocky and triumphant, Alfredo is irresistible.

           EXT. STAGE DOOR - LATER

           As the door opens, a HUNDRED VOICES CRY OUT AT ONCE:

                                 CROWD
                        Leitzel!/Just a look, 
                        Leitzel!/Leitzel, marry me!

           Leamy, Nellie, Toni and Tina emerge, followed finally by 
           Leitzel, who struts with her head held high. A little girl 
           thrusts her hand out toward them.

                                 LITTLE GIRL
                        Miss Leitzel, will you sign your 
                        picture?

           Leitzel pauses. Sure enough, the Girl is holding out a 
           crumpled handbill featuring her image. Leitzel smiles and 
           takes it, signing it “to my biggest little fan.”
           INT. PALMER HOUSE DINING ROOM - LATE NIGHT

           Alfredo and Leitzel sit among the restaurant’s wealthy 
           patrons, attracting their share of looks as Alfredo TALKS AND 
           LAUGHS loudly. Self-conscious:

                                 LEITZEL
                        Shhhh. People are staring at us.

                                 ALFREDO
                             (loudly, to the room)
                        Get used to seeing this face. I’m 
                        gonna be the biggest star the 
                        world’s ever seen.

                                 LEITZEL
                        Only one person can be the biggest 
                        star. But you’ll make a very 
                        handsome runner-up. 

           He eyes her. Obviously turned on by the challenge. 

           INT. CHICAGO COLISEUM - LATER

           A silent, dimly lit arena. The steel of the trapeze rigging 
           glimmers faintly. Suddenly Alfredo comes FLYING OUT OF THE 
           DARKNESS on his trapeze, WHOOPING as he pumps his body around 
           the bar. Leitzel follows from the other direction, LAUGHING 
           as she flies through the air, holding the bar by her knees.

           On her downswing Leitzel DIVES INTO THE NET. Lands in the 
           center and rolls over onto her back, smiling up at him. 

           Alfredo’s momentum slows. He hangs from his trapeze by his 
           arms, breathing heavily, taking in the tableau of this 
           beautiful girl in the center of the net.

                                 LEITZEL
                        Are you coming?

           He plummets into the net, which rolls him inward until he 
           lands face-down on top of Leitzel. Not exactly on purpose ... 
           but also not an accident. He pushes himself up onto his 
           elbows. Gently brushes the hair from her face.

                                 ALFREDO
                        Caught you.

           He leans down to kiss her. The innocence of their first night 
           together giving way to something harder to control. Before 
           long he’s unbuttoning her dress. She’s pulling off his shirt. 
           She makes a SMALL SOUND that ECHOES through the arena. After 
           that, the only sound is the creaking of the net.
           EXT. STREET - PRE-DAWN

           Alfredo walks Leitzel home, holding her hand. Spontaneously 
           raises it to his face to kiss it. Both are thrumming with 
           excitement about what’s just happened between them.

                                 ALFREDO
                        Will your sister be mad if she 
                        catches you coming in so late?

                                 LEITZEL
                        Can I tell you a secret? 

                                 ALFREDO
                        Always.

                                 LEITZEL
                        Nellie’s not my sister. She’s my 
                        mother.
                             (beat)
                        She doesn’t like people to know. I 
                        think she’s ashamed to be alone. 

           They pass by a wall plastered with ads for the circus: “LAST 
           CHICAGO PERFORMANCE SATURDAY.” Alfredo eyes it. Appears to be 
           mustering his courage to say something. Finally he spits it 
           out, quickly and eagerly:

                                 ALFREDO
                        You don’t have to go back to Europe 
                        with her, you know.

                                 LEITZEL
                        What would I do instead?

                                 ALFREDO
                        Stay here. With me.  

                                 LEITZEL
                        And follow you around the country 
                        stealing from butcher shops?

                                 ALFREDO
                        I had an idea about that. We’ll 
                        form our own act. Us and Lalo. We 
                        can call ourselves the Flying 
                        Codonas.

           A smile blooms on her face as she realizes what this means.

                                 LEITZEL
                        But I’m not a Codona.
                                 ALFREDO
                        Not yet. 

           INT. CHICAGO COLISEUM - EVENING

           HANS AND CARL JAHN, brothers in their 20s, perform their act 
           on the floor: Carl balances a forty-foot pole on his 
           shoulders while Hans does tricks standing atop it. 

           BACKSTAGE - In the dimness backstage, Gretchen watches. 
           Blushes as Hans catches her eye and winks at her. 

           INT. BACKSTAGE HALLWAY - SAME

           The ROARING of the crowd is distant as Leitzel and Alfredo 
           carom down the hallway, laughing, half-making-out already. 
           They BURST THROUGH THE DOOR to Gretchen’s dressing room ...

           INT. GRETCHEN’S DRESSING ROOM

           ... and stop short at the sight of Nellie sitting there, a 
           sobbing Charlotte cradled in her arms. 

           Nellie’s eyes flash with surprise. Hissing to Alfredo:

                                 NELLIE
                        You. Out. Now.

           Alfredo bolts back out the door, shutting it behind him. 
           Looking up, red-eyed and apologetic:

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        I’m sorry, Leitzel. I didn’t know 
                        who else I could go to.

                                 NELLIE
                        Your friend here is in trouble. And 
                        the young man responsible is 
                        refusing to marry her.

                                 LEITZEL
                        You were seeing someone other than 
                        Butch?

                                 CHARLOTTE
                             (impatient)
                        She’s talking about Butch. Butch 
                        broke it off with me. 

                                 LEITZEL
                        But ... he said he loved you.
           Ignoring her naive friend and turning to Nellie instead:

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        What am I going to do? I’ll be 
                        fired for moral turpitude. 

                                 NELLIE
                        No you won’t. You just need a 
                        midwife. Everyone uses them.

                                 CHARLOTTE
                        I don’t have the money for that.

                                 NELLIE
                        I’ll take care of it. You’ll be 
                        good as new after, you’ll see.
                             (to Leitzel)
                        I’ll deal with you later.

           INT. LEITZEL’S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT

           Nellie is putting things in the drawers of Leitzel’s steamer 
           trunk as quickly as Leitzel can pull them back out.

                                 LEITZEL
                        This is different. He’s really 
                        going to marry me.

                                 NELLIE
                        Did he tell you that? 

                                 LEITZEL
                        Not exactly, but--

                                 NELLIE
                        I don’t do these things to make you 
                        miserable. I do them because I’m 
                        older than you, and I know better. 

                                 LEITZEL
                        He’s not like you think he is.

                                 NELLIE
                        Men are the same everywhere.

           She grabs her daughter’s hands urgently. 

                                 NELLIE (CONT’D)
                        I know you think he loves you. He 
                        probably thinks he loves you too. 
                        But no one, no one will ever love 
                        you the way your mother does.
           Seeing that Leitzel is starting to come around:

                                 NELLIE (CONT’D)
                        There’s an easy test. All you have 
                        to do is ask yourself one question: 
                        does he want what’s best for you, 
                        or what’s best for himself?

           EXT. CHICAGO COLISEUM - EARLY EVENING

           The banners outside the Coliseum have been plastered over 
           with signs reading “FINAL 1909 PERFORMANCE SOLD OUT.”

           INT. UNDER THE STANDS - LATER

           The CHEERFUL MUSIC of the circus orchestra is a stark 
           contrast to Alfredo’s devastation as he stares at Leitzel, 
           unbelieving. She won’t meet his eye, stares at her feet.

                                 ALFREDO
                        What’s changed? The other night--

                                 LEITZEL
                        We were just talking. Fantasizing. 

                                 ALFREDO
                        I wasn’t.

                                 LEITZEL
                        “The Flying Codonas”? You can’t 
                        have been serious. Why would anyone 
                        ever hire us?

                                 ALFREDO
                        You’re in a hit act--

                                 LEITZEL
                        A hit sister act. 

                                 ALFREDO
                        --and I can do a double somersault.

                                 LEITZEL
                        So can a lot of people. 

                                 ALFREDO
                        Please, Leitzel. I need you.

           Her eyes tear up as she realizes: he’s failing Nellie’s test. 

                                 LEITZEL
                        You need me. 
                                 ALFREDO
                             (not understanding)
                        Yes. I don’t know what I’d do 
                        without you. Don’t you understand? 
                        This is fate.

                                 LEITZEL
                        Do you know what that word means?

                                 ALFREDO
                        It means destiny.

                                 LEITZEL
                        It means already decided.

           INT. ARENA

           The ORCHESTRA launches into Ruby’s snake-charming tune as the 
           young woman enters, wicker basket in her arms.

           INT. UNDER THE BLEACHERS

           At the sound of the music change, Leitzel shakes her head.

                                 LEITZEL
                        I have to go.

                                 ALFREDO
                        So that’s it? This is how we say 
                        goodbye? Under the stands, with the 
                        moldy popcorn?

                                 LEITZEL
                        I guess that’s up to you.

           She gives him one last longing expression, then spins on her 
           heel and runs into the darkness. 

           INT. LEITZEL’S ROOM - LATE NIGHT

           Nellie lies on the bed with Leitzel, holding her tightly as 
           sobs shake her tiny frame. 

                                 NELLIE
                        Shhhh. It’s okay. 

                                 LEITZEL
                        I thought he’d come here, come 
                        looking for me ... we’d go out 
                        dancing one last time ...
                                 (MORE)
                                 LEITZEL (CONT'D)
                             (wiping her eyes)
                        It was stupid, but I thought ...

                                 NELLIE
                        If he really loved you he’d come no 
                        matter what you said. 

           Leitzel looks up at her mother, surprised she understands.

                                 LEITZEL
                        Yes.

           She buries her face in Nellie’s shoulder, sobbing again.

                                 NELLIE
                        I know how much it hurts. Remember 
                        that feeling. Never forget how much 
                        it hurts. 

           INT. ROOMING HOUSE ENTRYWAY - DAWN

           Nellie is bossing around a harried PORTER as he attempts to 
           deal with the women’s massive stacks of luggage:

                                 NELLIE
                        Be sure you put my hatboxes on top. 
                        I don’t want them getting crushed. 

           She looks up and is surprised to see Alfredo standing on the 
           stoop. Bags under his swollen eyes, like he’s been crying.

           EXT. ROOMING HOUSE STOOP

           Nellie steps outside, closing the door behind her. 

                                 NELLIE
                        What are you doing here?

                                 ALFREDO
                        Please. I have to see her. 

                                 NELLIE
                        She doesn’t want to see you. She 
                        told me very specifically that if 
                        you came I should send you away. 

           Alfredo’s face falls. He holds out an envelope with the word 
           Leitzel written on it in block letters.

                                 ALFREDO
                        Will you please give this to her?
                                 NELLIE
                        You have very neat penmanship for 
                        someone with no schooling.

                                 ALFREDO
                        I paid one of the guys a nickel to 
                        write it out for me.  

           A flicker of sadness crosses Nellie’s face. 

                                 NELLIE
                        You know--
                             (carefully)
                        You’re a promising performer.

                                 ALFREDO
                             (surprised)
                        Thank you.

                                 NELLIE
                        All this focusing on romance is 
                        just going to get in your way. 
                             (beat)
                        I’ll see that she gets this. 

           She slides back inside and shuts the door in his face.

           INT. ENTRYWAY

           Nellie eyes the envelope thoughtfully. Opens it, reads the 
           short note inside. Then, decisively, she tucks it into one of 
           the inner pockets of one of her hatboxes and clamps it shut.

           EXT. CHICAGO TRAIN STATION - MORNING

           TRAINS CHUG into and out of the busy hub.

           INT. CHICAGO TRAIN STATION - PLATFORM

           A train FLAMBOYANTLY PAINTED in Barnum’s signature blue and 
           cream idles, attracting no small attention from the CROWD 
           waiting on the platform. Lalo boards, followed by Alfredo.

           INT. PASSENGER TRAIN

           Leitzel sits in a luxurious berth facing Leamy, Nellie, Toni 
           and Tina. The view behind her is of another passenger train 
           ... until it SLIDES AWAY, revealing the Barnum’s train.
           INT. BARNUM’S TRAIN

           Spying something, Alfredo presses his face to a window. 

           INT. PASSENGER TRAIN

           Nellie spots the Barnum’s train just as a PORTER walks by:

                                 PORTER
                        Now departing for New York City.

           As the train begins to move, Leitzel turns toward the window.

                                 NELLIE
                             (quick)
                        Has anyone seen my other glove? It 
                        must have fallen on the floor. 

           INT. BARNUM’S TRAIN

           Alfredo pushes through the other PERFORMERS milling about and 
           stowing their bags. He runs out the door and onto the

           INT. PLATFORM 

           As Leitzel’s train accelerates, Alfredo RUNS ALONGSIDE IT as 
           fast as he can, shouting:

                                 ALFREDO
                        Leitzel! Leitzel!

           INT. PASSENGER TRAIN

           But his shouts are inaudible over the roaring of the train as 
           it picks up speed. The women continue to feel around the 
           floorboards for Nellie’s “missing glove.” Through the window, 
           we can see Alfredo leaping and waving.

           INT. PLATFORM

           Alfredo reaches the end of the platform as the train is 
           SWALLOWED BY DAYLIGHT. Alfredo watches it shrink to a tiny 
           dark point on the horizon. And then it’s gone.

                                                               FADE TO:
           EXT. BLACKPOOL RESORT - SUNSET (1911)

           Countless REVELERS flow from the pubs, hotels and beach clubs 
           of Blackpool, the English seaside resort. A GROWING CROWD 
           gathers as what appears to be the entire town travels up the 
           main road to the towering BLACKPOOL TOWER AND CIRCUS.

           INT. BLACKPOOL CIRCUS - LATER

           A charming British EMCEE in a top hat announces the next act:

                                 EMCEE
                        Ladies and gents, you’ve seen ‘er 
                        ‘ere in Blackpool more times ‘an 
                        you can count. But you ‘aven’t seen 
                        nothin’ till you’ve seen her 
                        protégée too. It’s my pleasure to 
                        announce our 1911 headlinin’ act, 
                        La Belle Nellie and Little Leitzel!

           MOTHER AND DAUGHTER perform side by side. Hard to know where 
           to look as Nellie does STUNTS ON THE TRAPEZE while Leitzel 
           SWINGS HER BODY AROUND ON THE RINGS, impossibly fast.

           INT. BLACKPOOL DRESSING ROOM - AFTER THE SHOW

           Leitzel’s small dressing room adjoins Nellie’s. She’s 
           finishing buttoning her dress as she opens her hatbox, only 
           to discover the hat inside doesn’t match.

                                 LEITZEL
                             (calling out)
                        Mother, I think our hatboxes got 
                        switched--

           As she picks up the hatbox something flutters to the ground. 
           The envelope. Yellowed, deeply creased where it’s been 
           folded. Leitzel picks it up curiously, then opens it hastily 
           when she sees her name. Mouths the words as she reads:

                                 ALFREDO (V.O.)
                        I hate the way we ended things. I 
                        want you to know I’ll wait for you. 
                        As long as it takes. Whenever 
                        you’re ready, I’ll be here, I 
                        promise. Yours always, Alfredo.

           Nellie enters, holding a similar-looking hatbox. 

                                 NELLIE
                        Is this the one--
           She freezes when she sees what Leitzel is holding. Slowly, 
           Leitzel looks up. Eyes blazing with rage.

                                 LEITZEL
                        You lied to me.

                                 NELLIE
                        Let me explain--

                                 LEITZEL
                        You don’t really care about me. You 
                        never did. All you care about is 
                        your act.

                                 NELLIE
                        That isn’t why I did it. 

                                 LEITZEL
                        You needed me. You needed my looks 
                        and my talent. So you lied to me to 
                        make sure I’d never leave you.

                                 NELLIE
                        I was protecting you! You don’t 
                        understand what the world is like--

                                 LEITZEL
                        Protecting me from what? Having a 
                        life of my own?

                                 NELLIE
                        I didn’t want you to wind up like 
                        all those poor girls in Chicago--

                                 LEITZEL
                        No. You want me to wind up like 
                        you. Old and ugly and broken. 

           Now it’s Nellie’s turn to tear up as she realizes:

                                 NELLIE
                        Is that how you see me?

                                 LEITZEL
                        Here’s a question, Mother: where’s 
                        my father? Why isn’t he with you? 
                        Maybe it’s because you’re selfish 
                        and hateful and--

           Nellie interrupts her with a SLAP. As Leitzel reels in shock:

                                 NELLIE
                        You don’t know what you’re talking 
                        about.
                                 LEITZEL
                        Some mother you turned out to be.

           She slams her trunk shut and drags it toward the door.

                                 NELLIE
                        Where are you going?

                                 LEITZEL
                        To America. 

           Nellie stands in her way, blocking the exit.

                                 NELLIE
                        You can’t be serious. 

                                 LEITZEL
                        He said he’d wait for me as long as 
                        it takes. 
                             (beat)
                        You can slow me down, but you can’t 
                        stop me. And you know it. 

           The two women stare each other down. Finally Nellie relents. 
           Hanging her head, she steps to the side. As Leitzel tugs her 
           trunk through the doorway:

                                 NELLIE
                        You can always come back to me. 

                                 LEITZEL
                        As if I’d want to.

           Nellie begins to sob. Devastated. 

                                 NELLIE
                        You’re breaking my heart.

           Leitzel pauses in the doorway. Hesitates. A moment of 
           uncertainty: is she sure she’s right? Then, deciding:

                                 LEITZEL
                        Well, now you know how I felt.

           And just like that, Leitzel is gone. 

           INT. CHICAGO COLISEUM - ARENA - LATE NIGHT

           With the evening’s show over and the crowds long gone, the 
           arena is eerily silent. The only movement is WORKERS walking 
           the rows of seats with dustpans and brooms, sweeping up 
           popcorn and ticket stubs.
                                 LALO 
                        This is a bad idea.

           Lalo is taller, deeper-voiced than before. He and Alfredo 
           stand on opposite platforms, gripping their trapeze bars.

                                 LALO (CONT’D)
                        More people have died trying for 
                        the Triple--

                                 ALFREDO
                        --than any other trick in history. 
                        That’s the point. Imagine the fame 
                        and riches we’ll have when we 
                        master it. We’ll perform 
                        everywhere. New York. California.
                             (beat)
                        Europe.

                                 LALO
                        Is this about her?

                                 ALFREDO
                        This is about you and me, brother. 

           Gripping the bar, Alfredo launches himself through the air. 

                                 LALO
                             (under his breath)
                        Lunatic.

           Lalo tucks his bar under his knees and launches himself 
           toward Alfredo, hanging upside down. The two men swing toward 
           one another. Alfredo LETS GO and HURTLES FORWARD, 
           SOMERSAULTING through the air. One somersault. Two. And then, 
           at the two and a half mark, he begins to PLUMMET. 

           Alfredo SMACKS into the net, HARD. BOUNCES, HITS AGAIN. As 
           Lalo regains his platform he calls down, panicked:

                                 LALO (CONT’D)
                        Alfredo? You okay? Alfredo?

           After a moment Alfredo raises his head. Sighing with relief:

                                 LALO (CONT’D)
                        I thought you were dead.

           Alfredo grins. Exhilarated. Whatever that was, he liked it.

                                 ALFREDO
                        We gotta do that again. 
           EXT. NEW YORK HARBOR - MORNING

           Blinking in the bright light, Leitzel crosses the lower-class 
           gangplank to shore. On the gangplank above her, the elegant 
           wealthy are disembarking, but she’s no longer one of them.

           INT. PENN STATION - AFTERNOON

           Leitzel is next in line as she counts the meager coins in her 
           hand. Finally it’s her turn. Approaching the counter:

                                 LEITZEL
                        How much for a ticket to Chicago?

                                 CASHIER
                        Eighteen bucks.

                                 LEITZEL
                        If I go third class, I meant.

                                 CASHIER
                        That is to go third class.

           Leitzel’s face falls.

           INT. AGENT’S OFFICE

           Leitzel sits in a smoky office across from a brash AGENT 
           chewing the end of a cigar. She sets an album on his desk and 
           opens it to reveal clippings from papers around the world.

                                 LEITZEL
                        I’m looking to make as much money 
                        as I can in as little time as 
                        possible. As you can see here, I 
                        was part of one of the world’s top 
                        aerial troupes--

                                 AGENT
                             (disinterested)
                        You strip?

                                 LEITZEL
                        Excuse me?

                                 AGENT
                        Strip. Take off your clothes. 

                                 LEITZEL
                             (mortified)
                        Of course not. 
           SIMILAR OFFICE

                                 AGENT #2
                        No girls go solo in this business 
                        without taking off their clothes.  

           THIRD OFFICE

                                 AGENT #3
                        I might be able to make room for 
                        you in a vaudeville show.

                                 LEITZEL
                        As a headliner?

                                 AGENT #3
                        Not exactly.

           EXT. CHICAGO COLISEUM - DAY

           A long line of ASPIRING FEMALE TRAPEZISTS has assembled 
           outside the coliseum. The women shiver in the cold. One holds 
           a handbill reading “NEW TRAPEZE ACT SEEKS LADY ACROBAT.”

           INT. CHICAGO COLISEUM - SAME

           Alfredo stands on the floor with Lalo, holding the handbill. 
           Looks up at their latest candidate, a TIMID GIRL. She’s 
           trembling on her platform, clearly afraid to jump in spite of 
           the safety harness around her midsection and the net below.

                                 ALFREDO
                        They all want to be stars. But they 
                        don’t want to do the work. 

                                 LALO
                             (to the Timid Girl)
                        Thanks for coming out. 

           The Timid Girl begins to carefully climb down the ladder.

                                 ALFREDO
                        Maybe we don’t really need a girl.

                                 LALO
                        You’re handsome, but that’s only a 
                        draw for half the population. And 
                        not the half with the money. 

           As if on cue, a STUNNING REDHEAD in her early twenties, 
           CLARA, approaches the ladder. Calling to her:
                                 LALO (CONT’D)
                        Name?

                                 CLARA
                        Clara Curtain. 

           In stark contrast to the Timid Girl, Clara practically FLIES 
           up the ladder to the platform high above.

                                 LALO
                        There’s a safety harness--

                                 CLARA
                        That’s okay.

           With zero hesitation, she grabs the bar and FLIES OFF THE 
           PLATFORM, turning THEATRICAL FLIPS as she goes.

           The mens’ eyes meet. No question: she’s the one.

           EXT. TRAINYARD - DAY

           Leitzel and a gaggle of RAGGED-LOOKING PERFORMERS disembark 
           from a milk train and find themselves standing in a muddy, 
           desolate Schenectady trainyard. 

                                 LEITZEL
                        How long until the next train?

           JEANETTE, 30s, a fellow aerialist, LAUGHS.

                                 JEANETTE
                        This is it, girlie. 

                                 LEITZEL
                        There must be some mistake.

           But the other performers have already set off on foot.

                                 JEANETTE
                        Mind you don’t complain too much or 
                        they’ll leave you here. I’ve seen 
                        it happen before.

           INT. RUN-DOWN THEATER - DAY

           Leitzel does her ministrations on the roman rings for a half-
           full room. Lackluster applause. Not nearly as thrilling when 
           she’s just a few feet from the stage floor.
           INT. CHICAGO COLISEUM - ARENA - DAY

           Alfredo SWOOPS DOWNWARD on his trapeze, then lets go as Lalo 
           FLIES OUT TO MEET HIM. The familiar sight of Alfredo’s 
           gravity-defying somersaults: one, two, two and a half ...

           And then, as always, Alfredo falls away from Lalo’s arms. He 
           DIVES INTO THE NET, SCREAMING LIKE AN ANIMAL IN FRUSTRATION.

           INT. L TRAIN - NIGHT

           The elevated train RATTLES ALONG. Alfredo and Lalo look 
           sullen and defeated.

                                 LALO
                        It’s time to move on, Alfredo.

                                 ALFREDO
                        I don’t care if it takes ten years. 
                        We’re going to get it. 

                                 LALO
                        Ten years is a little too late to 
                        get us into Barnum’s this spring. 
                        We need something else.

                                 ALFREDO
                             (enraged)
                        There is nothing else! Nothing else 
                        will get us where we need to go!

           That’s it. Lalo can’t hold it in any longer. 

                                 LALO
                        Leitzel’s back in America!

           Alfredo turns pale. Like he’s seen a ghost.

                                 ALFREDO
                        That’s ... not possible. 

           Lalo looks instantly remorseful.

                                 LALO
                        I wasn’t going to say anything, but 
                        Victoria sent me this from Maine. 
                        Who knows how long she’s been back.

           He pulls a folded up newspaper ad from his bag. It advertises 
           a lowbrow vaudeville show on an east coast tour. Sure enough, 
           among the long list of performers’ names: Leitzel Pelikan.
                                 LALO (CONT’D)
                        She’s here, and she’s not with you. 
                        She doesn’t want to be with you. 
                             (beat)
                        It’s time to stop focusing on the 
                        past. We have to think about our 
                        future. Ours. The Flying Codonas. 

           A silence as Alfredo absorbs this. Finally he says:

                                 ALFREDO
                        I do have one idea.

           INT. ARENA - DAY

           A skeptical TALENT SCOUT looks up to where Alfredo and Clara 
           share a platform, while Lalo stands on the one opposite. 

                                 TALENT SCOUT
                        I like you, Alfredo, but so far I 
                        haven’t seen anything Mister Barnum 
                        can put on a poster. 

           Alfredo and Clara exchange a look. From above, she pulls down 
           a gunnysack; Alfredo shimmies into it head-first until only 
           his arms are free. His face is completely covered.

                                 TALENT SCOUT (CONT’D)
                        You can’t be serious.

           Wordlessly, Alfredo grips his trapeze, then DIVES. He SWINGS 
           BLINDLY a few times before HURTLING TWO SOMERSAULTS THROUGH 
           THE AIR, only to be caught by Lalo.

           But they’re not done. On an upswing, Lalo HURLS ALFREDO 
           toward a trapeze tossed by Clara with perfect timing. Alfredo 
           turns three MIDAIR PIROUETTES on the way to catching it. With 
           her help, he regains Clara’s platform. She pulls off the sack 
           and the three acrobats turn smugly to the Talent Scout.

                                 CLARA
                        How would that look on your poster?

           Alfredo looks at Clara as if seeing what she is for the first 
           time: a beautiful fellow thrill-seeker. A talented acrobat. 
           Just like Leitzel ... but Clara is right in front of him.
           INT. VAUDEVILLE HOUSE - LOBBY - AFTERNOON

           FEMALE SINGING and AUDIENCE LAUGHTER can be heard through the 
           theater doors as Leitzel, in an ill-fitting jacket and cap, 
           disconsolately CRANKS THE POPCORN MACHINE. Through the 
           windows at the front, she watches RAIN POUR.

           INT. WOMEN’S TENT - NIGHT

           The MANAGER of this ramshackle tour walks up the aisle 
           between the women’s cots handing out envelopes:

                                 MANAGER
                        Diaz. Pelikan.

           Leitzel takes her envelope and counts the cash inside as the 
           Manager walks away. Pulls a roll of bills from her pillowcase 
           and adds the new money to it. Counting the total out loud:

                                 LEITZEL
                        Sixteen, seventeen ...

           She grins triumphantly.

           INT. TRAIN CAR - AFTERNOON

           Leitzel bounces up and down in her seat eagerly. Noticing 
           that the OLDER WOMAN next to her appears irritated:

                                 LEITZEL
                        Sorry. I’m just so wound up. 

                                 OLDER WOMAN
                        I can see that.

                                 LEITZEL
                        I’m in love.

           The Woman rolls her eyes.

           EXT. CHICAGO COLISEUM - PERFORMERS’ EXIT - EARLY EVENING

           Leitzel loiters on the sidewalk. She once came out this exit 
           to uproarious applause; now she’s waiting to sneak inside. 
           Finally, a CLOWN exits, and as he walks away she’s able to 
           slip through the door before it swings shut.
           INT. BACKSTAGE

           The familiar sight of the arena grows in size as Leitzel 
           eagerly approaches. She hears familiar voices:

                                 LALO (O.S.)
                        Estas listo?

                                 ALFREDO (O.S.)
                        Listo!

           Leitzel runs forward eagerly, then halts in her tracks at 
           what she sees: high above, Alfredo has just caught a trapeze 
           swung by Clara. As Leitzel watches in disbelief, he lands on 
           her platform and SWEEPS HER INTO A KISS.

           Turning in shock to a STAGEHAND standing nearby:

                                 LEITZEL
                        Who is that?

                                 STAGEHAND
                        Mister Alfredo’s girl. She’s a 
                        peach, isn’t she?

           Leitzel’s face turns white. Her eyes fill as she realizes the 
           meaning of this news: he didn’t wait for her after all.

           Alfredo pauses: something’s caught his eye. He turns toward 
           where Leitzel’s watching. But before he can see her, she 
           spins on her heel and RUNS BACK INTO THE DARKNESS.

           INT. AGENT’S OFFICE - AFTERNOON

           Leitzel finds herself seated again across from the brash 
           Agent who told her she’d have to strip. Amused:

                                 AGENT
                        That didn’t take long.

           He looks down at the contract in front of him. Reading:

                                 AGENT (CONT’D)
                        So, Leitzel - Pelikan? Really? We 
                        gotta change that - what kinda work 
                        are you interested in?

                                 LEITZEL
                        Whatever kind I can get.

                                                               FADE TO:
           INT. AERIAL GARDENS - MIDNIGHT (1915)

           WOODEN MALLETS POUND THE TABLES of New York’s most exclusive 
           and opulent venue. The stage is curtained and dark; pillars 
           of crystal glimmer in the dimness. As a gilded clock CHIMES 
           MIDNIGHT the pounding intensifies. This DEAFENING RACKET is 
           how the club’s MALE PATRONS show their enthusiasm. 

           An inky velvet curtain WHOOSHES UPWARD to reveal Leitzel with 
           her back to the audience, sitting on a trapeze and WRAPPED 
           TIGHTLY in a cloak. As she casts it off theatrically, 
           revealing the SCARLET CORSET underneath, the POUNDING GROWS.

           Her body arches backward. Slow, sensual, revealing her figure 
           inch by inch. She WINKS just as a FLASHBULB POPS. 

           WOLF WHISTLES, MORE POUNDING as she SLIDES SEDUCTIVELY up and 
           down the trapeze’s ropes. But one member of the audience is 
           silent: this is the hulking, imposing figure of MISTER JOHN 
           RINGLING, 50s. He watches analytically, never smiling. Seated 
           next to him is the infinitely more cheerful FLO ZIEGFIELD.

                                 MISTER JOHN
                        Risqué, of course, but hardly 
                        headliner material, Ziegfield. 

                                 ZIEGFIELD
                        Just wait.

           Leitzel pauses, seated. In a flirty, challenging voice:

                                 LEITZEL
                        Are you ready for the real show?

           MALLETS POUND ENTHUSIASTICALLY.

                                 LEITZEL (CONT’D)
                        Anyone here suffer from heart 
                        problems? Shortness of breath? 
                        Shortness of ...
                             (suggestive)
                        ... stature? 

           LAUGHTER as the POUNDING CONTINUES. One man shouts:

                                 AUDIENCE MEMBER
                        Nothing wrong with my stature, 
                        sweetheart!

           Leitzel pulls a small burlap bag from her cleavage and rubs 
           her hands with chalk dust. Ever so briefly, her smile fails. 
           But then she’s off, leaping to her roman rings. She swings 
           herself around a few times using both arms, then does 
           something unexpected: she lets the left ring go. Insanely, 
           impossibly strong, she THROWS HER ENTIRE BODY UP AND AROUND 
           using ONLY HER RIGHT ARM. The audience GASPS, STUNNED.

           LEITZEL’S POV - As our vision swings from the stage floor to 
           the hot lights to the audience to the rafters, we hear the 
           DULL POP AND CLICK of Leitzel’s shoulder DISLOCATING.

           FROM THE AUDIENCE - By now Leitzel’s spinning body is little 
           more than a blur as the audience starts to count along:

                                 AUDIENCE
                        Nineteen! Twenty!

           LEITZEL’S POV - The POPPING AND CLICKING of Leitzel’s 
           shoulder grows louder. Her breath starts to CATCH, become 
           ragged. We can really feel how much this hurts.

           Dimly, as if from deep, deep underwater, we hear:

                                 AUDIENCE (CONT’D)
                        Thirty-four! Thirty-five! 

           FROM THE AUDIENCE - Leitzel’s revolutions are now so rapid 
           and jerky that they’re almost alarming.

           LEITZEL’S POV - Everything’s a blur. All sounds are muted, 
           underwater. Then, suddenly, a woman’s UNEARTHLY VOICE, low 
           and gravelly, CUTS IN crystal-clear:

                                 UNEARTHLY VOICE (V.O.)
                        Let go. 

           Leitzel’s eyes pop open as she continues to spin. She eyes 
           the crowd looking for the voice’s source, but sees nothing. 

                                 AUDIENCE
                        Ninety-eight. Ninety-nine. A 
                        hundred!

           FROM THE AUDIENCE - Leitzel brings herself to a stop as the 
           audience LEAPS TO ITS FEET.

           Leitzel is GIDDY, ECSTATIC. The voice forgotten. She does one 
           midair curtsy, then another to UPROARIOUS APPLAUSE.

           INT. DRESSING ROOM - EARLY MORNING

           Post-performance, Leitzel stares at herself in the mirror. 
           Winces as she pulls a red glove over her right arm to hide 
           the gruesome, bleeding gash her rigging has torn there.
           A KNOCK at the door is followed by a STAGEHAND peeking in.

                                 STAGEHAND
                        Miss Leitzel? Someone to see you.

           The Stagehand steps aside to permit Mister John to enter. 
           Leitzel recognizes him instantly:

                                 LEITZEL
                        You’re John Ringling.

                                 MISTER JOHN
                        To my employees it’s Mister John.

           Leitzel breaks into an EARSPLITTING GRIN.

                                 LEITZEL
                        Well, Mister John. I’m Lillian 
                        Leitzel. And you’re late.

           EXT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - DAY 

           Down the wall of this most storied of venues, a brightly 
           colored banner unfurls. It advertises THE RINGLING BROTHERS 
           1915 CIRCUS above an enormous image of Leitzel dangling from 
           her roman ring. Underneath it reads, “FEATURING LILLIAN 
           LEITZEL, WORLD’S MOST MARVELOUS LADY GYMNAST.”

           EXT. CIRCUS GROUNDS - DAY

           A STAGEHAND leads Leitzel across the circus’ sprawling camp. 

                                 STAGEHAND
                        Wait’ll you see your bunk. Mister 
                        John got you a good one. All the 
                        girls fight to be near the windows. 

           INT. SIXTY-FOUR CAR - LATER

           Leitzel’s suitcase rests on an upper bunk next to a window. 
           She’s unpacking when she’s startled by a little girl’s voice:

                                 DOLLY
                        Are you really a queen?

           Leitzel turns around to see DOLLY, 4, standing behind her, 
           holding a doll under one arm and wearing a tiara. Playful:

                                 LEITZEL
                        Are you really a princess?
           From outside a woman’s voice calls:

                                 GRETCHEN (O.S.)
                        Dolly? Where’d you run off to?

           As Gretchen, now in her late 30s, steps into the car:

                                 GRETCHEN (CONT’D)
                        I’m so sorry if she was - Leitzel?

                                 LEITZEL
                             (realizing)
                        Oh my God. Gretchen!

           She throws herself into the other woman’s arms.

           INT. HANS AND GRETCHEN’S BERTH - LATER

           Gretchen and her husband Hans sit on the bed, Dolly playing 
           next to them. The walls are decorated with posters featuring 
           the “INCREDIBLE JAHN BROTHERS, HANS AND CARL!”

                                 LEITZEL
                        She always had a crush on you.

                                 HANS
                        She’s the prettiest showgirl I’ve 
                        ever seen. And I’ve seen a few.

                                 GRETCHEN
                        Retired showgirl. 

                                 LEITZEL
                        You quit performing? Why?

                                 GRETCHEN
                        Woman to woman? Having one of these 
                        little devils takes it out of you. 

                                 LEITZEL
                        But you loved dancing. 

                                 GRETCHEN
                             (smiling at Dolly)
                        It’s all worth it. You’ll see.

           Leitzel nods, taking in this new idea. 
           EXT. MIDDLE AMERICA FAIRGROUNDS - EARLY EVENING

           As PATRONS STREAM THROUGH THE GATE toward the big top, CLYDE 
           INGALLS, 40s, the handsome manager of the sideshow, beseeches 
           them in a BOOMING, impossible-to-ignore voice:

                                 INGALLS
                        They’re all real, they’re all 
                        alive, and they’re all anxious to 
                        meet you -- yes, you! Step right in 
                        and witness for yourself the 
                        Amazing Ossified Man, the Lion 
                        Girl, the Giant of the Jungle ...

           INT. BIG TOP - EVENING

           The audience counts along as Leitzel spins:

                                 AUDIENCE
                        One-forty-five! One-forty-six!

           EXT. FAIRGROUNDS - SAME

           Dolly toddles past the bear cages, clutching her doll. 
           Doesn’t notice as one accidentally unlocked door CREAKS OPEN. 

           INT. BIG TOP 

           As Leitzel climbs down her rope, the CROWD ROARS. She BEAMS, 
           THRILLED, performs a curtsy with her forearm bent away from 
           the crowd to hide its increasingly deep gouge.

           EXT. FAIRGROUNDS

           Dolly drops her doll. Bends down to pick it up. When she 
           looks up again she finds herself facing a WALL OF FUR. 

           INT. BIG TOP

           As Leitzel passes into the shadows of the backstage area she 
           faintly hears a CHILD’S SCREAM. 

           EXT. FAIRGROUNDS

           Leitzel runs outside. Her eyes widen when she sees the 
           BAFFLED BEAR calmly holding Dolly in his arms.
                                 LEITZEL
                        Help! Somebody!

           Ingalls comes SPRINTING UP. With calm fearlessness and 
           authority, he approaches the bear and PLUCKS DOLLY FROM ITS 
           PAWS. Turns to hand the little girl to Leitzel, who embraces 
           her protectively before looking up at her savior. Overwhelmed 
           by the attractive figure he cuts. 

                                 LEITZEL (CONT’D)
                        Hello. 

           He grins. This is the last person he ever expected to find 
           gazing up at him, practically batting her eyelashes. 

                                 INGALLS
                        Hello.

           INT. LEITZEL’S TENT - LATER

           Leitzel cradles Dolly on her lap, playing with her hair. As 
           maternal-seeming as if Dolly were her own daughter.

                                 DOLLY
                        Auntie Leitzel, why don’t you have 
                        a husband?

                                 LEITZEL
                        Because. Not everybody needs a 
                        husband.

                                 DOLLY
                        But don’t you get lonely?

                                 LEITZEL
                        Come to think of it ...

           Leitzel sets Dolly down on the bed, then gets down on one 
           knee theatrically and takes Dolly’s hand. Formally:

                                 LEITZEL (CONT’D)
                        Dolly Jahn, will you marry me?

           Dolly collapses into DELIGHTED GIGGLES.

                                 DOLLY
                        When I’m growed up I wanna be just 
                        like you.
           INT. SEEDY BAR - NIGHT

           Alfredo sits at the bar alone, drinking morosely. As he lifts 
           his glass, we see what he’s been using as a coaster.

           INSERT - NEWSPAPER

           A huge picture of Leitzel and Ingalls standing at an altar is 
           accompanied by the headline “TRUE LOVE UNDER THE BIG TOP.”

           INT. BARNUM BIG TOP - LATE NIGHT

           Alone in the dim space, Alfredo leaps from his platform, 
           flies from the trapeze, and turns two somersaults ... before 
           falling into the net. He quickly rolls off. Climbs back up.

           Again and again he HITS THE NET, face screwed up in pain. 
           After the seventh or eighth impact, a voice in the darkness:

                                 CLARA (O.S.)
                        It’s just a trick. 

           She materializes out of the gloom. Alfredo can’t even look at 
           her as she perches next to him on the net. Eying the rope 
           burns crisscrossing his arms and legs:

                                 CLARA (CONT’D)
                        It’s eating away at you, and I 
                        don’t understand for what. But I 
                        wish I did. 

                                 ALFREDO
                        It’s like I’m a drunk. The further 
                        I get from having a glass in my 
                        hand, the worse I feel. Up there, 
                        it’s all full glasses, lined up 
                        just for me. But down here ...

           He looks at her, eyes full of hope that she’ll understand. 
           After a moment, decisively:

                                 CLARA
                        You’re going to get it. 

                                 ALFREDO
                        You really think so?

           She’s clearly troubled by the thought, but she nods as she 
           takes his hand and clasps it in hers. After a silence:

                                 ALFREDO (CONT’D)
                        Will you marry me?
           She looks at him in surprise. Unable to believe her ears. 
           Realizing he means it, she suddenly SHRIEKS IN DELIGHT.

                                                               FADE TO:

           INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - PRIVATE BOX - NIGHT

           Silhouetted heads watch intently as in the arena below, two 
           DAREDEVILS are carefully pedalling bicycles across parallel 
           tightwires. They balance on their shoulders a pole with a 
           THIRD DAREDEVIL STANDING BALANCED on it.

           A rectangle of yellow light appears at the back. Mister John 
           and an extravagantly attired Leitzel are framed inside. He 
           whispers something to her, points, then departs. 

           She approaches the man he pointed to, who’s sitting in the 
           front row. Pretending to be surprised:

                                 LEITZEL
                        You’re Colonel Maxwell Howard, the 
                        paper magnate! 

           The COLONEL, 50s, turns away from the spectacle below. He 
           looks Leitzel up and down, then smiles.

           INT. FRENCH RESTAURANT - EVENING

           Leitzel is seated across from the Colonel. A dessert cart 
           trundles by, pushed by a uniformed WAITER; at the sight of 
           the elaborate pastries, Leitzel’s eyes widen. As she raises 
           her glass, we notice she’s no longer wearing a ring.

                                 COLONEL
                        I’ve been an avid follower of your 
                        career. I even saw you perform in 
                        1909, with your sisters.

                                 LEITZEL
                        I’ve had a lot of lucky breaks.

                                 COLONEL
                        Never say that. No one gets this 
                        far on luck. You’re here because 
                        you’re strong, and you’re smart, 
                        and because nobody can take their 
                        eyes off you.

           Leitzel blushes at this. Changing the subject:

                                 LEITZEL
                        So you run a paper company. 
                                 COLONEL
                        Fastest-expanding in the country. 
                        Just opened an office in the Empire 
                        State Building. Guess my secret.

                                 LEITZEL
                        I don’t have much of a head for 
                        business. 

                                 COLONEL
                        There you go again. How’d you get 
                        where you are without a head for 
                        business?
                             (leaning forward)
                        I’m going to tell you something, 
                        and I want you to carry it with you 
                        wherever you go, and think of it 
                        whenever you need to: a girl like 
                        you can do anything. Anything.
                             (beat)
                        So go ahead. Guess. What do you 
                        think is the secret to my success?

                                 LEITZEL
                        You make the best paper.

                                 COLONEL
                        I make the most expensive paper. 
                        Maybe there will be in heaven, but 
                        in this life there’s no objective 
                        measure of value. You have to tell 
                        people what you’re worth. And then 
                        you have to prove it every day.

           He leans forward.

                                 COLONEL (CONT’D)
                        You’re a headliner, but you’re not 
                        a star. And no one will treat you 
                        like a star until you learn to 
                        treat yourself like one.

           INT. MISTER JOHN’S OFFICE - DAY

           Mister John raises his eyebrows at Leitzel, who is seated 
           across from him. Raising a cup of coffee to his face:

                                 MISTER JOHN
                        I only offer private cars to my top 
                        executives. To give one to you, I’d 
                        have to boot one of them.
                                 LEITZEL
                        I notice you say “executives.” So 
                        there are more than one. 

                                 MISTER JOHN
                        That’s right.

                                 LEITZEL
                        So: they can be replaced. 
                             (gathering her courage)
                        While we’re on the subject, I’d 
                        also like an increase. To five-
                        hundred a week.

           The normally difficult-to-ruffle man CHOKES MID-SIP.

                                 MISTER JOHN
                        I don’t even pay my male headliners 
                        that much. Not by half.

                                 LEITZEL
                        Do you think they’ll be embarrassed 
                        when they realize they’re being out-
                        earned by a girl?

           EXT. LEITZEL’S PRIVATE TENT - NIGHT

           A cluster of PERFORMERS have gathered outside a MASSIVE 
           PRIVATE TENT, which glows from within. Leitzel and the 
           Colonel’s silhouettes can be seen as she GIGGLES LOUDLY.

           INT. LEITZEL’S PRIVATE TENT

           Leitzel’s new home on the road is more sumptuously furnished 
           than most houses. But every gleaming, glittering surface is 
           covered in clothes, books, newspapers.

                                 COLONEL
                        This place is a sty. 

           Leitzel laughs, begins pulling him toward the bed. Resisting:

                                 COLONEL (CONT’D)
                        Let’s go to my hotel.

                                 LEITZEL
                        It’s just a little mess.

                                 COLONEL
                        It’s not that. Well, not just that. 
                        I’m married. And you know how 
                        circus people love to talk. 
                                 LEITZEL
                        Then let them talk.

           He smiles. Pleased. Now that’s the attitude of a true star.

           EXT. BIG TOP - EARLY EVENING

           The sun is setting over the field beyond the Austin, Texas 
           circus grounds as COUNTLESS PEOPLE funnel into the tent. We 
           see every age, every race, every walk of life, before briefly 
           featuring the face of MABEL CLEMINGS, 30. The tall, plain-
           faced woman has a shining black eye.

           EXT. BIG TOP - LATER

           The crowd outside the tent is so thick that POLICEMEN with 
           nightclubs and whistles have been enlisted to hold it back. 
           As Leitzel waves and blows kisses, a LITTLE GIRL thrusts a 
           photo toward her. She takes it, signs it and hands it back. 

           Puzzled, the Girl’s MOTHER reads the inscription out loud:

                                 MOTHER
                        “There’s a little bit of bad in 
                        every good little girl”?

           INT. TRAIN STATION - DAY

           Leitzel holds a squirming Dolly as she waits on the platform 
           with Hans and Gretchen.  

           Suddenly something catches her eye: two of the circus’ 
           STRONGMEN removing a woman from the train. Her head is hung, 
           but when she looks up we see it’s Mabel. 

                                 LEITZEL
                        Who’s that woman?

                                 GRETCHEN
                        Didn’t you hear? They found her 
                        stowed away in the stock car.

           Mabel’s eyes meet Leitzel’s as the men hustle her out the 
           door. Leitzel has just enough time to notice her black eye.

           EXT. TRAIN STATION

           From behind, Mabel is a dejected figure, slowly trudging away 
           from the station. The Strongmen watch in shock as the Queen 
           of the Air chases after her:
                                 LEITZEL
                        Excuse me, miss? Miss?

           INT. LEITZEL’S PULLMAN CAR - LATER

           Mabel trails Leitzel, eyes wide. Though the two women are the 
           same age, they couldn’t look more different: Mabel is plain-
           faced and tall, and wears a modest, dark dress.

                                 LEITZEL
                        You’ll keep my car and tent neat, 
                        see to my costumes and luggage, and 
                        attend to my every need before and 
                        after each show. Do you know how to 
                        make tea? To style hair?

                                 MABEL
                        Yes.

                                 LEITZEL
                        My work is very strenuous. It makes 
                        me high-strung. Tempestuous. Ego is 
                        the curse of the professional 
                        woman, and you’ll have to cater to 
                        mine constantly.

           INT. SEEDY BAR

           Alfredo, Lalo, and Clara are gathered around a small table 
           with a newspaper between them. The head reads “ACROBAT ERNIE 
           LANE KILLED ATTEMPTING ELUSIVE TRICK.” We notice Clara and 
           Alfredo are both wearing wedding rings.

                                 CLARA
                        His neck was broken in four places. 
                        His face was so bruised his own 
                        wife didn’t recognize him.

           Alfredo’s eyes flick to the countless photos of pinup girls 
           tacked behind the bar. Prominent among them is the image of 
           Leitzel at the Aerial Garden. With him wherever he goes. 

                                 ALFREDO
                        The gods took it from Lane for a 
                        reason. Maybe now it’s our turn.

           He jumps up decisively. 

                                 ALFREDO (CONT’D)
                        C’mon, Lalo. Let’s go. 
           He walks out the door. After a moment, with an apologetic 
           glance at Clara, Lalo follows him. 

           INT. SMALL ARENA - LATE NIGHT

           Lalo stands on his platform awaiting Alfredo’s cue.

                                 ALFREDO
                        Listo!

           Alfredo seizes his trapeze bar and launches into the air. He 
           somersaults ONCE, TWICE, TWICE AND A HALF ... and then 
           completes a THIRD. A RESOUNDING CLAP as his hands meet Lalo’s 
           in a perfect catch.

           Alfredo and Lalo plummet into the net together. Both WEEPING 
           WITH JOY. They roll into one another and HUG EXCITEDLY.

                                 LALO
                        We did it. I can’t believe we did 
                        it. We goddamn did it!

                                 ALFREDO
                        We did it!

           INT. LEITZEL’S PULLMAN CAR - AFTERNOON

           Mabel, Leitzel, Hans and Gretchen play cards. Gretchen LAUGHS 
           at something Hans has just done, kisses him.

           Suddenly Leitzel BOLTS UPRIGHT in her seat at something she 
           sees out the window: the side of a barn bearing a two-story, 
           brightly painted advertisement for THE FLYING CODONAS. Lalo, 
           Alfredo ... and the stunningly beautiful Clara.

           Then, as quickly as it appeared, the vision is gone, leaving 
           Leitzel staring at her own reflection in the glass.

                                                               FADE TO:

           EXT. MOVIE THEATER - EVENING (1926)

           Leitzel examines her reflection in the glass of the ticket 
           kiosk as she waits in line with the Colonel. Her right arm is 
           hidden by a long, red, satin glove, but her left arm is bare.

           Approaching the kiosk, the Colonel leans forward:

                                 COLONEL
                        Two for Variety.
                                 LEITZEL
                             (teasing)
                        It’s pronounced Variété. 

           INT. MOVIE THEATER 

           Light flickers over Leitzel and the Colonel’s faces. 
           Onscreen, a jerky silent film plays, accompanied by swaying 
           music from a PIT ORCHESTRA. 

           After a moment we realize it’s a circus film, and that the 
           figure performing the acrobatic stunts is none other than 
           Alfredo. On film, before Leitzel’s very eyes, he executes a 
           PERFECT TRIPLE SOMERSAULT. As the audience GASPS IN AWE:

                                 LEITZEL
                             (marveling)
                        He got it. He really got it.

                                 COLONEL
                        You know him?

                                 LEITZEL
                        We were in Barnum’s together in 
                        Chicago. A hundred years ago.

                                 COLONEL
                        Maybe you’ll meet again soon.

                                 PATRON (O.S.)
                        Shhhh.

                                 LEITZEL
                        Not likely. Barnum’s will never let 
                        him go after this. 

                                 COLONEL
                        Don’t tell me you haven’t heard.

           Leitzel tries to hide her hopefulness with a naive look -- 
           heard what? The Colonel nods, confirming ...

           EXT. OFFICE BUILDING - EARLY EVENING

           As Mister John exits his building he is BESIEGED by REPORTERS 
           and PHOTOGRAPHERS, all calling out:
                                 REPORTERS
                        Mister Ringling, can you tell us 
                        more about the decision to merge 
                        with Barnum’s?/Mister Ringling, one 
                        quick question!/Two minutes for the 
                        Post, Mister Ringling?

           One ASSERTIVE REPORTER’S voice rises above the rest:

                                 ASSERTIVE REPORTER
                        Mister Ringling, any idea what you 
                        plan to call the combined circus?

           Mister John pauses. Cracks a rare smile.

                                 MISTER JOHN
                        The Greatest Show on Earth.

           INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - ARENA (1927)

           An aerial view reveals the insanity of the activity on the 
           arena floor: CLOWNS juggling, DANCERS practicing, ANIMAL 
           TAMERS rolling their caged charges, WORKMEN scurrying about 
           securing cables and riggings. 

           Into this madness arrive Alfredo, Lalo and Clara, still 
           dressed in their traveling gear and pulling their trunks. A 
           smarmy CIRCUS EXECUTIVE leads them across the floor. 

                                 CIRCUS EXECUTIVE
                        Such an honor to meet the world-
                        famous Flying Codonas. Clara - may 
                        I call you that? - look at your 
                        figure! I wish my wife knew your 
                        secret. And Alfredo, master of the 
                        Triple. Quite the distinction. And 
                        Lalo, of course. You’re also here.

           As if choreographed, the sea of people suddenly parts to 
           reveal Leitzel, a vision in her white tulle costume, being 
           lowered from the ceiling while sitting on her trapeze. Her 
           right arm, as always, is covered in a red satin glove.

           Seeing who’s approaching, she freezes momentarily. A look of 
           pure excitement crosses her face at the first sight of 
           Alfredo she’s had in years. But she recovers quickly, pasting 
           on a polite, welcoming smile. 

           The Exec’s voice diminishes to a mere background MURMUR ...

                                 CIRCUS EXECUTIVE (CONT’D)
                        This is the only place for you. 
                        Truly the greatest show on earth. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 CIRCUS EXECUTIVE (CONT’D)
                        We have over fifteen-hundred 
                        performers and workmen, we’ll open 
                        for a crowd of twenty thousand ...

           Leitzel meets their group in the center of the arena.

                                 LEITZEL
                        Well, well. Look at you.

           She and Alfredo gaze at one another. The moment goes on just 
           a second too long. Then, turning abruptly to the rest:

                                 LEITZEL (CONT’D)
                        You must be Clara. Welcome. And 
                        Lalo! You’re so grown up! Well, 
                        don’t be silent, say something.

                                 ALFREDO
                        You look so ... strong.

                                 LEITZEL
                        So do you, Mister Salto Mortale. I 
                        probably saw Variété twenty times. 
                        I couldn’t believe my eyes!

           She seizes Clara’s hand and pulls her ahead of the men. 

                                 LEITZEL (CONT’D)
                        I hope you two won’t be strangers.

           Behind the women, the Exec continues PRATTLING ON to Lalo 
           while Alfredo drifts along beside them like a man in shock. 

                                 CLARA
                        Alfredo didn’t tell me you knew 
                        each other.

                                 LEITZEL
                             (beat)
                        Well, everybody from the old 
                        Chicago crowd remembers one 
                        another, of course. Come along and 
                        I’ll show you your dressing room. 

           INT. LEITZEL’S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON

           Leitzel is pouring tea for the Colonel, Hans and Gretchen 
           when Mabel leads Clara and Alfredo into the room. Clara is 
           clearly awestruck at the opulence of her surroundings. But 
           Alfredo is only focused on Leitzel. 

                                 CLARA
                        This place is like a museum!
           Leitzel laughs. 

                                 LEITZEL
                        I’m so glad you came. Have some 
                        tea, it’s imported. Alfredo, you 
                        remember Hans and Gretchen. 

           The two men embrace warmly; Alfredo kisses Gretchen’s hand, 
           making her laugh. Noticing her wedding ring:

                                 ALFREDO
                        You two are ...

                                 LEITZEL
                        A circus love story with a happy 
                        ending. Imagine that. 
                             (beat)
                        And the gentleman to my left is 
                        Colonel Maxwell Howard. He owns a 
                        paper mill in Ohio.

                                 COLONEL
                        A few paper mills, in fact.

           Clara stands aside shyly. In a small voice she ventures:

                                 CLARA
                        I love your necklace, Lillian.

                                 LEITZEL
                        What, this? Here, take it. 

           She takes off her ornate pearl-and-diamond necklace and 
           casually hands it to the other woman with her red-glove-
           covered arm. As usual, her other arm is bare.

                                 CLARA
                        Oh, I wasn’t--

                                 LEITZEL
                        For a while there I was positively 
                        obsessed with diamonds. Now I 
                        hardly even like the look of them.

           Leitzel glances quickly at Alfredo to see how he’s reacting 
           to this. Clara fingers the expensive jewelry, eyes wide.

                                 COLONEL
                        Lillian’s done well playing the 
                        stock market, with some advice from 
                        a knowledgeable friend.
                                 HANS
                        I don’t understand how this high 
                        can possibly last.

                                 LEITZEL
                        Please. We have the strongest 
                        economy in the world. Alfredo, 
                        you’ve traveled. Tell them.

                                 ALFREDO
                        Uh ...

           Put on the spot, it’s clear Alfredo hasn’t been following 
           this conversation at all. Smoothly moving on:

                                 COLONEL
                        Now that peace has been restored 
                        there’s nothing in our way. It’s a 
                        historical fact that wars are 
                        always followed by periods of 
                        enormous prosperity.

                                 GRETCHEN
                             (pointed)
                        Not for everyone. 

                                 LEITZEL
                        Here, let me help you with that. 

           She reaches over to where Clara has been struggling to put on 
           the necklace and clasps it at the back of her neck for her. 

           INT. ALFREDO AND CLARA’S BERTH - NIGHT

           Clara struggles to unclasp the necklace while Alfredo sits on 
           the bed. As she goes to put the necklace in a drawer:

                                 ALFREDO
                        You don’t want to put that 
                        somewhere more safe?

                                 CLARA
                        I don’t have anywhere safe. I don’t 
                        have anything compared to her.

           Realizing she’s picked up on something, Alfredo deflects:

                                 ALFREDO
                        You get this way whenever there’s 
                        an attractive woman around. Another 
                        attractive woman, I mean.
           She shoots him a resentful look. We get the sense that he’s 
           done more than his part to engender her paranoia.

                                 ALFREDO (CONT’D)
                        Oh, don’t be that way. Come here.

           She perches on the bed next to him.

                                 ALFREDO (CONT’D)
                        You know how much I need you.

           As he speaks, he loosens the back of her dress.

                                 ALFREDO (CONT’D)
                        What would I have in front of me, 
                        if I didn’t have my number-one girl 
                        behind me?

           She smiles uncertainly as he pulls the dress down. As long as 
           he still wants her, everything has to be okay. Right?

           Hans watches as Leitzel trains Dolly, now a gangly pre-teen, 
           on the trapeze above. As the girl executes a flip:

                                 LEITZEL
                        Remember, the strength should come 
                        out of your abdomen, not your arms.
                             (to Hans)
                        She’s getting good.

                                 HANS
                        She has a good teacher.
                             (beat)
                        It’s nice having Alfredo back.

                                 LEITZEL
                        Uh-huh. Well done, Dolly!

                                 HANS
                        Be careful there.

           She won’t meet his eye, stares up at Dolly high above.

                                 LEITZEL
                        Believe me, the last thing I’m 
                        interested in is having my heart 
                        broken again by Alfredo Codona. 
           INT. SPEAKEASY - NIGHT

           Leitzel enters and crosses the smoky space to the bar. She’s 
           the only woman in the room, but the BARTENDER greets her as a 
           regular as she finds a stool between two other patrons:

                                 BARTENDER
                        Miss Leitzel. What’ll it be?

                                 LEITZEL
                        Whiskey. Up. 

           The man next to her turns his head at the sound of her name.

                                 ALFREDO
                        Now there’s the Leitzel I know. 
                        None of this have-some-tea, pinky-
                        in-the-air horseshit.

           Seeing who it is, Leitzel turns bright red.

                                 LEITZEL
                        I’m sorry. I’ll go. 

                                 ALFREDO
                        So proper.

                                 LEITZEL
                        I’m single. You’re unaccompanied. 

           He grins temptingly at her. As irresistible as ever.

                                 ALFREDO
                        Sounds like a recipe for a great 
                        night to me. 

           Leitzel smiles uncomfortably as the Bartender returns with 
           her drink, deposits it in front of her. Seeming to sense 
           there’s something between these two, he quickly departs.

                                 ALFREDO (CONT’D)
                        So. No family, even after all these 
                        years. Don’t you get lonely?

                                 LEITZEL
                        The circus is my family.

                                 ALFREDO
                        Now there’s a sad little story if I 
                        ever heard one. What happened to 
                        your husband?

                                 LEITZEL
                        Which one?
           This catches him by surprise.

                                 ALFREDO
                        The one from the papers. There was 
                        another one?

                                 LEITZEL
                        When I was still doing vaudeville. 
                        For about four seconds. Honestly I 
                        don’t even remember his name.

                                 ALFREDO
                        Yes you do.

           He stares her down. Cocky. Finally she gives in:

                                 LEITZEL
                        Fine. It was Alexis. 

           Grinning triumphantly:

                                 ALFREDO
                        You act like you’ve changed, but I 
                        still see the real you under there.

           He grabs her right arm.

                                 ALFREDO (CONT’D)
                        There’s just one thing I can’t 
                        figure out. What are you hiding 
                        under this glove?

           She yanks her arm back, exasperated.

                                 LEITZEL
                        What do you want from me, Alfredo? 
                        Time’s gone by. We’re both 
                        different people now. 

                                 ALFREDO
                        Then why do I feel like I’m 
                        seventeen all over again? 
                             (raising his glass)
                        Remember being that age?

                                 LEITZEL
                        Everything felt so possible.

                                 ALFREDO
                        That’s what getting older is, I 
                        think. Everything you could have 
                        been falling away, until all you’re 
                        left with is what you are. 
                                 LEITZEL
                        The most famous acrobat in the 
                        world. 

                                 ALFREDO
                        Nah. Just a handsome runner-up.

           LATER

           A cluster of emptied glasses rests at each of their elbows. 
           Behind them, the bar has all but emptied: it’s late. 

                                 LEITZEL
                        So. Tell me about Clara.

                                 ALFREDO
                        Aw, we don’t have to do that, do 
                        we? Ask me anything else.

                                 LEITZEL
                        I want to know.

                                 ALFREDO
                        I’ll tell you one thing. She 
                        wouldn’t be caught dead in a place 
                        like this, drinking this coffin 
                        varnish you keep ordering, not even 
                        wearing stockings.

                                 LEITZEL
                        I always hated stockings.

                                 ALFREDO
                        She’s sweet, and beautiful, and 
                        kind. She takes care of me. 

                                 LEITZEL
                        So you’re just like the rest of 
                        them, then. 

                                 ALFREDO
                        What’s that supposed to mean?

                                 LEITZEL
                        Just looking for someone to rub 
                        your shoulders and darn your socks.

                                 ALFREDO
                        Is that so wrong?

           Leitzel hesitates. Then, instead of responding, she hails the 
           Bartender, presses coins into his hand.
                                 LEITZEL
                        I’ve got his drinks. 

           She slides off her stool and walks away, leaving Alfredo to 
           stare after her.

           INT. BIG TOP - EVENING

           Alfredo BULLETS THROUGH THE AIR, thousands of astonished 
           faces behind him as he turns somersault after somersault. As 
           his hands SLAP into Lalo’s the crowd ROARS APPLAUSE.

           EXT. PERFORMERS’ EXIT - LATER

           Alfredo steps outside only to find the Colonel waiting.

                                 ALFREDO
                        Leitzel doesn’t go on for another 
                        hour. I’d think such a big fan of 
                        hers would know that.

                                 COLONEL
                        I was actually waiting for you. 

           He nods to where his car is idling nearby.

                                 COLONEL (CONT’D)
                        Let’s go for a drive.

           INT. DUESENBERG - MOMENTS LATER

           The Colonel and Alfredo share the backseat while his 
           CHAUFFEUR wordlessly pilots them in no particular direction.

                                 ALFREDO
                        Nice car.

                                 COLONEL
                        The best they make.

                                 ALFREDO
                        You like having things other people 
                        can’t get.

                                 COLONEL
                        It’s one of the privileges of being 
                        a man of my position.
                                 ALFREDO
                        So what do you want with me? Want 
                        to take me around to your club, put 
                        me in the trophy case?

                                 COLONEL
                        You needn’t have so much contempt 
                        for me. You might be surprised to 
                        learn we have a lot in common.

                                 ALFREDO
                        I doubt that.

                                 COLONEL
                        We both started from nothing. Maybe 
                        that’s why we both have an affinity 
                        for risk -- when you start from 
                        nothing you have nothing to fear.

                                 ALFREDO
                        Is this the kind of brilliant 
                        observation that separates the 
                        millionaires from the rest of us?

                                 COLONEL
                             (ignoring this)
                        And of course, we’re both married 
                        men. So a little advice, one 
                        married man to another: have some 
                        respect for the institution. 

           Alfredo studies the Colonel’s face, realizing his meaning.

                                 ALFREDO
                        I suppose your wife thinks you’re 
                        away on business right now. 

                                 COLONEL
                        My wife and I have a beautiful life 
                        with our family. I’ve never done 
                        anything to jeopardize that.

                                 ALFREDO
                        When I married Clara I thought I’d 
                        never see Leitzel again.

                                 COLONEL
                        That’s not a reason to punish 
                        either of them. 

                                 ALFREDO
                        Why don’t you just tell me to stay 
                        away from your woman already so I 
                        can get back to work.
                                 COLONEL
                             (amused)
                        If you think she’s anybody’s woman 
                        but her own, you’re already in over 
                        your head.
                             (to the Chauffeur)
                        My friend will be getting out now.

           The Chauffeur pulls the car over, then gets out and runs 
           around to Alfredo’s side.

                                 ALFREDO
                        We’re miles from the fairgrounds.

           The Chauffeur opens Alfredo’s door for him.

                                 COLONEL
                        Use the walk as an opportunity to 
                        think. I’m sure you’ll see the 
                        wisdom in what I’ve said.

           EXT. LONELY STREET

           The Duesenburg leaves Alfredo in its dust. He watches it 
           round a corner before beginning to walk, then jog, then run.

           EXT. BIG TOP

           Barely breaking a sweat, Alfredo jogs back onto the circus 
           grounds and re-enters the tent.

           INT. BIG TOP 

           Leitzel looks out at the audience. Just a murky blur with the 
           spotlight shining in her eyes. As she grins and winks ...

           FROM THE AUDIENCE - We see that she’s holding herself in a 
           seated position between the roman rings. It’s an incredible 
           feat of arm strength, but she makes it seem casual, natural.

                                 LEITZEL
                        You know, the last time I was in 
                        Milwaukee I got into some trouble.

           The audience begins to TITTER IN ANTICIPATION.

                                 LEITZEL (CONT’D)
                        I’d heard you have a world renowned 
                        gentlemen’s club and couldn’t 
                        resist the temptation. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 LEITZEL (CONT’D)
                        Imagine my disappointment when 
                        there wasn’t a gentleman in the 
                        place. 

           BACKSTAGE - Alfredo watches, laughs along as the audience 
           ROARS LAUGHTER. The Colonel’s warning obviously unheeded. 

           EXT. LEITZEL’S TENT - NIGHT

           The massive tent glows. As Alfredo approaches, the 
           tantalizing sounds of LAUGHTER AND MUSIC increase in volume.

           He’s stopped outside the entrance by a foreboding STRONGMAN.

                                 STRONGMAN
                        Name, please?

                                 ALFREDO
                        Is that a joke? I’m Alfredo Codona. 
                             (beat)
                        The only trapezist in the world who 
                        can do a triple somersault? 

                                 STRONGMAN
                        I’m sorry, sir. You’re not 
                        permitted entrance.

                                 ALFREDO
                        There must be a misunderstanding. 

                                 STRONGMAN
                        I’m sorry. Mister John’s orders.

                                 ALFREDO
                             (shouting)
                        Leitzel! Leitzel, can you hear me?

           He attempts to rush past the Strongman, who calmly grabs him 
           and pulls him away from the tent. By this time his shouting 
           has attracted several curious PERFORMERS, including Clara. 

                                 ALFREDO (CONT’D)
                        Leitzel!

           INT. MISTER JOHN’S TENT - LATER STILL

           Mister John pours a drink for Alfredo, then one for himself.

                                 ALFREDO
                        You can’t control my personal life.
                                 MISTER JOHN
                        Your contract includes a very 
                        strict morality clause.

                                 ALFREDO
                        I’m not even doing anything.

                                 MISTER JOHN
                        That isn’t what I hear. I won’t 
                        have extramarital ... carrying-on 
                        disrupting my circus. I’m only 
                        going to warn you once: stay away 
                        from Lillian Leitzel.

                                 ALFREDO
                        Or what? 

                                 MISTER JOHN
                        Or there will be consequences.

           INT. CIRCUS TENT - NIGHT

           The crowd is still APPLAUDING from Leitzel’s performance as 
           Mabel meets her in the center ring and wraps her in a cloak.

           Alfredo waits backstage with an eager look. As the women 
           approach, however, two STRONGMEN appear as if from nowhere to 
           flank them. As they pass, Alfredo meets Leitzel’s eye. She 
           gives him a quick apologetic glance before continuing on. 

           EXT. CIRCUS CAMP - NIGHT

           Leitzel’s Pullman car is brightly lit. Her RADIO BLARES as 
           PERFORMERS AND WORKERS crowd inside to listen:

                                 ANNOUNCER (V.)
                        Mister Charles Lindbergh completed 
                        his historic flight across the 
                        Atlantic today ...

           Alfredo approaches, but is stopped short when he sees Mister 
           John sitting just inside the doorway. Seeing him there, the 
           older man slowly shakes his head in warning. 

           EXT. CIRCUS CAMP - MORNING

           By now Alfredo has become accustomed to walking past 
           Leitzel’s tent without a second look. But he stops when he 
           hears the sound of a bell ringing:
                                 LEITZEL (O.S.)
                             (gaily)
                        Calling to order Auntie Leitzel’s 
                        Free School!

           INT. LEITZEL’S TENT - LATER

           A banner reading “AUNTIE LEITZEL’S FREE SCHOOL” is strung 
           from the ceiling. Leitzel stands in front of a gaggle of 
           STUDENTS, Dolly among them. On a small chalkboard, she’s 
           written “GRAVITY,” and underneath, “GIVES THINGS WEIGHT.”

                                 LEITZEL
                        What else does gravity do?

           Dolly raises her hand.

                                 DOLLY
                        Makes things fall.

           Leitzel begins adding this, but pauses mid-word at the sight 
           of a new student seating himself at the back: Alfredo.

                                 LEITZEL
                        What are you doing here?

                                 ALFREDO
                        I want to learn.

           The other Students giggle at this.

                                 LEITZEL
                        You’re not supposed to be here. 
                        Mister John was very clear--

           Realizing the kids are listening intently, she changes tack.

                                 LEITZEL (CONT’D)
                        This is a school for children.

                                 ALFREDO
                        That’s okay. I’m young at heart. 

           As he settles in, sitting Indian-style like the younger kids, 
           Leitzel can’t help but smile. Finally she continues:

                                 LEITZEL
                        Fine. Anything else gravity does?

                                 STUDENT
                        It pulls two things together.
           INT. LEITZEL’S PULLMAN CAR - LATE NIGHT

           A soft RAP at the door between cars awakens Leitzel. She 
           walks curiously to the door and slides it open to find 
           Alfredo standing there holding a stack of books.

                                 ALFREDO
                        No funny business. I swear.
                             (holding one up)
                        Unless what gets you going is 
                        elementary school grammar. 

           Leitzel hesitates, then stands aside so he can come in.

           INT. BIG TOP - NIGHT

           An astonished AUDIENCE counts along as Leitzel flings herself 
           around and around:

                                 AUDIENCE
                        Two-hundred-forty! Two-hundred-
                        forty-one!

           LEITZEL’S POV - The sound of Leitzel’s SHOULDER DISLOCATING 
           is even more GRUESOME and amplified than before. We see the 
           rigging attached to the ring digging into her OPEN WOUND. 
           Suddenly the UNEARTHLY VOICE cuts in, eerie as ever:

                                 UNEARTHLY VOICE (V.O.)
                        Let go. 

                                 AUDIENCE
                        Two-hundred-forty!

           FROM BACKSTAGE - Clara watches, eyes wide. She’s never seen 
           Leitzel do anything like this before, nor has anyone: she’s 
           about to hit her personal record. She begins to slow:

                                 AUDIENCE (CONT’D)
                        Two-fifty! Two-fifty-one!

           LEITZEL’S POV - the Voice matches the rhythm of her heart:

                                 UNEARTHLY VOICE (V.O.)
                        Let go. Let go. Let go. Let go.

           FROM THE AUDIENCE - Leitzel pulls two more rotations:

                                 AUDIENCE
                        Two-fifty-six! Two-fifty-seven!

           Finally, she slows to a stop and hangs by her right arm, 
           barely swinging. Unsmiling. Pale. As if she’s seen a ghost. 
           But if you blinked, you’d have missed it: the next second 
           she’s GRINNING TRIUMPHANTLY, pulling one of her AERIAL 
           CURTSIES while the DAZZLED CROWD CHEERS UPROARIOUSLY. 

           INT. ALFREDO AND CLARA’S BERTH - LATE NIGHT

           Alfredo eases himself out of bed while Clara sleeps. 

           INT. TRAIN CAR 

           Alfredo tiptoes past shuttered, silent berths. Stops short at 
           the sight of Hans leaning out the window smoking a cigarette.

                                 ALFREDO
                        Hans.

                                 HANS
                        Turn around, Alfredo.

           Hans stares out the window at the scenery rushing by.

                                 ALFREDO
                        I know you don’t understand--

                                 HANS
                        Turn around and get back in bed 
                        with your wife. 

           Alfredo hesitates. We realize how much he believes it when he 
           finally responds, agonized:

                                 ALFREDO
                        I can’t.

           Hans locks eyes with him. Then he flicks his cigarette out 
           the window and re-enters his berth without another word.

           INT. LEITZEL’S PULLMAN CAR - LATER

           Moonlit fields stream by out the window as Alfredo and 
           Leitzel sit next to one another on her couch. Alfredo’s 
           reading out loud from the newspaper, with some difficulty:

                                 ALFREDO
                        “A time when a p-- P H onagraph--”

                                 LEITZEL
                        Phonograph.
                                 ALFREDO
                        “When a phonograph owner may enjoy 
                        a mott-eye-on--”

                                 LEITZEL
                        Motion. “May enjoy a motion picture 
                        by putting on his machine a record 
                        combining the principles of the 
                        television and the phonograph.”

                                 ALFREDO
                        Wow. Really?

           With every pause to help, Leitzel’s been leaning in closer 
           and closer. Now she laughs, charmed by Alfredo’s reaction.

                                 ALFREDO (CONT’D)
                        “Hit-- Hitherto, he had regarded 
                        the idea as a sky-- scientific 
                        novelty. But now, a p-- p--”

                                 LEITZEL
                        It’s okay. Just think it through.

                                 ALFREDO
                        You have changed, you know.

                                 LEITZEL
                        I’m sorry you think so.

                                 ALFREDO
                        Not like that. Seeing this world 
                        you’ve created - it’s as if you 
                        built the life we always talked 
                        about, and now I’ve finally found 
                        my way back to it. Where I belong. 

           He leans in to kiss her, but she turns away, trembling.

                                 LEITZEL
                        Don’t.

                                 ALFREDO
                        Why not? Is it because I’m married?

                                 LEITZEL
                        Yes. No.

                                 ALFREDO
                        Because you’re afraid of Mister 
                        John finding out?

                                 LEITZEL
                        God no.
                                 ALFREDO
                        Then what is it?

                                 LEITZEL
                        Because if you try one more time I 
                        won’t be able to say no. 

           He takes her right arm in his hands and begins to pull at her 
           omnipresent red glove. She doesn’t say a word as, inch by 
           inch, he reveals the wound on her arm.

                                 ALFREDO
                        Tell me to stop.

           Finally he’s revealed her whole arm. Examines her weeping 
           gouge before gently turning her face back toward his. He 
           stares in her eyes for a moment before kissing her. Gasping 
           desperately as he pulls away:

                                 LEITZEL
                        Don’t stop.

           MORNING

           Through the windows, the scene has changed to an empty Grant 
           Park. Alfredo and Leitzel are asleep in each other’s arms 
           when VOICES, INCREASINGLY LOUD, awaken them.

                                 MABEL (O.S.)
                        No one’s allowed in Miss Leitzel’s 
                        private car without her--

           But it’s too late. The door SLIDES OPEN, revealing Mister 
           John. Hot on his heels are Mabel ... and a tearful Clara.

           Leitzel and Alfredo grab their clothes as Mister John booms:

                                 MISTER JOHN
                        What in God’s name is happening in 
                        here?

                                 ALFREDO
                        Clara? What did you do?

                                 CLARA
                        I woke up and you weren’t there.

                                 MISTER JOHN
                        This is very serious.

           He strides back through the train. Mabel also departs 
           quickly, leaving the three of them alone.
                                 CLARA
                        I woke up and you weren’t there.

           EXT. GRANT PARK (CHICAGO) - DAY

           The sun beats down brightly as Clara, Alfredo and Leitzel 
           face Mister John. Their fellow PERFORMERS watch furtively 
           from the windows of the train.

                                 MISTER JOHN
                        You have jeopardized the harmony of 
                        this community, tarnished the good 
                        reputation of this circus and 
                        disappointed me personally. 

                                 LEITZEL
                        I’m sorry. I’m so sorry.

                                 MISTER JOHN
                        I can’t allow this degenerate 
                        behavior to compromise my show. 
                        You’ve left me with no choice: 
                        you’re fired.

           There’s a silence as everyone realizes he’s looking not at 
           Leitzel and Alfredo, but at Clara.

                                 MISTER JOHN (CONT’D)
                        Pack up your things. 

                                 ALFREDO
                        Wait. Don’t do this. Fire me.

                                 LEITZEL
                        No. Me. I should be the one to go.

                                 MISTER JOHN
                             (to Clara)
                        We’ll put you on the next train.

                                 ALFREDO
                        You can’t do this to her!

                                 MISTER JOHN
                        I warned you there would be 
                        consequences.

                                 ALFREDO
                        Fine. Then I quit. 

                                 MISTER JOHN
                        You have a contract with this 
                        circus. You’ll be in breach.
           Alfredo looks from Clara to Leitzel, helpless, as Clara turns 
           to the train full of onlookers:

                                 CLARA
                        I’m not embarrassed. I’m glad 
                        you’re watching! I want you to see 
                        what she really is!

           Mister John nods discreetly at two nearby WORKERS, who step 
           forward to take Clara by the arms and pull her into the 
           train. As they drag her inside:

                                 CLARA (CONT’D)
                        I feel sorry for you two! You’ll 
                        never be happy!

           Leitzel looks at the faces of the people watching from the 
           train. Sees Dolly among them. Lowers her head, ashamed. 

           INT. SPEAKEASY - NIGHT

           We advance quickly on Alfredo, seated alone at the bar with 
           his back to us. As he turns, smiling, Lalo HITS HIM SQUARE IN 
           THE FACE, knocking him to the ground. Alfredo gets up slowly.

                                 ALFREDO
                        I know you don’t approve--

                                 LALO
                        It wasn’t enough for you to break 
                        her heart. You had to end her 
                        career too.

                                 ALFREDO
                        I did the best I could. 

                                 LALO
                        She was part of our act. Part of 
                        our family. Doesn’t that mean 
                        anything to you? 

                                 ALFREDO
                        Lalo Codona, Morality Police.

                                 LALO
                        Clara was right. You’re never going 
                        to be happy, because you can’t be. 
                        The moment you get something you 
                        want is just the moment you start 
                        wanting something else.
           INT. FANCY RESTAURANT - EVENING

           Leitzel sits at a table across from the Colonel. From his 
           expression we can tell he just received the bad news.

                                 COLONEL
                        So. It’s really true love then. 

                                 LEITZEL
                        I’ll always be grateful to you. 
                        Always. You made me who I am.

                                 COLONEL
                        You made you who you are.

                                 LEITZEL
                             (fondly)
                        There you go again. 

           He rolls the edge of his glass against the table, despondent. 

                                 COLONEL
                        It’s strange, being my age. The 
                        world as I knew it is disappearing. 
                        Society is changing, men are 
                        changing, women are changing.

           He smiles at her.

                                 COLONEL (CONT’D)
                        But you make me feel good about 
                        what’s to come. That’s a rare 
                        thing. And a valuable one.

           She reaches out and takes his hand. Smiles sadly at him. We 
           can tell this goodbye is hard for her. 

           INT. LEITZEL’S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT

           Alfredo is pacing back and forth excitedly while Leitzel 
           packs his trunk for him. 

                                 ALFREDO
                        This is going to be huge for me. 
                        For us. I’m doubling for both the 
                        leads. For Janet Gaynor.

                                 LEITZEL
                        I hate the movies. Compared to live 
                        performance they’re just tedious. I 
                        give it three years before they 
                        stop making them altogether. 
                                 ALFREDO
                        Oh. I see.

                                 LEITZEL
                        Do you want me to pack your 
                        leotards, or are they going to--

                                 ALFREDO
                        You’re the real star, and I’m 
                        spending two weeks in Hollywood for 
                        no reason at all. 

                                 LEITZEL
                        Not for no reason at all. Because 
                        you need the money.

                                 ALFREDO
                        You think I’m low-class.

                                 LEITZEL
                        I think I make more money than you.

                                 ALFREDO
                        You’re so superior to me.

                                 LEITZEL
                        Superior at earning money, yes. 

                                 ALFREDO
                        With your huge apartment and your 
                        fancy jewelry and your nice things.

           He gestures at her vanity, which is cluttered with silver 
           toilette items, jewelry, perfume bottles. 

                                 ALFREDO (CONT’D)
                        Is it so hard for you to support 
                        me? To tell me I’m incredible 
                        instead of telling me I’m not quite 
                        as incredible as you?

                                 LEITZEL
                        You don’t have to apologize for 
                        being successful. Why should I?

           Alfredo stares at her reflection in the vanity mirror, 
           seething, before abruptly picking up a silver hairbrush and 
           hurling it at the mirror, shattering it. 

           INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME

           The CRASH startles Mabel, who looks up from her crocheting as 
           Leitzel and Alfredo’s voices escalate in volume.
           INT. BEDROOM

           Alfredo shoves the drawers into his trunk furiously.

                                 ALFREDO
                        I can’t believe I was stupid enough 
                        to think I could share a life with 
                        you. You’ve never even shared a 
                        spotlight.

           He pulls the suitcase toward the door. With growing hysteria:

                                 LEITZEL
                        If you walk out that door right now 
                        it’ll be the last time you ever 
                        walk through it again--

           But he kicks the door shut mid-sentence, denying her the 
           satisfaction of finishing her threat.

           EXT. FOX LOT - MORNING (1928)

           Alfredo and Lalo cross the busy backlot of the old Fox 
           Studios at Sunset and Western, eyes wide at the hustle and 
           purpose of everyone around them. They’re headed for what 
           looks incongruously like a country barn.

           INT. 4 DEVILS SET

           They enter to find the inside staged like a Parisian 
           entertainment hall, complete with a cupola and rows of empty 
           seats. In the center of the floor, famed director F.W. MURNAU 
           explains to his leads, CHARLES MORTON and JANET GAYNOR:

                                 MURNAU 
                             (German accent)
                        Charles is seduced by the vamp, in 
                        spite of his promises to Marion. 

           Turning, Murnau notices Alfredo approaching.

                                 MURNAU (CONT’D)
                        Wonderful. Alfredo Codona, meet 
                        Charles Morton and Janet Gaynor.

                                 CHARLES
                        It’s an honor. 

                                 JANET
                        Truly. We’re all such big fans.

           Alfredo shakes Charles’ hand before kissing Janet’s.
                                 LALO
                             (stepping forward)
                        Lalo Codona. Excited to be here.

           But neither of the actors acknowledges him.

                                 MURNAU
                        I was just explaining the film’s 
                        penultimate scene, when Marion’s 
                        heartbreak drives her to madness.

           EXT. MIDTOWN AVENUE - MORNING

           Mabel trails along after Leitzel, struggling to balance 
           multiple wrapped parcels from stores. 

           INT. DEPARTMENT STORE 

           Leitzel pulls things off counters and shelves with reckless 
           abandon, shoving them into Mabel’s waiting arms as SHOPGIRLS 
           whisper to one another:

                                 SHOPGIRL #1
                        Here she comes again.

                                 SHOPGIRL #2
                        Third time this week.

           Mabel puts things back as quickly as Leitzel pulls them down, 
           but her boss doesn’t seem to notice. She strides ahead 
           without looking back, rattling on manically:

                                 LEITZEL
                        I want some of those drop-waist 
                        dresses all the girls are wearing 
                        now. The beaded ones. And the 
                        little hats to match, with 
                        paillettes all over them. And a 
                        feather boa. Two feather boas.

                                 MABEL
                        You have plenty of dresses.

                                 LEITZEL
                        Then I’ll throw some away. Out with 
                        the old, in with the new, that’s 
                        how the expression goes, isn’t it?

                                 MABEL
                        Please. Let’s just go home.
                                 LEITZEL
                        You’re being awfully dull today. 
                        Even for you.

                                 MABEL
                        It’s just ...

                                 LEITZEL
                        Oh, God, Mabel, spit it out.

                                 MABEL
                        It’s just hard to watch you waste 
                        so much money on things you’ll 
                        never take out of the box!

           Leitzel reels as if she’s been slapped.

                                 LEITZEL
                        You’re fired. 

           She strides off. Mabel follows her patiently until she whips 
           around again, furious:

                                 LEITZEL (CONT’D)
                        What’s wrong with you? I said 
                        you’re fired.

           The scene they’re making has attracted the attention of other 
           SHOPPERS, who’ve stopped what they’re doing to watch.

                                 MABEL
                        Let’s just get you home--

                                 LEITZEL
                        You’re like a dog, you know that? 
                        Your master can beat you within an 
                        inch of your life and you’ll still 
                        follow him around, hoping he’ll 
                        decide he loves you again. 

           Mabel is silent. She’s ridden out these tantrums before.

                                 LEITZEL (CONT’D)
                        Nothing to say? 
                             (beat)
                        Oh. I see what’s really going on 
                        here. You’re worried about money, 
                        aren’t you? Well, don’t be.

           Leitzel reaches into her purse and pulls out a wad of cash. 
           She throws the crumpled bills at Mabel. They bounce off her 
           face, her chest, her legs, and land at her feet in a pile.
           Other SHOPPERS stare at Mabel, whose face turns scarlet. This 
           is a new level of humiliation. 

                                 LEITZEL (CONT’D)
                        There. Now you have what you really 
                        wanted from me all along.

           Leitzel strides off, shouting to no one in particular:

                                 LEITZEL (CONT’D)
                        There had better be a cab waiting 
                        for me when I walk out that door!

           INT. 4 DEVILS SET 

           Alfredo and Murnau stand on a high platform. Alfredo watches 
           over his shoulder as Murnau instructs Janet and Charles, who 
           lie next to one another in the center of the floor, 
           portraying the film’s two dead main characters.

                                 MURNAU
                        Charles, if you could just bend 
                        your neck a little further ...

           Alfredo is weirdly transfixed by this sight.

                                 MURNAU (CONT’D)
                             (turning to him)
                        As an acrobat yourself you must 
                        find this ending especially tragic. 

                                 ALFREDO
                        I don’t know. Maybe star-crossed 
                        lovers are better off this way.

                                 MURNAU
                        Surely you don’t think that. 

                                 ALFREDO
                        Look at them. They won’t grow old. 
                        Won’t start to hate each other. 
                        They’ll always be remembered just 
                        as they are.

           INT. LEITZEL’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT

           Leitzel comes staggering through the door, drunk. The 
           apartment is dark except for a faint glow from Mabel’s room. 
           INT. MABEL’S ROOM

           We’ve never seen this tiny headquarters that Mabel enjoys, 
           the only permanent home she’s known in years. It’s 
           utilitarian but surprisingly cheerful. The walls are 
           plastered in pictures of flowers, and a crocheted blanket 
           makes the twin bed look cozy and comfortable.

           As Leitzel enters unsteadily, she sees Mabel filling a small 
           suitcase with items from her dresser.

                                 LEITZEL
                        Come have a drink with me. 

           INT. LIVING ROOM

           Mabel sits across from Leitzel, seeming uncomfortable perched 
           on her fancy sofa. Leitzel pours an inch of whiskey into a 
           glass and hands it to her, then pours one for herself. 
           Sipping it with a grimace:

                                 MABEL
                        This tastes like medicine.

                                 LEITZEL
                        It’s medicine for something all 
                        right. Go ahead. It grows on you.

           Mabel takes another sip.

                                 LEITZEL (CONT’D)
                        Now tell me what I can do to make 
                        you stay.

                                 MABEL
                        Nothing.

                                 LEITZEL
                        I’ll double what I pay you. Set you 
                        up in your own apartment. Buy you 
                        anything you want.

                                 MABEL
                        It’s not about money.

                                 LEITZEL
                        Then what is it about? Why’d you 
                        take this job in the first place?

           Mabel is quiet for a moment. Then:

                                 MABEL
                        I wanted freedom.
                                 LEITZEL
                             (jaded)
                        Don’t we all.

                                 MABEL
                        How can you say that? You have all 
                        the freedom in the world, and look 
                        what you do with it! Sit in a room 
                        full of nice things but keep it too 
                        dark to see them. Drink bootleg 
                        hooch and cry about a man. You 
                        might as well be in Elmo, Texas, 
                        taking in mending so your husband 
                        has extra whorehouse money.

           There’s a silence as Leitzel takes this in. Then:

                                 LEITZEL
                        You don’t have an accent.

                                 MABEL
                        I got rid of it.

                                 LEITZEL
                        Me too. My tutor would slap me with 
                        a ruler if I missed a th sound.
                             (British accent)
                        “Do you want people to know you’re 
                        Silesian?” And then whack.

                                 MABEL
                        Silesia?

                                 LEITZEL
                        It’s gone now. The war. They re-
                        drew the map, and it didn’t make 
                        the cut.
                             (harsh laugh)
                        I have a father I’ve never met, a 
                        mother I never see and a home that 
                        doesn’t exist anymore. I’m from 
                        Nowhere Comma Nowhere.

                                 MABEL
                        Me too.

                                 LEITZEL
                        You’re the best friend I have, and 
                        I know so little about you.
                             (off Mabel’s surprise)
                        Don’t get sentimental about it. 
                        It’s just a fact. 

           There’s a long silence. Then, unprompted:
                                 MABEL
                        Growing up we didn’t have a mirror. 
                        We didn’t even have a glass window. 
                        For the longest time I had no idea 
                        what I looked like. None at all.

                                 LEITZEL
                        I can’t imagine that. 

                                 MABEL
                        I think a lot of girls would be sad 
                        to go all those years only to find 
                        out they’re plain. But not me. 
                        Having something like that just 
                        means having something to lose.

           Leitzel nods, taking her meaning.

                                 LEITZEL
                        We’ll all get old.

                                 MABEL
                        That’s right.

                                 LEITZEL
                        This is why I need you. To remind 
                        me I’m still a person. You’ll stay, 
                        won’t you? I promise I’ll be 
                        better. Just stay.

                                 MABEL
                        I’m not going anywhere. You know 
                        that.
                             (beat)
                        Unless maybe you want to fire me 
                        again, then offer to pay me double 
                        one more time ...

           Leitzel points at the door. Dramatically, but with a twinkle:

                                 LEITZEL
                        Mabel, you’re fired.

           EXT. AIRFIELD - AFTERNOON

           Alfredo walks down the steps of a plane to find Leitzel 
           standing on the tarmac, waiting. 

           He hesitates just long enough to make us wonder what he’s 
           thinking. Then he runs to her and sweeps her into his arms. 
           As she starts to cry with relief:
                                 ALFREDO
                        I’m sorry. I’m terrible. I’m so 
                        terrible.

                                 LEITZEL
                        I’m worse.

                                 ALFREDO
                        I guess that makes us perfect for 
                        one another.

                                 LEITZEL
                        I guess we are.

           INT. LEITZEL’S TENT - EVENING 

           Leitzel and Alfredo lie in an exhausted post-coital heap on 
           her bed. A KNOCK AT THE DOOR startles them:

                                 MABEL (O.S.)
                        It’s nearly six.

                                 LEITZEL
                        Just a minute!

           She slides out of bed and walks to her dresser. Flips open a 
           wooden box and pulls out a strip of rubber and a syringe.

                                 ALFREDO
                        What are you doing?

           With expert swiftness, Leitzel ties off her upper right arm 
           to pop the vein, then inserts the needle. 

                                 LEITZEL
                        It’s caffeine. To quiet the pain. I 
                        tried cocaine but it made me dizzy.
                             (beat)
                        You wanted to know what was under 
                        the glove. Well, here it is.

           Alfredo takes this in as Leitzel depresses the plunger, then 
           hastily unwraps her arm and stashes her gear in the box. 

                                 ALFREDO
                        You should finish getting ready. 

           Leitzel pulls two costumes off her rack.

                                 LEITZEL
                        Red? Or white? I’m thinking white.
                                 ALFREDO
                        Definitely red.

           INT. CHICAGO COLISEUM - NIGHT

           NEAR THE CEILING - Hidden by darkness, Leitzel sits on her 
           trapeze, kicking her feet. She’s wearing the white dress. Far 
           below, the Ringmaster is wrapping up his introduction:

                                 RINGMASTER
                        ... the world’s most daring lady 
                        acrobat, Miss Lillian Leitzel!

           As the spotlight ILLUMINATES HER, Leitzel leaps to her feet, 
           bowing and curtsying for the APPLAUDING CROWD. As always, she 
           uses her big toe to nudge open the of chalk dust tied to the 
           bar. But she freezes when something catches her eye.

           Suddenly the Ringmaster is illuminated again. The band 
           strikes up an unaccustomed tune: it’s the ragtime melody 
           Alfredo and Leitzel danced to so long ago.

                                 RINGMASTER (CONT’D)
                        Ladies and gentlemen, we have a 
                        very special surprise for you.

           Leitzel bends over, baffled, to unearth a strange object from 
           the little sack of dust. As she holds it up to the light, we 
           realize it’s a MASSIVE DIAMOND RING.

           ON THE FLOOR - The Ringmaster has been joined by Alfredo.

                                 RINGMASTER (CONT’D)
                        The King of the Trapeze has a 
                        question for the Queen of the Air. 

                                 ALFREDO
                        Lillian Leitzel, will you be my--

           He can’t even get the words out before the crowd ERUPTS INTO 
           ROARING CHEERS AND APPLAUSE. They completely drown him out as 
           he tries again, laughing:

                                 ALFREDO (CONT’D)
                             (shouting)
                        Will you be my wife?

           The stagehands have been lowering Leitzel’s trapeze. She’s in 
           tears, nodding frantically. 

           When she’s within reach, Alfredo pulls her off the bar, 
           dipping her into a kiss. 
           His eyes are shut, but Leitzel’s are wide open, taking in the 
           POPPING OF FLASHBULBS as countless press photographers 
           capture the moment. 

           INT. LEITZEL’S PULLMAN CAR - NIGHT

           Leitzel is asleep in Alfredo’s arms when a QUIET TAP at the 
           door startles her awake. She slides out of his grip, careful 
           not to wake him, and pulls on a robe before stepping outside.

           EXT. LEITZEL’S PULLMAN CAR

           Three TEENAGED FEMALE PERFORMERS are waiting outside, their 
           hooded oil lamp the only illumination in the darkened camp.

                                 LEITZEL
                             (hushed tone)
                        Really? All of you? 
                             (stern)
                        Caroline, this is your second.

                                 CAROLINE
                        I’m so sorry, Miss Leitzel. I 
                        screwed up again. 

           Leitzel shakes her head, pulls a roll of bills from the 
           pocket of her robe. Counting them out:

                                 LEITZEL
                        I want all of you to get Dutch 
                        pessaries. The midwife will have 
                        them, but you’ll have to ask. 

                                 CAROLINE
                        Aren’t those illegal?

           Leitzel shoots her a look. 

           INT. LEITZEL’S PULLMAN CAR

           As she slides back into bed, Leitzel awakens Alfredo.

                                 ALFREDO
                        Where were you?

                                 LEITZEL
                        Nowhere. Go back to sleep.

                                                               FADE TO:
           EXT. GRANT PARK - AFTERNOON - AERIAL VIEW 

           The normally bustling circus camp is empty except for a few 
           STRAGGLERS running across the grounds in formal wear. 

           INT. PALMER HOUSE SUITE - EARLY AFTERNOON

           Mabel is putting the finishing touches on Leitzel’s hair at 
           the vanity. In the reflection of the room behind them, her 
           wedding dress can be seen hanging in a corner. A KNOCK at the 
           suite’s front door interrupts them.

           As Leitzel walks toward the door and unlocks it:

                                 LEITZEL
                        You’d better have your eyes shut. 
                        You know it’s bad luck to--

           She stops short when she sees who it is.

                                 LEITZEL (CONT’D)
                        Oh. Come in.

           INT. PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH

           Church bells ring the hour: ONE, TWO, THREE. Alfredo, dapper 
           in a pricy-looking morning suit, stands at the altar to the 
           left of a MINISTER, BEAMING. 

           We REVERSE to see the pews PACKED with faces familiar and 
           unfamiliar: Mister John, the Ringmaster, Hans, Gretchen and 
           Dolly. Seated with Lalo and the other TRAPEZISTS is VERA 
           BRUCE, 22, a wide-eyed, gorgeous new addition to the circus.

           The DOUBLE-DOORS at the back of the room BANG OPEN. The 
           GUESTS leap to their feet and turn around. But it’s just a 
           late arrival: a JUGGLER and his DATE. 

                                 ALFREDO
                        Fashionably late. That’s Leitzel.

           The Guests LAUGH WARMLY. 

           INT. SUITE - SITTING ROOM - SAME

           Leitzel pours the Colonel a glass of champagne.

                                 COLONEL
                        I hope you don’t mind the 
                        intrusion. I saw the big news in 
                        the papers.
                                 LEITZEL
                        I’m actually already late.

                                 COLONEL
                        I came all this way. You should at 
                        least hear what I have to say.

           She glances at the clock. Hesitates.

                                 LEITZEL
                        Well, I suppose they can’t very 
                        well start without me. 

           INT. CHURCH

           We hear the bells ringing ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR as Alfredo 
           PACES at the front of the room. The Guests have grown 
           RESTLESS, are TALKING and TITTERING amongst themselves. Vera 
           is VISIBLY THRILLED to bear witness to the scandal.

           INT. SUITE

           Leitzel and the Colonel are mid-argument.

                                 LEITZEL
                        It’s no surprise you don’t like 
                        him. I just can’t believe you hate 
                        him enough to try to talk me out of 
                        marrying him.

                                 COLONEL
                        Have I ever not had your best 
                        interests at heart? Have I ever 
                        been jealous, demanding, unkind? 
                        Have I ever asked anything of you?

                                 LEITZEL
                        No. I suppose not.

                                 COLONEL
                        Then I’m asking you now: Please 
                        don’t do this. You have no idea 
                        what kind of mistake you’re making. 

           INT. CHURCH

           ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR, FIVE CHIMES as men take off their 
           jackets and unbutton their shirts, women fan their faces. 
           Alfredo sits on the steps to the altar, face in hands. Looks 
           up hopefully as Lalo enters from the rectory:
                                 LALO
                        No one’s seen her in the lobby, and 
                        her suite isn’t picking up.

           INT. SUITE

           Leitzel and the Colonel stare each other down as a phone 
           RINGS in the background. When it finally goes silent:

                                 LEITZEL
                        Maybe it’s time for me to make some 
                        decisions without your help.

                                 COLONEL
                        If you let him make you his wife, 
                        one day that’s all you’ll be. 

                                 LEITZEL
                        I guess you don’t know me that well 
                        after all.

                                 COLONEL
                        I know how you feel about him. It’s 
                        more than love. It’s as if he’s a 
                        battle you’re trying to win.
                             (beat)
                        What wouldn’t you be willing to 
                        sacrifice, if it meant he’d stay by 
                        your side? What wouldn’t you give 
                        up, if it meant keeping him?

                                 LEITZEL
                        He would never ask me to make that 
                        kind of choice. 

                                 COLONEL
                        If you really believed that, we 
                        wouldn’t still be sitting here.

                                 LEITZEL
                        My God. What time is it?

                                 COLONEL
                        You know what time it is. I’ve seen 
                        you looking at the clock over my 
                        shoulder. There. You did it again.

           Leitzel opens her mouth to respond, then shuts it again.

                                 COLONEL (CONT’D)
                        You can do it now, while it’s still 
                        easy, or you can do it later, when 
                        it’s going to really hurt. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 COLONEL (CONT’D)
                        But at some point, everyone has to 
                        choose between ambition and love.

           She takes this in. Then downs her champagne and stands up, 
           ready to issue her final, best retort:

                                 LEITZEL
                        You didn’t.

           She waits for him to respond. But the Colonel has no comeback 
           for this. After all, she’s right.

           INT. CHURCH

           The bells chime SIX. As they RING, INEXORABLY COUNTING OUT 
           THE HOUR, Alfredo stares out at the RESTLESS ROOM. Scraps of 
           WHISPERED GOSSIP come drifting toward him:

                                 CLOWN
                        ... running around with those rich 
                        friends of Mister John’s ...

                                 EQUESTRIENNE
                        ... heard she once made a pass at 
                        Woodrow Wilson!

                                 LION GIRL
                        ... he thought he was getting a 
                        wife, not becoming one.

           Suddenly the doors at the back BURST OPEN. Everyone RISES AND 
           TURNS. The sound of Leitzel GIGGLING DELIGHTEDLY precedes her 
           appearance. At the sight of her, the whole room GASPS. 

           Alfredo raises his head to see his bride STRIDING DOWN THE 
           AISLE EXCITEDLY. Tears in her eyes, a vision in white satin. 
           Everything about the tableau she presents is perfect, except 
           for the man on her arm: she’s accompanied by the Colonel. 

           He walks arm-in-arm with her until they reach the altar. Then 
           he nods deferentially at the baffled Alfredo and steps to the 
           side to take a seat in a front pew. Leitzel smiles at 
           Alfredo, then turns to address the room:

                                 LEITZEL
                        Am I late?

           The crowd LAUGHS. She turns back to Alfredo and grabs both of 
           his hands. Seeing his face, she murmurs:

                                 LEITZEL (CONT’D)
                        We waited all these years, what’s 
                        another couple of hours?
           The Minister comes dashing in from the rectory with Lalo, who 
           went to retrieve him. Straightening his vestments, he steps 
           between the couple of the hour and addresses Alfredo:

                                 MINISTER
                        Shall we begin?

           A PAINFUL SILENCE follows. Leitzel looks up at Alfredo 
           lovingly, pleadingly. Finally, he speaks:

                                 ALFREDO
                        Please.

           EXT. CHICAGO STREET

           An OLDER COUPLE strolling down the sidewalk turn their heads 
           at the sound of a GOOFY HORN BLASTING. We REVERSE to see the 
           THRILLED FACES of Leitzel and Alfredo hanging out of an open-
           top automobile piloted by a CLOWN in full makeup. 

           INT. CIRCUS TENT - LATER

           The tent has been filled with LONG BENCHES AND TABLES, at 
           which the wedding’s HUNDREDS OF GUESTS eat and drink merrily. 
           Dead-center on the floor are Leitzel and Alfredo. Leitzel 
           flings back champagne with abandon, but he appears troubled:

                                 ALFREDO
                        I thought we were having roast 
                        chicken and potatoes.

           As he speaks, DECADENT PLATTERS crowded with LOBSTERS, 
           OYSTERS and CRAB LEGS are passed under their noses.

                                 LEITZEL
                        The Colonel wanted to jazz it up a 
                        bit. In fact he insisted.

                                 ALFREDO
                        Did it ever occur to you I might 
                        not want the Colonel buying my 
                        wedding dinner?

                                 LEITZEL
                        Smile. Everyone’s watching us.

           She jumps to her feet and bangs on her glass with her fork to 
           get everyone’s attention. As the guests quiet down:

                                 LEITZEL (CONT’D)
                        We’re so honored to have you all 
                        here to celebrate our marriage.
           She looks down at Alfredo, still BEAMING RADIANTLY. 

                                 LEITZEL (CONT’D)
                        For so long I searched for a man 
                        who was my perfect match in every 
                        way, only to discover that I’d 
                        known him all along.

           Alfredo leaps to his feet and pulls her in close for a kiss. 
           The GUESTS APPLAUD WILDLY.

           LATER

           A TEAM OF UNIFORMED WAITERS is hard at work popping bottle 
           after bottle of champagne. The pale gold liquid FIZZES in 
           glasses, OVERFLOWS bottles as the REVELERS continue to party.

           As we travel over the benches crammed with guests, we find 
           Alfredo STALKING ALONG the aisles between tables.

           He finds Lalo at a table with a cluster of other performers, 
           laughing at something a beautiful young woman, ANITA, has 
           just said. Alfredo taps him on the shoulder and he 
           reluctantly tears himself away.

                                 ALFREDO
                        Have you seen Leitzel?

                                 LALO
                        Was she the one standing next to 
                        you at the altar earlier?

           He turns back to the table as Anita finishes her joke:

                                 ANITA
                        So he says, you of all people 
                        should know how to let go!

           INT. CHICAGO COLISEUM

           The arena is barely lit and silent. Leitzel eyes the trapeze 
           rigging high above before unbuttoning her wedding dress.

           NEAR THE CEILING - Leitzel flies back and forth on the 
           trapeze wearing only her slip. Eyes squeezed shut. Happy. And 
           then, suddenly, her eyes pop open at the sound of the VOICE:

                                 UNEARTHLY VOICE (V.O.)
                        Let go. 

           The trapeze slows to a stop. Leitzel hangs from it by her 
           knees, eyes wide, frightened.
                                 LEITZEL
                        Who are you?

           But there’s no answer.

           INT. LEITZEL’S PULLMAN CAR - LATE NIGHT

           Alfredo sits on the bed, morosely studying the drink in his 
           hand. Takes a gulp and squeezes his eyes shut against the 
           burn. When he opens them again, Leitzel is standing there. 

                                 LEITZEL
                        There you are.

                                 ALFREDO
                        Here I am?

                                 LEITZEL
                        Did you have a good time?

                                 ALFREDO
                        What do you think?

           She sits next to him and rests her head on his shoulder.

                                 LEITZEL
                        This was the happiest day of my 
                        life. 

                                 ALFREDO
                        Really? Who’d you spend it with?

                                 LEITZEL
                        I’m not going to report to you 
                        everywhere I’ve been like a child.

                                 ALFREDO
                        Leitzel.

                                 LEITZEL
                        Fine.
                             (beat)
                        I went to practice.

                                 ALFREDO
                        You expect me to believe that?

           Leitzel pulls off her gloves and holds out her arms. Her 
           wound is torn open again, her hands white from chalk. 
                                 LEITZEL
                        It’s just with all the wedding 
                        preparations there hasn’t been any 
                        time to rehearse, and we open in a 
                        week, and I started to panic 
                        thinking there’s been all this 
                        publicity and I might turn around 
                        and make a fool of myself--

           He rises. Paces across the room, then THROWS DOWN HIS DRINK 
           drunkenly, decisively. The glass SHATTERS.

           She flinches. It seems as if he’s furious. This might really 
           be it. The end, their marriage over before it even began.

           And then, bafflingly, he begins to LAUGH. 

                                 ALFREDO
                        You’re perfect. You couldn’t be 
                        more perfect. 

           Leitzel rushes to him. He wraps his arms around her, crushes 
           her against his chest. 

                                 LEITZEL
                        I wanted you for so long, I almost 
                        can’t believe I have you. It feels 
                        like a dream.

                                 ALFREDO
                        That’s because it is.

           He leans down to kiss her. 

           INT. MOVIE THEATER

           Silhouetted heads watch a flickering newsreel.

           INSERT - FILM - “KING AND QUEEN OF THE BIG TOP”

           In scratchy black and white, Leitzel and Alfredo exit a town 
           car outside the edifice of a chic apartment building. 

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        A real-life Romeo and Juliet story 
                        played out under the big top when 
                        Lillian Leitzel, world’s foremost 
                        lady gymnast, said “I do” to 
                        Alfredo Codona, world’s greatest 
                        living trapeze artist.

           In a practice tent, Alfredo executes the Triple flawlessly.
                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Sorry, gentlemen, she’s off the 
                        market. And there’s never been a 
                        more adoring wife. In a recent 
                        interview with the Ladies Home 
                        Journal, the new Mrs. Codona gave a 
                        hint of what may be in store ...

           Suspended high in the air in Grant Park, Leitzel performs her 
           rotations against a backdrop of tall buildings.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        Telling the publication that 
                        although she’s a worldwide 
                        celebrity, the act she’s most 
                        looking forward to next is 
                        motherhood. 

           Stiffly posed on a couch, the couple smiles for the camera.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        It was a magical day for fans of 
                        the circus when these two were wed.

           INT. MOVIE THEATER

           We REVERSE to see Mister John seated in the balcony, reveling 
           in this brilliant act of publicity.

                                 NARRATOR (V.O.)
                        But it’s their fellow performers 
                        who bear witness daily to the real 
                        greatest show on earth ...

           INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - ARENA - DAY

           PERFORMERS and STAFF, including a wide-eyed Vera and a quiet, 
           watchful Lalo, stare upward at Alfredo and Leitzel rehearsing 
           on side-by-side trapezes. Something undeniably thrilling 
           about the way these two play off one another. 

                                 SHOWGIRL
                        I wanna see the Triple!

                                 VERA
                        Yeah! Triple! Triple!

           Soon it catches on, becomes a CHANT:

                                 CROWD
                        Tri-ple! Tri-ple! Tri-ple!
           Shrugging with false modesty - aw, shucks - Alfredo stands on 
           one platform, while Leitzel positions herself on the other. 
           From below Lalo calls up:

                                 LALO
                        He can’t come out to the bar. He 
                        needs a catcher.

                                 LEITZEL
                        I’ll be his catcher.

           The crowd RUSTLES WITH WHISPERED REACTIONS to this gauntlet 
           being thrown. Pleading, to Alfredo:

                                 LALO
                        She doesn’t know how to catch. 

           Alfredo peers across the arena at Leitzel. From below:

                                 VERA
                        She can do it!

                                 LEITZEL
                        I like her.

           The crowd below LAUGHS. Alfredo takes a deep breath before 
           SWINGING OUTWARD to build speed. As he returns, Leitzel tucks 
           her legs around her trapeze, then SWINGS OUT TO MEET HIM.

           Letting go of the bar, Alfredo somersaults as the other 
           performers count:

                                 CROWD
                        One ... two ... three!

           Coming out of the third, it looks as if he’ll miss Leitzel 
           completely. Did she dive just a second too late? But no: 
           she’s just bulleting toward him more quickly than Lalo would. 
           She reaches her arms down and their hands CLAP TOGETHER. 

           As the crowd ERUPTS INTO APPLAUSE, he looks up at her and 
           grins. She grins back. Exhilarated.

           INT. LEITZEL’S TENT - DAY 

           The banner for Auntie Leitzel’s Free School is strung across 
           the makeshift classroom. As the they leave, Mabel gathers the 
           STUDENTS’ books and cushions. Dolly, now a gawky pre-teen, is 
           walking out when Leitzel calls after her:

                                 LEITZEL
                        Dolly, stay a minute.
           From her armoire, Leitzel begins to pull out box after box 
           with labels from fancy department stores. As she opens them 
           for Dolly, we realize they all contain beautiful dresses.

                                 LEITZEL (CONT’D)
                        You’re getting too tall for your 
                        old things.

           Dolly throws her arms around Leitzel.

                                 DOLLY
                        I love you so much, Aunt Leitzel.

           Dolly skips giddily from the room. Mabel wags a finger at 
           Leitzel scoldingly. 

                                 MABEL
                        You shouldn’t have done that.

                                 LEITZEL
                             (fake-furious)
                        Mabel, you’re fired.

           Mabel laughs. By now this is a warm inside joke. 

           INT. TEA SALON - MORNING

           Leitzel and Vera sit across from one another at a little 
           table with a teapot and finger sandwiches. Vera clearly 
           enthralled by the luxuriousness of their surroundings.

                                 LEITZEL
                        The training and rehearsal will be 
                        significantly more intense than 
                        what you’ve been accustomed to.

                                 VERA
                        I’m equal to the task. 

                                 LEITZEL
                        And you’ll comport yourself with 
                        utmost professionalism around my 
                        husband. And Lalo.

                                 VERA
                        Of course. Absolutely. 

           As Leitzel signals to a passing WAITER for the check:

                                 VERA (CONT’D)
                        Can I ask you something? Why me?
           Leitzel eyes Vera’s unmarked ivory arms before reaching 
           forward with her gloved one to pour the last of the tea.

                                 LEITZEL
                        You won’t forget who’s in charge.

           INT. LEITZEL’S PRIVATE TENT - EVENING

           Leitzel sits at her vanity, preparing her syringe and 
           watching in the mirror as Alfredo pulls on his costume.

                                 ALFREDO
                        We’ve been trying for a baby for 
                        almost a year now. Maybe you should 
                        think about seeing a doctor.

                                 LEITZEL
                        I don’t think that’s the problem.

                                 ALFREDO
                        Then what do you think it is?

                                 LEITZEL
                        Maybe it’s the stress of this 
                        place. The intensity of the demands 
                        it places on me. On both of us. 

           On cue, she shoots her arm full of caffeine, wincing.

           EXT. INDIANA FAIRGROUNDS - SUNSET

           Leitzel finds Hans sitting alone on a slight rise just beyond 
           the fairgrounds, looking out over a cornfield rippling in the 
           breeze. It stretches as far away as the eye can see.

           Seating herself next to him:

                                 LEITZEL
                        Gretchen’s been looking everywhere 
                        for you. She seems upset.

           He raises a flask and takes a swig, then passes it to 
           Leitzel, who takes a drink in commiseration. 

                                 HANS
                        Mister John cut my wages again. But 
                        I guess the Queen of the Air 
                        doesn’t have to worry about that 
                        kind of thing. 
                             (beat)
                                 (MORE)
                                 HANS (CONT'D)
                        You know, there’s a thin line 
                        between helping and making a show 
                        of helping. Too thin lately.

                                 LEITZEL
                        It was just a few dresses. 

                                 HANS
                        How do you think it makes me feel 
                        when you give her better than what 
                        I can provide myself? And anyway, 
                        shouldn’t you be starting a family 
                        of your own by now? 

                                 LEITZEL
                        You sound like Alfredo.

                                 HANS
                        I know it’s not for lack of effort. 
                        You two should consider shutting 
                        your windows at night. 
                             (beat)
                        Lately I feel like something’s ... 
                        ending. Do you?

                                 LEITZEL
                        I hate seeing you like this. 

                                 HANS
                        I don’t know what we’d do without 
                        this circus. Where we’d go. 

                                 LEITZEL
                             (taking his arm)
                        You’re not going to have to worry 
                        about that. I promise.

           They stare out at the sunset together. 

           INT. MISTER JOHN’S CAR - AFTERNOON

           Mister John is exhausted, defeated-looking; on the other side 
           of his desk, Leitzel and Alfredo are IRATE.

                                 LEITZEL
                        If you won’t do it for them, do it 
                        for me. Gretchen is like my sister.

                                 MISTER JOHN
                        The Jahns’ act is dated. It doesn’t 
                        pull in the crowds it used to. But 
                        then, what does?
                             (beat)
                                 (MORE)
                                 MISTER JOHN (CONT'D)
                        Now’s as good a time as any to tell 
                        you: I’m taking you both down as 
                        well. To four-hundred a week.

                                 ALFREDO
                        Is that a joke?

                                 MISTER JOHN
                        That’s still a handsome sum. No 
                        other circus can pay it. 

                                 LEITZEL
                        So we should be grateful.

                                 MISTER JOHN
                        This isn’t personal. Ticket sales 
                        are off. You’re both too young to 
                        remember the 1901 panic--

                                 ALFREDO
                        What if Leitzel and I were to start 
                        our own circus?

           He means this as a threat, but the older man merely shakes 
           his head in warning:

                                 MISTER JOHN
                        I’d strongly advise against that. 

           INT. LEITZEL’S PULLMAN CAR - EVENING

           Leitzel sits at her vanity applying her makeup while Alfredo 
           flips through a bound book of press clippings.

                                 ALFREDO
                        What’s this one? The one that calls 
                        you “Queen of the Flock”?

           INT. BIG TOP - SAME

           Hans and Carl are in the middle of their act. Hans stands 
           atop the forty-foot pole balanced on Carl’s shoulders.

                                 LEITZEL
                        Just a thing from the war. The 
                        soldiers all voted.
           INT. BIG TOP

           Hans, teeth gritted as he struggles to maintain his balance, 
           is sliding a cushioned headrest onto the top of his pole in 
           preparation for his final stunt.

           the world.

                                              The most beautiful woman in 
                                              the world. 

           She looks at him in the mirror, eyes full of the question: do 
           you still agree? But he ignores it, looks down again.

           INT. BIG TOP

           Gripping the pole, Hans lowers his head onto the cushion, 
           then lets his arms go so that he is balanced only by his 
           head. Then an alarming TREMOR passes through his body. The 
           audience CHUCKLES, assumes this is part of the show. 

           INT. LEITZEL’S PULLMAN CAR

           Alfredo slides a photo out of the book. It’s the shot of 
           Leitzel in her skimpy costume at the Aerial Garden. Glances 
           up at her again. A reminder that they’re both getting older.

                                 ALFREDO
                        Did you think more about my idea?

           INT. BIG TOP

           Hans’ body SHUDDERS VIOLENTLY. The audience is now MURMURING, 
           ALARMED, as he STARTS TO FALL.

           INT. LEITZEL’S PULLMAN CAR

                                 ALFREDO
                        Maybe if we ran our own show we 
                        could focus more on having a 
                        family. Isn’t that what you want?

                                 LEITZEL
                        Of course. 
           Suddenly a WOMAN’S SCREAM ECHOES across the camp. 

           EXT. CIRCUS GROUNDS

           Leitzel and Alfredo, alarmed, join the STREAM OF PERFORMERS 
           flocking toward the circus tent.

           INT. CIRCUS TENT

           It’s SHEER PANDEMONIUM as WORKERS and PERFORMERS surround 
           Carl and Hans. Carl is barely conscious, woozy, while Hans is 
           limp, eyes shut. Gretchen is holding one of his hands, seems 
           confused at his lack of response:

                                 GRETCHEN
                        Something’s wrong with my husband. 

           Taking in what’s happened, Leitzel turns pale. Alfredo runs 
           to Gretchen and pulls her away from the body as the circus 
           DOCTOR comes running up.

                                 ALFREDO
                        Let’s give the doctor room--

                                 GRETCHEN
                        Tell him there’s something wrong 
                        with my husband!

           Leitzel is running to join them when she sees Dolly on the 
           other side of the floor. Realizing what’s happening:

                                 DOLLY
                        Dad!

           Dolly CHARGES TOWARD THE BODIES. Performers try to catch her 
           and miss as she BULLETS TOWARD HER FATHER. Finally, Leitzel 
           intercepts her just feet from where Hans lies. Grabs her and 
           HOLDS ONTO HER TIGHTLY, stroking her hair, as she shrieks:

                                 DOLLY (CONT’D)
                        Dad! Dad!

           Alfredo and Gretchen approach. Gretchen quickly pulls Dolly 
           away, and the girl buries her face in her mother’s chest. 

                                 DOLLY (CONT’D)
                        No. No. No. 

           The Doctor looks up from Hans’ body to their small group. He 
           shakes his head: he’s gone.
           EXT. CIRCUS GROUNDS - DAY

           Gretchen and Dolly, wearing black, stand next to a small 
           stack of suitcases. Leitzel is crying as they say goodbye.

                                 LEITZEL
                        I don’t want you to go. 

                                 GRETCHEN
                        Now that Hans is gone there’s no 
                        place for us here.

                                 LEITZEL
                        Dolly can join the trapezists. I 
                        was performing every night by her 
                        age.

           Dolly shakes her head, tearful. Gretchen holds her daughter 
           close as she says, her voice shaking with fear:

                                 DOLLY
                        I can’t, Aunt Leitzel. I can’t go 
                        up there ever again.

           Leitzel shakes her head apologetically. 

                                 LEITZEL
                        No, of course not. 

           She puts her arms around the other two women. The three of 
           them hold each other and cry. 

           INT. LEITZEL’S PULLMAN CAR - LATER

           Leitzel stares out the window at the place where they stood. 
           Alfredo sits next to her, silent.

                                 LEITZEL
                        They were the only family I had. 

                                 ALFREDO
                        That’s not true. 

           He kisses her hand gently. 

                                 ALFREDO (CONT’D)
                        Let me take you away. I can make 
                        you happy again. I promise.

           She nods. A spark of desperate hope in her eyes.

                                 LEITZEL
                        You’re right. It’s time.
           INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY 

           Leitzel and Alfredo are handed fabric samples by a sleazy 
           SALESMAN. As Leitzel fingers a thick, gold canvas:

                                 SALESMAN
                        That’s the best quality tent canvas 
                        we got. Eighty cents a square foot.

                                 LEITZEL
                        I don’t know ...

                                 SALESMAN
                        Did I mention it’s flame resistant?

                                 ALFREDO
                             (to Leitzel)
                        You can’t put a price on safety.

           INT. LEITZEL’S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - DAY

           Leitzel and Alfredo sit opposite two crewmen, MIKE and ROB.

                                 ALFREDO
                        Whatever Mister John’s been paying 
                        you, I’ll double it. 

           Rob and Mike look at one another. Impressed. 

                                 ROB
                        Okay. We’re in.

           INT. TRAINYARD - DAY

           Leitzel watches as Alfredo runs his hand lovingly across the 
           machined surface of a brand new, unpainted train.

                                 LEITZEL
                        I can see it across there. “The 
                        Great Codona Circus,” in gold leaf.

           Alfredo looks at her in surprise.

                                 ALFREDO
                        You don’t want your name on it?

                                 LEITZEL
                        Your name is my name now. Remember? 
                        We’re a family.

           She takes his arm. He sighs.
                                 ALFREDO
                        I wish we could afford this one.

                                 LEITZEL
                        We can if I sell my apartment.

                                 ALFREDO
                        I can’t take anymore of your money.

                                 LEITZEL
                        It’s our money. And I want you to 
                        have it.
                             (beat)
                        I believe in you.

           Alfredo beams. He’s waited a long time to hear those words.

                                 ALFREDO
                        1929 is going to be our year.

                                                               FADE TO:

           EXT. CIRCUS GROUNDS - AFTERNOON 

           Leitzel and Alfredo stand outside their brand-new, blue and 
           gold big top, smiling with pride as their CRYER announces to 
           an ENORMOUS, JOSTLING CROWD:

                                 CRYER 
                        Right this way! Step right up for 
                        the Great Codona Circus! 

           EXT. CIRCUS CAMP - NIGHT

           Leitzel, carefully balancing a martini, enters the big top. A 
           tiny figure swallowed by its enormous entrance.

           INT. BIG TOP

           She finds Alfredo sequestered in the ticket booth, counting 
           the money from a lock box by lantern light. 

                                 LEITZEL
                        How are we doing?

                                 ALFREDO
                        You know what? I think we might 
                        just pull this thing off. How do 
                        you like the new flyer?
           He hands her a proof of a handbill: “THE GREAT CODONA CIRCUS 
           IN ITS PREMIERE SEASON, FEATURING THE WORLD-FAMOUS FLYING 
           CODONAS.” No mention of Leitzel. 

                                 LEITZEL
                        I love it. 

           He sips his drink. Grimaces. Starting to laugh:

                                 ALFREDO
                        What is this?

                                 LEITZEL
                        A martini. I made it myself. 

           She takes it from him and takes a sip, then immediately SPITS 
           IT OUT. By now they’re both laughing hysterically.

                                 ALFREDO
                        You, wife, are good at a lot of 
                        unusual things. But you’re better 
                        off leaving the usual ones to 
                        someone else.

           INT. LEITZEL AND ALFREDO’S TENT - LATE NIGHT

           A post-coital tangle of sheets. Alfredo spoons Leitzel, 
           stroking her wounded arm. 

                                 ALFREDO
                        This was the right decision.

                                 LEITZEL
                        We do seem to be doing well.

                                 ALFREDO
                        Not because of that. Because of 
                        you. You’re different here. 

           A calculating look on her face as she absorbs this. Maybe her 
           good wife routine isn’t coming as naturally as he thinks. 

           EXT. LAREDO MAIN STREET - DAY

           Performers and workmen stream from the train depot, LAUGHING 
           and JOSTLING EACH OTHER. Alfredo and Leitzel among them, 
           holding hands. But the group quickly slows at what it sees.

           A desolate main street. Like a ghost town. Although it’s the 
           middle of the day, all the businesses are shuttered. 
                                 ALFREDO
                        Where is everyone?

           The group wanders down the street. Not a soul in sight. As 
           they get further down the road, they start to hear a HUBBUB. 
           ANGRY SHOUTING grows in volume as they near a corner.

                                 MAN (O.S.)
                        Give us back our money!

           EXT. LAREDO SAVINGS BANK

           Alfredo and Leitzel round the corner to find an ANGRY MOB 
           gathered outside the bank. MEN HURL THEMSELVES AGAINST ITS 
           LOCKED DOORS, then fall back into the street, GROANING.

                                 WOMAN
                        We want our money back or we’ll 
                        burn this place to the ground!

           Leitzel turns to Alfredo, terrified. 

                                 LEITZEL
                        What’s happening?

           INT. PASSENGER CAR - LATE NIGHT

           The sixty or so members of the circus travel in a single, 
           cramped passenger car. As we travel down its center aisle to 
           a curtained-off area at the rear, we see what these reduced 
           circumstances mean for the PERFORMERS:

           --A SHOWGIRL and CLOWN try to silence their SQUALLING BABY.

           --VERA removes her stage makeup using a small compact mirror, 
           her eyes occasionally flicking toward the curtains.

           --A GAGGLE OF EQUESTRIENNES bicker over a Life magazine.

           --Mabel tries to get comfortable lying on the hard floor.

           Finally, we see Lalo and Anita sitting against the wall just 
           outside the curtains, her head on his shoulder. At the sound 
           of Alfredo shouting, Mabel looks over at Lalo, worried.

                                 ALFREDO (O.S.)
                        We’re not shutting down and that’s 
                        final!
           INT. PARTITIONED AREA - SAME

           The section of the train that Leitzel and Alfredo have 
           reserved for themselves is small, but contains a real, narrow 
           bed and a table, over which the two are now ARGUING.

                                 LEITZEL
                        The whole world is falling apart. 
                        Millionaires are throwing 
                        themselves off skyscrapers. 

           She gestures at a newspaper on the table. The boldface 
           headline declares “BILLIONS LOST AS STOCKS CRASH.” 

                                 LEITZEL (CONT’D)
                        If we keep operating at a loss 
                        we’ll bankrupt ourselves.

                                 ALFREDO
                        “Operating at a loss”? Who taught 
                        you all this fancy little 
                        businesslady talk? The Colonel?

                                 LEITZEL
                        Please be reasonable--

                                 ALFREDO
                        This is my goddamn circus and I’ll 
                        run it how I want to!

           Leitzel’s eyes flare. With barely controlled anger:

                                 LEITZEL
                        Your circus? Yours? Who paid for 
                        it? Whose lifetime of earnings, 
                        jewelry, cars ... apartment--

                                 ALFREDO
                        I knew you were waiting for the 
                        chance to throw that in my face.

           He sloshes his drink. Takes a gulp. Trying to defuse the 
           situation, Leitzel changes tack. Putting a hand on his arm:

                                 LEITZEL
                        I’m just trying to help.

                                 ALFREDO
                        Cógete!

           Leitzel recoils. Even if we don’t know that he just told her 
           to go fuck herself, the cruelty of the phrase is clear.
           INT. BIG TOP - MORNING

           NEAR THE CEILING - Dressed in their rehearsal leotards, Vera 
           and Alfredo stand on a platform. Suddenly, out of nowhere:

                                 VERA
                        I think you’re right. Not shutting 
                        us down, I mean.  

           Alfredo turns to her, surprised. She blushes demurely.

                                 VERA (CONT’D)
                        I know it’s not my place--

                                 ALFREDO
                        No, no. Go on.

                                 VERA
                        I just think, you grew up in the 
                        circus. If anyone in the world 
                        knows how to run one? It’s you. 

           Alfredo looks at her with new appreciation. Seems to realize 
           for the first time how gorgeous and young she is. 

                                 ALFREDO
                        Thank you. 

           ON THE FLOOR - Leitzel watches as Alfredo whispers something 
           in Vera’s ear. The younger woman ERUPTS INTO LAUGHTER.

           EXT. PERFORMERS’ EXIT - MOMENTS LATER

           Leitzel bolts out of the big top, looking sick. She’s 
           immediately approached by Mike.

                                 MIKE
                        Excuse me, Mrs. Codona? I’m sorry 
                        to bother you--

                                 LEITZEL
                        What is it?

                                 MIKE
                        We’re all real happy to be here. We 
                        are. But the thing is, Mister 
                        Codona’s got behind on our wages.

                                 LEITZEL
                        How behind?
                                 MIKE
                        Two weeks. I’m not asking for 
                        myself, you understand. But the 
                        McConnells, they have a baby--

                                 LEITZEL
                        Of course. It’s okay. I’m glad you 
                        said something. 

                                 MIKE
                        Should I talk to Mister Codona?

                                 LEITZEL
                        No. I’ll take care of it.

           EXT. CIRCUS CAMP - NIGHT

           PERFORMERS AND CREW gather around a campfire. They’re all 
           huddled and shivering. Leitzel scrambles from employee to 
           employee, handing over steaming bowls of soup. 

           Mike lifts his to discover a ten-dollar bill folded 
           underneath. Leitzel presses a finger to her lips: shhh.

           Her deliveries finished, she joins the circle. Looks from 
           face to resentful face. Catches Mike’s eye, but he doesn’t 
           smile. She hasn’t even paid him half of what he’s owed.

           Suddenly Vera begins to sing:

                                 VERA
                        Day is ending, birds are wending 
                        back to the shelter of each little 
                        nest they love ...

           Realizing what she’s singing, an EQUESTRIENNE chimes in:

                                 EQUESTRIENNE
                        Night shade’s falling ...

           Alfredo joins the song, catching Vera’s eye:

                                 ALFREDO
                        Lovers calling ... What makes the 
                        world go round? Nothing but love.

           Now the whole group, except for Leitzel, sings together:

                                 ALL
                        When the whippoorwill calls, and 
                        evening is nigh ...
           Leitzel backs away from the circle. Mabel quickly rises to 
           follow her into the train as the song continues:

                                 ALL (CONT’D)
                        I hurry to my blue heaven.

           INT. TRAIN CAR - MOMENTS LATER

           Leitzel lies on the floor of the empty car crying. Mabel 
           gently peels her from the ground and wraps her arms around 
           her as her sobs shake both their bodies. Over Mabel’s 
           shoulder we see her devastated, miserable face:

                                 LEITZEL
                        No matter what I do I can’t make 
                        him happy. And all it takes her to 
                        make him happy is a song. 

           INT. LEITZEL AND ALFREDO’S TENT - LATER

           Leitzel enters wearing a low-cut nightgown. Conciliatory, 
           trying to seem sexy. But her fragile confidence fails at the 
           sight of Alfredo sitting on the bed, head hung. 

                                 ALFREDO
                        Is this what I think it is?

           He holds up something much like a diaphragm: Leitzel’s Dutch 
           pessary, the birth control she told the teenage girls to get.

                                 ALFREDO (CONT’D)
                        All this time you’ve been lying to 
                        me. Pretending to want a family. 
                        But all you really want is to keep 
                        being Lillian Leitzel. Star.

                                 LEITZEL
                        Give me that.

           She lunges for it, furious, but he holds it away from her.

                                 ALFREDO
                        That’s how you’re going to play 
                        this. You’re not even going to try 
                        to say you’re sorry.

                                 LEITZEL
                        We both know the real reason you’re 
                        so eager for a family. Because then 
                        you’ll finally get to be on top. 
                        While I’m locked away growing your 
                        next little flying Codona--
                                 (MORE)
                                 LEITZEL (CONT'D)
                             (with boundless contempt)
                        --feeding it and burping it and 
                        rocking it to sleep, you’ll be up 
                        there every night. With her. 

                                 ALFREDO
                        You’ve lost your mind. 

                                 LEITZEL
                        You’ve always competed with me. As 
                        long as I’ve known you. It kills 
                        you that I’m more famous, that I’m 
                        smarter, that I make more money. 
                        That’s why you like her. Because 
                        standing next to her is like 
                        standing next to no one at all.

                                 ALFREDO
                        When did you become such a 
                        miserable bitch? 

           He tears the pessary in half and throws the pieces on the 
           ground. Leitzel’s eyes follow them, panicked.

                                 ALFREDO (CONT’D)
                        You can be the Queen of the Air or 
                        you can be my wife. But you can’t 
                        be both forever.

           He storms out.

           INT. BIG TOP - LATE NIGHT

           Alfredo and Lalo stand on opposite platforms.

                                 ALFREDO
                        Listo!

           Alfredo launches. As Lalo swings down to meet him, he turns 
           one, two, three somersaults ... then seems to try for a 
           fourth. But he doesn’t make it, sailing past Lalo’s 
           outstretched arms before PLUMMETING HEADFIRST INTO THE NET.

                                 ALFREDO (CONT’D)
                        Goddammit!

           Lalo drops, landing next to him. They lie on their backs for 
           a moment before Alfredo pulls himself up:

                                 ALFREDO (CONT’D)
                        Let’s try it again.
                                 LALO
                        Come on, Alfredo. I’m exhausted.

                                 ALFREDO
                        We were so close last time. Didn’t 
                        you feel it?

                                 LALO
                        We’ve been practicing for four 
                        hours. I can’t feel anything. 

                                 ALFREDO
                        I’m not going to let you take this 
                        from me just because you’re tired.

                                 LALO
                        This is as much my trick as yours.

                                 ALFREDO
                        Keep telling yourself that.

           And just like that, they’re fighting, rolling back and forth 
           in the net, throwing punches every chance they get. Finally 
           Lalo lands one square in Alfredo’s face. When he pulls his 
           hand back, it’s covered in blood. Wiping his bloodied nose, 
           seeming incredulous that Lalo could actually win a fight:

                                 ALFREDO (CONT’D)
                        You weren’t like this when we were 
                        going after the Triple. 

                                 LALO
                        Things have changed since then.

           INT. PASSENGER CAR - EVENING

           Alfredo and Leitzel address the company of performers.

                                 LEITZEL
                        I don’t know how to thank you all 
                        for following us here, for putting 
                        your trust in us ...
                             (wiping her eyes)
                        You’re our family. We wanted so 
                        badly to take care of you. 

           A room of morose expressions. Suddenly, with forced gusto:

                                 ALFREDO
                        Why all the long faces? This is a 
                        celebration! It may be our final 
                        show, but it’s also going to be our 
                        best. We’re going out with a bang.
                                 VERA
                        Here, here!

           Leitzel locks eyes with the younger woman, disapproving. But 
           Vera just stares right back at her. Unashamed and unafraid.

           INT. BIG TOP - MIDNIGHT

           The Flying Codonas finish the show for a half-full audience. 
           Alfredo hangs from Lalo’s hands as the two men SWING INWARD. 
           Matching them on the other side is Vera, hanging from her 
           trapeze by her knees. When the two meet in the middle, Vera 
           and Alfredo SWITCH PLACES with magical-seeming grace.

           As the three descend their ladders, the Grand Codona Circus’ 
           BAND strikes up “Auld Lang Syne.” Gold confetti falls from 
           the ceiling like snow. The Performers begin to SING ALONG, 
           putting arms around each others’ shoulders and swaying.

           Lalo finds Anita in the crowd and kisses her. Leitzel scans 
           the faces of the revelers and finally spots Alfredo. His back 
           is to her. And his arm is around Vera.

           INT. TRAIN STATION - MORNING

           The various members of the Codona circus hug each other 
           goodbye as Leitzel gets ready to put Mabel on a train.

                                 LEITZEL
                        I’ll send for you as soon as I have 
                        the money. I promise. 

           They step apart. Then Leitzel grabs Mabel again and pulls her 
           into a tight hug, surprising them both.

                                                               FADE TO:

           INT. TOWN CAR - MORNING 

           Vera, Alfredo and Lalo talk excitedly while Leitzel stares 
           out the window at Central Park passing by.

                                 ALFREDO
                        So we ran into some trouble here. 
                        It happens. Everything will be fine 
                        once we get to Europe.

                                 VERA
                        Is the food in Paris as good as 
                        they say?
                                 LALO
                        Better. Not to mention the wine.

                                 ALFREDO
                        Or the girls. Those accents. Oui 
                        oui oui, je t’aime, je t’adore!

           Vera playfully mock-punches him. As Leitzel continues to 
           stare out the window, a break in the treeline reveals a HUGE 
           SHANTYTOWN on the park’s Great Lawn. The sight of a TEENAGE 
           GIRL who resembles Dolly catches her eye. But then the 
           treeline resumes and the vision is gone.

           EXT. CIRQUE D’HIVER - MORNING

           A BANNER UNFURLS over the venue’s front entrance reading 

                  “LES PLUS FORMIDABLES SPECTACTLES DU MONDE: LES CODONAS 
                               VOLANT ET LA REINE DE L’AIR!”

           INT. HOTEL DINING ROOM - SAME

           Leitzel and Lalo are on one side of the table, Alfredo and 
           Vera the other as the foursome eats breakfast.

                                 LEITZEL
                        I thought we could visit the Louvre 
                        this afternoon. 

                                 ALFREDO
                        Why don’t you take Lalo? He could 
                        use a little culture.

           Alfredo eyes her challengingly, then rests his hand on Vera’s 
           knee. The message is clear: I want you to see this. 

           INT. LOUVRE GALLERY - AFTERNOON

           Leitzel and Lalo make somber figures in the midst of the 
           excited crowd as they walk along in silence. Finally:

                                 LEITZEL
                        Wonder what they’re doing right 
                        now, all alone, in a fancy hotel.

                                 LALO
                        I can’t talk to you about this.

                                 LEITZEL
                        Then talk about anything. Anything 
                        you want. Talk or I’ll scream. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 LEITZEL (CONT'D)
                             (beat)
                        How are you?

                                 LALO
                        No one ever asks me that.

                                 LEITZEL
                        I’m sorry.

                                 LALO
                        I’d kinda gotten used to it. 

           They’ve paused in front of the Venus de Milo. Leitzel reaches 
           her hand toward the statue’s torso, fascinated by the holes 
           in its smooth surface. Suddenly a nearby GUARD shouts:

                                 GUARD
                        Mademoiselle! Ne touche pas!

           Leitzel steps back, face burning. After a moment:

                                 LALO
                        I’m going to ask Anita to marry me.

                                 LEITZEL
                        That’s ... wonderful.

                                 LALO
                        I’ve been saving up. She says she 
                        doesn’t care about a ring, so I’m 
                        going to put it toward some land. 
                        California, maybe. We like it 
                        there.

                                 LEITZEL
                        A home.

                                 LALO
                        For when we’re ready for it. 

                                 LEITZEL
                        It doesn’t scare you? The idea of 
                        leaving all this behind?

                                 LALO
                        No. I mean, what we do is exciting 
                        and all. But nothing’s more 
                        exciting than she is.

           Leitzel begins to cry. We know what she’s thinking: Alfredo 
           would never say that about her. Noticing:

                                 LALO (CONT’D)
                        Aw, jeez. I’m sorry.
                                 LEITZEL
                        This isn’t - I’m just happy for 
                        you. That’s all. 

           INT. CIRQUE D’HIVER - EVENING

           The arena’s BIG CHANDELIERS make its gilded cornices and 
           ceiling GLIMMER as Leitzel climbs up her rope, pausing every 
           so often to wink or gesture flirtatiously at the audience. 
           They GASP as she LEAPS TO HER ROMAN RING, then begin to count 
           along, enthralled, as her revolutions grow faster and faster:

                                 AUDIENCE
                        Un! Deux! Trois! Quatre!

           BACKSTAGE - Vera and Alfredo watch through the gap between 
           heavy velvet curtains as Leitzel becomes just a blur.

           LEITZEL’S POV - As the gold and maroon of the arena spin by 
           at a nauseating pace, the sound of Leitzel’s shoulder 
           DISLOCATING is gruesomely loud.

           BACKSTAGE - Vera continues to watch in awe, transfixed. 
           Alfredo, meanwhile, is only watching Vera.

                                 VERA
                        She’s still incredible, even after 
                        all these years.

           Alfredo is surprised to realize:

                                 ALFREDO
                        You admire her.

                                 VERA
                        Why wouldn’t I? She has everything 
                        I want.

           She glances quickly at Alfredo, then looks away coyly. 

                                 ALFREDO
                        You’re very ambitious.

                                 VERA
                        Thank you.

                                 ALFREDO
                        Most women wouldn’t consider that a 
                        compliment.

                                 VERA
                        I guess I’m not most women. 
           LEITZEL’S POV - As Leitzel continues to SPIN, she does the 
           old dancer’s trick of focusing on the same spot with each 
           turn. This time, that spot is the backstage entrance, where 
           she can see Alfredo and Vera’s silhouettes. Suddenly the 
           VOICE cuts in, as gravelly and disturbing as ever:

                                 UNEARTHLY VOICE (O.S.)
                        Let go.

           Leitzel ACCELERATES, trying to drown it out.

                                 UNEARTHLY VOICE (O.S.) (CONT’D)
                        Let go. Let go. Let go. Let--

                                 LEITZEL
                        STOP!

           BACKSTAGE - Alfredo and Vera hear Leitzel SHRIEK, then see 
           her abruptly stop swinging, so that she’s just hanging by her 
           arm. A MURMUR runs through the audience - what’s happening?

           Then Leitzel, ever the professional, turns herself upside 
           down so that she’s suspended feet-up. As if it were all part 
           of the show. The audience, relieved, begins to APPLAUD.

           INT. HOTEL SUITE - SITTING ROOM - EARLY MORNING

           Leitzel enters from the bedroom. Without her usual mask of 
           makeup, she looks as vulnerable as a little girl.

                                 LEITZEL
                        Alfredo? Are you here?

           The silence is resounding. All the answer she needs.

           INT. BEDROOM - LATER

           Leitzel quickly packs her trunk. Has to stand on it to close 
           it - she’s not used to doing this for herself.

           INT. TRAIN CAR - MORNING

           The winter light is cold on Leitzel’s face as the train 
           slides out of the station. As it picks up speed and gets 
           noisier and noisier, she allows herself to start to SOB.
           INT. BERLIN APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY

           An ELDERLY WOMAN with a dog on a leash eyes Leitzel curiously 
           as she stands in front of a door. She waits until the Woman 
           has gone down the stairs before KNOCKING LOUDLY.

           After a moment the door swings open. Leitzel’s face crumples.

                                 LEITZEL
                        I didn’t know where else to go.

           We REVERSE to see the middle-aged woman standing on the 
           threshold. It’s Nellie, now 52. 

                                 NELLIE
                        You came to the right place.

           Leitzel throws herself into her mother’s arms.

           INT. NELLIE’S APARTMENT - DAY

           Dozens of SHINY CIRCUS ACROBATS dangle above our heads. They 
           sway gently in the breeze. Their eyes are black, unseeing, as 
           they drift toward, then away from one another. 

           From above, we see Leitzel and Nellie lying next to one 
           another on the bed. The ceramic figurines hang from the 
           ceiling. Nellie’s collection. Leitzel swats at one idly, 
           sending it flying, as Nellie turns to look at her.

                                 NELLIE
                        I can’t believe you’re really here.

                                 LEITZEL
                        You said I could always come back 
                        to you. I never forgot that. 

                                 NELLIE
                        I was a bad mother.

                                 LEITZEL
                        No. You were right all along. Once 
                        you told me, “Men are the same 
                        everywhere.” I was so sure I knew 
                        better ... I should have listened.

           She sits up suddenly.

                                 LEITZEL (CONT’D)
                        What happened between you and my 
                        father?

           Nellie swallows. After a moment’s hesitation:
                                 NELLIE
                        He ran a circus in the Carpathians. 
                        A small one, just a wagon and a 
                        horse. He was always after the 
                        young girls. One night I tried to 
                        run away. But he caught me.
                             (beat)
                        I was eleven years old.

           Leitzel’s eyes tear up as the meaning of this hits her.

                                 LEITZEL
                        Why didn’t you tell me?

                                 NELLIE
                        I don’t know. I suppose I thought 
                        if you knew where you came from 
                        you’d think you belonged there. 
                             (beat)
                        I wanted you to have a different 
                        kind of life. 

           Leitzel wraps Nellie in her arms as the older woman begins to 
           cry. Rocking her back and forth gently:

                                 LEITZEL
                        Don’t worry. I did. 

           INT. CIRQUE D’HIVER - MORNING

           A lone JANITOR travels the rows of empty seats sweeping. We 
           watch with him as Alfredo and Lalo swing back and forth on 
           their trapezes, building momentum. Then Alfredo’s off: one 
           somersault, two, three ... and a half. 

           He flips himself upside down one last time and his ankles 
           SMACK into Lalo’s outstretched hands.

           They drop into the net, LAUGHING HYSTERICALLY, hugging one 
           another, like they did on that night long ago when they got 
           the Triple for the first time. 

           INT. PARIS RESTAURANT - EVENING

           Vera and Lalo talk as a WAITER pours champagne. But their 
           words are a MUTED BABBLE to Alfredo. He snaps out of it only 
           when he realizes Vera is addressing him:
                                 VERA
                             (raising her glass)
                        To Alfredo, the only trapezist in 
                        the world to get the triple-and-a-
                        half. You’re an inspiration.

                                 ALFREDO
                             (snappish)
                        Give it a rest, Vera.

           Her face falls. But she recovers quickly. Pasting on a 
           saccharine smile and a tone to match:

                                 VERA
                        Fine, then. To us.

           INT. NELLIE’S APARTMENT - AFTERNOON

           Leitzel is folding clothes while Nellie listens to the radio. 
           A KNOCK AT THE DOOR turns both their heads. Leitzel goes to 
           open it, her face lighting up when she sees who it is:

                                 LEITZEL
                        You’re here.

           We REVERSE to see that it’s Mabel waiting there.

           INT. NELLIE’S APARTMENT

           Leitzel, Nellie and Mabel sit in a triangle, eying one 
           another cautiously. Leitzel holds a sealed envelope.

                                 LEITZEL
                        He brought you over for this?

                                 MABEL
                        He wanted it hand-delivered.

                                 LEITZEL
                        Well. This should be good.

           Her feigned bravado is betrayed by the trembling of her hands 
           as she unseals the envelope and removes the letter inside.

           INT. TRAIN CAR - NIGHT

           Alfredo scribbles furtively while Vera sleeps, her head 
           resting on his shoulder.
                                 ALFREDO (V.O.)
                        When it comes to you, I’ve always 
                        been a coward. I’ve been afraid to 
                        have you and afraid to lose you.

           INT. HOTEL LOBBY - AFTERNOON

           Alfredo, Lalo and Vera are led across the lobby by a BELLBOY.

                                 ALFREDO (V.O.)
                        The truth is we’re both cowards. 
                        Isn’t that funny to say?

           INT. HOTEL SUITE

           Vera unpacks her trunk. Looks up at Alfredo, her smile ever-
           so-slightly triumphant.

                                 ALFREDO (V.O.)
                        We risk our lives every night. But 
                        loving someone else, all of them -- 
                        I realize now that that’s the real 
                        daredevil act.

           INT. HOTEL SUITE - EARLY MORNING

           Vera awakens to see a short note resting on Alfredo’s pillow.

                                 ALFREDO
                        Give me one more chance, and I 
                        promise I will finally be brave.

           INT. NELLIE’S APARTMENT

           Leitzel finishes reading. Her head stays down for one long 
           moment. When she looks up again, she’s crying. Mabel and 
           Nellie’s faces both say, Well? Leitzel nods frantically.

           Mabel pulls the front door open to reveal Alfredo waiting in 
           the hall, smiling shyly. He’d been there all along. 

           EXT. BERLIN STREET - EARLY EVENING

           Leitzel and Alfredo walk hand-in-hand in the bluish dusk. A 
           pair of LAMPLIGHTERS work both sides of the street, igniting 
           halos of yellow light that fall on the sidewalks.

                                 LEITZEL
                        This is my favorite time here.
                                 ALFREDO
                        In New York they’re replacing them 
                        with electric.

                                 LEITZEL
                        Everything seems like it’s changing 
                        so much faster than it used to. 

           They pause to look in the window of a bookstore.

                                 ALFREDO
                        I see people reading that 
                        everywhere.

           We realize they’re looking at a display that prominently 
           features “Mein Kampf.” 

                                 LEITZEL
                        People are very excited about 
                        Mister Hitler. They think he can 
                        solve all of Germany’s problems.

           They continue walking. 

                                 ALFREDO
                        Sometimes I feel like I’ve only 
                        seen the big events of my lifetime 
                        from the windows of trains.

           INT. LEITZEL’S ROOM - LATER

           Leitzel and Alfredo lie on the bed. She’s boosted herself up 
           on her elbow and is laughing, mock-horrified:

                                 LEITZEL
                        You never ask a lady that!

                                 ALFREDO
                        I’m sorry, is there a lady here?

           He looks around. She laughs again, pushes him away playfully. 

                                 ALFREDO (CONT’D)
                        Well, I for one am not ashamed. 
                        Thirty-seven.

                                 LEITZEL
                        Thirty-seven?

                                 ALFREDO
                        We were apart for a long time. And 
                        I couldn’t help it if the girls 
                        found me irresistible.
                                 LEITZEL
                        You know, back in Chicago we had a 
                        word for people like you. 

                                 ALFREDO
                        Heroes?

           He’s grinning, but she looks away, suddenly serious. This 
           game isn’t as much fun as she thought it was going to be. 

                                 ALFREDO (CONT’D)
                        I thought we were putting 
                        everything on the table. 

                                 LEITZEL
                        I guess I didn’t realize how much 
                        everything there was. 

                                 ALFREDO
                        Well, since I already told you how 
                        many in the past, I might as well 
                        tell you how many in the future. 

           He holds up a single finger solemnly. She laughs.

           EXT. BERLIN STREET - DAY

           The streets are now covered in a thick blanket of snow. KIDS 
           run back and forth, throwing snowballs, as Leitzel and 
           Alfredo walk along, carrying wrapped packages. Suddenly:

                                 LEITZEL
                        Why’d you come back?

           There’s a brief silence. Then:

                                 ALFREDO
                        We got the three and a half.

                                 LEITZEL
                        You did?

                                 ALFREDO
                        Something just clicked. We couldn’t 
                        do it, and then suddenly we could.

                                 LEITZEL
                        That’s incredible!

           He shrugs. Not the reaction she was expecting. Baffled:

                                 LEITZEL (CONT’D)
                        You don’t seem excited.
                                 ALFREDO
                        I remember when we got the Triple. 
                        There was this unreality, like I’d 
                        split in two - the me I’d always 
                        been, and the man who’d mastered 
                        the Leap of Death. I didn’t know 
                        which one I wanted to be more.

                                 LEITZEL
                        But this time was different.

                                 ALFREDO
                        No. That was the problem. It was 
                        all the same. But then I realized, 
                        the first time I wanted to be both 
                        those men. This time I didn’t want 
                        to be either of them.

           He stops to take both of her hands.

                                 ALFREDO (CONT’D)
                        What’s the point in flying if you 
                        don’t have anywhere to land?

           Realizing what he’s getting at:

                                 LEITZEL
                        We can’t quit. We’re penniless.

                                 ALFREDO
                        We can go to Hollywood and do 
                        stunts in the movies. You’ll see. 
                        Compared to circus work it’s easy. 

                                 LEITZEL
                        How will we get there? Neither of 
                        us has performed in weeks. 

                                 ALFREDO
                        You still have the Copenhagen show.

                                 LEITZEL
                        I was planning on canceling.

                                 ALFREDO
                        But you haven’t yet. 

           She’s silent. After a moment he drops her hands.

                                 ALFREDO (CONT’D)
                        Well. It’s just an idea.

           He resumes walking. Leitzel is surprised to see him smiling.
                                 LEITZEL
                        You’re not angry. 

                                 ALFREDO
                        I’m not going to give you an 
                        ultimatum. This time you decide.

           INT. NELLIE’S APARTMENT - EVENING

           A Christmas tree is lit with candles, strung with popcorn. 
           Nellie opens a package to find a ceramic acrobat to add to 
           her collection. She hugs Alfredo, who immediately sets about 
           stringing it from the ceiling for her. 

           INT. WINTERGARTEN THEATER - DAY

           Leitzel and Alfredo are admitted to the backstage of the 
           empty theater by a JANITOR. Pressing money into his hand:

                                 LEITZEL
                        Danke.

           Alfredo walks out onto the darkened stage while Leitzel feels 
           around for something on the wall until she finds it: a 
           handle. She pulls down forcefully and the hundreds of lights 
           hanging from the theater’s ceiling ILLUMINATE ALL AT ONCE.

           She joins Alfredo on the stage. He stares up at the 
           constellations of bulbs in awe.

                                 ALFREDO
                        It’s beautiful.

                                 LEITZEL
                        This is where the agent from 
                        Barnum’s first noticed us. I was 
                        only eighteen, but somehow I knew 
                        my life was about to change.

           She lies down on the stage so that she’s staring up at the 
           sea of lights. Alfredo joins her. After a silence:

                                 LEITZEL (CONT’D)
                        I hear a voice in my head. When I’m 
                        performing.

                                 ALFREDO
                        What does it say?

                                 LEITZEL
                        “Let go.”
           She sits up. Stares out at the theater’s hundreds of seats.

                                 LEITZEL (CONT’D)
                        I’m ready.

           He sits up next to her. Studies her face.

                                 ALFREDO
                        Are you sure?

                                 LEITZEL
                        I want to go home.

                                 ALFREDO
                        But we don’t have a home.

                                 LEITZEL
                        Yes we do.

           She takes his hand. Realizing her meaning:

                                 ALFREDO
                        I love you, Leitzel.

           She turns to him in surprise. Unbelievable though it seems, 
           they’ve never said those words to each other before.

                                 LEITZEL
                        I love you too. 

           INT. COPENHAGEN HOTEL ROOM - AFTERNOON

           Alfredo is reading the paper as Leitzel enters, trailed by 
           Mabel carrying an enormous box from a department store. She 
           opens it to reveal a beautiful mint-green dress.

                                 ALFREDO
                        Have you seen this?

           He holds out a full-page ad for the VALENCIA THEATER, listing 
           the performers in tonight’s show and featuring a publicity 
           image of Leitzel. Although the ad is in Danish, it’s easy to 
           see that Leitzel is the last and thirteenth performer listed.

                                 ALFREDO (CONT’D)
                        You’re the thirteenth act on Friday 
                        the thirteenth. 

           She hesitates. His fear is persuasive, contagious. Rallying:

                                 LEITZEL
                        I’m thirteenth because I’m the big 
                        finish. 
                                 (MORE)
                                 LEITZEL (CONT'D)
                        And it’s Friday the thirteenth 
                        because all the major engagements 
                        premiere on Fridays. 

           She shuts herself in the bathroom. Mabel begins unpacking the 
           dress. Catching her smiling at him:

                                 ALFREDO
                        What?

                                 MABEL
                        I like seeing you worry about her.

           EXT. VALENCIA MUSIC HALL - DAY 

           A banner depicting Leitzel hanging from her roman ring hangs 
           over the double doors. Alfredo lines up in a crowd of WELL-TO-
           DO PATRONS waiting for admittance. 

           INT. VALENCIA MUSIC HALL - LATER

           Alfredo watches Leitzel’s fake fall from the audience, 
           grinning. APPLAUSE RISES as the audience realizes it’s a 
           trick. She pulls an upside-down curtsy, then drops a sly 
           little wink in Alfredo’s direction.

                                 EMCEE
                        Ladies and gentlemen, Lillian 
                        Leitzel, the Queen of the Air!

           At this, Leitzel pulls herself up, then LEAPS from her 
           trapeze to her roman ring. She swings back and forth, 
           building momentum, until she can FLING HER BODY OVER ITSELF. 
           She quickly gains in speed, a human propeller in a flowing 
           dress. The AUDIENCE begins to count along:

                                 AUDIENCE
                        Tre ... Fire ... Fern ... Seks ...

           LEITZEL’S POV - We hear the familiar CLICK AND POP as 
           Leitzel’s shoulder dislocates, her STRAINED BREATHING. Her 
           eyes fix on the glittering chandelier beyond her upturned 
           feet every time she reaches the bottom of a rotation.

           And then something strange happens. The chandelier gets 
           smaller. It takes a moment before we realize why: she’s 
           FALLING AWAY FROM IT, feet still pointed upward.

           FROM THE AUDIENCE - As she PLUMMETS TOWARD THE FLOOR, sixty 
           feet below, she reaches for her trapeze bar. Alfredo holds 
           his breath - surely she’ll grab it and recover. But her 
           fingers just brush it uselessly, PUSHING IT AWAY. 
           Alfredo sees the PANIC on her face. Rises to his feet. 

           The SHOCKED SILENCE that follows is just enough time to see 
           that Leitzel still clutches her roman ring in her right hand. 
           She didn’t let go - it somehow came loose from its rigging.

           A woman’s SCREAM punctuates the silence just before Leitzel 
           HITS THE FLOOR FLAT ON HER BACK. A HOLLOW BOOM echoes. 

           Alfredo CLAMBERS DOWN the rows of seats as quickly as he can. 
           He and Mabel, coming from backstage, reach Leitzel’s body at 
           the same time. She’s still. Eyes shut. Alfredo is HYSTERICAL:

                                 ALFREDO
                        Is anybody going to call a doctor?

           He grabs her hand, which still clutches the ring tightly. The 
           metal clasp that connected it to its rigging is broken. 

           Two ATTENDANTS rush onto the floor with a stretcher. Leitzel 
           opens her eyes, looks left and right before waving them off.

                                 LEITZEL
                             (rasping)
                        I’m all right. I can go on.

           Mabel strokes her hair soothingly. It’s streaked with blood.

                                 MABEL
                        It’s okay. Just be still.

           Leitzel cracks a smile. Weakly, shutting her eyes again:

                                 LEITZEL
                        Mabel ... you’re fired. 

           INT. COPENHAGEN HOSPITAL - CORRIDOR - NIGHT

           Alfredo, alone in the echoing corridor, PACES ANXIOUSLY. 
           After several excruciating moments an exhausted DOCTOR 
           emerges from a nearby room.

                                 DOCTOR
                        Mister Leitzel?

                                 ALFREDO
                        It’s - Yes.

                                 DOCTOR
                        We gave your wife the highest dose 
                        of morphine permitted for someone 
                        her size. But I don’t know how much 
                        it’s helping. 
           Alfredo tries to push past him, but the Doctor stops him en 
           route to the door. Gently:

                                 DOCTOR (CONT’D)
                        It won’t help either of you if you 
                        let your shock show on your face.

                                 ALFREDO
                        I’ve seen circus accidents before.

                                 DOCTOR
                        You’ve never seen anything like 
                        this.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM

           Leitzel sits upright in the bed, dressed in a short hospital 
           gown. She looks like an alien: her arms and legs are black 
           and blue, her face yellow, her eyes bloodshot. When she sees 
           Alfredo coming through the door, she tries to smile. 

                                 LEITZEL
                        So? Think there’s a place for me in 
                        the sideshow?

           Because even her vocal chords are bruised, her voice comes 
           out as a strange, low almost-croak that we’ve heard before: 
           it’s the voice Leitzel used to hear in her head.

                                 ALFREDO
                        You’re beautiful.

           He rushes to her side. Leans in to kiss her before realizing 
           how bruised her face and lips are. 

                                 LEITZEL
                        What did the doctor say?

                                 ALFREDO
                        He said you’re doing great. 

           Leitzel tries to laugh, starts to COUGH VIOLENTLY. She holds 
           a handkerchief over her mouth. When she pulls it away it’s 
           spattered with blood.

                                 LEITZEL
                        What did he really say?

           There’s a long silence as Alfredo gathers the courage to tell 
           her the truth. Beginning to cry:

                                 ALFREDO
                        He said you’re going to die.
           Leitzel nods. Stunned by the actual words, but not surprised.

                                 ALFREDO (CONT’D)
                        Your skull is cracked. Your bones 
                        are shattered. And you’re bleeding 
                        inside. You’re bleeding everywhere.

           He ERUPTS INTO A SOB. Leans forward to hide his head between 
           his knees as he cries. When he looks up again, her eyes are 
           closed, her breath shuddering in and out of her broken chest. 

                                 ALFREDO (CONT’D)
                        Hey, remember the night we went 
                        dancing? In Chicago? You asked me 
                        why I chose you over all the other 
                        girls, remember that? And I said--

           He stops to collect himself.

                                 ALFREDO (CONT’D)
                        I said it was because there’s no 
                        one else like you. But what I meant 
                        was there’s no one else like me. 

           He begins to sob again. Kisses her hand, hoping she’ll 
           respond. But Leitzel is silent. Asleep. 

           INT. WAITING ROOM - THE NEXT DAY

           Mabel and Nellie sit together. Mabel’s head on Nellie’s 
           shoulder. Through the windows behind them, a thick snow falls 
           hard and fast. Mabel squeezes her eyes shut, crying.

           INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - SAME

           Alfredo, sitting next to her bed, presses something into 
           Leitzel’s hand: her pouch of chalk dust. As her fingers close 
           around it, her eyes flutter open and land on him. 

           She smiles. Extends her free hand weakly. He grabs it, holds 
           it tight as she opens her mouth, struggles to speak.

                                 ALFREDO
                        It’s okay. Don’t talk. 

           She croaks something. Impossible to understand, but Alfredo 
           seems to get it somehow:

                                 ALFREDO (CONT’D)
                        Me too. 
           She shuts her eyes as the pouch of chalk dust slips from her 
           hand. Alfredo looks down as it BURSTS ON THE FLOOR. When he 
           looks up again, her chest is still.

           INT. SHIP CABIN - NIGHT

           Alfredo sits alone in his cabin with a copper urn cradled in 
           his lap. His eyes are red and sunken. 

           EXT. SHIP DECK - DAY

           Alfredo stands at the rail, watching the distant shape of the 
           New York skyline slowly come into focus. The LOUD BUZZING of 
           a plane propeller turns his face upward. A SNOWFALL OF FLOWER 
           PETALS swirls suddenly around the deck. What’s happening?

           The BUZZING grows faint and is gone. The flower petals settle 
           and we see their source: an ENORMOUS WREATH OF RED AND WHITE 
           ROSES that the plane has dropped onto the ship. Alfredo steps 
           toward it, eyes it, finally finds the small card. He opens it 
           to see a single word, printed in bold: “COLONEL.”

           EXT. INGLEWOOD PARK CEMETERY - DAY

           HANDS slide that same urn into a niche in a MARBLE SLAB. We 
           PULL AWAY to reveal

           An ENORMOUS CROWD extends down a hillside away from a HUGE 
           MARBLE MONUMENT. Rolling green hills studded with white 
           gravestones behind them. We can’t yet see the front of the 
           monument, but we can see that they’re perturbed by it:

                                 GUEST #1
                        I heard he commissioned it after 
                        seeing it in a dream.

                                 GUEST #2
                        What’s it supposed to mean?

           We REVERSE to reveal a FIFTEEN-FOOT STATUE depicting Alfredo 
           with ENORMOUS ANGEL’S WINGS. He’s embracing a wingless, 
           BARELY CLOTHED Leitzel. Beneath their feet, two roman rings 
           are carved. The rope attached to one is severed. 

           After a moment, Alfredo steps up and positions himself in 
           front of the statue. The crowd falls silent.

                                 ALFREDO
                        People often said my wife was 
                        difficult. They were right.
           Relieved LAUGHTER from the guests. 

                                 ALFREDO (CONT’D)
                        Difficult, demanding, high-strung. 
                        I don’t feel bad saying that 
                        because she would’ve said so 
                        herself. She loved being difficult.

           He locks eyes with familiar faces in the crowd - Mister John, 
           Mabel, Victoria. Finally he lands on Lalo as he continues:

                                 ALFREDO (CONT’D)
                        Someone once said that the moment I 
                        get something I want, I start 
                        wanting something else. Leitzel and 
                        I had that in common. It’s not a 
                        good thing. We were never very 
                        good. But we were lucky.
                             (beat)
                        We were lucky because we lived to 
                        see the day something was finally 
                        enough for both of us. It turned 
                        out to be something harder and more 
                        daring than any circus trick. But  
                        so much more spectacular.

                                                               FADE TO:

           EXT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - EARLY EVENING (1935)

           The country is still hobbled from the depression, and the 
           line outside the Garden is sparse, unenthusiastic.

           INT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - ARENA - LATER

           ON THE FLOOR - The RINGMASTER addresses the half-full room:

                                 RINGMASTER
                        You’ve never seen anything like 
                        them in your life: Alfredo Codona 
                        ... and his dazzling wife!

           NEAR THE CEILING - Vera and Alfredo stand on their platform.

                                 ALFREDO
                        You look beautiful.

                                 VERA
                        Shut up. I’m trying to concentrate.

           Alfredo’s mouth sets in a grim line. It’s clear the bloom is 
           off the rose: he knows now what Vera really wanted all along. 
           She dives, SWEEPS ACROSS THE ARENA on her trapeze. But the 
           audience doesn’t react. Something unconvincing about her. 

                                 RINGMASTER
                        His brother Lalo’s in the act too. 
                        And you won’t believe what these 
                        two can do. 
                             (as a DRUMROLL begins)
                        They risk life and limb in this 
                        deadly feat. And all you risk is a 
                        quarter a seat. 

           He CHUCKLES BITTERLY. But the audience doesn’t laugh along. 
           They watch, unimpressed, as Alfredo swings forward, then 
           back, gaining momentum. On the next swing, he LETS GO, 
           BULLETING THROUGH THE AIR as he turns his first somersault. 

           ALFREDO’S POV - Alfredo’s eyes lock on Lalo just leaving his 
           platform. He spins again before seeing him a second time, now 
           halfway there. He spins once more and looks up to see ...

           Leitzel. She’s grinning widely and swinging toward him from 
           her knees like she did during rehearsal long ago. She reaches 
           her arms downward to lock them with his. They’re bare and 
           perfectly white, unscarred. He reaches out to meet her grasp.

           FROM THE AUDIENCE - Alfredo SOARS RIGHT PAST LALO, leaving 
           his brother flying toward the opposite side of the arena 
           alone. Lalo SWIVELS HIS NECK DESPERATELY in time to see 
           Alfredo ROCKET HEAD-FIRST INTO THE NET. 

           He BOUNCES CARELESSLY off the woven ropes, his body LIMP AS A 
           DOLL’S, and RICOCHETS into a pole, which sends him FLYING 
           DOWNWARD. With every impact the crowd SUCKS IN ITS BREATH. 
           Finally, he lands FLAT ON HIS BACK on the dirt floor.

           ON THE FLOOR - Alfredo’s right arm is twisted at an odd angle 
           as he stares up at the ceiling. He COUGHS and SUCKS IN AIR, 
           the wind knocked out of him as we begin to PULL AWAY.

           Higher and higher we go. Alfredo turns his head to the side 
           and suddenly Leitzel is lying there too, her body as broken 
           as his. Side by side, they’re an almost perfect match to the 
           final shot of Murnau’s film.

           As we ascend into the rafters, the two commas of their bodies 
           become little more than white shapes on a dark floor.

                                 ALFREDO (V.O.)
                        They won’t grow old. Won’t start to 
                        hate each other. They’ll always be 
                        remembered just as they are.

                                                                CUT TO:
           EXT. INGLEWOOD PARK CEMETERY - PRESENT DAY

           The STATUE OF ALFREDO AND LEITZEL still stands on its 
           hillside, but bushes have grown up around the back of it. A 
           series of CLOSE SHOTS reveal places where plaques have been 
           pried off, the marble chipped and stained. 

           Over these flashes, we learn ...

           Alfredo broke his back in his fall. He never flew again.

           Two years later, Vera asked him for a divorce. He shot her to 
           death, then turned the gun on himself. 

           In his suicide note, he wrote, “I am going back to Leitzel, 
           the only woman who ever really loved me.”

           We hold on the forgotten monument for a moment after this 
           last piece of information fades. Alfredo squints at us over 
           Leitzel’s shoulder. Although he’s the one with wings, it 
           looks as if he’s trying to keep her from floating away.

           It’s a regular day here. There’s the drone of a lawn mower in 
           the distance, the hum as a car drives by. There was a time 
           when everyone knew the names Alfredo Codona and Lillian 
           Leitzel, the king and queen of the big top. Now no one does.

                                         THE END
